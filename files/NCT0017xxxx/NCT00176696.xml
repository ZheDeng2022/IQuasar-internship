  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reducing postoperative pain leads to increased patient comfort and facilitates speedy&#xD;
      recovery and discharge from the hospital following surgery. The focus of controlling&#xD;
      postoperative pain has gradually shifted from postoperative management to intraoperative&#xD;
      management. The investigators believe that this study is a unique opportunity to assess the&#xD;
      adequacy of intraoperative analgesia, allowing for immediate administration of the&#xD;
      appropriate opioid analgesics. The purpose of this research is to bring to light the&#xD;
      applicability of facial electromyography as an intraoperative solution to postoperative pain&#xD;
      management.&#xD;

      After consenting to enter the study, the subject will be asked a series of questions&#xD;
      regarding his/her medical history. He/she will be shown the test for determining&#xD;
      consciousness by squeezing the experimenter's hand when asked. It will be explained to&#xD;
      him/her that once unconscious, he/she will not be able to respond to the command of squeezing&#xD;
      the hand. The facial monitor will be shown to the patient, as well as its location of&#xD;
      placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative Period: The leads will be placed for the FACE monitor as well as for the BIS&#xD;
      monitoring device. The objective of the BIS monitor which is already in use in the University&#xD;
      Hospital Operating room suites is to determine consciousness. An identical and typical&#xD;
      anesthetic protocol will be utilized for all the patients in order to eliminate anesthetic&#xD;
      factors. The protocol is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After administration of propofol for induction, a forearm tourniquet device will be inflated&#xD;
      to a pressure greater than 200 mm Hg. A muscle relaxant will then be given once the&#xD;
      tourniquet is inflated while the arm with the tourniquet will not be paralyzed. This allows&#xD;
      for a check on the unconsciousness of the patient; that is, the patient will be told,&#xD;
      &quot;squeeze my hand&quot;. It is expected that no patient will respond by squeezing his or her hand&#xD;
      because they are unconscious and anesthetized. The maximum length of time the cuff will be&#xD;
      inflated is 20 minutes. Tourniquets applied to the entire leg or arm are normally inflated&#xD;
      for up to 120 minutes and are standard practice in orthopedic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One group of patients, determined randomly, will be administered 250 ug of fentanyl during&#xD;
      induction of anesthesia, while the second group, also determined randomly, will be&#xD;
      administered 50 ug of fentanyl. Both groups of patients will be administered an inhalational&#xD;
      anesthetic (isoflurane, desflurane, or sevoflurane) at the level 30% above that which insures&#xD;
      unconsciousness (called 1.1 MAC), but will not be given nitrous oxide during the 10 minutes&#xD;
      of our study period due to this gas' effect on Hagihira's &quot;loss of bicoherence&quot; phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study period will begin 5 minutes before surgical incision, and will end 5 minutes after&#xD;
      surgical incision. Our hypothesis is that central registration of pain exists despite the&#xD;
      presence of adequate unconsciousness in the patient, and FACE technology will complement the&#xD;
      use of the BIS (EEG) monitor to ensure effective administration of anesthesia for patients in&#xD;
      the future.&#xD;
