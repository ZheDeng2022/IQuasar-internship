  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate sensor longevity and skin integrity with two&#xD;
      different models of neonatal pulse oximetry sensors currently used for monitoring oxygen&#xD;
      levels in small infants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A common method for assessing the respiratory status of hospitalized children is the use of&#xD;
      pulse oximetry. This noninvasive device typically is placed on a finger, foot/palm of a&#xD;
      child. Red and infrared light is shined through the tissue under the sensor and the&#xD;
      information is sent back to a monitor for calculation of oxygen saturation. Use of this&#xD;
      noninvasive method provides continuous information on the oxygenation status of patients and&#xD;
      has greatly reduced the number of arterial blood samples required for patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the advantages of noninvasive pulse oximetry are significant, there are a number of&#xD;
      factors which can negatively impact the performance of the device. Patient movement and&#xD;
      sensor adherence to the skin have been some of the challenges to optimal device performance.&#xD;
      While much of the clinical research on pulse oximetry sensors over the years has evaluated&#xD;
      device accuracy and reliability, limited data is available on sensor longevity under&#xD;
      conditions typical of clinical use. A particular challenge with neonatal pulse oximetry&#xD;
      monitoring is insuring proper sensor adherence within the warm, moist environment of&#xD;
      incubators used in neonatal care. Furthermore, limited data are available on the impact of&#xD;
      sensor adherence on skin integrity in premature infants who are at high risk for skin&#xD;
      breakdown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives. The purpose of this study is to evaluate sensor longevity and impact on skin&#xD;
      integrity in neonatal patients with two different models of pulse oximetry sensors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method. A sample of 32 premature infants will be recruited to participate in this&#xD;
      study in which an adhesive sensor and a nonadhesive sensor are compared. Both sensors will be&#xD;
      simultaneously tested in each subject, for a period of 14 days, with one sensor on the right&#xD;
      foot and the other sensor on the left foot. Data will be collected on sensor longevity, skin&#xD;
      integrity at the sensor site, reason for sensor replacement and ease of use rating by the&#xD;
      clinician. Data will be summarized using descriptive statistics.&#xD;
