  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this series of study has a many-fold intention depicted as follows: to&#xD;
      describe and characterize schizophrenic patients' aggressive acts in hospital and community,&#xD;
      to identify and specify heterogeneity in their structure, and to look for and set up risk&#xD;
      factors for prevention. This study investigates four major issues: (1) Establishing an&#xD;
      objective behavior rating scale for measuring aggressive acts; (2) Understanding the&#xD;
      characteristics and incidence of aggressive acts by patients with schizophrenia; (3)&#xD;
      Exploration of the heterogeneous structure of aggressive acts by patients with schizophrenia;&#xD;
      and (4) Identifying the risk factors of aggressive acts of patients with schizophrenia.&#xD;

      Psychiatric patients' aggressive acts can occur frequently and are recognized as a&#xD;
      significant problem in psychiatric services. Understanding of aggressive acts in clinical&#xD;
      settings and community is still incomplete and the clinical care of aggressive acts remains&#xD;
      unsatisfactory. This study investigates four major issues: (1) Establishing an objective&#xD;
      behavior rating scale for measuring aggressive acts; (2) Understanding the characteristics&#xD;
      and incidence of aggressive acts by patients with schizophrenia; (3) Exploration of the&#xD;
      heterogeneous structure of aggressive acts by patients with schizophrenia; and (4)&#xD;
      Identifying the risk factors of aggressive acts of patients with schizophrenia. At first, the&#xD;
      content validity, construct validity, and internal consistency of the Chinese version of&#xD;
      Violence Scale were examined. Both of retrospective survey and prospective panel design were&#xD;
      used for data collection. Patients fulfilling the DSM-IV criteria of schizophrenia in&#xD;
      hospital and community, and their siblings and family caregivers, were recruited as different&#xD;
      phases of study subjects, after signing informed consent for understanding their past&#xD;
      history, prospective occurrence of aggressive acts, and the related risk factors. It is&#xD;
      therefore to establish objective measures and to develop insights into the heterogeneity and&#xD;
      related risk factors of aggressive acts, for improvement in the management and prevention of&#xD;
      aggressive acts.&#xD;
