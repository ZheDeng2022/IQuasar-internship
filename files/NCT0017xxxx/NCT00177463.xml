      Our hypothesis is that oral L-carnosine treatment (as compared with placebo) will enhance&#xD;
      cognitive abilities (specifically: measures of attention, executive function, working memory,&#xD;
      visuospatial ability and language) in persons with bipolar disorder. Secondarily, we&#xD;
      hypothesize there will be secondary improvements in positive, negative and mood symptoms with&#xD;
      L-carnosine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to test these hypotheses by conducting a randomized, placebo controlled, add on&#xD;
      treatment trial of L-carnosine (added to existing antipsychotic treatment) on 48 recruited&#xD;
      subjects with DSM IV TR bipolar disorder for a period of 12 weeks. Measures of cognition, and&#xD;
      psychopathology will be utilized for evaluating primary and secondary outcomes, along with&#xD;
      safety assessments.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is our hypothesis that L-carnosine treatment of persons with bipolar illness will improve&#xD;
      their cognitive outcomes, more specifically, measures of attention and executive function,&#xD;
      verbal and visuospatial memory and psychomotor performance, relative to placebo treatment. We&#xD;
      also hypothesize that L-carnosine treatment may secondarily improve any residual affective&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH PLAN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to test these hypotheses by conducting a randomized, placebo controlled, add on&#xD;
      treatment trial of L-carnosine (added to ongoing prescribed pharmacological treatment, for&#xD;
      example - lithium, anticonvulsants, antipsychotic agents and depressants) for a period of 12&#xD;
      weeks. Measures of cognition, and psychopathology will be utilized for evaluating primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes, along with safety assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 48 subjects with DSM IV TR bipolar I disorder will be recruited from Western&#xD;
      Psychiatric Institute and Clinic, Mayview State Hospital and Mon Yough Community Services,&#xD;
      Inc. using a 1:1 randomization, subjects who sign a informed consent document will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive L-carnosine or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that 12 of the 48 subjects may not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, leaving&#xD;
      36 consenting adults (18 to 65 years) with DSM IV-TR Bipolar Disorder who will be assessed&#xD;
      for euthymia (Young Mania Rating Scale Score ≤ 10, Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale&#xD;
      Score of ≤ 10) over a one month period (2 assessments) while receiving stable doses of their&#xD;
      current medications. They will also be assessed for cognitive dysfunction&#xD;
      (attention/executive function, immediate and declarative memory, and psychomotor performance)&#xD;
      using Cogtest - a proprietary neuropsychological library of 19 tests. These subjects will be&#xD;
      characterized for normal pre-morbid IQ, no ECT treatment in past 6 months, no alcohol or&#xD;
      substance dependence in past 6 months, mini-mental state score ≥ 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      L-carnosine (or placebo) will be administered using random assignment at a dose of 500&#xD;
      mg/day, increasing each week by 500 mg to a dose of 2000 mg/day (twice daily schedule) in 4&#xD;
      weeks; as an adjunct to existing psychotropic medicines. The dose of 2000 mg (or less, i.e. a&#xD;
      minimum of 500 mg if tolerability is an issue) will be continued for 8 additional weeks.&#xD;
      L-carnosine is not known to have interactions with psychotropic drugs but mood-stabilizer&#xD;
      levels will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard psychopathology rating scales will be administered to evaluate secondary aims such&#xD;
      as impact on residual symptoms of bipolar disorder. Safety will be assessed by tailing a&#xD;
      careful medical history and physical examination at screening and evaluating results of&#xD;
      laboratory measures. Any adverse effects will be assessed by asking questions at each visit,&#xD;
      and if required bring subjects in for assessments outside the scheduled visits, and by&#xD;
      telephone contact in between longer scheduled visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive dysfunction can seriously hinder improved functional outcomes in persons with&#xD;
      schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. If this short term intervention with L-carnosine shows&#xD;
      promise, more definitive studies using adequate powered sample sizes, and of longer duration&#xD;
      can be conducted. If improvements in cognitive problems are linked to improved functional&#xD;
      outcomes using such supplemental treatments, an important therapeutic milestone in bipolar&#xD;
      disorder will have been achieved.&#xD;
