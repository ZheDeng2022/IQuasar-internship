  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if taking medication once a month can help to decrease&#xD;
      the risk of vaginal infections. Additionally, researchers will study whether personal habits,&#xD;
      such as douching, bathing, and sexual practices can influence the risk of vaginal infections.&#xD;
      Vaginal infections may influence the risk of becoming infected with HIV-1 and other sexually&#xD;
      transmitted diseases (STDs). Study participants will include 400 female prostitutes ages 16&#xD;
      and older, living in Mombasa. Study procedures will include sexual behavior questions,&#xD;
      physical examinations including pelvic exams, testing of vaginal and cervical secretions for&#xD;
      STDs, urine collection and blood samples. Participants will receive 2 different types of&#xD;
      pills to treat vaginal infections (metronidazole or fluconazole) or placebo (contains no&#xD;
      medication). Participants will be involved in study related procedures for 1 year and will&#xD;
      return to the study clinic at one month intervals.&#xD;

      Prospective studies in Africa have demonstrated that vaginal infections are associated with a&#xD;
      significant increase in a woman's risk of infection with HIV-1. Further clinical and&#xD;
      epidemiological research is needed to evaluate strategies for prevention and treatment of&#xD;
      vaginal infections as a means of reducing HIV-1 acquisition. Developing a vaginal health&#xD;
      intervention to reduce the risk of HIV-1 infection is a particularly important goal in&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa, where female controlled strategies for reducing the risk of HIV-1&#xD;
      transmission may be an important means of decreasing the spread of the epidemic. This study&#xD;
      will evaluate the efficacy of a regimen for reducing the rate of vaginal infections. The&#xD;
      study is a double blind, randomized, controlled trial of monthly treatment with single-dose&#xD;
      metronidazole and fluconazole as a means of decreasing vaginal infections and promoting&#xD;
      normal vaginal flora in HIV-1 seronegative female sex workers (FSWs) in Mombasa, Kenya.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from an existing cohort of HIV-1 seronegative FSWs followed at&#xD;
      a municipal sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic in Mombassa, Kenya, since February&#xD;
      1993. Participants will be randomized to treatment with metronidazole 2 grams plus&#xD;
      fluconazole 150 mg once a month or placebo. All patients will be asked to return for&#xD;
      follow-up after 1 month. All women in the study will be treated as indicated for symptomatic&#xD;
      vaginal infections, other genital track infections and followed until they have completed 12&#xD;
      monthly follow-up visits.&#xD;
