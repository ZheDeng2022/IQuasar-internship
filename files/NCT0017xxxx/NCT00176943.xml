  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is thought that alopecia areata occurs as the result of an inappropriate response of the&#xD;
      body's own immune system to certain substances in or around the hair follicle. We will be&#xD;
      examining the efficacy of Aldara Cream 5% in treating extensive alopecia areata and observe&#xD;
      its affect on the hair follicle.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will examine how the application of Aldara Cream 5% daily for 6 months will affect the&#xD;
      hair follicle and the inflammation present in the skin of patients with alopecia areata. In&#xD;
      the study we will obtain additional scalp biopsies to examine how the drug affects the&#xD;
      quality and state of activity of the immune cells in the biopsy specimens. This type of&#xD;
      information will provide data about the behavior of these inflammatory cells in mediating the&#xD;
      hair loss associated with alopecia areata and how this behavior may be effected by Aldara&#xD;
      Cream 5% treatment. Such information may be valuable to the successful management of alopecia&#xD;
      areata.&#xD;
