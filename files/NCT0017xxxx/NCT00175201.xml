      In this randomised study a proactive care and rehabilitation intervention is compared to the&#xD;
      current care and rehabilitation in patients undergoing primary hip and knee replacement&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cost efficacy analysis in a societal perspective is made from effect data in the randomised&#xD;
      controlled study together with cost data gathered during the perioperative and postoperative&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the proactive care and rehabilitation intervention is cost effective the intervention is&#xD;
      going to be implemented in Ringkøbing County. This implementation proces is measured within a&#xD;
      monitoring project of all patients receiving hip or knee replacement surgery in Ringkøbing&#xD;
      County in the period 2003 to 2007.&#xD;

      BACKBROUND Hip and knee replacement are commonly performed surgical procedures, with more&#xD;
      than 800,000 hip operations carried out worldwide each year and with almost 550 hip and knee&#xD;
      replacements each year in Ringkoebing County. The main indicators for total hip or knee&#xD;
      replacement are intractable pain and/or limitation of function that cannot be managed by&#xD;
      conservative treatment alone. Leading causes of such pain include osteoarthritis, rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis, trauma, congenital abnormalities, dysplasia and osteochondritic disease. In the&#xD;
      absence of treatments that provide a cure for conditions such as osteoarthritis, management&#xD;
      is directed primarily towards relieving pain and re-ducing functional limitation. Joint&#xD;
      replacement is one surgical option when medical treatment has failed to provide adequate&#xD;
      symptom relief. Hip or knee replacement is a major surgical procedure that requires inpatient&#xD;
      physiotherapy and out-patient rehabilitation following a stay in hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the effect of optimizing the perioperative period, no systemically critical reviews&#xD;
      of randomized controlled trials (RCT) could be identified. Only one RCT of the effect of a&#xD;
      clinical pathway in hip and knee arthroplasty could be identified, the study by Dowsey et al&#xD;
      from 1999, which concludes that the intervention gives a better effect and reduces the&#xD;
      average length of stay with 1.5 day. No cost data were reported in this study. A systematic&#xD;
      review of clinical pathways including the study by Dowsey et al and ten non-RCT studies&#xD;
      concludes that clinical pathways for total knee and total hip arthroplasty reduces costs and&#xD;
      length of stay. A significant and great reduction in length of stay is reported from two&#xD;
      resent Danish non-RCT, the study by Rasmussen et al, in which an accelerated and proactive&#xD;
      care was given and the study by Husted et al, in which no extra resources were allocated but&#xD;
      the care was given in a special unit focusing on a length of stay of maximal 8 days. However&#xD;
      nothing is known about the cost or effects of this accelerated and proactive care out-side&#xD;
      the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary the overall evidence level on accelerated perioperative care and rehabilitation&#xD;
      for patients undergoing total hip or knee replacement is scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES To investigate the cost efficacy of a focused and specialized care unit in&#xD;
      patients undergoing total hip or knee replacement&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the cost effectiveness of a focused and specialized care unit in patients&#xD;
      under-going total hip or knee replacement&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: Randomized controlled intervention trial with cost efficacy and cost&#xD;
      effectiveness analysis. This study follows the recommendations by the CONSORT Statement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative study - RCT Study subjects All patients planned to undergo a primary total hip&#xD;
      or total knee replacement at the Hospital in Holstebro, are at first contact to the hospital&#xD;
      invited to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria's are patients operated secondary to&#xD;
      a hip fracture, patients undergoing remission and patients who are not able to cooperate&#xD;
      normally during the perioperative period. All patients interested in participating in the&#xD;
      study are given written and oral information. After consent the participating patients&#xD;
      completes a baseline questionnaire and are randomized to one of the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The estimated sample size of the groups at followup was calculated using actual&#xD;
      data from the hospital in Holstebro from the year 2004 together with data from a pilot study&#xD;
      in 2005. The risk of performing a Type 1 error was set at 5% using a two-sided analysis, and&#xD;
      the power of detecting a true difference was set at 80%. The anticipated reduction of length&#xD;
      of stay was set at 2 days in the intervention group, from a mean length of stay of 8 days&#xD;
      with a standard deviation (SD) of 4 days to a mean length of stay of 6 days and SD of 2 days.&#xD;
      When using a two-sample comparison of means this gives a need for at least 80 patients, 40&#xD;
      persons in each group at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Simple randomization ensuring equal distribution of operation area (hip:knee)&#xD;
      is performed by drawing an envelope from a box.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Control group Patients in the control group receive the current perioperative&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group Patients in the intervention group are given perioperative care and&#xD;
      rehabilitation according to the regime advocated by The Unit for Perioperative Nursing&#xD;
      Care,Rigshospitalet and in the study by Husted et al and. In this study the perioperative&#xD;
      care and rehabilitation is organized in a new proactive special care and rehabilitation unit&#xD;
      where the patients are gathered and the health care staff are focusing on a preselected&#xD;
      discharge day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attempts to reduce potential bias Masking of the patients is obtained by concealment of the&#xD;
      intervention in the other intervention groups, and by securing that the patients in the two&#xD;
      different groups are kept apart in different rooms. Masking of the treating therapists and&#xD;
      caretaking nurses are attempted by randomly allocating them to either usual or the new&#xD;
      preoperative care and rehabilitation unit. All personal allocated to the new preoperative&#xD;
      unit receive education and participates in a pre study period. After starting the&#xD;
      intervention period the treating therapists and caretaking nurses are not allowed to attend&#xD;
      the rooms of patients not allocated to their intervention arm. During the intervention period&#xD;
      physiotherapists and nurses are not allowed to discuss the intervention with persons in the&#xD;
      other intervention arm. Situation and circumstances where the protocol is not followed will&#xD;
      be registered using an intervention log book. The baseline and follow-up data collection is&#xD;
      performed with questionnaires and by measurements by a person not involved in the&#xD;
      intervention. No attempt is made to minimize the placebo or the Hawthorne effect, because the&#xD;
      different attention and time spent in the intervention is an important factor in the cost&#xD;
      effectiveness analysis. Potential contamination regarding the care given by nurses and&#xD;
      treating therapists is recorded via a structured observation of care and treatment before&#xD;
      baseline and in the latter part the study period. Compliance with exercise is collected&#xD;
      through the reporting of actual participation in planned training and questionnaires filled&#xD;
      inat day of discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Length of stay is recorded using register information and all other outcome&#xD;
      measures are collected from questionnaires at discharge, 3, 12 and 24 months after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures Primary outcome measures are length of stay, health related quality of life&#xD;
      measured with EQ-5D and SF-36/SF-6D. Secondary outcome measures are pain measured with a&#xD;
      6/point ordinal scale, disability measured with Harris Hip Score / The Danish Knee&#xD;
      Arthroplasty Register Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects are collected from register data on mortality and the incidence and length of&#xD;
      stay be-cause of deep vein thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis The data is analysed according to the recommendations by Sackett et al using&#xD;
      intention-to-treat analysis. Chi-square test is used for categorical data and parametric or&#xD;
      non-parametric statistics for two-sample comparison of means are used for continuous data.&#xD;
      The significance level is set at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost efficacy study of a perioperative intervention Efficacy is in this study defined&#xD;
      according to Last JM as: The extent to which a specific intervention, procedure, regimen, or&#xD;
      service produces a beneficial result under ideal conditions. Ideally, the determination of&#xD;
      efficacy is based on the results of a randomized controlled trial. The question to be&#xD;
      answered according to Drummond MF et al is: Can it work? To determine whether a proactive&#xD;
      perioperative intervention in patients undergoing total hip or knee replacement is cost&#xD;
      effective under ideal circumstances the study is performed alongside the RCT at one hospital.&#xD;
      Actual costs are sought via available data sources and patient administered diaries and&#xD;
      collected for a period of 24 months. The collected cost data are divided into direct costs&#xD;
      and benefits, indirect costs and benefits and intangible costs and benefits. Direct&#xD;
      healthcare costs include peripoperative operation and hospital stay costs at DRG taxes&#xD;
      together with changes in costs due to the perioperative intervention at actual prices. Direct&#xD;
      postoperative primary health care sector costs include costs from visiting general&#xD;
      practitioner, nurses and physiotherapist at preset prices. Direct non-healthcare costs&#xD;
      includes social sector costs such as professional home care and extra costs at nursery homes,&#xD;
      private home care costs, private rehabilitation costs, costs from visiting alternative&#xD;
      therapists, private help costs and transportation costs at preset prices. Indirect costs are&#xD;
      costs from production loss and are estimated according to the friction method with a maximum&#xD;
      of 3 months of absenteeism from paid work at preset salary. Intangible costs and benefits are&#xD;
      not collected beneath being implicit in the quality of life measures. The costs are held&#xD;
      against the primary outcome measures in each group. The cost efficacy of the intervention is&#xD;
      calculated as the differences in costs related to the differences in effects between the&#xD;
      intervention and control group. The cost efficacy analysis is performed according to the&#xD;
      recommendations by Drummond et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost effectiveness study of a perioperative intervention Effectiveness is in this study&#xD;
      defined according to Last JM as: The extent to which a specific intervention, procedure,&#xD;
      regimen, or service, when deployed in the field of routine circumstances, does what it is&#xD;
      intended to do for a specific population. The question to be answered according to Drum-mond&#xD;
      MF et al is: Does it work? To determine whether a proactive perioperative intervention in&#xD;
      patients undergoing total hip or knee replacement is cost effective in other units in the&#xD;
      county under normal circumstances the estimated cost difference from the efficacy study&#xD;
      together with the im-plementation time, problems and costs of the fully developed&#xD;
      intervention is held against the actual effect difference of all outcome measures for the&#xD;
      period following implementation compared the period prior to implementation. The cost&#xD;
      effectiveness analysis is performed according to the recommendations by Drummond et al.&#xD;
