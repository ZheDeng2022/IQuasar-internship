  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for children with brain tumors is surgical removal of the tumor&#xD;
      followed by radiation to the brain and chemotherapy (medicines) given to shrink any remaining&#xD;
      tumor or to prevent tumor from growing back. There are very few treatment options available&#xD;
      for children whose brain tumor grows back after receiving radiation treatment. There is a&#xD;
      greater risk of complications and side effects when the brain is repeatedly treated with&#xD;
      external radiation. The side effects of repeat radiation treatment are dependent on the&#xD;
      amount of the brain that is radiated. Radiation given with PRS during surgery is focused to&#xD;
      the specific area of the brain where the tumor is located. Therefore, the area of the brain&#xD;
      affected by the radiation is smaller. It is hoped that this targeted radiation will lessen&#xD;
      the side effects to the normal brain that is not affected by the tumor. It is also hoped that&#xD;
      a lower occurrence of side effects will increase the quality of life of children with brain&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal dose of targeted radiation is not known. Therefore, increasing doses will be&#xD;
      given to treat different patients, starting with the lowest possible dose. The amount of&#xD;
      radiation to be given will depend on whether or not your child received prior radiation&#xD;
      therapy and where the tumor is located. The groups of patients will first be divided into 2&#xD;
      groups: Group A, who are those who received radiation as part of their prior treatment, and&#xD;
      Group B, who are those who did not receive any radiation treatment. Each group will be then&#xD;
      divided again into 2 groups depending on the location of the tumor. In each group, if the&#xD;
      lowest dose is well-tolerated with only minimal side effects by 3 patients, then the next&#xD;
      higher dose will be given to the next 3 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this research are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the potential side effects of a single high dose of x-rays using the Photon&#xD;
           Radiosurgery System (PRS) given to a small area of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum dose of targeted radiation that can be safely given to brain&#xD;
           tumors with the fewest side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To see how well this treatment works for children with recurrent brain tumors and&#xD;
           newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central nervous system tumors account for approximately 20% of all childhood neoplasms. The&#xD;
      treatment modalities used in the primary management of brain tumors are surgery, radiation&#xD;
      therapy and chemotherapy. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in each of&#xD;
      these therapeutic approaches. In spite of these advancements local tumor recurrence continues&#xD;
      to be an important reason for treatment failure in these children. The local tumor recurrence&#xD;
      rate varies according to the primary tumor type, treatment technique and tumor-stage at&#xD;
      initial presentation. After conventional treatment, the local tumor recurrence rate ranges&#xD;
      from 10% - 40% in tumors like medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma and low-grade&#xD;
      gliomas . However in aggressive tumors like glioblastoma multiforme the tumor recurrence rate&#xD;
      in spite of the best modern treatments remains at 80-100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation therapy has always played a key role in the management of adult and pediatric brain&#xD;
      tumors. There has been considerable interest in treating brain tumors using stereotactic&#xD;
      radiosurgery (SRS) using the Gamma knife or Linear accelerator and stereotactic radiotherapy&#xD;
      (SRT). The goal of stereotactic treatment is to deliver a high dose of radiation with high&#xD;
      geometric precision to a discrete tumor located in the brain. This is accomplished by the use&#xD;
      of rigid immobilization skull frames and CT / MRI information for treatment planning and&#xD;
      tumor targeting. Presently there are several therapeutic options available for children with&#xD;
      recurrent brain tumors. Reirradiation has been employed in recurrent gliomas,&#xD;
      medulloblastomas and ependymomas with stereotactic radiosurgery stereotactic radiation and&#xD;
      brachytherapy . Following reirradiation, tumor control rates of 50-70% have been obtained.&#xD;
      The radiosurgery doses used in children with radiation recurrent tumors have ranged from&#xD;
      10-24 Gy. The reirradiation has been generally well tolerated with retreatment complications&#xD;
      like transient edema, cranial neuropathy or radiation necrosis observed in 10-15% of&#xD;
      children. The results with high dose chemotherapy and bone marrow / stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      in children with recurrent malignant gliomas, medulloblastoma and ependymoma have been&#xD;
      disappointing with significant morbidity and mortality. Intraoperative radiation has also&#xD;
      been utilized for the treatment of primary and recurrent brain tumors. In a report from&#xD;
      Japan, 17 patients including two children with radiation recurrent malignant brain tumors&#xD;
      were treated with intraoperative radiation to doses of 20 - 40 Gy. Intraoperative radiation&#xD;
      was delivered using special applicators and electron beams. The radiation was delivered after&#xD;
      tumor resection and doses of 23 - 40 Gy were delivered to depths of 0.5-1.5 cm. The median&#xD;
      survival for patients with malignant gliomas and other tumors (ependymoma, oligodendroglioma)&#xD;
      was 12 months and 51 months respectively. The two children with ependymoma were cured and are&#xD;
      currently alive at 134 and 88 months after intraoperative radiation. Three patients developed&#xD;
      symptomatic brain necrosis, two of them had relief of symptoms with surgery and one patient&#xD;
      died. Three patients also developed postoperative meningitis. In another report from&#xD;
      University of Nebraska Medical Center, 49 patients with glioblastoma multiforme were treated&#xD;
      with interstitial Cobalt 60 high dose-rate irradiation to a dose of 20 Gy to the tumor with a&#xD;
      1-cm margin. The patients with no prior radiation therapy (Group I) received an additional 40&#xD;
      Gy of external irradiation. Nineteen of these patients (Group II) had been previously&#xD;
      irradiated, and they received only interstitial irradiation. The Cobalt 60 probe was guided&#xD;
      into the tumor using CT scans and a stereotactic frame. This treatment was well tolerated,&#xD;
      one patient had a dural leak and another had a subdural hematoma. There were no cases of&#xD;
      meningitis or radiation necrosis. The median survival for Group I and Group II patients were&#xD;
      7 months and 6 months respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The photon radiosurgery system (PRS) is an intraoperative irradiation device that is capable&#xD;
      of delivering high radiation doses to brain tumors. This system has recently been approved&#xD;
      for clinical use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photon Radiosurgery System (PRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Photon Radiosurgery System (PRS) incorporates a miniature, 40 KeV x-ray source capable of&#xD;
      delivering a prescribed radiation dose directly to a target volume. The PRS consists in part&#xD;
      of an electron beam-activated x-ray source with a sealed vacuum tube that is 10 cm long and&#xD;
      3.2 mm in outer diameter that is designed for insertion into the body. This vacuum tube&#xD;
      incorporates an electron beam target on the inside surface of its tip. When an accelerated&#xD;
      electron beam is generated and sent down the tube to strike the target, Bremsstrahlung and&#xD;
      line x-rays are emitted from the tip of the tube in a nearly isotropic pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of dose-rate in a water phantom have determined that the x-ray beam emanates&#xD;
      essentially, from a point source, with a nominal dose rate of 150 cGy/min at 10 mm, for a&#xD;
      beam current of 40 uA and a voltage of 40 kV. The absolute dose is estimated to be + 10%. The&#xD;
      dose distribution in water falls off approximately as a function of the third power of the&#xD;
      distance from the power source. The generator is light weighed, only 3.45 lbs. The radiation&#xD;
      dose is adjusted by accelerating voltage (ranging from 30 to 50kV), beam current (ranging&#xD;
      from 5 to 40 uA) and treatment time (0-60 minutes) through the control console that weighs&#xD;
      only 40lbs. The lightweight of PRS system readily allows us to carry the device to the&#xD;
      laboratory and the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For use of the PRS as an adjuvant treatment, treatment applicators made from a rigid&#xD;
      biocompatible plastic (ULTEM 1000) with known x-ray transmission characteristics are used.&#xD;
      The inside is hollowed out to allow introduction of the PRS x-ray probe to the epicenter of&#xD;
      the applicator so that the dose at its outer surface is uniform. The end of the applicators&#xD;
      is spherical with its diameter ranging from 1.5 cm to 4 cm. Treatment applicators will be&#xD;
      sterilized prior to each use. The applicator is inserted into the tumor-resected cavity to&#xD;
      deliver the prescribed dose of radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operation and dose characteristics of the PRS combine advantages of external beam&#xD;
      radiosurgery with those of brachytherapy (implantation of radiation seeds). As with&#xD;
      brachytherapy, the PRS can be located very precisely within the target volume, and can&#xD;
      improve the delivery of conformal therapy by irradiating the target volume precisely, with&#xD;
      little or no scatter of radiation. Due to its very rapid dose fall-off, the PRS significantly&#xD;
      reduces the radiation dose delivered to healthy tissues as compared with external beam&#xD;
      radiation and radiosurgery. Like radiosurgery, however, the PRS has a very high dose rate and&#xD;
      can deliver high radiation doses to the target volume. Another distinct advantage of the PRS&#xD;
      system is the ability to significantly decrease the radiation dose to the normal structures&#xD;
      in the brain adjacent to the tumor. All of the radiation treatment techniques presently&#xD;
      available deliver 10-50% of prescribed dose to the normal brain. Intraoperative irradiation&#xD;
      using PRS because of its direct application into the tumor or tumor bed limits the dose to&#xD;
      the normal tissue. This approach could result in a significant decrease in radiation induced&#xD;
      complications in vital structures such as the optic pathway, brain stem and cerebral blood&#xD;
      vessels. Another advantage of PRS is that unlike other types of therapy, the PRS does not&#xD;
      require the use of a radiation-shielded room. To summarize, the advantages of the&#xD;
      interstitial/surface application of radiation using the PRS are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Direct access to the surgical bed of the tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Accurate delivery of a high single dose of radiation to the tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Superior protection of adjacent brain, cranial nerves or other critical structures by&#xD;
           the use of intraoperative shielding or intraoperative displacement of these organs&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Superior radiobiological effectiveness (RBE) of low energy X-rays&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Tumor dose inhomogeneity similar to brachytherapy and Gamma knife radiosurgery, with the&#xD;
           center of the tumor receiving a higher dose than the peripheral region that is adjacent&#xD;
           to normal structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of studies carried out with the PRS in brain tumors have demonstrated it to be&#xD;
      capable of delivering a lethal dose of radiation, in a single application to intracranial&#xD;
      tumors with minimal side effects. It has been used to treat primary and metastatic brain&#xD;
      tumors. In a report from Massachusetts General Hospital, 14 adults with primary and&#xD;
      metastatic brain tumors &lt; 3.5 cm in greatest diameter were treated with a single fraction of&#xD;
      irradiation using PRS. The treated tumor diameter ranged from 10mm - 35 mm (mean 21mm), and&#xD;
      the tumor edge prescribed dose ranged from 10-20 Gy (average 12.5 Gy). The average treatment&#xD;
      time was 23 minutes (range, 7-45 minutes). Local control was obtained in 10 of the 13&#xD;
      patients with a follow-up of 1.5 - 36 months (mean 12 months). All patients tolerated the&#xD;
      procedure well, and most patients were discharged home the day after treatment. No new&#xD;
      neurological deficits were noted after irradiation. This study aims at determining the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose of irradiation using PRS in recurrent pediatric brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiation dose delivered by the PRS and radiosurgery are similar with regard to dose-rate&#xD;
      and total dose. The RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) has performed a dose escalation&#xD;
      study to assess the maximum tolerated dose of radiosurgery in adults with previously&#xD;
      irradiated brain tumors and brain metastases. Based on acute and late toxicity, the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated radiosurgery doses were 24 Gy, 18 Gy and 15 Gy for tumors &lt; 20 mm, 21-30 mm and&#xD;
      31-40 mm respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we had intended to perform a similar dose escalation study with doses ranging&#xD;
      from 10-19 Gy, 10-16 Gy and 10 - 14 Gy for tumors &lt; 20 mm, 21-25 mm and 26-40 mm&#xD;
      respectively. These doses are lower than the established maximum tolerated doses for brain&#xD;
      reirradiation in adults with radiosurgery. These doses are also lower than the 20-40 Gy doses&#xD;
      utilized for intraoperative irradiation of adult brain tumors with electrons and Cobalt 60&#xD;
      sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis of patients entered on the study was performed. Based on the occurrence&#xD;
      of treatment -related complications in ONE patient who required 2 applicators and in another&#xD;
      patient in whom the dose was prescribed to 5 mm depth, the protocol has been modified as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. No patient will have PRS treatment using more than one applicator&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The depth of prescribed dose should not exceed 2 mm&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients who have received prior RT and those who have not received prior RT would be&#xD;
           classified into Group A and Group B respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The dose levels will for these two groups would be as shown in the table in Section 8.0.&#xD;
           The dose escalation for non-brainstem (10-19 Gy) remains the same, but dose escalation&#xD;
           will no longer be stratified by tumor size. The dose levels for sites adjacent to the&#xD;
           brainstem and/or cranial nerves (10-14 Gy) also remain the same. A minimum of 3 patients&#xD;
           will have to be accrued in each dose level and only if there are no complications&#xD;
           observed, accrual at the next dose level would begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will be based on the incidence of acute CNS toxicity defined by RTOG&#xD;
      criteria. Unacceptable toxicity will be considered to be irreversible grade 3 (severe), any&#xD;
      grade 4 (life threatening) or grade 5 (fatal) RTOG CNS toxicity occurring within 3 months of&#xD;
      reirradiation. If no patient developed an unacceptable CNS toxicity as defined below, the&#xD;
      dose for that tumor size was then escalated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brain stem is very important part of the brain that controls most bodily functions like&#xD;
      blood pressure, respiration etc. In this study, we have adopted a gentler dose escalation&#xD;
      scheme for tumors in and around the brain stem. The three doses to be studied for tumors in&#xD;
      this location are10 Gy, 12 Gy and 14 Gy. These doses will be delivered independent of tumor&#xD;
      size.&#xD;
