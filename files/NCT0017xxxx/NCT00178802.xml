  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thermal therapy (hyperthermia of heat) can increase the effect of chemotherapy treatments. By&#xD;
      itself, thermal therapy can also kill cancer cells. By using thermal therapy to treat the&#xD;
      whole body, the investigators can treat cancer cells wherever they are throughout the entire&#xD;
      body. In this study, the investigators are testing the combination of thermal therapy&#xD;
      combined with chemotherapy to see:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. if it improves the effect of the chemotherapy drugs,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. if it helps the body fight the cancer cells, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. if this treatment is safe for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study does not offer heat treatment alone. Any patient with advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      breast, or endometrial cancer resistant to standard treatment may be treated with the phase&#xD;
      II protocol therapy; however, the patient will need to undergo some medical tests to make&#xD;
      sure this treatment would be safe for them.&#xD;

      Once a patient has been accepted for this study, the patient will need to have a Central&#xD;
      Venous line (CV line or port) if they do not already have one. (this may be placed by the&#xD;
      patient's own doctor, or it can be done here).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment cycle begins with a continuous 24-hour intravenous infusion of 5-Fluorouracil&#xD;
      (5-FU) over a period of 5 days. This regimen will end 24 hours prior to the scheduled heat&#xD;
      treatment. In addition, at the beginning of the treatment, the patient will begin daily,&#xD;
      low-dose Interferon-alpha injections for the duration of their participation in this study.&#xD;
      The drug, Interferon-alpha, is given to stimulate the immune system and to decrease tumor&#xD;
      microvasculature. Interferon-alpha also interrupts the division of cancer cells and slows&#xD;
      tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fever-range whole-body heat treatment is performed while the patient is under light&#xD;
      conscious sedation. With this type of sedation, the patient is awake during the treatment but&#xD;
      not uncomfortable. This type of sedation method is used to reduce the discomfort of the&#xD;
      6-hour heat treatment procedure yet allows the patient to respond to verbal commands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's body temperature is elevated to 40oC (104oF) over a period of 60-90 minutes.&#xD;
      When the body reaches the target 40 oC, we will maintain that body temperature for six hours.&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the six hours of heat treatment, the patient will be cooled to their&#xD;
      normal body temperature, over 30-45 minutes. The Doxil chemotherapy will then be infused i.v.&#xD;
      over a period of 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire procedure lasts approximately 8-10 hours. After the treatment is completed, we&#xD;
      observe the patient for 2 to 12 hours to make sure the treatment has been well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will continue the daily low-dose Interferon-alpha injections. Additionally, the&#xD;
      patient will be given daily Leukine (sargramostim) cytokine injections usually beginning 3-5&#xD;
      days after receiving chemotherapy to help support the immune system by helping the body&#xD;
      create more white blood cells, which are important in helping your body fight infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment, the patient will need a complete blood count with platelet and differential&#xD;
      count each week. These lab studies can be done at the patient's own doctor's office as long&#xD;
      as the results are faxed to us. They can also be done in our clinic. The treatment cycle will&#xD;
      be repeated every 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We always attempt to perform at least two thermochemotherapy cycles. After the second&#xD;
      treatment, CT and/or MRI scans are repeated to see if the tumor has changed. These scans,&#xD;
      along with a physical examination and the lab studies, are used to determine if additional&#xD;
      heat treatments will be performed. Additional treatments continue based on how well a patient&#xD;
      responds to the treatment. There is no limit to the number of heat treatments a patient may&#xD;
      have.&#xD;
