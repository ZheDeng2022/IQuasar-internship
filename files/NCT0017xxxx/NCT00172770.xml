  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness, which has a prodromal phase of 1-2 years prior to&#xD;
      the onset of the illness. During the prodromal phase, patients might show maladaptation&#xD;
      and/or poor social functioning. However, these early symptom of schizophrenia might be&#xD;
      overlooked by patients and their families. At that period, patients might strive to improve&#xD;
      their social interactions and social functioning. However, the efforts might further create&#xD;
      their stress level on everyday life, which can actually accelerate the illness onset of&#xD;
      schizophrenia. In other words, the efforts would worsen the pathophysiologic changes in the&#xD;
      brain, which can result in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous researches found that the critical period for treatment of schizophrenia is the&#xD;
      early phase of illness onset, especially the first two or three years. Delay treatment would&#xD;
      worsen the illness. To this extent, early treatment would bring to a better prognosis as well&#xD;
      as minimize the costs of individuals, families and society. In other words, early&#xD;
      interventions not only can prevent relapse, it also can benefit patients' psychosocial&#xD;
      adjustments. However, researches found that the average duration of untreated psychosis is&#xD;
      25.2 months in Taiwan, which indicates the phenomena of delay treatment and this trend might&#xD;
      result in missing the critical treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a two years study aiming to establish an early intervention program for patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia. In the first year, it aims to understand the phenomena of psychiatric care&#xD;
      services utilization for patients with schizophrenia, special emphasis will be on the delay&#xD;
      treatment and pluralistic health seeking process. In the second year, it aims to establish an&#xD;
      early intervention program. The results of this research would contribute to in-service&#xD;
      trainings, service providing, and policy making of psychiatric services.&#xD;
