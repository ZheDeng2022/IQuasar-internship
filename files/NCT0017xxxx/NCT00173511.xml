      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, a common disorder encountered at emergency room, may&#xD;
      cause hypotension and tachycardia that may in turn result in myocardial ischemia in patients&#xD;
      with coronary artery disease (CAD). An emergent endoscopy with hemostasis is the mainstay of&#xD;
      management. However, endoscopy itself may result in myocardial ischemia. Whether myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia and arrhythmia occurs more frequently during emergent endoscopy in patients with CAD&#xD;
      remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether the risk of myocardial ischemia and arrhythmia is increased during&#xD;
      emergent endoscopy in patients with CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients with documented CAD undergoing emergent endoscopy due to UGI bleeding are&#xD;
      included. Adult patients without CAD undergoing emergent endoscopy due to UGI bleeding were&#xD;
      included as the control group. The expected case numbers were 50 patients in each group.&#xD;
      Patients with terminal illness, pregnancy, active lung disease requiring ventilator support&#xD;
      are excluded. Before endoscopy, symptoms of myocardial ischemia, blood pressure, heart rate,&#xD;
      O2 saturation, hemogram, baseline 12-lead EKG, and cardiac enzyme are obtained. All patients&#xD;
      are monitored with Holter EKG since 10 minutes before endoscopy to 2 hours after the&#xD;
      procedure. Blood pressure, heart rate, and O2 saturation are closely monitored during the&#xD;
      procedure. Endoscopy is performed by experienced endoscopist and endoscopic hemostasis is&#xD;
      done according to the types of lesions. The duration of endoscopy, types of endoscopic&#xD;
      hemostasis, and blood pressure are recorded. After endoscopy, symptoms of myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia, blood pressure, heart rate, O2 saturation, hemogram, baseline 12-lead EKG, and&#xD;
      cardiac enzyme are checked again.&#xD;

      Expected Result and Implication If myocardial ischemia is not increased in CAD patients&#xD;
      undergoing emergent endoscopy, then this technique can be used safely in this group of&#xD;
      patients. If myocardial ischemia occurs more frequently in CAD patients undergoing emergent&#xD;
      endoscopy, we can try to analyze factors associated with increased risk, such as duration of&#xD;
      endoscopy, severity of anemia, or drugs used for endoscopic hemostasis. Then we can try to&#xD;
      avoid these predisposing factors and increase the safety of emergent endoscopy.&#xD;
