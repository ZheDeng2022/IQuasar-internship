      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shoulder-related dysfunction (SD) is a common health problem in various patient populations.&#xD;
      SD can affect an individual's ability to function independently, consequently decreasing&#xD;
      quality of life. A battery of simple measurable function-related tests for patients with SD&#xD;
      is important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test the reliability, validity, and potential clinical use of&#xD;
      a battery of function-related tests in patients with SD. Additionally, the biomechanical&#xD;
      characteristics of the battery of function-related tests will be analyzed in terms of&#xD;
      three-dimensional shoulder complex movements and associated muscular activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated measurements and descriptive study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The affected arms of 60 symptomatic patients with SD will be assessed by two clinicians as&#xD;
      well as by one clinician twice to calculate intertester and intrarater reliabilities.&#xD;
      Assessment will include self-report measures and the battery of function-related tests&#xD;
      (hand-in-neck, hand-to-scapula, hand-to-opposite-scapula, and modified Kibler's lateral&#xD;
      scapular slide test). Pearson correlation or Spearman's rho correlation coefficients will be&#xD;
      calculated and the correlation matrices will be examined for evidence of convergent and&#xD;
      discriminative validity among pain, disability, and function-related measures in patients&#xD;
      with SD. Principle axis factor analysis will be performed on the kinematic measurements and&#xD;
      muscular electromyography (EMG) activities to characterize the factor loading of each task.&#xD;

      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with SDs will be recruited from the clinics in the department of Orthopedics and&#xD;
      Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH). There are&#xD;
      about three patients with SD among 40 outpatient visits from the clinics each week. It is&#xD;
      estimated that at least two subjects with SD per week will participate in this study. Thus,&#xD;
      it will take six months to recruit 60 subjects with SD. All patients will be recruited and&#xD;
      tested within a 6-month period. They will receive a written and verbal explanation of the&#xD;
      purposes and procedures of the study. If they agree to participate they will be required to&#xD;
      sign approved informed consent forms approved by the Human Subjects Committee of NTUH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria are adults at least 18 years old. Patients with SD will have (1) a&#xD;
      limited ROM of a shoulder joint (ROM losses of 25% or greater compared with the noninvolved&#xD;
      shoulder in at least two of the following shoulder motions: glenohumeral flexion, abduction,&#xD;
      or medial/lateral rotation), and (2) pain and stiffness in the shoulder region for at least&#xD;
      three months, and (3) the consent of the patient's physician to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Patients with SD will be excluded after an examination by a physical therapist if they have&#xD;
      (1) reproduction of cervical symptoms during a cervical screening examination (active and&#xD;
      resisted range of motion, active and resisted range of motion with overpressure, quadrant&#xD;
      test), (2) numbness or tingling in the upper extremity, (3) a history of onset of symptoms&#xD;
      due to traumatic injury, glenohumeral or AC joint dislocation; or (4) surgery on the&#xD;
      shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Function-related tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hand-in-neck:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hand-in-neck test will be scored on a 5-point scale, where zero represents normal&#xD;
      function and four indicates the most decreased function (Table 1) [Mannerkorpi et al., 1999].&#xD;
      For this test, patients will stand and place their hands over the posterior aspect of the&#xD;
      neck. The test performance of the patients with fibromyalgia is significantly decreased in&#xD;
      comparison with healthy subjects [Mannerkorpi et al., 1999]. It is not known, however, to&#xD;
      what extent performance is compromised in patients with SD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hand-to-scapula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hand-to-scapula test will be scored on a 5-point scale, where zero represents normal&#xD;
      function and 4 indicates the most decreased function (Table 1) [Mannerkorpi et al., 1999].&#xD;
      This is a common task that is performed with difficulty by patients with limited range of&#xD;
      motion of the shoulder joint. The test performance of the patients with fibromyalgia is also&#xD;
      significantly decreased in comparison with healthy subjects [Mannerkorpi et al., 1999].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hand-to-opposite-scapula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hand-to-opposite-scapula test will be scored on a 4-point scale, where zero represents&#xD;
      normal function and three indicates the most decreased function (Table 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modified Kibler's lateral scapular slide test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kibler et al. [1998 and 2002] characterized the scapula dysfunction by side-to-side&#xD;
      comparisons of the scapular during arm elevation as well as at 3 test positions (Table 1).&#xD;
      Measurements of scapula symmetry are taken bilaterally from the inferior angle of both&#xD;
      scapulas. In this study, we will use the modified Kibler's lateral scapular slide test&#xD;
      (LSST). The observed difference will be assessed on a three-point scale (Table. 1). The&#xD;
      reliability and validity of the test will be assessed in patients with SD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures of pain will be included to assess validity. The patient will be asked to rate pain&#xD;
      with movement according to a scale in which no pain will be assigned 0 points and the worst&#xD;
      possible pain will be assigned 10 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-report measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-report measures are valuable, since they present patients' perceptions of the&#xD;
      multifaceted effects of shoulder disorders. The literature shows that various self-report&#xD;
      scales for the assessment of functional limitation and disability of the shoulder are&#xD;
      available [Michener and Leggin, 2001]. Each scale is different because the developers of each&#xD;
      questionnaire placed a particular emphasis on the selection of items from the vast range of&#xD;
      symptoms in patients with shoulder disorders. The selection of the disabilities of the arm,&#xD;
      shoulder and hand (DASH) and Flexilevel Scale of Shoulder Function (FLEX-SF) to assess&#xD;
      shoulder function and disability in our study is based on its entire continuum assessment of&#xD;
      shoulder functions and appropriate psychometric properties of reliability, validity, and&#xD;
      responsiveness to clinical change [Beaton et al., 2001; Cook et al., 2003].&#xD;
&#xD;
      DASH:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DASH outcome measure is a 30-item, self-report questionnaire designed to measure physical&#xD;
      function and symptoms in subjects with any musculoskeletal disorder of the upper extremity.&#xD;
      Beaton et al. [2001] evaluated the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the DASH in&#xD;
      two hundred patients with shoulder problems and demonstrated good validity, test-retest&#xD;
      reliability, and responsiveness of the DASH. The DASH is scaled on a 0-100 score. A higher&#xD;
      score indicates greater disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DASH disability/symptom score = [(sum of n responses) /n - 1] x 25 n is equal to the number&#xD;
      of completed responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FLEX-SF:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this scale, respondents answer a single question that grossly classifies their level of&#xD;
      function as low, medium, or high. They then respond to only the items that target their level&#xD;
      of function. Scores are recorded from 1, with the most limited function, to 50 without any&#xD;
      limited function in the subject. This scale has been tested on 400 subjects with SDs and has&#xD;
      showed high reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [3,1] = 0.90) and good validity&#xD;
      (Guyatt responsiveness index = 1.12) [Cook et al., 2003].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life will be assessed on a 10-cm visual analog scale on which 0 cm indicates an&#xD;
      excellent quality of life and 10 cm indicates the worst imaginable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrumentation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FASTRAK motion analysis system (Polhemus Inc., Colchester, VT, USA) and a surface&#xD;
      electromyography (sEMG) device will be used to detect shoulder complex movements and&#xD;
      associated muscle activities. The sEMG assemblies include differential silver-silver chloride&#xD;
      surface electrodes (an inter-electrode distance of 30 mm, 4 mm diameter), a pre-amplifier&#xD;
      headbox (with a gain of 150), and a Bagnoli-8 amplifier (DelSys Inc., PO Box 15734, Boston,&#xD;
      MA, USA), which has a gain of 1000, a high input impedance (10 M Ohm at 60 Hz), a common mode&#xD;
      rejection ratio of 92 dB at 60 Hz, and a bandwidth (-3 dB) of 20 to 500 Hz. The sEMG data&#xD;
      will be collected at 2500 Hz/channel using a 16-bit A/D board. Full bandwidth sEMG data will&#xD;
      be reduced using a root mean square (RMS) algorithm to produce sEMG envelopes with an&#xD;
      effective sampling rate of 20 s/s. These envelope data will be the basis for subsequent&#xD;
      processing. Our previous investigation demonstrated that this system has good reliability to&#xD;
      characterize functional tasks [Lin et al., 2004].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reliability, validity, and potential clinical use of a battery of function-related tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic information, physical examination, completion of pain scale report, and&#xD;
      self-report measures (DASH and FLEX-SF) will be assessed for all patients. Two physical&#xD;
      therapists with a minimum of 5 years' clinical experience will independently measure patients&#xD;
      with function-related tests in each test session. One of the two testers will measure&#xD;
      patients with function-related tests twice with 3 to 5 days' separation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomechanical characteristics of the battery of function-related tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surface electrodes will be placed over the upper trapezius muscle (two thirds of the distance&#xD;
      from the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra to the acromion process), the lower&#xD;
      trapezius muscle (one fourth of the distance from the thoracic spine to the inferior angle of&#xD;
      the scapula when the arm is fully flexed in the sagittal plane), and the lower serratus&#xD;
      anterior muscle (over the muscle fibers anterior to the latissimus dorsi muscle when the arm&#xD;
      is flexed 90° in the sagittal plane) [Perotto, 1994]. Verification of signal quality will be&#xD;
      investigated for each muscle by having the subject perform a resisted contraction in manual&#xD;
      muscle test positions specific to each muscle of interest. The FASTRAK sensors will next be&#xD;
      attached with adhesive tape to the sternum and to the skin overlying the flat superior bony&#xD;
      surface of the scapular acromial process. A third sensor will be attached to the distal&#xD;
      humerus between lateral and medial epicondyles with adhesive tape. These surface sensor&#xD;
      placements are believed to have fewer skin movement artifacts. A fourth sensor will be&#xD;
      attached to an object according to the tested functional tasks. In addition, another sensor&#xD;
      attached to a stylus will be used to manually digitize palpated anatomical coordinates.&#xD;
      Kinematic and EMG data will then be collected for 5 seconds in this resting seated posture.&#xD;
      Subjects will then be asked to perform the battery of function-related tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The order of function-related tasks will be randomized. Once the subjects are familiar with&#xD;
      the functional tasks, synchronized kinematic and EMG data from 3 trials for each testing task&#xD;
      will be collected. Subjects will be given approximately 2 to 3 minutes of rest between&#xD;
      practice and test conditions. All subjects will be queried regarding the need for additional&#xD;
      rest to prevent fatigue. Sensors will not be removed and replaced between trials. Data&#xD;
      reduction will follow the method we presented in a previous published study [Lin et al.,&#xD;
      2004].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reliability:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics including means and standard deviations will be calculated for each&#xD;
      trial and for each tester. For the intratester reliability of each measure by the same&#xD;
      tester, data from the two test days, which will be 3 to 5 days apart, will be used to&#xD;
      calculate kappa statistics. For the intertester reliability of each measure by the two&#xD;
      testers, data within the test session, which will be at most 20 minutes, will be used to&#xD;
      calculate kappa statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the measures used in the calculation of Pearson correlation or Spearman's rho correlation&#xD;
      coefficients will be individual trial measures. For the intratester or intertester&#xD;
      reliability of measures (hand-to-scapula, hand-to-opposite-scapula, and modified Kibler's&#xD;
      LSST positions 1 and 2), and the measured outcome on trial 1, tester 1 will be used. The&#xD;
      average of the test-retest result will be used in the correlation analysis. Pearson&#xD;
      correlation or Spearman's rho correlation coefficients will be calculated, and the&#xD;
      correlation matrices will be examined for evidence of convergent and discriminative validity&#xD;
      among pain, disability, and function-related measures in patients with SD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomechanical characteristics of the battery of function-related tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principle axis factor analysis will be performed on the kinematic measurements and muscular&#xD;
      EMG activities to characterize the factor loading of each task. The kinematic measurements&#xD;
      (dependent variables) will include reliable angular variable from peak scapular upward&#xD;
      rotation, peak scapular tipping, peak scapular protraction, peak humeral elevation, peak&#xD;
      scapular elevation, plane of humeral elevation, and humeral rotation during the testing&#xD;
      tasks. The muscle EMG (dependent variables) will include reliable mean RMS percentages from&#xD;
      the upper trapezius, lower trapezius, and serratus anterior during the tasks.&#xD;
