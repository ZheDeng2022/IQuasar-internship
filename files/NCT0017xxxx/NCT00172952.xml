      High myopia (pathological myopia) is caused by excessive axial elongation that primarily&#xD;
      involves the ora-equatorial area and the posterior pole. Pathological myopia often&#xD;
      accompanied by glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration, and retinal detachment, leading to&#xD;
      blindness when the damage to the retina is extremely severe. Population and family studies in&#xD;
      Chinese have provided evidence for a geneticcomponent to pathologic myopia. Children of&#xD;
      myopic parents are more likely to have myopia than are children of nonmyopic parents.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is possible to search a potential candidate gene for myopia through the genomic&#xD;
      study of pathological myopia. The retina receives the signal from the retina-RPE complexes&#xD;
      and affects the growth of scleral coats. The changes of scleral components, collagen fibrils&#xD;
      and proteoglycans, are noted in experimental and human myopia and induce the pathology of&#xD;
      high myopia. It is interesting to know that individual difference of SNP in the components of&#xD;
      scleral coat affects the response to the signal from retina-RPE complexes. The most important&#xD;
      effectors in scleral coats are collagens, proteoglycans, MMPs and TIMPs. Therefore, the&#xD;
      difference of SNPs in different genes might contribute the formation of scleral thinning&#xD;
      during myopia development. In this project, we will focus on this subject by using GenomeLab&#xD;
      SNPstream Genotyping System which is powerful and helpful for identify some specific SNPs in&#xD;
      the regard.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are unrelated Chinese subjects with high myopia ≦-6.00D. The diagnosis of myopia&#xD;
             is determined by the refractive error. Anisometropic individuals, with a refractive&#xD;
             error of ≦-6.00 D for one eye and ≦-6.00 D for the other eye, with at least a 2-D&#xD;
             difference between the two eyes, are considered unaffected&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals are excluded if there is known ocular disease or insult that could&#xD;
             predispose to myopia, such as retinopathy of prematurity or early-age media&#xD;
             opacification, or if they had a known genetic disease associated with myopia, such as&#xD;
             Stickler or Marfan syndrome.&#xD;
