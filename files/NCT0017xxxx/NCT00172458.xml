  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vertebral artery stenosis (VAS) decreases posterior brain perfusion, causing vertebrobasilar&#xD;
      insufficiency (VBI). It is also an important embolic source to the posterior brain. The most&#xD;
      frequently involved location is the proximal part of the vessel, including the ostium.&#xD;
      Various surgical procedures have been described for the treatment of proximal VAS with&#xD;
      symptoms refractory to medical therapy, but all are technically difficult with high operative&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endovascular intervention has been described as an alternative to surgery. Balloon&#xD;
      angioplasty is limited by elastic recoil and dissection. The restenosis rates reported in the&#xD;
      literature varied, as high as 75 %. Stenting offers salvage following unsuccessful balloon&#xD;
      angioplasty, and primary stenting have been shown to be safe and effective with lower&#xD;
      restenosis rate. Coronary equipments are ideal for ostial VAS, considering the size of the&#xD;
      artery and location of the lesion. Recently, Albuquerque et al. reports a relative high&#xD;
      restenosis rate in a longer follow-up duration. Restenosis seems to become an important issue&#xD;
      regarding the patients' quality of life. However, there is no clinical parameter to predict&#xD;
      restenosis of VAS. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical results of our&#xD;
      series of symptomatic ostial VAS treated exclusively with tubular balloon expandable coronary&#xD;
      stents. We sought to identify predictors of restenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a clinical observation study. Only chart review and angiographic review will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
