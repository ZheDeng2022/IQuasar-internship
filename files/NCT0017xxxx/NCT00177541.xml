  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the mechanisms mediating the therapeutic efficacy of pelvic floor muscle&#xD;
      exercises and biofeedback for urge urinary incontinence, as well as the characteristics of&#xD;
      patients most likely to respond. By identifying the key components of this treatment, we hope&#xD;
      to simplify it and make it more easily applicable, more effective, less expensive, and thus&#xD;
      more useful for people with urge incontinence in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence (UI) is prevalent and morbid in the elderly, and its associated costs&#xD;
      exceed $26 billion annually. Although effective therapy exists, it is underutilized. This is&#xD;
      particularly true for non-pharmacologic therapies, which are at least as effective as drugs&#xD;
      but safer, and recommended as the initial approach by every national panel. If therapies such&#xD;
      as biofeedback (which targets pelvic muscles and detrusor suppression) are to become more&#xD;
      widely used, they will require simplification, fewer and briefer sessions, less expensive&#xD;
      equipment, and less sophisticated therapists. Unfortunately, such protocols cannot yet be&#xD;
      devised because it is unknown which components are essential. We postulate that the&#xD;
      mechanisms mediating effectiveness can be identified and that such knowledge will make it&#xD;
      possible to enhance efficacy and to formulate more feasible and cost-effective protocols.&#xD;
      Since reduction in UI correlates weakly with improved quality of life, however, it is&#xD;
      important that biofeedback's impact on life quality be assessed concomitantly to ensure that&#xD;
      formulation of such streamlined methods does not eliminate components essential for improved&#xD;
      quality of life, even if they have no physiological correlates. We will address these issues&#xD;
      by treating at least 150 elderly subjects with urge UI in an 8-week course of biofeedback. We&#xD;
      will collect clinical and quality of life data and perform extensive physiologic testing on&#xD;
      each subject at baseline and 8 weeks later. Improvement will be correlated with change in&#xD;
      physiologic and quality of life parameters to identify the parameters that likely mediated&#xD;
      it. Knowledge from this study should identify predictors and mechanisms mediating success of&#xD;
      biofeedback; suggest ways that it could be further improved; facilitate development of less&#xD;
      expensive, quicker, and more feasible protocols to deliver it (potentially permitting&#xD;
      application to less motivated or cognitively impaired patients); and shed insight into&#xD;
      mechanisms that may even improve efficacy of other interventions.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  urinary incontinence (urge or predominantly urge) by clinical criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  able to accurately complete a voiding diary, to perform a 24-hour pad test under&#xD;
             direction, and to undergo instruction in biofeedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
