  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of the investigational agent,&#xD;
      MucoMilk®, a polyclonal-antibody enriched Whey Protein Concentrate 40% (WPC-40) made of milk&#xD;
      of immunized cows. Secondary objectives will investigate the effectiveness of MucoMilk® as an&#xD;
      aid in the prevention of relapse of C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective, controlled, randomized, open-label study. Sixty&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized 2:1 to receive MucoMilk® (n=40) or to the control arm with no&#xD;
      specific product intervention (n=20). There is no effective FDA-approved treatment to prevent&#xD;
      recurrence of CDAD that is being withheld from subjects who will be randomized to the control&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor will prepare sequentially numbered batches of MucoMilk® for the entire 2-week&#xD;
      dosing period, or 42 packets, and will prepare a randomization table that will be held in&#xD;
      confidence by the University of Pittsburgh Investigational Drug Service (IDS) pharmacist.&#xD;
      Each subject will be assigned a sequential study number (i.e. 1, 2, 3, etc.) as they are&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. Upon enrollment, research staff will contact the IDS pharmacist to&#xD;
      obtain the subject's study number and randomization assignment (MucoMilk® or no specific&#xD;
      product intervention). Research staff will not have access to the randomization table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects assigned to receive MucoMilk® will be given a box containing 14 leaflets numbered&#xD;
      &quot;Day 1&quot; to &quot;Day 14&quot;. Each leaflet consists of 3 packets labeled &quot;morning&quot;, &quot;noon&quot;, and&#xD;
      &quot;evening&quot; connected by perforated paper. Subjects will be provided with one box and&#xD;
      instructed not to alter their diet during the two-week course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the University of Pittsburgh, it is anticipated that up to 150 subjects will need to be&#xD;
      screened in order to enter 60 subjects on study. Subjects may participate in this study for&#xD;
      up to 63 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be managed and followed per institutional infection control guidelines for C.&#xD;
      difficile containment regardless of assigned study group. Subjects will receive appropriate&#xD;
      treatment for comorbid conditions based on the judgement of the treating physician and&#xD;
      practice guidelines. With the exception of investigational agents, any clinically indicated&#xD;
      concomitant medications for symptomatic relief or support will be allowed upon recommendation&#xD;
      and approval of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this trial, the safety of MucoMilk® will be determined by passive self-reporting in a&#xD;
      subject diary and active surveillance by preset interview of any adverse events. In addition,&#xD;
      a physical exam and extensive hematologic and biochemical testing will be performed before&#xD;
      and after MucoMilk® administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be examined by assessing CDAD relapse rates. A relapse of CDAD will be reached&#xD;
      when, in comparison with the day before, stools have become looser and either (1) the&#xD;
      frequency of stools has increased for 2 consecutive days, or (2) on a single day the&#xD;
      frequency increases by &gt; 3 stools, or (3) occurrence of &gt; 6 stools/day on any day. In this&#xD;
      respect, CDAD relapse will be defined as &quot;probable&quot; if occurring as described for the first&#xD;
      18 days following MucoMilk® initiation with a negative C. diff toxin assay or &quot;proven&quot; if&#xD;
      occurring at any time with a positive C. diff toxin assay. A subject will be considered a&#xD;
      treatment failure if s/he meets the above criteria for a CDAD relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who cannot or will not be included in this study will be asked to be followed for 60&#xD;
      days off-study for any adverse reaction(s) or CDAD relapses per subject diary documentation.&#xD;
      These subjects may receive treatment for CDAD outside of this study as standard of care but&#xD;
      will not be offered any study product or intervention through randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Clinical and Laboratory Evaluations: Subjects may be either inpatients or outpatients&#xD;
      during their participation in this study. Inpatient study visits will take place at UPMC&#xD;
      Presbyterian, UPMC Montefiore, or UPMC Shadyside. Outpatient study visits will take place at&#xD;
      the Infectious Disease Clinic in the Falk Medical Building. Each study visit will last about&#xD;
      one hour depending on the procedures to be done at that visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures performed in this study are research-required with the exception of the&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment for CDAD initiated at the Diagnosis Visit and any stool toxin assays&#xD;
      performed to confirm suspected CDAD relapse as these are both standard of care for CDAD. The&#xD;
      investigator will review the results of all evaluations, and these results will become part&#xD;
      of the subject's research record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It may be necessary for the subject to make additional visit(s) during participation in this&#xD;
      study to have any of the study procedures listed below repeated in the event of unforeseen or&#xD;
      unanticipated abnormal results; difficulties in sample shipping, processing, or testing;&#xD;
      and/or if the subject experiences any changes in his/her physical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit for all subjects will occur within 3 days prior to Day 1 or will be combined&#xD;
      with the Day 1 Visit as subjects may be randomized if currently receiving or have completed&#xD;
      standard antibiotic therapy for CDAD. Subjects will be asked to read and sign the informed&#xD;
      consent before any study procedures are performed. Evaluations to be done at this visit&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of demographic data, medication history, chronic health score, and&#xD;
           primary/relapse CDAD episode information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Female subjects of childbearing potential will be given a urine pregnancy test, which&#xD;
           must be negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects currently on a standard antibiotic course for CDAD with oral/intravenous&#xD;
      metronidazole and/or vancomycin will continue this therapy for a minimum of 10 days per&#xD;
      standard of care at the discretion of the study physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 Visit will occur during or within 3 days after Screening. If diarrhea has recurred and&#xD;
      CDAD relapse is suspected, stool sample for toxin assay by ELISA/cell test, culture, and&#xD;
      microscopy. If positive for CDAD, the subject will be taken off study and followed as per&#xD;
      standard of care for CDAD relapse. Evaluations include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Karnofsky and EORTC GI scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  45ml blood draw for hematology (Hgb, WBC w/diff, platelets), renal function (creatinine,&#xD;
           urea, electrolytes), liver function (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, glucose,&#xD;
           total protein, bilirubin), lipids, IgE, and for storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Female subjects of childbearing potential will be given a urine pregnancy test, which&#xD;
           must be negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Distribution of subject diary for recording of any adverse event(s) and the number and&#xD;
           consistency of all stools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of these evaluations, MucoMilk® subjects will receive enough study product&#xD;
      for entire 14-day dosing period, be counseled on proper storage and administration by the&#xD;
      study staff, and be given a study agent diary to record compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 7 to 9 Visit will be conducted by telephone for outpatients or by visit for inpatients to&#xD;
      review stool frequency and consistency and any perceived adverse events from MucoMilk®, if&#xD;
      applicable. If a CDAD relapse is suspected based on this review, the subject will be asked to&#xD;
      provide a stool sample for toxin assay. If positive for CDAD, the subject will be taken off&#xD;
      MucoMilk® if applicable, off study, and followed as per standard of care for CDAD relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 18 to 21 Visit evaluations include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Targeted physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Karnofsky and EORTC GI scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  45ml blood draw for hematology, renal and liver function tests, lipids, IgE, and for&#xD;
           storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If diarrhea has recurred and CDAD relapse is suspected, stool sample for toxin assay by&#xD;
           ELISA/cell test, culture, and microscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of any unused investigational product and study agent diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject diary review. Subjects will continue to record any adverse event(s) and the&#xD;
           number and consistency of all stools during the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through Day 60 weekly visits will be conducted by telephone or visit to review bowel&#xD;
      movements and stool consistency. If a CDAD relapse is suspected based on any review, the&#xD;
      subject will be asked to provide a stool sample for toxin assay. If positive for CDAD, the&#xD;
      subject will be taken off study and followed as per standard of care for CDAD relapse. The&#xD;
      occurrence and time to the occurrence of any new relapse in this period will be evaluated as&#xD;
      well. Subjects who complete the study through Day 60 with no relapse of CDAD will be asked to&#xD;
      return their diary, discharged from study participation, and referred back to their primary&#xD;
      care physician for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Storage of Biological Samples: During this study, serum samples collected on Day 1 and on&#xD;
      Day 18 to 21 will be labeled with the subject's study identification number and date&#xD;
      collected; processed; frozen; and stored at MucoVax for future testing that is part of this&#xD;
      study, including investigation of antibodies directed against C. difficile and its toxins.&#xD;
      Also, the presence of human antibodies directed against bovine immunoglobulins may be&#xD;
      examined. The sponsor will have sole control over these samples, which will be stored for an&#xD;
      indefinite period of time. Subjects will not be notified of the results of these future&#xD;
      studies as the information collected will not apply to the management of their disease at the&#xD;
      time these tests are done. If these samples are provided to secondary investigators, these&#xD;
      samples, devoid of all subject identifiers and rendered anonymous, will be obtained from the&#xD;
      sponsor by the secondary investigator. The secondary investigator will not have direct access&#xD;
      to any subject identifiers or related subject information.&#xD;
