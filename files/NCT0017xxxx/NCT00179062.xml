    <textblock>
      This twelve month, open-label study considers the effect of Risperdal (risperidone) versus&#xD;
      Zyprexa (olanzapine) on weight gain, physical health, and outcome in a population of those&#xD;
      diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, major depression or bipolar disorder&#xD;
      with psychotic features. This study evaluates symptom response as well as general health&#xD;
      indicators such as body mass index, glucose, prolactin, and cholesterol levels at baseline,&#xD;
      month (M)1, M3, M6 and M12.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for participation in the&#xD;
        current research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects will be males and females between 18-60 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects will have a definite diagnosis by DSM-IV criteria of schizophrenia,&#xD;
             schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder or major depression with psychotic&#xD;
             symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects may be outpatients or inpatients at the time of entry. They will continue in&#xD;
             the study if hospitalization should occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subjects or their legal guardian must sign the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from consideration for the&#xD;
        current research project.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects will be excluded if they have a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental&#xD;
             Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis other than schizophrenia, schizoaffective&#xD;
             disorder, bipolar disorder or depression with psychotic features; however, a&#xD;
             concurrent diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder, which does not account for the&#xD;
             subjects's psychosis is acceptable..&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has received continuous treatment of olanzapine or risperidone in the last two&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects receiving continuous treatment with olanzapine or risperidone in the last two&#xD;
             months prior to entering the study will be excluded. This means the subject cannot&#xD;
             have actually taken olanzapine or risperidone daily for more than four weeks prior to&#xD;
             enrollment. There must be a gap of at least two days of not taking medication during&#xD;
             that period. The dose for olanzapine cannot exceed 10 mg /day, the dose for&#xD;
             risperidone 2 mg/day. The last day of exposure of any kind should be at least seven&#xD;
             days before baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has been diagnosed as treatment refractory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects unable to speak or read the English language.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with a DSM-IV diagnosis of substance dependence within three months prior to&#xD;
             selection. Occasional abuse (defined as bingeing no more than once per week) will not&#xD;
             preclude entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with a documented disease of the central nervous system, including but not&#xD;
             limited to stroke, tumor, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's&#xD;
             disease, seizure disorder requiring anticonvulsants, history of brain trauma resulting&#xD;
             in documented impairment, chronic infection, neurosyphilis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with hepatic, renal, atherosclerotic heart disease, arrhythmias or&#xD;
             gastrointestinal disease of sufficient degree to interfere with the excretion,&#xD;
             absorption, and/or metabolism of trial medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects with clinical signs of liver disease should be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects with acute (e.g. infection), unstable (e.g. labile hypertension, unstable&#xD;
             angina), significant, or untreated medical illness; patients with diastolic blood&#xD;
             pressure &gt; 95 mmHg at screening should be treated and stabilized before randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects with narrow angle glaucoma, chronic urinary retention and/or clinically&#xD;
             significant prostatic hypertrophy, paralytic ileus or related conditions, which in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator may be exacerbated by the anticholinergic effects of&#xD;
             olanzapine.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects with a known eating disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Female subjects who are pregnant or breast-feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subjects who are being treated with a depot neuroleptic within one treatment cycle of&#xD;
             the beginning of the washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subjects with a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subjects with a high-risk for suicide.&#xD;
