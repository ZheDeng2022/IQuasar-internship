  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of osteoporosis therapy is to prevent fracture, and anabolic agents can&#xD;
      accomplish this by strengthening bone structure, which is accompanied by changes in BMD.&#xD;
      Effects of ALX1-11 on BMD have been previously documented in a dose-finding Phase II clinical&#xD;
      trial in osteoporotic postmenopausal women taking calcium and vitamin D supplements, who were&#xD;
      otherwise naive to osteoporosis therapies. The anabolic effects of ALX1-11 on lumbar&#xD;
      vertebrae were statistically significant compared to placebo after 12 months of treatment. In&#xD;
      addition, animal studies showed that the new bone formed by treatment with ALX1 11 is of good&#xD;
      quality both histologically and biomechanically (Mosekilde et al., 1991; Kimmel et al.,&#xD;
      1993).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol ALX1-11-93001 (TOP) assessed the effect of 18 months of ALX1-11 treatment on&#xD;
      fracture incidence as a primary efficacy variable, and Protocol CL1-11-002 (OLES) assessed&#xD;
      the effect on BMD for up to 24 months of treatment. Subjects who will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      current study (TRES) will be those who received placebo in TOP and ALX1-11 in OLES. TRES will&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of continued ALX1-11 treatment on the safety and efficacy variables&#xD;
      assessed in the OLE study for a maximum treatment duration of 36 months in the OLES and TRES&#xD;
      combined.&#xD;
