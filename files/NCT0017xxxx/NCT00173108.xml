      The first aim is to develop a clinic-based intervention program and a home-based intervention&#xD;
      program for VLBW preterm infants that have common intervention services but are respectively&#xD;
      delivered at clinic and home. The interventions are comprehensive that combine child- and&#xD;
      parent-focused services including health and feeding consultation, education of child&#xD;
      development skills, intervention of mother-infant interaction, and parent support. The&#xD;
      eleven-session interventions are intensive that begin in hospitalization and end at 12 months&#xD;
      of corrected age. The clinical feasibility and usefulness of implementing these intervention&#xD;
      programs within the context of randomized intervention study subject to the existing&#xD;
      constraints of the hospital and home settings will be tested in a pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim is to conduct a randomized control trial to examine the costs and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the UCP, the CBIP, and the HBIP for VLBW preterm infants. Gender and&#xD;
      socio-economically matched normal full-term infants will also be included as a comparison&#xD;
      group. Outcome measures that include child, parenting, and transactions outcomes will be&#xD;
      compared between groups. Child outcome measures will include health status, growth,&#xD;
      neurodevelopment, and neurosensory status; parenting outcome measures will include maternal&#xD;
      parenting competence, social support, and psychological stress; transactions outcome measure&#xD;
      will be mother-infant interaction. Costs (direct and indirect costs) associated with each&#xD;
      early intervention program during the follow-up period will be estimated. Average and&#xD;
      incremental cost/effectiveness ratio will be calculated to determine which early intervention&#xD;
      program is most cost-effective for VLBW preterm infants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth with very low birth weight (VLBW) (gestational age &lt;37 weeks and birth weight&#xD;
      &lt;1,501 g) is a significant public health problem worldwide. Longitudinal follow-up studies&#xD;
      showed that VLBW preterm infants require prolonged hospitalization and are at substantial&#xD;
      risk for various morbidities during neonatal period than those born at normal birth weight.&#xD;
      Furthermore, approximately 40% of VLBW preterm infants are burden with adverse outcomes from&#xD;
      chronic health problems and re-hospitalizations, to lower IQ, developmental delays,&#xD;
      behavioral problems, and poor educational achievement. Accumulating data collected in Western&#xD;
      developed countries have suggested that comprehensive and intensive early interventions may&#xD;
      be beneficial for preterm infants and their families. However, there is little information&#xD;
      concerning what early intervention should be attempted for these infants and their families&#xD;
      in Taiwan. The purpose of this study is therefore to examine the cost-effectiveness of three&#xD;
      early intervention programs i.e., the usual care program, the clinic-based intervention&#xD;
      program, and the home-based intervention program for VLBW preterm infants. In a preliminary&#xD;
      study, we surveyed the need of intervention services following hospital discharge in VLBW&#xD;
      preterm infants (N=69) and their families. All mothers expressed the need of services that 60&#xD;
      (87%) preferred service delivery at home and 9 (13%) preferred service delivery at neonatal&#xD;
      follow-up clinic. The intervention services specifically identified were health and&#xD;
      respiratory assistance (N=22), feeding assistance (N=17), education of child development&#xD;
      skills (N=12), and parent support (N=8). Based on these survey data and the results of&#xD;
      previous intervention studies, we will develop in this proposed research project a&#xD;
      clinic-based intervention program and a home-based intervention program that have common&#xD;
      intervention services but are respectively delivered via clinic visit and home visit. The&#xD;
      interventions are comprehensive that combine child- and parent-focused services including&#xD;
      health and feeding consultation, education of child development skills, intervention of&#xD;
      mother-infant interaction, and parent support. The eleven-session interventions are intensive&#xD;
      that begin in hospitalization and end at 12 months of corrected age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a four-year research project that employs a single blind, randomized&#xD;
      experimental design to examine the efficacy of the early intervention programs for VLBW&#xD;
      preterm infants. For the first year, we will develop the clinic-based intervention program&#xD;
      and the home-based intervention programs in the actual situations to examine their clinical&#xD;
      usefulness. From the second to the fourth year, 180 VLBW preterm infants who are born and&#xD;
      admitted to the neonatal intensive care units of National Taiwan University Hospital and&#xD;
      MacKay Memorial Hospital will be randomly assigned to the usual care program, the&#xD;
      clinic-based intervention program, and the home-based intervention program. Sixty gender and&#xD;
      socio-economically matched normal full-term infants will also be included as a comparison&#xD;
      group. Child, parenting, and transactions outcomes will be assessed when infants are at 4, 6,&#xD;
      12, 18, and 24 months of corrected age. Child outcomes are measured by health status, growth,&#xD;
      neurodevelopment, and neurosensory status; parenting outcomes are measured by maternal&#xD;
      parenting competence, social support, and psychological stress; transactions outcome is&#xD;
      measured by mother-infant interaction. Generalized estimating equations will be used to&#xD;
      examine the differences in changes of outcome variables between intervention and control&#xD;
      groups. At the end of the fourth year, the costs and effectiveness of the three intervention&#xD;
      programs will be compared to determine which one is more cost-effective for VLBW preterm&#xD;
      infants in Taiwan. The results of this study will help clinicians and parents understand the&#xD;
      efficacy of early intervention for VLBW preterm infants. Furthermore, the data of this study&#xD;
      will provide important information to policy makers and health administrators concerning&#xD;
      resource allocation of early intervention forVLBW preterm infants in Taiwan.&#xD;
