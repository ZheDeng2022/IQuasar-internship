    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of injections of Botox (botulinum toxin&#xD;
      type A) for the treatment of chronic neck pain. Botox is an approved treatment for patients&#xD;
      with cervical dystonia. Cervical dystonia is a chronic condition characterized by involuntary&#xD;
      movements of the neck that are often painful. In this study, the response from Botox in&#xD;
      patients with neck pain not associated with cervical dystonia will be compared to the pain&#xD;
      response in patients with cervical dystonia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical dystonia (CD) is a condition characterized by involuntary movements of the neck.&#xD;
      Generally these movements are rotational and are frequently associated with significant pain.&#xD;
      Treatment of CD with oral medications is usually unsuccessful and the current treatment of&#xD;
      choice for the majority of patients consists of periodic injections of botulinum toxin into&#xD;
      the offending muscles. Resistant cases are considered candidates for selective surgical&#xD;
      denervation procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Botulinum toxin type A (Botox®) is a FDA approved treatment for CD. Botox® has been safely&#xD;
      used to treat CD in our clinic since 1989. In controlled trials, Botox® significantly&#xD;
      improved pain in patients with CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cervico-thoracic pain syndromes not associated with dystonia (refractory cervicothoracic&#xD;
      myofascial pain syndrome or CMPS) is a chronic regional pain syndrome. It is a common&#xD;
      component in acute and chronic pain syndromes, occurring in up to 14% of the U.S. population.&#xD;
      This pain is often resistant to treatment and is characterized by a series of tender trigger&#xD;
      points. These are often injected with local anesthetics that provide temporary relief of pain&#xD;
      in some patients. Recent uncontrolled trials have suggested that Botox® may be helpful in&#xD;
      patients with CMPS. Most attempts to use Botox® to treat these Patients have utilized smaller&#xD;
      doses of Botox® than those used typically to treat CD. Also, most studies have used Botox®&#xD;
      injection into tender trigger points rather than into the belly of the muscle as is commonly&#xD;
      done to treat CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will use doses of Botox® that are typically used to treat CD. Injections of&#xD;
      Botox® will be guided by EMG to determine areas of involuntarily firing muscle rather than&#xD;
      solely into tender trigger points. The results in patients with CMPS will be compared to the&#xD;
      pain relief experienced with those with CD. It is hoped that this trial will provide pilot&#xD;
      data for planning a larger safety and efficacy trial of Botox® for chronic cervico-thoracic&#xD;
      pain not associated with CD.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Outpatient, male and female subjects, of any race, between 18 years of age and older.&#xD;
             Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             result at the Screening/Baseline Visit. (A female is considered of childbearing&#xD;
             potential unless she is postmenopausal or without a uterus and/or both ovaries.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects suffering from cervicothoracic muscle pain with or without cervical dystonia.&#xD;
             The pain must be of at least 3 months duration and characterized by a numerical pain&#xD;
             rating score of at least 5 on the pain subscale of the TWSTR scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are able to understand the requirements of the study and sign an Informed&#xD;
