  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of antipsychotic medications has increased over the past decade. While more recently&#xD;
      developed medications are improved with regards to extrapyramidal side effects, the use of&#xD;
      atypical antipsychotics has been associated with substantial weight gain and a worsening of&#xD;
      metabolic profile. The time course and extent of weight gain differs among antipsychotics,&#xD;
      with olanzapine and clozapine being associated with greatest weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanisms underlying a worsening metabolic profile, obesity and obesity-related illnesses&#xD;
      are complex, extending beyond sedentary lifestyle, poor diet and genetic predisposition.&#xD;
      There is also a growing body of evidence that the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) has a role&#xD;
      in the generation of both obesity and obesity-related illness. While the role of the SNS in&#xD;
      blood pressure control is readily acknowledged it is less well appreciated that activation of&#xD;
      the SNS exerts profound metabolic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the fact of a causal relation linking antipsychotic drugs and obesity is&#xD;
      unequivocally established, the biological mechanisms operating are unclear, and strategies&#xD;
      for preventive therapy remain largely unformulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the role of the SNS and its association with the metabolic&#xD;
      abnormalities that are frequently observed in patients with schizophrenia following treatment&#xD;
      with antipsychotic medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the study will investigate whether treatment with the centrally acting&#xD;
      sympatholytic agent moxonidine will modify SNS activity and, hence, favourably influence the&#xD;
      downstream metabolic abnormalities seen in antipsychotic treated patients with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Elevated sympathetic nervous system activity underlies the metabolic&#xD;
      disturbances observed in patients following antipsychotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To investigate the role of the sympathetic nervous system and its association with the&#xD;
      metabolic abnormalities that are frequently observed in patients with schizophrenia following&#xD;
      treatment with antipsychotic medications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Central sympathoinhibition with moxonidine will blunt the elevated sympathetic&#xD;
      nervous activity and downstream metabolic abnormalities observed in antipsychotic treated&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine whether treatment with the centrally acting sympatholytic agent moxonidine&#xD;
      will modify sympathetic nervous system activity and, hence, favourably influence the&#xD;
      downstream metabolic abnormalities seen in antipsychotic treated patients with schizophrenia.&#xD;
