  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a RCT studying the effectiveness of the Singapore Program for All Inclusive Care for&#xD;
      the Elderly (SingaPACE) demonstration project over a 36 month period. SingaPACE is modelled&#xD;
      on the US PACE home and community based service that acts as an alternative to institutional&#xD;
      care. The comparator is best referrals for care as currently arranged through the Agency for&#xD;
      Integrated Care (AIC) and referred by medical social workers. This research aims to determine&#xD;
      how the SingaPACE model of health and social care affects use of emergency and acute care&#xD;
      hospital services, institutional care, the quality of life (QOL) and satisfaction of the&#xD;
      participants aged 60+ and their caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses to be tested are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H01: The elderly in SingaPACE will have fewer admissions to accident &amp; emergency (A&amp;E)&#xD;
      hospitalization than the elderly who are not in SingaPACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H02: The elderly in SingaPACE will have fewer admissions to acute care hospitalization than&#xD;
      the elderly who are not in SingaPACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H03: The elderly in SingaPACE will delay first admission to institutionalized nursing home&#xD;
      care more than the elderly who are not in SingaPACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H04: The elderly in SingaPACE clients will have a higher QOL compared to the elderly who are&#xD;
      not in SingaPACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H05: Caregivers of the elderly in SingaPACE will have a lower care-giving burden compared to&#xD;
      caregivers of the elderly who are not in SingaPACE.&#xD;

      * Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects will be identified from i) inpatients referred prior to discharge and ii)&#xD;
      outpatients to medical social workers from Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and Alexandra&#xD;
      Hospital (AH). After confirming study eligibility the medical social worker will inform the&#xD;
      potential subject about the study; after obtaining informed consent, the medical social&#xD;
      worker will make a telephone call to the Duke - NUS research fellow who will then carry out&#xD;
      the randomization process, assigning the subject to either the intervention group or the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Sites&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SingaPACE program will be located at 298, Tiong Bahru Road, #15-01/06 Central Plaza and&#xD;
      at NTUC Eldercare, Block 117, Bukit Merah View.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization will be stratified at each recruitment site by gender, assuring equal&#xD;
           numbers of men and women in each study arm; and by hospital assuring equal number of&#xD;
           patients from SGH and AH in each study arm. 20 participants will enter the study (10 per&#xD;
           arm) each month over a proposed 4-month recruitment period. If the recruitment rate is&#xD;
           lower than expected, the recruitment period will be extended.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals in the intervention group will have a program of services based on intake&#xD;
           and ongoing evaluation using interRAI by the SingaPACE assessment team. Services&#xD;
           included in the integrated available mix are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Case management across the continuum of care&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medical care by the SingaPACE physician&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Home nursing (e.g., for administering parenteral medication, wound care, assessment&#xD;
                of health status, nutrition)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Home care (e.g., for assistance with ADL)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Occupational therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Psychosocial care and counseling by social workers&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Transportation to care and support services&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Emergency housing and beds - public hospital acute bed substitution&#xD;
&#xD;
                24 hour doctor / nurse phone coverageIf individuals in the intervention group leave&#xD;
                the SingaPACE program, they will still continue to be tracked as a part of&#xD;
                intention-to-treat analysis. Patients who die over the 36 months will be counted as&#xD;
                drop outs. While the program can have new replacements for patients who have died,&#xD;
                new participants will not be counted as a part of the intervention group in this&#xD;
                research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals randomized to the control arm will be referred to the medical social worker&#xD;
           for referral to community services as usual. The control group will be interviewed on&#xD;
           their medical history, healthcare utilization and expenditure data. The data collected&#xD;
           will be complemented by data that may be made available by the VWO providing home and&#xD;
           community care to the control group. Such VWO data may possibly include assessments&#xD;
           using RAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants from the control group switch from a VWO community care program to another&#xD;
      VWO community care program, they will still continue to be tracked and included in the&#xD;
      intention-to-treat analysis. For participants who die over the period of study, they will be&#xD;
      counted as loss to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will receive community care services referred by the SGH MSW:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VWO community care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GPs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Polyclinics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specialist Outpatient Clinics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Traditional Chinese Medicine or herbal treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supportive care arrangements of the family, relatives and friends&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All participants will be tracked over a 36-month period starting August 2011.&#xD;
                Following the US PACE impact evaluation from 1998 observations of all patients will&#xD;
                be made at the beginning of the intervention and follow up at 6 month intervals&#xD;
                (Chatterji et al. 1998; Irvin, Massey and Dorsey 1997; White, Abel and Kidder,&#xD;
                2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis The main outcome measure is number of EMT events, A&amp;E events and acute care events&#xD;
      over the 36 month period. This is the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints to be studied are time to first admission to nursing home over the 36&#xD;
      month period, LOS in A&amp;E; LOS in acute care; patient QOL and satisfaction with care; monthly&#xD;
      utilization and costs; healthcare expenditure (out-of-pocket) and financing; and caregiver&#xD;
      satisfaction / well being. There will be both unadjusted and adjusted measures. For time to&#xD;
      first admission to nursing home, survival analysis specifically Cox Proportional Hazards&#xD;
      regressions and intention-to-treat analysis will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since our study tracks participants over a period of 36 months, the first potential concern&#xD;
      is participants in the control group who may be lost to follow-up 6 months after discharge&#xD;
      which is when the MSW will close the care management files for patients. After the 6 months,&#xD;
      the control group may for various reasons cease to receive community care unless they are in&#xD;
      a VWO program that has care management. To minimize this difficulty, the available&#xD;
      coordinated care management VWOs in the Bukit Merah catchment area will be provided with the&#xD;
      list of names of the control group for oversight. Should any of the participants drop out of&#xD;
      a community care program, the care coordinators can assist in enrolling the older adult in&#xD;
      another care program should the participant decide that s / he would like to continue in a&#xD;
      care program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical justification and the means by which data will be analyzed and interpreted&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the hypothesis to be tested, H03: Frail elderly in SingaPACE will have delayed first&#xD;
      admission to institutionalized residential care nursing home relative to the frail elderly&#xD;
      who are not in SingaPACE, survival analysis will be carried out. Shoenfeld's formula gives&#xD;
      the total number of first nursing home admissions necessary to achieve 80% power as a&#xD;
      function of the hazard ratio 32/(log HR)2. Assuming a hazard ratio of 0.35, along with first&#xD;
      admission probabilities of 20% and 50% in SingaPACE and non-SingaPACE groups respectively,&#xD;
      approximately 28 total admissions and therefore total participants (40 in each group) will be&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the hypotheses H01: The elderly in SingaPACE will tend to have fewer admissions to&#xD;
      accident &amp; emergency (A&amp;E) hospitalization than the elderly who are not in SingaPACE; H02:&#xD;
      The elderly in SingaPACE will have fewer admissions to acute care hospitalization than the&#xD;
      elderly who are not in SingaPACE; H04: The elderly in SingaPACE clients will have an enhanced&#xD;
      QOL and satisfaction compared to the elderly who are not in SingaPACE; and H05: Caregivers of&#xD;
      the elderly in SingaPACE will have a lower care-giving burden compared to caregivers of the&#xD;
      elderly who are not in SingaPACE, Wilcoxon rank sum tests will be carried out. Assuming that&#xD;
      observations from one group will exceed observations from the other group at least 55% of the&#xD;
      time, each of these tests will have greater than 80% power for detecting a difference between&#xD;
      the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analytical strategy will consist of hypothesis testing for each of the five individual&#xD;
      hypotheses and intention-to-treat analysis. Also there will be an examination of the&#xD;
      distributions of the main outcomes across all participants in each arm over 36 months. This&#xD;
      will be complemented by a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of PACE programs in the US and&#xD;
      Singapore.&#xD;
