  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, phase Ib/II study. First, the aim of the phase Ib part is&#xD;
      to estimate the MTD(s) and/or to identify the recommended phase II dose(s) (RP2D) for the&#xD;
      combination of MEK162 and AMG 479 (ganitumab), followed by the phase II part to assess the&#xD;
      clinical efficacy and to further assess the safety of the combination in selected patient&#xD;
      populations. The dose escalation part of the study will be guided by a Bayesian Logistic&#xD;
      Regression Model (BLRM). At least 18 patients are expected to be enrolled in the dose&#xD;
      escalation part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following MTD/ RP2D declaration, patients will be enrolled in three phase II arms to assess&#xD;
      efficacy of the combination as well as to better understand the safety, tolerability, PK,&#xD;
      antibody concentrations and PD of the combination at MTD/RP2D. Phase II arm 1 will consist of&#xD;
      approximately 25 patients with KRAS-mutant colorectal adenocarcinoma. Phase II arm 2 will&#xD;
      consist of approximately 20 patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Phase II arm&#xD;
      3 will consist of approximately 28 patients with mutant BRAFV600 melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity develops, or&#xD;
      withdrawal of informed consent, whichever occurs first. All patients will be followed up - at&#xD;
      minimum patients must complete the safety follow-up assessments 30 days after the last dose&#xD;
      of the study treatment.&#xD;
