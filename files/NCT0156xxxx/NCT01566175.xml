  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to implant the Reducer in patients with the symptoms of&#xD;
      refractory angina, that suffer from refractory angina who demonstrate reversible ischemia.&#xD;

      -  Interventional, Allocation: Open label, Primary Purpose: Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis and treatment for which the device is required:Patients with advanced&#xD;
           obstructive coronary artery disease and severe disabling refractory angina despite&#xD;
           optimal medical therapy. No revascularization option available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Why this unlicensed device is chosen over a licensed device or conventional therapies&#xD;
           for this particular patient? Patient currently treated with optimal medical therapies&#xD;
           that include: long acting nitrates, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers. The&#xD;
           patient is not amendable to re-do bypass graft surgery, not amendable to percutaneous&#xD;
           coronary intervention, as determined by recent coronary angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no other licensed device that can effectively ameliorate refractory angina and&#xD;
      reduce the number of angina episodes and improve quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The current device has been used in 25 patients to date. Safety information at 6 months had&#xD;
      been published (JACC 2007;49:1783). Extended safety and efficacy information at 3 years had&#xD;
      been reported in March 2010 (ACC Annual Scientific conference). The device has not been&#xD;
      associated with any procedure-related adverse events during the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks (theoretical):•Coronary sinus dissection at the time of implantation. •Coronary sinus&#xD;
      perforation and acute cardiac tamponade requiring drainage. •Device migration and&#xD;
      embolization. •Late coronary sinus occlusion These risk were not reported in patients who&#xD;
      receieved the device. Benefits: •Reduce angina severity. •Improve quality of life. •Reduction&#xD;
      in the intensity of medical therapy with decrease side effects. •Reduced incidence of&#xD;
      hospital admissions, emergency room visits and outpatient clinic visits for refractory&#xD;
      angina. •Improved left ventricular function, and reduced LV end diastolic pressure. These&#xD;
      patients have poor quality of life. They are disable and unable to work or to perform basic&#xD;
      daily activities. Cannulation of the coronary sinus presents procedural risks similar to that&#xD;
      of pacemaker electrode insertion, a procedure which is frequently performed in Interventional&#xD;
      cardiology. For these particular patients with poor quality of life, the offered technology&#xD;
      can potentially make them more active, more productive, and less dependent on medication and&#xD;
      the health system.&#xD;
