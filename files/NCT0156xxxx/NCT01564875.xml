      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multicenter, double-dummy, double-blinded, randomized, Phase 4 study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be randomized to either a study group or a control group in a 1:1 ratio,&#xD;
           and will be orally administered the assigned drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The study is designed to demonstrate that efficacy and safety of morning dosing of Simvast&#xD;
      Controlled Release (CR) Tab is not inferior to evening dosing of Zocor Tab in patients with&#xD;
      stage 3,4,5 chronic kidney disease with hyperlipidemia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      -to assess the percent change of LDL-C at Week 8 from baseline in Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD)&#xD;
      stage 3,4,5 with hyperlipidemia subjects.&#xD;

      The secondary objectives of the study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess the change and percent change of TC, HDL-C, TG from baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess the accomplishment rate of therapeutic goals based on the therapeutic guidance&#xD;
           for hyperlipidemia of the Korean Society of Lipidology and Atherosclerosis.&#xD;
