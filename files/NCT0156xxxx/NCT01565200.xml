  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      T-DM1 , which is a highly innovative but also expensive antiHER2 agent consisting in the&#xD;
      coupling of the humanised monoclonal antibody trastuzumab with a cytotoxic agent (maytansine&#xD;
      derivate) has shown an encouraging antitumor activity evaluated by Recist criteria (35%&#xD;
      objective response rate, 44% stable disease, 18% progressive disease) in patients with&#xD;
      advanced HER2 positive Breast Cancer pretreated with several cytotoxic drugs, trastuzumab and&#xD;
      lapatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale I :For TDM1 to be active, the presence of an intact HER2 receptor is &quot;key&quot; since&#xD;
      the internalization of the cytotoxic moiety depends on the binding of trastuzumab to the&#xD;
      external domain of HER2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The zirconium 89 labelled trastuzumab PET/CT (or HER2 immunoPET/CT) is a non invasive test&#xD;
      which shows promise in measuring HER2 expression (extracellular domain) for the entire&#xD;
      disease burden and which could identify non responding patients prior to TDM1 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale II: As for many such agents, it is desirable to identify early on (here with the&#xD;
      use of FDG-PET/CT) which patients are unlikely to benefit from the therapy&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the trial is to prospectively evaluate the ability of a zirconium 89&#xD;
      labelled trastuzumab PET, to predict, before initiation of the treatment, treatment failure&#xD;
      to a new targeted drug: T-DM1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, the early FDG-PET/CT, performed after 1 course of T-DM1, will also&#xD;
      evaluated for its ability to predict non response to TDM1.&#xD;
