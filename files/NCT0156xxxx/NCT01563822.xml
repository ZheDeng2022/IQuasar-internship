      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally during ovum pick-up in ICSI, we aspirate the follicles for oocyte retrieval but&#xD;
      unfortunately we don't make use of the follicular fluid (FF) and we discard it in spite of&#xD;
      the fact that this does not happen in nature. The fallopian tube picks-up the FF with the&#xD;
      oocyte during ovulation. As this fluid contains stem cell factor and C-Kit receptor&#xD;
      responsible for implantation and IGF responsible for endometrial growth and TGF that improves&#xD;
      implantation. That's why flushing the endometrial cavity with FF after ovum pick-up might&#xD;
      improve endometrial receptivity and implantation rates; the limiting step in ICSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 patients attending kasr El-Aini IVF center preparing for ICSI cycles are randomized into&#xD;
      two groups. In the study group, flushing the endometrial cavity with 2ml of clear follicular&#xD;
      fluid surrounding mature oocytes through an IUI catheter is done after ovum pick-up While in&#xD;
      the control group, no flushing of the endometrial cavity with FF is done. The implantation&#xD;
      rates and pregnancy rates in both groups will be assessed.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Looking at the process of IVF, we found that we only make use of the ovum and sperm and we&#xD;
      neglect completely the valuable effect of the follicular fluid which is currently attracting&#xD;
      a lot of attention. Several studies revealed a pivotal role played by this fluid in the&#xD;
      process of fertilization and implantation as it is rich in growth factors as stem cell&#xD;
      factor, transforming growth factor and insulin growth factor and cytokines (1,2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Macci√≤ study confirmed that follicular fluid (FF) contains factors that induce&#xD;
      immunosuppression and explained that the immunosuppressive activity of FF is mediated by the&#xD;
      specific inhibition of the production of IL-1 alpha and IL-2 and by the decreased expression&#xD;
      of the CD25 (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During ovum pick-up, we aspirate all the FF and throw it away after ovum retrieval. This&#xD;
      fluid normally enters the fallopian tubes while picking the ovum during ovulation in natural&#xD;
      cycles and it reaches the uterine cavity as well and several studies suggested that it might&#xD;
      have a crucial role in modifying uterine receptivity preparing the endometrium for the&#xD;
      fertilized ovum arriving after 3 days as the TGF controls apoptosis, the IGF improves&#xD;
      endometrial thickness and the immunosuppressive activity of the FF paves the way for the&#xD;
      embryo to implant in the uterine cavity (4,5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actually Hunter study in 2007, provided circumstantial evidence for entry of follicular fluid&#xD;
      into the Fallopian tubes, especially close to the time of ovulation, with the suggestion that&#xD;
      such entry could modify the nature of endosalpingeal secretion and transudation. Thereafter,&#xD;
      the spectrum of gonadal hormones in follicular fluid could be influencing uterine tissues in&#xD;
      a local manner (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, it is a well known fact that implantation is the limiting step in IVF&#xD;
      success , actually almost all IVF cycles succeed in offering fertilized ova giving rise to&#xD;
      embryos at the different stages of development but unfortunately when we transfer them to the&#xD;
      uterine cavity, 60% fail to implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implantation is a complex initial step in the establishment of a successful pregnancy.&#xD;
      Although embryo quality is an important determinant of implantation, temporally co-ordinated&#xD;
      differentiation of endometrial cells to attain uterine receptivity and a synchronized&#xD;
      dialogue between maternal and embryonic tissues are crucial. Optimizing endometrial&#xD;
      receptivity in fertility treatment will improve success rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several growth factors and cytokines appear to be involved in the process of implantation.&#xD;
      Stem cell factor and its receptor c-kit regulate the progression and survival of germ cells&#xD;
      and play an important role in follicular development. It is present in the follicular fluid&#xD;
      however little information was available on the role of stem cell factor and its receptor in&#xD;
      the process of blastocyst implantation. It was not until Mitsunari examined the expression of&#xD;
      stem cell factor and its receptor in mouse embryos and in the stromal and epithelial cells of&#xD;
      the uterine endometrium by reverse transcription -polymerase chain reaction . He illustrated&#xD;
      that stem cell factor derived from endometrial cells and the implanting embryo exerts&#xD;
      paracrine and autocrine action on the process of implantation by stimulating trophoblast&#xD;
      outgrowth through its receptor c-kit (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neglecting the importance of the follicular fluid and throwing it away during the process of&#xD;
      IVF is actually a deviation from what happens in nature where the fallopian tube is&#xD;
      intelligent enough to appreciate the value of this fluid and pick it up with the ovum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      That is why in this study, we want to mimic natural cycles and explore the benefits of&#xD;
      flushing the uterine cavity with follicular fluid after ovum pick-up in improving&#xD;
      implantation rates in ICSI cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 patients attending kasr El-Ainey IVF center preparing for ICSI cycles will be randomized&#xD;
      into two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective interventional study, the patients of both groups will receive the same&#xD;
      induction protocol for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation which is the long protocol, our&#xD;
      standard protocol in the center. Initial suppression of ovarian function with gonadotrophin&#xD;
      releasing hormone agonist will start on day 21 of the preceeding cycle. Human menopausal&#xD;
      gonadotrophin induction will start after confirmed ovarian down regulation by both laboratory&#xD;
      investigations and ultrasound by daily intramuscular injection of 150-300 IU (Merional, IBSA)&#xD;
      until at least 3 follicles reach 18 mm and serum estradiol level lies between 1000-4000 then&#xD;
      10000 IU, HCG is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovum pick-up is scheduled 35 hours later, where each follicle is aspirated in a separate tube&#xD;
      and will be examined by the embryologist separately where:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The follicular fluid from empty follicles will be discarded, only the FF from follicles&#xD;
           where mature oocytes were retrieved will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The follicular fluid contaminated with blood will be discarded and would not be used,&#xD;
           only the clear FF will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No flushing was used after oocyte aspiration in order not to interfere with the&#xD;
           concentration of growth factors in the FF .&#xD;
&#xD;
      After explaining the procedure and taking informed consent from the patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2ml of clear follicular fluid will be injected in the uterine cavity to flush the endometrium&#xD;
      through an IUI catheter after performing mock transfer in the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While, in the control group, no flushing of the endometrial cavity with FF is done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, embryo transfer will be carried out 2-3 days later according to the condition&#xD;
      of the embryos and pregnancy test will be carried out 14 days later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol was approved by the review board at kasr el-Aini hospital; IVF center at Cairo&#xD;
      university.&#xD;
