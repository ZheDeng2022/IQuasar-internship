      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that transdermal nicotine treatment&#xD;
      retards disease progression as measured by change in total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating&#xD;
      Scale (UPDRS)(part I, II, III)score between baseline and after 52 weeks of study treatment&#xD;
      plus two more months wash out (60 weeks).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to prove the disease-modifying potential of transdermal nicotine treatment, an&#xD;
      explanatory design with a 2 months wash-out phase before endpoint assessment will be&#xD;
      performed. The primary objective is to demonstrate superiority measured by the difference&#xD;
      between the nicotine arm and the placebo arm in the change in total UPDRS score (part I-III)&#xD;
      between baseline and end of month 14 (12 months treatment and 2 months wash-out, see 3.1).&#xD;
      The total UPDRS score will be determined by an independent rater, who is not involved in any&#xD;
      other study-related procedure (e.g. reporting of adverse events). Change in total UPDRS score&#xD;
      is the most widely applied measure in similar clinical trials assessing long-term beneficial&#xD;
      effects of drugs. The investigators will also determine whether the slope of the curves for&#xD;
      the total UPDRS score in active- and placebo-treated subjects show a tendency to converge&#xD;
      over time. For this purpose the UPDRS will be determined three times after placebo/nicotine&#xD;
      withdrawal at the end of the study during Visit 7,8, and 9 (i.e. four times including Visit&#xD;
      6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 250 subjects will be screened at 25-30 centers in Germany and the USA. The&#xD;
      recruitment period will be 18 months. In the screening phase, subjects will be evaluated for&#xD;
      eligibility for enrolment into the treatment phase. The investigators expect that screening&#xD;
      of 250 subjects will result in 160 eligible subjects who will be randomly assigned 1:1 to&#xD;
      treatment with either transdermal nicotine or transdermal placebo patch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment phase consists of a titration period (16 weeks, to find the highest dosage&#xD;
      tolerated by the subject with a target of 28 mg) and a maintenance period (week 17 to week 52&#xD;
      with the highest tolerated dosage of nicotine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment phase will be followed by an 8 week wash-out phase (3 weeks down titration and&#xD;
      5 weeks run out).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose adjustments are permitted for adverse events and have to be documented thoroughly.&#xD;
