    <textblock>
      Dolutegravir (DTG, GSK1349572) is an integrase inhibitor that is currently in Phase 3&#xD;
      clinical development for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.&#xD;
      Co-infection with Hepatitis C (HCV) is common in HIV-infected subjects therefore it is&#xD;
      expected that DTG will be coadministered with treatments for HCV. Boceprevir (BCV) and&#xD;
      Telaprevir (TVR) are protease inhibitors for the treatment of HCV that were recently approved&#xD;
      by the Food and Drug Administration/European Medicines Agency (FDA/EMA) and have rapidly been&#xD;
      adopted to &quot;standard of care&quot; in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavarin. This is&#xD;
      a single-center, open-label, two-cohort, two-period, one-way, study in healthy adult&#xD;
      subjects. A total of approximately 32 subjects will be enrolled, in order to obtain 24&#xD;
      evaluable subjects (12 per cohort). In the first treatment period, all subjects will receive&#xD;
      DTG 50 mg once daily for 5 days (treatment A). In period 2, subjects will receive DTG 50 mg&#xD;
      once daily plus either BCV 800 mg q8h (treatment B) for 10 days or TVR 750 mg q8h (treatment&#xD;
      C) for 10 days. There will be no washout between treatments. Safety evaluations and serial PK&#xD;
      samples will be collected during each treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have a screening visit within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug,&#xD;
      two treatment periods, and a follow-up visit 7-14 days after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted at one center in the US, with healthy adult male and female&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
