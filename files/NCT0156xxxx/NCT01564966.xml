      -  A reduce in renal mass may result in remnant single nephron hyperfiltration, with&#xD;
           associated proteinuria and an accelerated loss of kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Live-donor kidney transplantation is generally considered the best choice for patients&#xD;
           who have renal failure and are awaiting transplantation, because these kidneys function&#xD;
           better than kidneys from deceased donors, and waiting times for deceased-donor&#xD;
           transplants are long&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Although several studies have shown that kidney donation has low short-term morbidity&#xD;
           and mortality, the data on long-term outcomes are much less complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study is designed to prospectively evaluate the effects of unilateral nephrectomy&#xD;
           on cardiovascular-renal functions of donors after living kidney donation: the&#xD;
           development of hypertension, albuminuria, renal failure, inflammatory and endothelial&#xD;
           changes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal dysfunction is associated with accelerated cardiovascular disease even when kidney&#xD;
      function is only mildly impaired. Besides, even levels of urinary albumin excretion below the&#xD;
      accepted threshold for microalbuminuria are associated with increased cardiovascular risk,&#xD;
      and the risk increases as the degree of proteinuria rises.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Live-donor kidney transplantation is generally considered the best choice for patients&#xD;
           who have renal failure and are awaiting transplantation, because these kidneys function&#xD;
           better than kidneys from deceased donors, and waiting times for deceased-donor&#xD;
           transplants are long. Although several studies have shown that kidney donation has low&#xD;
           short-term morbidity and mortality, the data on long-term outcomes are much less&#xD;
           complete. The short and long term renal functions of donors after kidney donation were&#xD;
           much studied and still remain uncertain, the cardiovascular effects of reduction in&#xD;
           renal mass in kidney donors is also not clearly known.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endothelial dysfunction (ED) is the first step for subsequent development of&#xD;
           atherosclerosis, which can help us to assess the cardiovascular changes after kidney&#xD;
           donation. Prospectively examining the endothelial consequences of uninephrectomy in&#xD;
           donors may provide useful insight into the existence and pathophysiology of&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease in donors and, therefore, into how the cardiovascular disease&#xD;
           risk associated with renal impairment might eventually be reduced.&#xD;
