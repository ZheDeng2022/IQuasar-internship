    <description>AVI-7288 is a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer with positive charges (PMOplusâ„¢) that targets Marburg virus nucleoprotein (NP). AVI-7288 is supplied in 5 mL vials containing 5 mL AVI-7288 at a concentration of 50 mg/mL. The dose levels of AVI-7288 will vary in four cohort's.</description>
