  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study consists on determining whether melatonin decreases oxidative stress in Barrett's&#xD;
      esophageal mucosa after 6 months of treatment. In order to achieve the clinical trial, the&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to two possible arms: omeprazole alone or omeprazole plus&#xD;
      melatonin. The patients will be followed around four visits during six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GERD is one of the most prevalent pathologies in the digestive tract. Barrett's esophagus, a&#xD;
      complication of chronic GERD, has attracted the attention of researchers due to its condition&#xD;
      of pre-neoplastic lesion. At present, treatment of Barrett's patients is limited to acid&#xD;
      inhibition with PPIs. Although there are several studies which indicate that treatment with&#xD;
      PPIs could decrease the incidence of high grade dysplasia and EAC, treatment with PPIs does&#xD;
      not eliminate the risk of EAC in these patients. Therefore, it is necessary to find&#xD;
      chemo-preventive agents that stop neoplastic progression of Barrett's esophagus. Among them,&#xD;
      antioxidants have become the most promising agent. This pilot study will determine the&#xD;
      efficacy of melatonin in the chemoprevention of EAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, the main objective of this study is to determine whether melatonin decreases oxidative&#xD;
      stress in Barrett's esophageal mucosa after 6 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate whether melatonin modifies other mechanisms associated to neoplastic progression&#xD;
      in BE patients: proliferation and apoptotic index and molecular markers of progression:&#xD;
      17pLOH, 9pLOH, p16 methylation and DNA ploidy (tetraploidy and/or aneuploidy).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a chronic disease secondary to the presence of stomach acid into&#xD;
      the esophagus. This atypical situation produces an inflammation and ulceration of the distal&#xD;
      esophagus mucosa. It is the main factor predisposing to the development of esophageal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma, which has a very poor prognosis. At present, therapy of Barrett's esophagus&#xD;
      is based on acid secretion inhibition with proton pump inhibitors, which is a very effective&#xD;
      therapy to reduce gastroesophageal reflux. However, this therapy does not completely&#xD;
      eliminate this risk. Therefore, the better way to follow this disorder is to perform periodic&#xD;
      upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsies. Therefore, it is necessary to find new&#xD;
      chemo-preventive agents that avoid more efficiently the neoplastic progression of BE. New&#xD;
      advances in knowledge about BE suggest that antioxidants could be used to reduce the disorder&#xD;
      development. These drugs are being used for long time ago in different pathologies in a lot&#xD;
      of countries. One of these drugs is melatonin, which combines several characteristics that&#xD;
      suggest it could be the most suitable antioxidant. It has no adverse effects reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that meet the following characteristics will be included in this clinical study:&#xD;
      Patients (males and females) with Barrett's esophagus (&gt;18 years and &lt;80) without macroscopic&#xD;
      esophagitis at endoscopy and a length of the metaplasic mucosa of 2 cm or longer. By the same&#xD;
      way, patients will be excluded of the study if present carcinoma or high grade dysplasia at&#xD;
      basal endoscopy, previous gastric or esophageal surgery, patients on NSAID or aspirin&#xD;
      treatment, neoplastic malignancies, hematological serious diseases (coagulation disorders and&#xD;
      anemia with Hb &lt; 9.5 gr/dL), serious/moderate cardiac, liver or renal diseases, need of&#xD;
      corticosteroid therapy (a minimum of 5 days per month is allowed, as well as topical or&#xD;
      inhaled treatment), patients on misoprostol or anticoagulants, patients with inflammatory&#xD;
      bowel disease and allergy to investigational drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, who agree to participate in the study and meet criteria, will be randomized to one&#xD;
      of the two following therapies: omeprazole alone or omeprazole + Circadin (melatonin.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention hardly produces any adverse effects, the most frequent adverse effects of&#xD;
      proton pump inhibitors are headache and stomach ache. For melatonin has not reported any&#xD;
      adverse effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be done in the Hospital Clinico Lozano Blesa (Zaragoza, Spain), promoted by&#xD;
      the Health Science Aragon Institute and its principal investigator is Angel Lanas Arbeloa&#xD;
      (Digestive Disease Service). It will start in March-april 2012 and will finish 12 months&#xD;
      later approximately. The study sponsor is I+CS (Aragon Institute of Health Sciences) that&#xD;
      carries the cost of the trial.&#xD;
