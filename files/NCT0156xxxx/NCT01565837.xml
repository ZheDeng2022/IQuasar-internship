  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if precisely-targeted radiation therapy, known as&#xD;
      stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SART), given during treatment with the drug ipilimumab&#xD;
      (Yervoy) will improve survival for patients with melanoma that has spread to five or fewer&#xD;
      sites (oligometastatic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected for research purposes. Planned studies include exploration of&#xD;
      certain gene mutations and serum markers as predictors of response to ipilimumab treatment.&#xD;
      Research lab studies will also evaluate if circulating tumor cells (CTC) can be accurately&#xD;
      detected and isolated from the blood using novel laboratory techniques and if they are a&#xD;
      prognostic/predictive marker for treatment response. Test results will not be given to&#xD;
      participants or their physicians. In some cases, CTC may be grown for long-term cell lines&#xD;
      for further research.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effectiveness of concurrent ipilimumab therapy and SART of melanoma&#xD;
           based on 1-year and 2-year overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of concurrent ipilimumab therapy and SART of&#xD;
           melanoma based on CTCAE grading of toxicities, and to identify any novel or unexpected&#xD;
           Grade 3 or 4 toxicities thought specifically related to ipilimumab and concurrent SART&#xD;
           during first 3 cycles of ipilimumab therapy (prior to week 9) in a Phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the 1-year and 2-year disease control rates (CR+PR+SD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess treatment response based on Immune Related Response Criteria (irRC) and mWHO&#xD;
           criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Characterize overall survival by Kaplan-Meier analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate individual lesion control (&lt;25% progression) following body SART at 6, 12, 24&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Describe number of patients requiring retreatment of any local lesion with surgery or&#xD;
           other treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Describe the incidence of new brain metastases following ipilimumab therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Describe the incidence of treatment related toxicity and/or symptomatic bleeding,&#xD;
           perforation, or necrosis at SART treated tumor sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Explore the use of circulating melanoma cells and serum metastasis gene expression&#xD;
           levels as prognostic and predictive (intermediate) markers to identify responding&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Assess the effect of therapy on quality of life, using ECOG score as a surrogate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ipilimumab may markedly enhance the immunologic responses to tumor antigen released from&#xD;
      necrotic tumor cells by radiotherapy by promoting cytotoxic T cell activation, while&#xD;
      preventing induction of antigen tolerance. In addition, further beneficial immunologic&#xD;
      effects may be achieved by the reduction in the amount of viable tumor cell mass. The net&#xD;
      effect may be to promote a significantly enhanced antitumor T cell response. This will result&#xD;
      in improved 1-year and 2-year survival, especially if a minimal or microscopic disease state&#xD;
      can be achieved within a patient following SART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biologic Correlation Studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently no standard prognostic or predictive markers to evaluate or predict&#xD;
      outcome of ipilimumab therapy. This study provides the opportunity for exploratory analysis&#xD;
      of several candidate hypotheses that may predict outcome.&#xD;
