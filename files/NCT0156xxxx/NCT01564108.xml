  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatments show great promise in the treatment&#xD;
      of a variety of retinal diseases. This study addresses a condition which affects a large&#xD;
      number of our patients in whom the investigators face difficult management decisions. These&#xD;
      patients with uveitis are severely disabled with visual loss related to cystoid macular&#xD;
      oedema (CMO) and few options remain when standard treatment has either failed or is&#xD;
      contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concentration of VEGF is increased in the eyes of patients with uveitis. Our hypothesis&#xD;
      is that a series of injections of Ranibizumab may be an effective treatment for CMO. It is&#xD;
      hoped that anti-VEGF therapy will have fewer side-effects than existing therapies and will be&#xD;
      more effective in improving quality of life by reducing macular thickening and restoring&#xD;
      visual function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has been designed as an open label, prospective non-randomised interventional case&#xD;
      series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical staff will be asked to briefly discuss the option of enrolling into the study with&#xD;
      potentially suitable patients. If the patient expresses an interest in finding out more about&#xD;
      the study, the doctor will then contact a member of the study team, who will provide the&#xD;
      patient with the patient information leaflet. This outlines the details and purpose of the&#xD;
      study, the intended benefits of the intravitreal treatment and the potential hazards&#xD;
      (including the unlicensed use of Ranibizumab for this indication). The intravitreal injection&#xD;
      procedure will be discussed. The follow-up schedule will be outlined. There will be an&#xD;
      opportunity for the patient to ask questions and at least 24 hours for the patient to think&#xD;
      about entering the study. Only 1 eye of each patient, the worse eye, will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive pre- and post- therapy and a longitudinal series of structure and function&#xD;
      tests will be performed on all 20 enrolled patients. All patients will receive intravitreal&#xD;
      injections performed in a designated clean room. The injections (Ranibizumab 0.5 mg in 0.05&#xD;
      ml) will be administered 4-5 weekly, for three injections then according to clinical need for&#xD;
      a total of 12 months of follow-up. A maximum of 5 intravitreal Ranibizumab injections will be&#xD;
      administered to patients who do not demonstrate any positive clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be seen for baseline screening over a 2 day period, with the first&#xD;
      treatment with Ranibizumab administered on the second day (maximum of 10 working days after&#xD;
      the first baseline screening day). Subsequent to the first 3 injections, the investigator&#xD;
      will assess whether re-treatment is warranted (clinical / OCT criteria set out in&#xD;
      re-treatment protocol). Re-treatment, when indicated, will be performed on the same day as&#xD;
      the follow-up visit and no sooner than 4 weeks or later than 5 weeks from the time of the&#xD;
      last treatment. If re-treatment with IVI Ranibizumab is to be deferred patients will not be&#xD;
      given a sham injection. Should a relapse in ocular inflammation occur, it might be difficult&#xD;
      to differentiate as to whether this is because of the drug or the underlying disease. A mild&#xD;
      flare up, Lucentis-related or not, may be observed and treated with topical therapy (but&#xD;
      patient will remain in the study). A moderate to severe recurrence, regardless of the cause&#xD;
      which will necessitate more extensive therapy, namely a change or addition of systemic&#xD;
      therapy, will result in the patient exiting the study-this would be an end point.&#xD;
