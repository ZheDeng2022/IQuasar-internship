      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the Calcium homeostasis in adult patients with&#xD;
      uncontrolled acromegaly. The measurements will be repeated 3-6 months after the treatment of&#xD;
      acromegaly (surgical or medical). The control group consists of patients with nonfunctioning&#xD;
      pituitary tumors who will undergo surgical removal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Calcitriol is the active form of vitamin D. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is secreted by the&#xD;
      parathyroid glands in the neck. Both these chemicals are responsible for keeping the levels&#xD;
      of calcium and phosphorous normal and also play a role in bone health. They can be measured&#xD;
      in the blood. In some disorders, PTH or calcitriol levels are elevated, which results in&#xD;
      increased calcium absorption from the gut, increased calcium in the bloodstream, and&#xD;
      increased calcium excretion in the urine. Increased calcium in the urine can lead to the&#xD;
      development of kidney stones. Increased calcium in the bloodstream can have adverse effects&#xD;
      on the heart, gut, kidneys, and bones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acromegaly is a condition where a pituitary tumor secretes excessive amounts of growth&#xD;
      hormone. Patients with acromegaly have been found to have a higher prevalence of kidney&#xD;
      stones, urinary calcium, and serum calcium when compared to normal adults. The reason for&#xD;
      this is unknown but a suggested mechanism is that growth hormone stimulates the production of&#xD;
      calcitriol or PTH. If this is true, then treatment of acromegaly resulting in lower growth&#xD;
      hormone levels should also result in lower blood and urine calcium levels. The investigators&#xD;
      want to see if patients with acromegaly have high calcitriol, and vitamin D binding protein,&#xD;
      or PTH levels and see if they change after treatment of the condition. The investigators also&#xD;
      want to assess the amount of calcium in the urine, before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with acromegaly may have disorders of bone health. The reason for this is unknown&#xD;
      but a suggested mechanism is that growth hormone affects bone remodeling. The investigators&#xD;
      want to see if patients with acromegaly have abnormal bone markers, specifically PINP, CTX,&#xD;
      and TRAP, and to see if they change after treatment of the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to see if the results are specific to patients with acromegaly, the investigators&#xD;
      also want to check these levels in patients who do not have acromegaly, but have a&#xD;
      &quot;nonfunctioning&quot; pituitary tumor. A nonfunctioning pituitary tumor is one that does not&#xD;
      secrete excessive hormones in the bloodstream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe baseline calcitriol/PTH status in patients with uncontrolled acromegaly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the change in calcitriol/PTH levels after treatment with acromegaly (surgical&#xD;
           or medical).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the calcium and calcitriol/PTH levels in patients with acromegaly compared&#xD;
           to patients with nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a voluntary study. Adult patients with a diagnosis of acromegaly or a clinically&#xD;
      nonfunctioning pituitary tumor receiving treatment at the Emory University Pituitary center&#xD;
      will be given the opportunity to enroll in the study. Those that agree to participate will&#xD;
      need to give written informed consent. Approximately 3 tablespoons (44ml) of blood will be&#xD;
      drawn at enrollment for testing of vitamin D status and parathyroid hormone. If patients are&#xD;
      already undergoing a blood draw for standard laboratory tests, then the volume of 44ml of&#xD;
      blood will be obtained at the same time in order to avoid an additional needle stick. In&#xD;
      addition, a 24-hour urine collection will be obtained to assess the amount of calcium present&#xD;
      in the urine. Please note that medical or surgical therapy for your pituitary condition is&#xD;
      determined by your endocrinologist and/or neurosurgeon and not part of the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 6 months after treatment for pituitary treatment is initiated, when patients return to&#xD;
      Emory University pituitary clinic for routine visit, laboratory data (vitamin D and&#xD;
      parathyroid hormone) and repeat urine studies (24 hour urine collection) will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The confidentiality will be respected in all encounters. No personal identifiers are&#xD;
      disclosed in any publications. Hard copy data will be kept securely in a locked office&#xD;
      building with limited access and electronic data will always be password protected with&#xD;
      access available to study personnel only. If abnormal results are discovered as part of&#xD;
      testing done for this study, those results will be released to the patient's primary&#xD;
      physician. All patients will be undergoing standard therapy for their pituitary disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of this study may have important implications for future studies that are designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the mechanism of how growth hormone may increase calcitriol levels.&#xD;
