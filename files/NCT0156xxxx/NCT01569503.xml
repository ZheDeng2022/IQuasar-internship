    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel diseases or IBD (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) are chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases involving the digestive tract, in particular the small bowel and/or the&#xD;
      recto-colon. IBD represent a public health problem in Gastroenterology. The etiopathogeny of&#xD;
      IBD is multifactorial involving immunological, genetic, infectious and environmental factors.&#xD;
      An overarching hypothesis is that an unbalance of the autonomic nervous system, represented&#xD;
      by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system (e.g. the vagus nerve) is part of the&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of IBD. A dysautonomia has been observed in IBD&#xD;
      patients and we have recently demonstrated that this dysautonomia was linked to psychological&#xD;
      coping, in particular in Crohn's disease. Classically, the vagus nerve, a mixed nerve, has an&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory role through its central afferents which secondarily stimulate the&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis. Recent data have shown that the anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties of the vagus nerve also involve peripheral efferents via an interaction of&#xD;
      acetylcholine with nicotinic receptors leading to an inhibition of TNF release by&#xD;
      macrophages. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is currently used for the treatment of some forms&#xD;
      of epilepsy in Human via a stimulation of vagal afferents. We have recently validated a model&#xD;
      of chronic VNS (3h/d for 5 days) in freely moving rats by stimulating vagal efferents and we&#xD;
      have studied the anti-inflammatory properties of VNS in an experimental model of colitis in&#xD;
      rats. VNS significantly decreased body weight loss due to colitis and had an&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effect by decreasing a multivariate index of inflammation. To date, medical&#xD;
      treatment of IBD (e.g. 5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunosuppressives or&#xD;
      biotherapies i.e. anti-TNF) is only suspensive. The aim of our project is to propose another&#xD;
      type of anti-inflammatory treatment based on neurostimulation of vagal efferents. For this&#xD;
      purpose, we aim to perform a pilot study in 10 patients with moderate to severe Crohn's&#xD;
      disease despite a reference treatment (corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressives) using the&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory properties of VNS as an alternative to anti-TNF therapy. Central and&#xD;
      peripheral effect of VNS will be also evaluated by electroencephalographic and sympatho-vagal&#xD;
      (heart rate variability) recordings. The finality, at term, is to use VNS as an alternative&#xD;
      to the conventional anti-TNF therapy not devoid of side effects, in particular infectious,&#xD;
      with the advantage to use an intrinsic anti-inflammatory (anti-TNF) system and to take cover&#xD;
      of problems of adherence to treatment which are frequently observed in the medical treatment&#xD;
      of IBD.&#xD;

    <description>VNS therapy consists of an implanted pacemaker-like device that delivers mild, intermittently pulsed signals to the patient's left vagus nerve. Roughly the size of a small pocket-watch and weighing less than one ounce, the pulse generator is implanted in the patient's left chest area. A thin thread-like wire, attached to the generator, runs under the skin to the left vagus nerve in the neck</description>
