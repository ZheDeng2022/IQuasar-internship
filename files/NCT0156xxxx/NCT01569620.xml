  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study seeks to investigate the impact of a culturally targeted print educational&#xD;
      intervention on rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening via colonoscopy among Hispanics.&#xD;
      If, as expected, the addition of culturally targeted materials to best clinical practices as&#xD;
      compared to a) best clinical practices plus standard materials or b) best clinical practices&#xD;
      alone leads to higher rates of CRC screening via colonoscopy then the culturally targeted&#xD;
      print educational materials can be easily disseminated among this rapidly growing minority&#xD;
      group who have low rates of CRC screening and whose disease is detected at later, less&#xD;
      curable stages.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CRC is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death among Hispanic women and men. Hispanics are more&#xD;
      likely to be diagnosed at more advanced disease stages compared to non-Hispanic whites and&#xD;
      have a lower probability of survival. A key way to decrease mortality from CRC among&#xD;
      Hispanics is to increase rates of CRC screening and thereby early detection of CRC. To&#xD;
      address low screening rates, thereby increasing the prevention and early detection of CRC,&#xD;
      the proposed research seeks to increase CRC colonoscopy screening among Hispanics. The&#xD;
      primary aim is to investigate the impact of a culturally targeted print educational&#xD;
      intervention designed to increase CRC screening via colonoscopy in a diverse group of&#xD;
      Hispanics 50 years of age and older. Our long standing (since 1999) research platform has&#xD;
      included significant community input through ongoing meetings with our Community Advisory&#xD;
      Board (CAB) soliciting their viewpoints and concerns. In addition, we consult with key&#xD;
      community members on an ongoing basis for additional input. A Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT)&#xD;
      will be conducted with 400 Hispanics within the context of the best clinical practices&#xD;
      currently provided at Mount Sinai. There are three study arms: 1) best clinical practices&#xD;
      plus culturally relevant print materials, 2) best clinical practices plus standard print&#xD;
      materials and 3) best clinical practices alone. These three arms will allow the investigation&#xD;
      of the addition of print materials and the comparison of culturally relevant to standard&#xD;
      print materials to assess the differential impact of each print format. This comparison&#xD;
      controls for the possible benefit of adding standard print materials to best clinical&#xD;
      practices and allows for investigation of the additional benefit of culturally targeted&#xD;
      relevant materials over and above that of standard materials. Further, by including feedback&#xD;
      from the community, we will be able to clearly understand the benefits of, and be able to&#xD;
      disseminate culturally targeted materials among this rapidly growing minority group. If, as&#xD;
      hypothesized, the addition of the culturally targeted print materials leads to higher rates&#xD;
      of colonoscopy, they can then be easily disseminated among health care settings treating&#xD;
      Hispanics.&#xD;
