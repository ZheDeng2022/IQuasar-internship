  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the major causes not only of mortality, but of disease burden worldwide,&#xD;
      because of residual disability and cognitive decline. Although blood pressure lowering has&#xD;
      been clearly shown to be the most effective means for primary and secondary prevention of&#xD;
      stroke, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels to achieve by treatment in order to optimize&#xD;
      prevention results are unknown, and whether SBP levels lower than those usually recommended&#xD;
      are accompanied by further or reduced benefits is undecided yet. Likewise, while low-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering by statins has been shown to be associated with&#xD;
      primary and secondary stroke prevention, whether more intense lowering is or is not of&#xD;
      further benefit is unknown. The Stroke in Hypertension Optimal Treatment Trial (ESH-CHL-SHOT)&#xD;
      is a factorial 3 x 2 arm, multicenter, randomized clinical trial designed to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that in elderly patients at high risk of recurrent stroke (previous recent stroke&#xD;
      or TIA) antihypertensive treatment programs aimed at reducing SBP to the usually recommended&#xD;
      values (&lt; 145 to 135 mmHg), to a lower goal (&lt; 135 to 125 mmHg) or to even lower values (&lt;&#xD;
      125 mmHg) will result in progressively greater reductions in recurrent stroke, incidence of&#xD;
      cardiovascular outcomes and cognitive decline. Parallely, the preventive efficacy of more and&#xD;
      less intense LDL-C reductions will be tested on the same outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ESH-CHL-SHOT will randomize about 7500 participants aged &gt; or = 65 years with SBP &gt; or = 140&#xD;
      mmHg or antihypertensive therapy, who have presented a stroke or TIA, within 1 to 6 months&#xD;
      before randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will investigate&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the effects of randomization to antihypertensive treatment of different intensities,&#xD;
           aiming at three different SBP targets. SBP targets are &lt; 145 to 135, &lt; 135 to 125, &lt; 125&#xD;
           mmHg, with approximate mean inter-target differences of 8 mmHg;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the effects of randomization to lipid lowering treatment of different intensity, aiming&#xD;
           at two different LDL-C targets. Targets are 2.8 to 1.8 mmol/l (110 to 70 mg/dl) and &lt;&#xD;
           1.8 mmol/l;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. possible interactions between antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatments. The&#xD;
           primary hypothesis is that recurrent stroke rates will be 25% lower in the lowest vs&#xD;
           intermediate SBP target group, 25% lower in the intermediate vs higher SBP target group,&#xD;
           and 20% lower in the lower vs higher LDL-C target group. Sample size has been calculated&#xD;
           to provide a 80% power with a significance of 5% after corrections for repetitive&#xD;
           measurements on the assumption that stroke incidence will be 4% per year in the highest&#xD;
           SBP target group. Participants will be recruited at approximately 250 clinics in Europe&#xD;
           (2500 patients) and China (5000 patients) over a 2-year period, and will be followed up&#xD;
           for an average of 4 years or until 925 recurrent strokes occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arms and assigned intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Antihypertensive treatment design and assigned treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated to one of three different sitting SBP targets:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. &lt; 145 to 135 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. &lt; 135 to 125 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. &lt; 125 mmHg to be possibly achieved within 3 months and subsequently maintained within&#xD;
           the target window.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are free to choose the drugs (among those approved in each country) to be&#xD;
      administered to individual patients. It is expected that patients already on antihypertensive&#xD;
      therapy and with SBP at randomization not too far from target will be maintained on current&#xD;
      therapy with suitable adjustments. Other patients (untreated or with SBP far from target) may&#xD;
      follow a suggested treatment algorithm of progressive increase in number of compounds or&#xD;
      doses. During follow-up visits drugs and/or doses will be modified if necessary to maintain&#xD;
      patients within randomized target window.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Lipid-lowering treatment design and assigned treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two different LDL-C targets:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) 2.8 to 1.8 mmol/l (110 to 70 mg/dl) B) &lt; 1.8 mmol/l (&lt; 70 mg/dl) to be possibly achieved&#xD;
      within 3 months and subsequently maintained within the target window.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are free to choose the statin (among those approved in each country) to be&#xD;
      administered to individual patients. The initial statin dose should be chosen by the&#xD;
      investigator according to LDL-C at randomization and the LDL-C target. The initial dose can&#xD;
      be increased (to the maximum dose allowed in each country) or decreased until the LDL-C&#xD;
      target is achieved possibly within 3 months, and further adjusted up or down at 6-month&#xD;
      intervals in order to maintain LDL-C within the randomized target window.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Qualifying event: stroke or TIA 1 to 6 months previous to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients should have a CT scan or MRI (preferably MRI) at screening. The CT scan&#xD;
             or MRI carried out at the time of the qualifying event, if available, is acceptable.&#xD;
             Stroke will be defined as imaging evidence of a recent brain infarction (or&#xD;
             haemorrhage) independently of duration of clinical symptoms, or as duration of&#xD;
             clinical symptoms &gt; 24 h even in absence of imaging evidence of lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  TIA as clinical symptoms (involving limbs or speech) lasting &lt; 24 h without imaging&#xD;
             evidence of infarction. Enrolling units should avoid enrolling patients with TIA in a&#xD;
             proportion greater than 25% of enrolled patients. The general coordinators in Milan&#xD;
             and Beijing may decide stopping enrolment of TIA patients if their proportion is&#xD;
             becoming greater than expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A haemorrhagic stroke (1 to 6 months previously) is also a qualifying event, but only&#xD;
             for the BP-lowering component of the trial (see Exclusion criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: 65 years and above. No fixed upper age limit is introduced, but frail patients&#xD;
             aged above 80 years should not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gender: either gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BP: Only hypertensive patients: untreated patients with SBP ≥140 mmHg; patients on&#xD;
             antihypertensive treatment with any BP (but see exclusion criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  LDL-C: Patients without statin treatment with LDL-C &gt; 2.8 mmol/l; patients on statin&#xD;
             treatment with any LDL-C value (but see exclusion criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Antiplatelet therapy: All patients should be under antiplatelet therapy (agents and&#xD;
             doses chosen by the investigator according to accepted guidelines), unless&#xD;
             contraindicated. Anticoagulant (instead of antiplatelet) therapy whenever indicated&#xD;
             (e.g. atrial fibrillation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Qualifying event:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients in unstable clinical conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Clinical disturbances caused by non-stroke pathology&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. patients with haemodynamically significant carotid stenosis or requiring carotid&#xD;
                  revascularization&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. haemorrhagic stroke is an exclusion criterion for the lipid lowering component of&#xD;
                  the trial; however, these patients should be randomized to the BP component, but&#xD;
                  considered in addition to the number of patients requested to each enrolling&#xD;
                  unit, in order not to decrease the power of the lipid-lowering component.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BP: - known secondary hypertension;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SBP &gt;140 mmHg under three antihypertensive drugs at full doses (these patients are&#xD;
             unlikely to achieve SBP &lt; 125 mmHg, if so randomized);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  orthostatic hypotension (SBP fall &gt; 25 mmHg on standing);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  LDL-C: - LDL-C &gt;2.8 mmol/l under full dose of a statin (these patients are unlikely to&#xD;
             achieve LDL-C targets).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  LDL-C &gt; 4.5 mmol/l under low dose of a statin or untreated (these patients are&#xD;
             unlikely to achieve the lower LDL-C target).&#xD;

          -  Dementia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe disability (modified Rankin scale &gt; 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe chronic renal failure defined as serum creatinine &gt; 250 micromol/l&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatic disease as determined by either AST or ALT values &gt; 2 times the upper limit of&#xD;
             normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices or portocaval shunt&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of gastrointestinal surgery or disorders which could interfere with drug&#xD;
             absorption&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy or contraindications to one of the drugs to be administered in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of malignancy including leukaemia and lymphoma (but not basal cell skin&#xD;
             cancer) within the last 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of clinically significant autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus&#xD;
             erythematosus&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse within the last 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of non-compliance to medical regimens and/or patients who are considered&#xD;
             potentially unreliable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability or unwillingness to give free informed consent&#xD;
