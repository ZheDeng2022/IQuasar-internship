    <textblock>
      Patients with breast cancer, who are treated with curative intent, have a combination of&#xD;
      surgery (excision of the tumor) and a course of medical therapy (chemotherapy or endocrine&#xD;
      treatment). Both treatments are associated with significant side effects. Chemotherapy is&#xD;
      associated with nausea, vomiting, hair loss and bone marrow suppression, whereas endocrine&#xD;
      therapy is associated with arthritis and menopausal symptoms. Patients taking either&#xD;
      chemotherapy or endocrine treatment may experience a range of side effects. The range and&#xD;
      severity of side effects experienced vary from patient to patient. Little or nothing is known&#xD;
      about the reason for this difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the investigators proposal is to develop a pretreatment test to identify patients&#xD;
      who are likely to undergo moderate to severe side effects, and therefore help doctors and&#xD;
      patients plan and optimize medical therapy. The pretreatment test will be based on&#xD;
      identifying a metabolic profile which can differentiate those patients who are likely to have&#xD;
      severe or moderate side effects from those with either no or mild side effects. To do this,&#xD;
      the investigators will take urine and blood samples from patients before and after the&#xD;
      administration of endocrine treatment or chemotherapy and generate metabolic profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators aim to gain an understanding into why side effects experienced&#xD;
      between different patients are so variable. To do this the investigators plan to perform&#xD;
      cytokine analysis, targeted genetic analysis and pharmaokinetic analysis on blood sample&#xD;
      collected from patients before and after treatment has commenced. Patients who have planned&#xD;
      surgical excision of tumor and are recommended to receive medical therapy before or after&#xD;
      surgery would be invited to join the study. Each patient will be required to make additional&#xD;
      visits to the hospital to complete questionnaires regarding side effects experienced and for&#xD;
      sample (urine and blood) collection. The investigators plan to recruit 168 patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with breast cancer are treated with a combination of surgery and medical treatment&#xD;
      (either before (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) surgery). Eligible patients will be&#xD;
      identified by the oncologist and from the multidisciplinary meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once eligible patients have been identified they will be informed of the study by their&#xD;
      oncologist, and then approached by the research team who will give them a patient information&#xD;
      leaflet, discuss the study, answer any questions and ask the patient to sign a consent form&#xD;
      if they are would like to participate in the study. The consent form must be signed before&#xD;
      any study related procedures are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have had surgery prior to receiving medical treatment (i.e. patients planned to&#xD;
      receive adjuvant treatment, or patients who have a sentinel lymph node biopsy prior to&#xD;
      starting neoadjuvant treatment) will have blood and urine samples taken before they have&#xD;
      their surgery, at the preassessment surgical appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The week before the patient starts medical therapy (either chemotherapy or endocrine&#xD;
      treatment) the patient will need to attend Charing Cross Hospital for the following&#xD;
      procedures (this may be an extra visit, depending on hospital appointments):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To see the study doctor for a medical history and physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulse and blood pressure measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMI (body mass index) and body fat assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To fill out a quality of life (QOL) questionnaire with research staff&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine blood tests (for haematology and biochemistry)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample for metabolic profiling and cytokine analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine sample for metabolic profiling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The blood taken will additionally be tested for targeted genetic analysis if the patient&#xD;
           has consented for this (as this is optional)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be asked to return to Charing Cross Hospital 24 hours later after an&#xD;
      overnight fast for (this will be an extra visit): • Fasted blood and urine samples for&#xD;
      metabolic profiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to get fasted samples from patients, as diet influences the metabolic&#xD;
      profile. Therefore to try to eliminate diet as a confounder it is important to get a fasted&#xD;
      sample. Additionally, at the time of collection of blood and urine samples for metabolic&#xD;
      profile analysis patients will be asked when they last ate, what they last ate and any&#xD;
      specific dietary preferences/requirements (i.e. vegetarian, gluten free diet).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further tests differ depending on whether the patient is receiving chemotherapy or endocrine&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving chemotherapy have 6 cycles, each cycle last 21 days. There are two types&#xD;
      of chemotherapy given for breast cancer which are FEC (6 cycles of 5fluorouracil, epirubicin&#xD;
      and cyclophosphamide) or FECD (3 cycles of 5fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      followed by 3 cycles of docetaxel). Patients receiving all types of chemotherapy (FEC and&#xD;
      FECD) patients will be required to attend at the following time for procedures are explained&#xD;
      below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cycle 1, day 2&#xD;
&#xD;
           o 24 hours after the patient received their chemotherapy treatment we will take urine&#xD;
           and blood samples for metabolic profiling, and blood samples for routine blood tests&#xD;
           (haematology and biochemistry) and cytokine analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At this time the patient will also be asked to fill out 2 questionnaires with&#xD;
                research staff - the first will be adverse effects experienced (questions from&#xD;
                CTCAEv4.0), and the second will be a QOL questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  This will be an extra visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cycle 2, day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prior to receiving their next cycle of chemotherapy urine and blood samples will be&#xD;
                taken for metabolic profiling. Blood samples will be taken for routine tests&#xD;
                (haematology and biochemistry) and for cytokine analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Two questionnaires (questionnaire based on adverse effects experienced and QOL&#xD;
                questionnaire) will be completed with research staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A blood sample will be taken after 10 minutes chemotherapy infusion has finished.&#xD;
                Pharmacokinetic analysis for 5FU will be conducted on this sample. If possible the&#xD;
                sample will be taken from the cannula through which the chemotherapy medication was&#xD;
                administered (the first 10mls will need to be discarded to avoid contamination).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  This will not be an extra visit if there has been no change to planned This will&#xD;
                not be an extra visit if there has been no change to planned treatment schedule. If&#xD;
                patients have consented for optional pharmacokinetic analysis the following sample&#xD;
                will also be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cycle 2, day 1 (optional assessment)&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Three blood samples will be taken during the following 4 hours for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
           analysis of cylophosphamide and epirubicin. If possible all samples will be taken from&#xD;
           the cannula through which the chemotherapy was administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cycle 2, day 2 (optional assessment) o A blood sample will be taken 24 hours after the&#xD;
           chemotherapy was given for pharmacokinetic analysis of cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cycle 2, day 3 (optional assessment)&#xD;
&#xD;
           o A blood sample will be taken 48 hours after the chemotherapy was given for&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  This will be an extra visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients are on FECD chemotherapy, they will attend at the above time points, but they&#xD;
      will additionally be asked to attend after their docetaxel has commenced. This is required to&#xD;
      test whether docetaxel has a different reaction in the body to the previous chemotherapy&#xD;
      given. Patients will be asked to attend at the following time points for the following&#xD;
      procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cycle 4, day 2&#xD;
&#xD;
           o 24 hours after the patient received their chemotherapy treatment we will take urine&#xD;
           and blood samples for metabolic profiling, and blood samples for routine blood tests&#xD;
           (haematology and biochemistry) and cytokine analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Two questionnaires (questionnaire based on adverse effects experienced and QOL&#xD;
           questionnaire) will be completed with research staff&#xD;

      also be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Cycle 5, day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      o A blood sample will be taken at the end of the chemotherapy infusion and 6 hours after the&#xD;
      infusion completed. If possible the blood samples will be taken from the cannula (the first&#xD;
      10mls taken from the cannula will need to be discarded to avoid contamination).&#xD;
&#xD;

             -  This will be an extra visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 21&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Two questionnaires (questionnaire based on adverse effects experienced and QOL&#xD;
                questionnaire) will be completed with research staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urine and blood samples for metabolic profiling. Blood samples for routine tests&#xD;
                (haematology and biochemistry) and cytokine analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  This will be an extra visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 5 months&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Two questionnaires (questionnaire based on adverse effects experienced and QOL&#xD;
                questionnaire) will be completed with research staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  BMI (body mass index) and body fat assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A blood sample for pharmacokinetic analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  This will be an extra visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures and interviews will be conducted at Charing Cross Hospital. All patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled in the study for 5 months. However, for patients receiving chemotherapy, if there&#xD;
      has been a change in treatment schedule by the oncologist the time the patient will spend in&#xD;
      the study will be increased in accordance with changes made to treatment schedule (i.e. if&#xD;
      cycle 4 (docetaxel) is started 1 week late, then the time in the study will be 5 months and 1&#xD;
      week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment (chemotherapy or endocrine treatment before&#xD;
      surgery) we will look at imaging and pathology reports to establish how the tumour has&#xD;
      responded to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to recruit 168 patients, 84 receiving endocrine therapy (either an oestrogen receptor&#xD;
      antagonist or aromatase inhibitor) and 84 receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy (FEC or FECD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 5 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient recruitment and collection of samples (months 112)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. H NMR spectroscopic analysis and UPLMS analysis of samples (months 718)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mathematical modelling of the data (months 120)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Structural identification of candidate biomarkers (months 1822)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Write up of results and guidelines (months 2024)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be analysed and published (in both presentations and a peer reviewed&#xD;
      journal) at the end of the study. No patient identifiable information will be present in&#xD;
      these publications. As all tests are carried out for research purposes and will be of no&#xD;
      direct benefit to patients participating in this study, there are no plans to inform patients&#xD;
      of their individual results. Patients will be informed of the overall results from the study&#xD;
      that may result in a publication.&#xD;
