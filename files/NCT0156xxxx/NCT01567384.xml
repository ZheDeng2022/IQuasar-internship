  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test the safety of an experimental drug called OSI-906 when&#xD;
      combined with pemetrexed at different dose levels and to find out the optimal doses of the&#xD;
      two drugs that can be given as a combination. Pemetrexed has been widely used for treatment&#xD;
      of certain solid organ tumors and is effective and approved for use in treatment of lung&#xD;
      cancer and mesothelioma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OSI-906 is a new agent that inhibits the insulin-like growth factor receptor pathway.&#xD;
      Targeting this pathway appears to be a promising strategy to treat cancer based on laboratory&#xD;
      studies. The present study will test if this agent can be administered safely in combination&#xD;
      with pemetrexed, a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's tumor type must be appropriate for therapy with pemetrexed or have no&#xD;
             standard treatment approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have discontinued previous chemotherapy and/or radiation at least 3&#xD;
             weeks[six weeks for nitrosoureas, BCNU, or mitomycin C] prior to entry into the study&#xD;
             and recovered from any toxic effects of previous treatment. Pallative radiation&#xD;
             therapy to sites involving more than 2 weeks prior to enrollment on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status less than 2 [see Appendix A].&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be able to take oral medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  leukocytes greater than 3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  absolute neutrophil count greater than 1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  platelets greater than 100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits AST[SGOT]/ALT[SGPT]less than 2.5 x&#xD;
             institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  creatinine clearance greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine&#xD;
             levels above institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of OSI-906 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and&#xD;
             because chemotherapeutic agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial&#xD;
             are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to&#xD;
             use adequate contraception [hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence]&#xD;
             prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman&#xD;
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating&#xD;
             in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with untreated, active or symptomatic brain metastases should be excluded&#xD;
             from this clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reaction to OSI-906 or pemetrexed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit adherence with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because OSI-906 and pemetrexed are&#xD;
             anti-proliferative agents agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient&#xD;
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with OSI-906, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated OSI-906. These potential risks may also apply to&#xD;
             other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with OSI-906. In addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients&#xD;
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with QTc interval greater than 450 msec at baseline will be excluded due to&#xD;
             risk of QTc prolongation with OSI-906.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking medications that prolong the QTc interval will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with significant cardiac disease will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with fasting blood glucose greater than 150 mg/dL at baseline will be&#xD;
             excluded due to risk of hyperglycemia with OSI-906.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of drugs that have a known risk of causing Torsades de Pointes [TdP] [Torsades&#xD;
             List on www.azcert.org/medical-pros/drug-lists/bycategory.cfm, see Appendix D] are&#xD;
             prohibited within 14 days prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of the potent CYP1A2 inhibitors ciprofloxacin and fluvoxamine. Other less potent&#xD;
             CYP1A2 inhibitors/inducers are not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of poorly controlled gastrointestinal disorders that could&#xD;
             affect the absorption of study drug (eg, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, etc)&#xD;
             should be excluded.&#xD;
