      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of gefapixant (AF-219/MK-7264) in female&#xD;
      participants with moderate to severe pain associated with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain&#xD;
      syndrome (IC/BPS) after 4 weeks of treatment.&#xD;

      This study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial designed to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of gefapixant in female participants with moderate to severe pain&#xD;
      associated with IC/BPS. The study will consist of 4 phases: Screening, Baseline, Treatment,&#xD;
      and Follow-up.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Average Mean Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) Score at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The bladder pain severity was measured using 0-10 NPRS, with 0 representing 'no pain' and 10 representing 'the worst pain possible'. Participants were asked to select a number on the scale that best described the severity of bladder pain during past 24 hours over telephone using an interactive voice response system (IVRS) every evening at bedtime during the baseline assessment phase and treatment phase (up to 4 weeks). The primary analysis was conducted using a Mixed Model with Repeated Measures (MMRM) approach to calculate the Least Squares (LS) mean change from baseline in NPRS score and associated Standard Error (SE) at Week 4 for each treatment arm. Negative values indicate decrease in bladder pain severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Painful Bladder/Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Diary (PBIC-SD) Score at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the severity of bladder pain syndrome (BPS), an 8-item participant self-report PBIC-SD measure was used. Participants were asked to select a number on the scale that best described the severity of bladder pain over telephone using an IVRS each evening on the three consecutive days (during the Baseline Assessment Phase and during each Treatment Week up to 4 weeks). Each item was graded on a scale from 0 (good condition) to 4 (poor condition) with a total score range 0-32. Higher scores indicate more severe BPS. The analysis was conducted using a MMRM approach to calculate the LS mean change from baseline PBIC-SD total score and associated SE at Week 4 for each treatment arm. Negative values indicate decrease in severity of BPS.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in O'Leary-Sant Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index (ICSI) Score at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the severity of BPS (urgency and frequency of urination, nighttime urination, and pain or burning) over past month, a 4-item self-report ICSI measure was used. Participants were asked to select a number on the scale that best described the severity of symptoms over telephone using an IVRS every evening at bedtime during the baseline assessment phase and treatment phase (up to 4 weeks). The ICSI score range from 0 (Not at all) to 5 (Almost always) for the first 3 items and a score of 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Almost always) for the last item, with an index score range of 0-19. Higher scores indicate more severe BPS. The analysis was conducted using one-way ANCOVA model to calculate the LS mean change from baseline ICSI total score and associated SE at Week 4 for each treatment arm. Negative values indicate decrease in severity of BPS.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Genitourinary Pain Index (GUPI) Score at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the degree of genitourinary pain symptoms, an 8-item self-report GUPI measure was used. Participants were asked to select a number on the scale that best described the severity of symptoms over telephone using an IVRS every evening at bedtime during the baseline assessment phase and treatment phase (up to 4 weeks). The GUPI instrument yields a total score of 0-45 and 3 subscales: pain (score = 0-23), urinary (score = 0-10), and quality of life (score = 0-12). Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms. The analysis was conducted using one-way ANCOVA model to calculate the LS mean change from baseline GUPI total score and associated SE at Week 4 for each treatment arm. Negative values indicate decrease in degree of genitourinary pain symptoms.</description>

    <description>Female participants receive gefapixant, a total dose titrated from 50 mg to highest tolerated dose (maximum of 300 mg) twice daily (BID), orally over a period of 6 days with food depending on safety and tolerability, and then maintain that dose for the course of a 4-week treatment period. Participants were allowed to decrease the dose if tolerability issues occurred.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Average Mean Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) Score at Week 4</title>
        <description>The bladder pain severity was measured using 0-10 NPRS, with 0 representing 'no pain' and 10 representing 'the worst pain possible'. Participants were asked to select a number on the scale that best described the severity of bladder pain during past 24 hours over telephone using an interactive voice response system (IVRS) every evening at bedtime during the baseline assessment phase and treatment phase (up to 4 weeks). The primary analysis was conducted using a Mixed Model with Repeated Measures (MMRM) approach to calculate the Least Squares (LS) mean change from baseline in NPRS score and associated Standard Error (SE) at Week 4 for each treatment arm. Negative values indicate decrease in bladder pain severity.</description>

        <description>To assess the severity of bladder pain syndrome (BPS), an 8-item participant self-report PBIC-SD measure was used. Participants were asked to select a number on the scale that best described the severity of bladder pain over telephone using an IVRS each evening on the three consecutive days (during the Baseline Assessment Phase and during each Treatment Week up to 4 weeks). Each item was graded on a scale from 0 (good condition) to 4 (poor condition) with a total score range 0-32. Higher scores indicate more severe BPS. The analysis was conducted using a MMRM approach to calculate the LS mean change from baseline PBIC-SD total score and associated SE at Week 4 for each treatment arm. Negative values indicate decrease in severity of BPS.</description>

        <description>To measure the severity of BPS (urgency and frequency of urination, nighttime urination, and pain or burning) over past month, a 4-item self-report ICSI measure was used. Participants were asked to select a number on the scale that best described the severity of symptoms over telephone using an IVRS every evening at bedtime during the baseline assessment phase and treatment phase (up to 4 weeks). The ICSI score range from 0 (Not at all) to 5 (Almost always) for the first 3 items and a score of 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Almost always) for the last item, with an index score range of 0-19. Higher scores indicate more severe BPS. The analysis was conducted using one-way ANCOVA model to calculate the LS mean change from baseline ICSI total score and associated SE at Week 4 for each treatment arm. Negative values indicate decrease in severity of BPS.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Genitourinary Pain Index (GUPI) Score at Week 4</title>
        <description>To measure the degree of genitourinary pain symptoms, an 8-item self-report GUPI measure was used. Participants were asked to select a number on the scale that best described the severity of symptoms over telephone using an IVRS every evening at bedtime during the baseline assessment phase and treatment phase (up to 4 weeks). The GUPI instrument yields a total score of 0-45 and 3 subscales: pain (score = 0-23), urinary (score = 0-10), and quality of life (score = 0-12). Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms. The analysis was conducted using one-way ANCOVA model to calculate the LS mean change from baseline GUPI total score and associated SE at Week 4 for each treatment arm. Negative values indicate decrease in degree of genitourinary pain symptoms.</description>
