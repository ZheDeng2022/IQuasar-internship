  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that transcranial direct current stimulation will reduce tobacco withdrawal&#xD;
      symptoms of tobacco dependent smokers abstinent from smoking for more than 10 hours.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will recruit 35 non-smokers and 30 adult smokers who smoke &gt; 15 cigarettes/day for more&#xD;
      than two years and are 18-55 years old. We expect about half of them will be females. All&#xD;
      participants will be screened for drugs of abuse and female participants will receive a&#xD;
      pregnancy test. Each smoker will participate in four tDCS sessions, one for sham and three&#xD;
      for real tDCS, each for one set of electrode montage. The first set is dorsal lateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex (i.e., F3 and F4 of 10/20 EEG system) and neck. The second set is middle&#xD;
      line prefrontal cortex (Fz), superior parietal cortex (Pz), and bilateral inferior temporal&#xD;
      cortex (T3 and T4). The third set is left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (F3) and superior&#xD;
      parietal cortex (P1), and right inferior temporal cortex (T4). The sequence of real and sham&#xD;
      tDCS will be counterbalanced among participants. Each session will last for 20 minutes and&#xD;
      there will be a minimum 48 hours between the two sessions. Participants will be required to&#xD;
      be abstinent from cigarette smoking overnight for a minimum of 10 hours and arrive at our lab&#xD;
      around 8:30 AM for each tDCS session. After arrival, each participant will provide a breath&#xD;
      sample for detection of any alcohol in their system, an assay of CO and for verification of&#xD;
      abstinence from cigarette smoking. We will place a nicotine patch (Nicoderm with 21 mg&#xD;
      nicotine) on the back of participants. We will also ask each participant to chew a nicotine&#xD;
      gum (Nicorette gum with 4 mg nicotine) for 30 minutes. The participants will perform a&#xD;
      battery of computerized tasks including the N-Back working memory task, and an attention task&#xD;
      involving watching a computer screen and pressing buttons to indicate more odd or even&#xD;
      numbers displayed on the screen. In addition participants will complete the following&#xD;
      questionnaires related to mood, nicotine withdrawal, mental state, possible side effects, and&#xD;
      cigarette craving: Profile of Mood States (McNair et al 1971), Shiffman-Jarvik Withdrawal&#xD;
      Scales (Shiffman &amp; Jarvik 1976), and Urge To Smoke (Jarvik et al 2000), tDCS side effects&#xD;
      questionnaire, Wisconsin Smoking Withdrawal Scale (Welsch 1999), Perceived Stress Scale&#xD;
      (Cohen 1983), Spielberger State/Trait Anxiety Questionnaire (Spielberger 1970).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will repeat above battery of cognitive tasks and questionnaires after tDCS.&#xD;
      Then they will be instructed to smoke one cigarette after this second battery of&#xD;
      tasks/questionnaires, and repeat the second battery of questionnaires after cigarette&#xD;
      smoking.&#xD;
