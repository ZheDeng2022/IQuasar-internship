  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the activity of temsirolimus in patients who have&#xD;
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and have been treated with one previous chemotherapy&#xD;
      or biologic therapy like sorafenib, but have experienced disease progression or intolerance&#xD;
      to that therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, no standard therapy exists for patients who progress on sorafenib. mTOR signaling&#xD;
      is often up-regulated in HCC promoting cell growth and survival. This process is inhibited by&#xD;
      rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR. Temsirolimus, a rapamycin analog, may delay tumor&#xD;
      progression by inhibiting mTOR in HCC.Intervention: Temsirolimus IV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive temsirolimus IV on days 1,8,15 every 21 days. Treatment will&#xD;
      continue till disease progression or untolerable side effects&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have advanced unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&#xD;
             Prior diagnosis of HCC could have been established histologically or based on one of&#xD;
             the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Liver mass &gt; 2cm: Characteristic enhancement on at least one imaging&#xD;
                  technique(triphasic CT scan, MRI, or contrast enhanced ultrasound) or AFP &gt; 200&#xD;
                  ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Liver mass between 1 and 2 cm: Characteristic enhancement on two imaging&#xD;
                  techniques.Diagnosis of HCC must have been confirmed by biopsy if&#xD;
                  non-characteristic enhancement on imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. All patients must have received exactly one prior systemic therapy (cytotoxic&#xD;
             chemotherapy or targeted therapies) and must not be eligible for further locoregional&#xD;
             treatment modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. All patients must have measurable disease per RECIST criteria.&#xD;
