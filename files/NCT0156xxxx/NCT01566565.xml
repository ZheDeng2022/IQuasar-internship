  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, three period, two sequence, open-label, randomized, crossover study, with&#xD;
      the primary objective of testing the safety and tolerability of combined oral doses of&#xD;
      theophylline and bambuterol in healthy human subjects. The secondary objective is to assess&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetic profiles of theophylline and bambuterol when administered alone or in&#xD;
      combination. It is hypothesized that the combination of these drugs is generally safe, and&#xD;
      that no drug interaction can be observed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, three period, two sequence, single-center, open-label, randomized,&#xD;
      crossover study design. Periods I and II consist of the oral administration of either a&#xD;
      single dose of theophylline or bambuterol alone, followed by a 7 day wash out interval.&#xD;
      Subsequently, Period III consists of the simultaneous administration of both drugs. All&#xD;
      subjects are to be confined to the Oslo University Hospital Research Unit throughout all&#xD;
      treatment periods [Study Day 1, 7 and 14]. A sufficient number of healthy adult subjects will&#xD;
      be consented in order to enroll 20 and complete 16 subjects who complete all three periods.&#xD;
      Replacement of subjects is permitted, if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualified subjects will be randomized into one of two sequences consisting of three Periods&#xD;
      as indicated below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -------------Period 1-----Period 2-----Period 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence A: Treatment 1 Treatment 2 Treatment 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence B: Treatment 2 Treatment 1 Treatment 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment 1: Theophylline 300 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment 2: Bambuterol 20 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment 3: Theophylline 300 mg plus Bambuterol 20 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of each treatment period, the subjects will proceed to the next period&#xD;
      provided no Stopping Rules criteria have been met&#xD;
