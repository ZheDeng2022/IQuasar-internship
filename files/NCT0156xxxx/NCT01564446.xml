  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and Significance: Adverse drug events (ADE) are the most common of all healthcare&#xD;
      associated adverse events. Transitions between inpatient and ambulatory care can lead to ADE&#xD;
      and avoidable healthcare utilization affecting up to 20% of patients. Insufficient monitoring&#xD;
      has been identified as a particularly common cause of preventable and ameliorable ADE. The&#xD;
      Joint Commission for Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) has called for a&#xD;
      process to &quot;accurately and completely reconcile medications across the continuum of care.&quot;&#xD;
      Inpatient computerized medication reconciliation tools have shown great potential, but little&#xD;
      is known about successful medication reconciliation strategies immediately post-discharge.&#xD;
      One promising solution to outpatient medication reconciliation is the use of secure&#xD;
      electronic communication (SEC) between patients, accessing their personal health record via a&#xD;
      web portal, and providers within an electronic health record. Surveys have consistently found&#xD;
      that patients want to communicate with their primary care providers via SEC, and SEC is&#xD;
      rapidly becoming a standard feature in electronic health records. A SEC-based approach to&#xD;
      outpatient medication reconciliation following hospital discharge has the potential to&#xD;
      improve patient safety, but important questions must be addressed, including: What&#xD;
      information needs to be included in the SEC? What elements of the SEC are essential to its&#xD;
      design? How can SEC be best incorporated into the workflow of the primary care office&#xD;
      practice? Will patients and physicians find this approach acceptable? To address these&#xD;
      questions, we propose a one-year pilot study at VA Boston with the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To evaluate the primary care environment's receptivity to secure electronic&#xD;
      communication (SEC) for medication reconciliation and design a prototype SEC. We will use&#xD;
      qualitative methods to characterize the primary care clinic environment - the physical space&#xD;
      and facilities, the workflow, the resources, as well as the knowledge, attitudes and skills&#xD;
      of staff and, most importantly, the patients. Specific approaches will include in-depth&#xD;
      interviews, direct ethnographic observations, and visualization methods Aim 2. To develop a&#xD;
      prototype SEC for medication reconciliation through a participatory design process, involving&#xD;
      primary care clinicians, staff and patients working collaboratively with the research team,&#xD;
      and to test the usability and acceptability of the prototype SEC among a sample of patients&#xD;
      and primary care clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research and Development Plan: With extensive experience in designing and evaluating health&#xD;
      care informatics innovations, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team with expertise from&#xD;
      primary care internal medicine, clinical informatics, health services research, qualitative&#xD;
      research, clinical pharmacy, nursing and industrial engineering. This team will carry out a&#xD;
      formative evaluation and develop a prototype of a secure electronic message to facilitate&#xD;
      medication reconciliation following hospital discharge. The proposed CIMIT project will&#xD;
      leverage the resources and expertise of the e-Health QUERI (a national VA program for&#xD;
      innovation and evaluation of the VA's e-Health programs) at VA Boston and other participating&#xD;
      VA facilities nationwide. The figure below shows a very rough conceptualization of the SEC&#xD;
      that will guide the qualitative research and participatory design of the prototype. This&#xD;
      project will lay the foundation for a future rigorous evaluation of this approach to&#xD;
      medication reconciliation and improving patient safety.&#xD;

      Adverse drug events (ADE) are the most common of all healthcare-associated adverse events1&#xD;
      and commonly occur after hospitalization when multiple changes to medication regimens take&#xD;
      place in the context of poor patient education, inadequate information transfer and delayed&#xD;
      continuity of care. Medication reconciliation - i.e., any intentional process to resolve&#xD;
      discrepancies between what medications the patient is taking and what medications the health&#xD;
      care team thinks the patient is taking - has been designated a &quot;National Patient Safety Goal&quot;&#xD;
      since 2005.2-6 Recent studies examining inpatient computerized medication reconciliation&#xD;
      tools and pharmacist-facilitated medication reconciliation programs at hospital discharge&#xD;
      have shown promising results. However, little is known about successful medication&#xD;
      reconciliation strategies following discharge, representing an untapped point of leverage to&#xD;
      improve medication safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With recently awarded seed funding, and in collaboration with the Department of Veterans'&#xD;
      Affairs (VA) nationwide Medication Reconciliation Initiative, we are developing an&#xD;
      informatics-based tool for medication reconciliation following hospital discharge by secure,&#xD;
      e-mail-like communication: the Secure Messaging for Medication Reconciliation Tool (SMMRT).&#xD;
      In this proposed study, we plan to pilot the SMMRT prototype through My HealtheVet (MHV), the&#xD;
      VA's secure personal health record and web portal, among 50 Veterans at VA Boston, with the&#xD;
      following two Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Refine the existing SMMRT prototype and integrate it into MHV's secure&#xD;
      messaging web-interface, with authentication of secure two-way communication between patient&#xD;
      and primary healthcare team. We will use a participatory and patient-centered process&#xD;
      involving the primary care clinicians, pharmacists, nurses, other staff members and Veterans&#xD;
      working collaboratively with the research team to establish the usability and acceptability&#xD;
      of the prototype SMMRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Pilot the SMMRT prototype, refined through Specific Aim 1, among 50 Veterans&#xD;
      with primary care relationships and hospitalized at our facility. Veterans will be recruited&#xD;
      prior to hospital discharge, enrolled in MHV if necessary, and trained in the use of secure&#xD;
      messaging and specifically the SMMRT tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will benefit from a recently funded preliminary study (Veterans' Engineering&#xD;
      Resource Center seed funding, $25,000), in enabling us to analyze the primary care&#xD;
      environment's receptivity to SMMRT-based post-discharge medication reconciliation, focusing&#xD;
      on staff activation and education, workflow optimization to incorporate staff and clinicians&#xD;
      managing SMMRT's incoming and outgoing messages, and coordination with MHV staff to ensure&#xD;
      continued successful software integration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed CIMIT-funded study will lead to a refined and strengthened intervention to&#xD;
      enhance the preliminary use of SMMRT, as well as qualitative results that will constitute the&#xD;
      foundation of an investigator-initiated research proposal alongside a full-scale&#xD;
      implementation of SMMRT into MHV for Veterans nationwide.&#xD;
