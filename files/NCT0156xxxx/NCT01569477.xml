  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test the hypotheses that incentives can increase both participation&#xD;
      in smoking cessation treatment and resulting cessation rates when they are offered to&#xD;
      Medicaid BadgerCare Plus members.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1: To determine the extent to which contingent financial &quot;treatment incentives&quot; (i.e.,&#xD;
      incentives for biochemical verification visits, treatment engagement, and abstinence) versus&#xD;
      &quot;attendance incentives&quot; (i.e., incentives for only attending the biochemical verification&#xD;
      visits), increase rates of smoking cessation . Participants will be BadgerCare Plus tobacco&#xD;
      users who enroll in Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line (WTQL) services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine the extent to which treatment incentives vs. attendance incentives&#xD;
      increase rates of engagement in smoking cessation treatment through the WTQL when offered to&#xD;
      BadgerCare Plus members who smoke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To determine the cost-effectiveness of the smoking cessation program when paired with&#xD;
      treatment incentives and when paired with attendance incentives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To identify moderating and mediational effects regarding the clinical benefit of&#xD;
      incentivized smoking treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 5: To determine the reach of an incentivized smoking cessation treatment that depends&#xD;
      upon primary care clinic staff, a fax-to-quit referral mechanism and a state quit line.&#xD;
