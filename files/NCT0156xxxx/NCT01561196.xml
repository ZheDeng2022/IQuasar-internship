    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to compare two methods for arterial cannulation. The traditional&#xD;
      method with ultrasound guided cannulation. The investigators goal is to improve this&#xD;
      procedure to reduce pain and complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The practice of placing vascular catheters is used many times every day at almost every&#xD;
      hospital. It is a safe procedure which generally does not imply problems. Though the&#xD;
      procedural optimum aren't reached. The procedure still fails some times and induce&#xD;
      complications. When the catheter is placed using the traditional method the pulse is palpated&#xD;
      by the operator's fingers. This is only to be done near the hand wrist. In this position the&#xD;
      catheter steadiness is fragile but because the pulse can't be sensed more proximal the&#xD;
      operator is forced to choose this position. This it though a problem that can be solved by&#xD;
      non invasive visualization technology. Ultrasound-guidance for central vascular access is&#xD;
      already well-established. However, in recent years ultrasound-guidance for peripheral&#xD;
      vascular access has gained popularity too. The evidence of multiple studies demonstrates&#xD;
      increased success rate and reduced complication rate with ultrasound compared to blind&#xD;
      landmark technique for vascular catheter placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years there have been both procedural technique and technology improvements in the&#xD;
      field of ultrasound. This has led to the improvement of procedural catheterisation techniques&#xD;
      that now can be done by novices with higher attempt success rate than traditional method. One&#xD;
      technique that is gaining success is the short-axis-out-of-plane technique (SAX-OOP) with&#xD;
      dynamic-needle-tip-tracking (DNTT).Using the ultrasound machine the needle can be placed in a&#xD;
      more proximal direction on the forearm and the investigators believe that by the help of the&#xD;
      exposed procedure on the monitor many complications can be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis; Firstly the investigators hypothesize that the pain induced by the conventional&#xD;
      method inclusive preoperational lidocaine injection will be the same or more intense than&#xD;
      using DNTT without local anesthesia. Secondly the investigators hypothesize that the use of&#xD;
      DNTT for the placement of the arterial catheter will decrease the time spend, amount of&#xD;
      complications (hematoma), the number of pricks, the number of utilized catheters compared to&#xD;
      the traditional palpation method. Thirdly the investigators claim that the best anatomical&#xD;
      place to put the catheter isn't always corresponding with the spot chosen by palpation, which&#xD;
      increase the number of failures.&#xD;
