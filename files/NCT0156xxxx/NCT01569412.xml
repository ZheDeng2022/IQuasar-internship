  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with HER2/neu expressing solid tumors progressing after standard therapy will be&#xD;
      treated with a so called trifunctional antibody (Ertumaxomab). The main objective of this&#xD;
      trial is to find the maximum tolerated dose. Tolerability and Safety will be assessed as well&#xD;
      as efficacy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open label phase I/II study dose escalating study to investigate safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of the trifunctional anti-HER2/neu x anti-CD3 antibody&#xD;
      ertumaxomab in patients with HER2/neu (1+/SISH positive, 2+ and 3+) expressing solid tumors&#xD;
      progressing after standard therapy. The primary objectives of the study is to assess the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of ertumaxomab in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      and to establish a recommended dose (RD) for further development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of ten infusions will be applicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen at baseline/screening, and then weekly for infusion and safety&#xD;
      assessment with a break of 3 weeks after the 5th dose. Radiological tumor assessment will be&#xD;
      performed every 6 weeks. Post-study follow-up will be completed every 8 weeks for up to one&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
