      Experiments suggest that during treatment with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) the activity of&#xD;
      coagulation factors (F) II and X better reflect anticoagulation than does FVII. Based on this&#xD;
      a new prothrombin time based monitoring test (Fiix-PT) has been invented which is only&#xD;
      sensitive to FII and FX. The Fiix-PT can be converted to INR (&quot;Fiix-INR&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the Fiix-PT may reflect anticoagulation and the&#xD;
      antithrombotic effect of VKA as accurately or better than the current PT based tests do (INR&#xD;
      based on PT or P&amp;P). The protocol describes a prospective randomized double-blind trial that&#xD;
      will be conducted at the Landspitali Anticoagulation Management Center (AMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the protocol is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Fiix-INR as a&#xD;
      monitoring test compared to the current PT based assays (INR) used to monitor patients&#xD;
      treated with VKA to prevent thromboembolism. The investigators will randomize 1200 clients of&#xD;
      the AMC into two identically sized monitoring groups, Fiix-INR (test group) and INR (control&#xD;
      group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical endpoints to be studied include efficacy (arterial and venous thromboembolic&#xD;
      event rate) and safety (bleeding events). Additionally, surrogate convenience endpoints will&#xD;
      be studied such as test frequency and time within target range.&#xD;

        1. STUDY SYNOPSIS Experiments suggest that during treatment with vitamin K antagonists&#xD;
           (VKA) the activity of coagulation factors (F) II and X better reflect anticoagulation&#xD;
           than does FVII. Based on this a new monitoring prothrombin time base test (Fiix-PT) has&#xD;
           been invented which is only sensitive to FII and FX. The Fiix-PT can be converted to INR&#xD;
           (&quot;Fiix-INR&quot;).We hypothesize that the Fiix-PT may reflect anticoagulation and the&#xD;
           antithrombotic effect of VKA as accurately or better than the current PT based tests do&#xD;
           (INR based on PT or P&amp;P). The protocol describes a prospective randomized double-blind&#xD;
           trial that will be conducted at the Landspitali Anticoagulation Management Center (AMC).&#xD;
           The objective of the protocol is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Fiix-INR as a&#xD;
           monitoring test compared to the current PT based assays (INR) used to monitor patients&#xD;
           treated with VKA in order to prevent thromboembolism. We will randomize 1200 clients of&#xD;
           the AMC into two identically sized monitoring groups, Fiix-INR (test group) and INR&#xD;
           (control group). Each individual will be assessed monthly for up to 24 months (an&#xD;
           expected average of 18 months) until a total of 600 patients years of observation has&#xD;
           been reached in each group. The clinical endpoints to be studied include efficacy&#xD;
           (arterial and venous thromboembolic event rate) and safety (bleeding events). Also,&#xD;
           surrogate convenience endpoints will be studied such as test frequency and time within&#xD;
           target range.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE 2.1 Background Vitamin K antagonists (VKA, coumarins) are&#xD;
           orally active anticoagulants that prevent normal gamma carboxylation of the vitamin K&#xD;
           dependent coagulation factors (FII, FVII, FIX, FX). The consequence is a reduction in&#xD;
           the clotability of the blood, ie an anticoagulant effect that can be used&#xD;
           therapeutically for the purpose of preventing thromboembolism. In order to assure&#xD;
           efficacy and safety, the dose of VKA needs to be adjusted to maintain the normalized&#xD;
           prothrombin time ratio (international normalized ratio, INR) within a safe therapeutic&#xD;
           range (most often with INR target 2.5, range 2.0-3.0). The clotting times obtained with&#xD;
           PT based tests have in practice for over 50 years been presumed to directly reflect the&#xD;
           antithrombotic effect of VKA in patients (Loeliger 1984). The PT (or P&amp;P-test) are used&#xD;
           all over the world for the purpose of monitoring anticoagulation and to make&#xD;
           dose-adjustments in patients taking VKA. Their results have been standardized by&#xD;
           calculating the International Normalized Ratio (INR) which takes into account the&#xD;
           sensitivity (strength) of the thromboplastin used by different reagents.&#xD;
&#xD;
           However, inherent problems exist with the PT. Due to the VKD factorsÂ´ significantly&#xD;
           different half-lifes (above), the PT clotting time obtained early after initiation or&#xD;
           dose change may mainly reflect the concentration of factor VII since FVII has the&#xD;
           notably shortest half-life (about 4-8 hours). If the concentration of factor VII has&#xD;
           little influence on the antithrombotic effect of VKA (see below), it is possible that&#xD;
           unnecessary and too frequent dose adjustments are made based on the use of the PT. This,&#xD;
           could potentially be harmful to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prior studies by others have indicated that the thrombin generation(Xi, Beguin et al.&#xD;
           1989; Brummel, Paradis et al. 2001) and antithrombotic influence of factor VII in&#xD;
           rabbits (Zivelin, Rao et al. 1993) may be less important than that of prothrombin or&#xD;
           factor X. Based on those observations, it is possible that monitoring VKA and their&#xD;
           safety could be improved by measuring either coagulation factor II or coagulation factor&#xD;
           X. Measuring and monitoring coagulation factor II alone (native prothrombin antigen) has&#xD;
           been shown to be very successful and more accurate than PT in clinical studies (Furie,&#xD;
           Liebman et al. 1984; Xi, Beguin et al. 1989; Furie, Diuguid et al. 1990; Kornberg,&#xD;
           Francis et al. 1993). The native prothrombin antigen assay, however, is not as&#xD;
           convenient for laboratories as the PT or P&amp;P. Monitoring coagulation factor X alone has&#xD;
           not been tested in patients to our knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We have investigated (Thrombosis Research 2012, in press.) the influence of each of the&#xD;
           VKD factors on coagulation induced by dilute (trace amount) thromboplastin using&#xD;
           rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM). The dilute thromboplastin is by some scientists&#xD;
           considered to reflect physiological clotting better than the 17,000 fold stronger&#xD;
           thromboplastin used in the current PT assays. ROTEM measures coagulation in more detail&#xD;
           than the traditional clotting times, i.e. initiation phase (clotting time), propagation&#xD;
           phase (bulk clot formation) and stabilization phase. Taken together, these experiments&#xD;
           using ROTEM show that the ROTEM clotting time (CT, initiation phase), ROTEM maximum&#xD;
           velocity of clot formation (Max Vel, propagation phase) and the ROTEM MCF (stabilization&#xD;
           phase) were affected much more by mildly and moderately low concentrations of factors II&#xD;
           or X (at activity levels that are present during ideal anticoagulation) than by&#xD;
           identical FVII or factor IX activity levels. Factors VII and IX mainly influenced the&#xD;
           ROTEM parameters at very low concentrations (&lt; 5%) which only occur during marked over&#xD;
           anticoagulation. We conclude from these experiments that when coagulation is initiated&#xD;
           with trace amount thromboplastin (physiological coagulation), reduction in concentration&#xD;
           of coagulation factors II or X has much more effect on the development of a clot than do&#xD;
           the concentrations of factors VII or IX except at extremely low activity levels of the&#xD;
           latter two factors. Our experimental results may indicate that in patients&#xD;
           anticoagulated with warfarin, the factor VII activity is a confounding source of&#xD;
           variation in INR (PT) results. Hence, measuring the influence of factor II or X or both&#xD;
           II and X simultaneously on fibrin formation might reduce INR fluctuation. Possibly, this&#xD;
           could better predict the antithrombotic effect than the current tests do. Thus,&#xD;
           measuring II or X or both simultaneously could possibly improve monitoring and dosing&#xD;
           during VKA therapy. This has led to our invention of a new test, &quot;Fiix-PT&quot; (or&#xD;
           Stuart-Prothrombin time) , which measures the combined action of factor II and factor X&#xD;
           activity on clotting induced by tissue thromboplastin in PPP. We are not aware of any&#xD;
           other scientists investigating this method and a local patent has been granted with&#xD;
           international patent applications in process (March 2012). The Fiix-PT is not affected&#xD;
           by reduced activity of any other coagulation factors. In comparison, the traditional&#xD;
           test method (Quick PT or OwrenÂ´s PT) measures the combined effect of factors II, VII and&#xD;
           X on fibrin formation in patients taking VKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 Hypothesis: Based on our experimental results as well as the results of others(Xi,&#xD;
           Beguin et al. 1989; Zivelin, Rao et al. 1993; Brummel, Paradis et al. 2001), we&#xD;
           hypothesize that the Fiix-PT may reflect anticoagulation and the antithrombotic effect&#xD;
           of VKA at least as accurately as than the current PT based tests do (PT, P&amp;P).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY OBJECTIVE The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
           Fiix-INR as a monitoring test compared to the current PT based assays used to monitor&#xD;
           patients treated with VKA to prevent thromboembolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. STUDY OVERVIEW This is a prospective, single-center, randomized, double-blinded,&#xD;
           non-inferiority study(D'Agostino, Massaro et al. 2003; Scott 2009) for the efficacy and&#xD;
           safety of Fiix-PT as a monitoring method in VKA treated patients involving 1200 patient&#xD;
           years of observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1 Participants: All ambulatory patients 18 years or older currently on or starting on&#xD;
           warfarin to treat and prevent thromboembolism during the study period at the&#xD;
           anticoagulation management center (AMC) at the Landspitali University Hospital in&#xD;
           Reykjavik, Iceland with a treatment goal of INR 2-3 will be eligible for participation&#xD;
           and randomization irrespective of indication for anticoagulation, age or concurrent&#xD;
           medication use. Thus, the study population will have various (or mixed) indications for&#xD;
           OA but the majority likely will have atrial fibrillation. Both current patients and new&#xD;
           patients will be randomized over a 3-6 month period until adequate number of patients&#xD;
           have entered the study. After patients sign informed consent they will be randomized&#xD;
           (see METHOD of randomization in chapter 7) to either Fiix-PT (test method, Fiix INR) or&#xD;
           PT (PT-INR based on Quick PT method as a control method). We will measure the PT- INR as&#xD;
           well as the Fiix - INR in the test group for the sake of safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2 Randomization standard (PT-INR) vs. new test (Fiix-INR). The aim is to randomize&#xD;
           1200 clients of the AMC into two identically sized monitoring groups, Fiix-INR (test&#xD;
           group) and INR (control group). Each individual will be assessed monthly for up to 24&#xD;
           months (an expected average of 18 months) until a total of 600 patients years of&#xD;
           observation has been reached in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3 Time frame: The clinical observation period for each participant will be 18 months&#xD;
           on average.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.4 Endpoints to be recorded: see Chapter 7 for details A.Clinical endpoints. Rate of&#xD;
           all TE or major bleeding. The major efficacy endpoint is symptomatic diagnosed TE events&#xD;
           or death from TE and the major safety endpoint, is major bleeding, including death from&#xD;
           major bleeding (Palareti 1996; Abdelhafiz and Wheeldon 2004). TE and major bleeding as a&#xD;
           combined endpoint. Death and causes of death from natural causes. All bleeding (major&#xD;
           and any other reported bleeding) B. Convenience/surrogate endpoints, eg. time within&#xD;
           target range, number of tests within target range, number of tests during study period,&#xD;
           number of tests needed to achieve stable anticoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.5 Study management: The study will be managed from day to day by an Executive&#xD;
           Committee (EXC) . All clinical diagnoses will be reviewed by a blinded Independent&#xD;
           Adjudication Committee (IAC) and Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The IAC and DSMB&#xD;
           will be blinded to which test group the patient with event for review belongs. All&#xD;
           suspected recurrent TEs, deaths, as well as all episodes of bleeding and other possible&#xD;
           vascular events will be evaluated by the IAC. The patent holders (PTÃ, BRG) will not be&#xD;
           on the IAC due to potential bias. Only adjudicated results will be the basis for the&#xD;
           final analyses. The DSMB will also monitor the study progress and patients' safety&#xD;
           during the study and give recommendations to the EXC.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Every time a patient has a contact (eg INR measurement or dosing instructions), the&#xD;
           dosing staff or study nurse will ask questions by exactly following the case review form&#xD;
           (CRF, 14.2). If the questions are answered with a &quot;yes&quot;, the study nurse will without&#xD;
           delay contact that particular patient for more detailed information (i.e. HCRU form see:&#xD;
           Event report form / Health Care resource utilization (HCRU)), and, as appropriate, will&#xD;
           also collect necessary case record documents for the IAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. STUDY POPULATION, RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1 Planned number of patients. See 11.3.1 5.2 Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Current or new patients 18 years or older currently on or starting VKA with INR&#xD;
           treatment target of 2-3&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Willingness to participate as volunteers and to signing an informed consent 5.3&#xD;
           Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Age under 18 years 2. Patients unable to sign informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4 Randomization and blinding 5.4.1 Random allocation to experimental testing (Fiix-PT,&#xD;
      Fiix-INR) group and standard testing (PT, PT-INR) group will be done by the study nurse or&#xD;
      coagulation laboratory staff member in the outpatient phlebotomy ward when patients come for&#xD;
      scheduled visits or in hospital inpatient wards;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In current stable patients: at time of signing informed consent. Stable patients have&#xD;
           had at least two INRÂ´s within the target range.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In new patients: no later than on the 4th day of warfarin administration, i.e. prior to&#xD;
           the first dose adjustment as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note that the first dose change/first dose adjustment decision of warfarin must be based on&#xD;
      post-randomization Fiix-PT or PT result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4.2 Randomization After patients sign informed consent they will be randomized to either&#xD;
      Fiix-PT (test method, Fiix INR) or PT (PT-INR based on Quick PT method as a control method).&#xD;
      Randomization will be done manually at time of signing the informed consent, ie the&#xD;
      participants will draw a labeled color card with an assigned study number (CRF number) which&#xD;
      will randomize them to either the test group or the control group. The coagulation laboratory&#xD;
      (supervised by BRG) will maintain a list of study participants during the study. They will be&#xD;
      responsible for randomization (color assignment) following the signing of informed consent.&#xD;
      Following randomization, each patient will be assigned a study participant number. The&#xD;
      laboratory will based on this participant number and color code as appropriate direct each&#xD;
      patientÂ´s sample to test A (Fiix-INR) or test B (PT-INR) which will be measured in the&#xD;
      Landspitali coagulation laboratory using the STA-R instrument (Stago).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4.3 Blinding. The study will be double-blinded, i.e. all assessors of clinical effect and&#xD;
      dosing staff as well as patients will be blinded to the monitoring test-method. Blinded test&#xD;
      results (INR) will be administered by the coagulation laboratory staff which cannot be&#xD;
      blinded since they do the laboratory testing. The coagulation laboratory will measure INR&#xD;
      (PT) on one STA-R instrument and Fiix-INR (Fiix-PT) on another STA-R instrument. All results,&#xD;
      however will be reported out as &quot;INR&quot;. The patients will not be informed on which test is&#xD;
      used to monitor their anticoagulation and only a value (&quot;INR&quot;) will be reported to patients.&#xD;
      The test results will also be reported electronically as &quot;INR&quot; to the dosing staff (nurses,&#xD;
      biomedical scientists, physicians) and study nurse who will not have knowledge on which test&#xD;
      is used to monitor each patient. The data will be managed by the study nurse who will not&#xD;
      have access to monitoring test allocation. All formal assessors of clinical events and&#xD;
      secondary endpoints will also be blinded to test allocation. The dosing staff will dose&#xD;
      patients based on INR, i.e. using the DAWN anticoagulation management software (Onundarson,&#xD;
      Einarsdottir et al. 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.5 Prior and concomitant anticoagulant medication 5.5.1 Anticoagulant medication prior to&#xD;
      randomization Therapeutic dosages of (LMW)heparin/fondaparinux are allowed concomitantly with&#xD;
      warfarin in new patients or during bridging therapy in association with procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 STUDY TESTS 6.1 INR and Fiix-INR Current patients on stable warfarin therapy (see 5.4.1)&#xD;
      can be included. In new patients, no later than after the first dose of warfarin should the&#xD;
      dosing be managed by the AMC staff at Landspitali. The VKA dosage will be adjusted to&#xD;
      maintain the Fiix-INR or the INR (PT-INR) with the therapeutic target of 2.5 (range 2.0-3.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1.1 PT-INR The INR is calculated by the following formula: INR= (Patient PT/mean normal&#xD;
      PT)ISI .&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1.2 Fiix-INR Fiix-PT will be measured using Neoplastin CI plusÂ® and Fiix depleted plasma as&#xD;
      described in patent application P8151IS00, March, 8th 2011. Fiix-INR will be calculated in&#xD;
      the same manner as the PT-INR is calculated. ISI is calculated from DEKS calibrators as in&#xD;
      6.1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Packaging, labeling, and storage The test reagents will be stored according to their&#xD;
      package inserts and the Fiix deficient plasma will be stored in aliquots at -70Â°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3 Accountability and study compliance All testing, dosing and follow-up must be done in&#xD;
      accordance with the protocol and group assignment. During emergency testing both tests should&#xD;
      be measured on all patients. When the laboratory is not sure both tests should be measured.&#xD;
      All samples drawn during weekend and holidays should be kept until coagulation laboratory&#xD;
      staff has decided that they can be discarded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3.1 VKA treatment monitoring The INR and Fiix-INR should initially be measured every 2 to 4&#xD;
      days and when stable (at least two consecutive tests within target range) no less that every&#xD;
      8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7 STUDY PROCEDURES 7.1 Study period This is the period between randomization (first testing&#xD;
      with assigned test = Day 1) and final assessment of each individual. Data will be retrieved&#xD;
      continuously as described above. After 3, 6, 9 and 12 months &quot;interim&quot; (safety, efficacy)&#xD;
      analyzes will be performed (see Chapter 11). We will randomize 1200 clients of the AMC into&#xD;
      two identically sized monitoring groups, Fiix-INR (test group) and INR (control group). Each&#xD;
      individual will be assessed monthly for up to 24 months (an expected average of 18 months)&#xD;
      until a total of 600 patients years of observation has been reached in each group. The study&#xD;
      may also be stopped by the recommendation of the DSMB if a clinically significant difference&#xD;
      in outcome becomes evident at an earlier time-point indicating inferiority of the new method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.1.1 Patient written information Prior to enrollment potential study participants will&#xD;
      receive an introductory information letter as well as informed consent form detailing the&#xD;
      study and symptoms suggestive of new or recurrent thromboembolism or major bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.1.2 Patient contacts Data will be retrieved continuously and each patient will be contacted&#xD;
      on a monthly basis. As described in detail in the protocol, in the case of suspected bleeding&#xD;
      or thrombotic events or death data will be retrieved from case records, hospital summaries,&#xD;
      autopsy reports or other records from physicians. When suspected serious events occur, the&#xD;
      patients will be immediately referred to appropriate level care in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.1.2.1 Initial CRF form (see: Initial Case Report Form (Initial CRF) form) When the patient&#xD;
      has signed an informed consent, an initial CRF form (ICRF) will be filled in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.1.2.2 Follow-up CRF form (see: Follow-up Contact Case report (review) form (Follow-up CRF))&#xD;
      Every time a patient has a contact with the AMC (e.g. INR measurement or dosing&#xD;
      instructions), the dosing staff or study nurse will ask questions by exactly following the&#xD;
      case review form (CRF, 14.2). If the questions are answered with a &quot;yes&quot;, the study nurse&#xD;
      will without delay contact that particular patient for more detailed information (ie HCRU&#xD;
      form, see: Event report form / Health Care resource utilization (HCRU)). The study nurse will&#xD;
      then, as appropriate, collect necessary documents for the independent adjudication committee&#xD;
      (IAC), see chapter 9.3.3. During each patient event, the following will be systematically&#xD;
      checked by interviewing patients and reviewing the hospital chart for thromboembolism,&#xD;
      bleeding events, concomitant medication, in particular antiplatelet agents such as aspirin or&#xD;
      clopidogrel and NSAID use and compliance with monitoring 7.1.2.3 Observational period All&#xD;
      patients will have a 5 day observational period after discontinuing from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2 Efficacy and safety outcome criteria for the IAC 7.2.1 Assessment of clinical outcomes&#xD;
      All suspected clinical outcomes i.e. recurrent TE, bleeding, death and vascular events, will&#xD;
      be notified expedited to the IAC in a manner blinded to which test was applied. Blinded&#xD;
      review of the event by the IAC should be completed within 2-4 weeks after occurrence of the&#xD;
      event. The primary efficacy outcome is symptomatic or fatal recurrent arterial or venous TE&#xD;
      event during the study period. The primary safety outcome is bleeding. Prespecified criteria&#xD;
      for these events are excluded from this abbreviated protocol version.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.3 Surrogate endpoints/Convenience endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. During initiation of VKA therapy: i. Number of tests needed to reach stable INR, i.e.&#xD;
           until the first of two consecutive INR values are obtained within the target range. ii.&#xD;
           Time until stable INR within target range&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. During stable phase: i. Total number of tests per treatment year ii. Dose adjustment&#xD;
           frequency (interval or number of dose adjustments during observation period) iii.&#xD;
           Percent tests within treatment range over observation period iv. Percent time within&#xD;
           target range (TTR) over observation period&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.4 Measures to minimize bias A series of measures will be implemented to minimize the&#xD;
      potential for bias in this study as detailed in the full protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.5 Approach to the bleeding patient If a patient has a serious bleed during study, the&#xD;
      following routine measures should be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Refer the patient immediately to the emergency department Delay or discontinue the next&#xD;
      anticoagulant dose and consider vitamin K administration and usual treatment for bleeding,&#xD;
      including blood transfusion, prothrombin complex concentrate administration, recombinant&#xD;
      factor VIIa (NovoSeven and fresh frozen plasma&#xD;
&#xD;
      8 PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OR TEMPORARY DISRUPTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At their own request or at the request of their legally acceptable guardian. If, in the&#xD;
      investigator's opinion, continuation on anticoagulation would be detrimental to the subject's&#xD;
      well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is further detailed in the full protocol 9 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE 9.1 Data quality The&#xD;
      monitoring and auditing procedures defined below will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.2 Documentation Entries made in the CRF must be either verifiable against source documents,&#xD;
      or have been directly entered into the CRF, in which case the entry in the CRF will be&#xD;
      considered as the source data. The source data parameter to be verified and the&#xD;
      identification of the source document must be documented. The study file and all source data&#xD;
      will be retained for 5 years following final publication of study results when source data&#xD;
      can be destroyed. No published result will be traceable to particular persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.3 Study administration/committees 9.3.1 Executive committee (EXC) The EXC has the overall&#xD;
      scientific responsibility of the study. Its tasks and responsibilities are to create and&#xD;
      approve the final protocol, co-author protocol amendments whenever necessary, ensure a&#xD;
      scientifically sound and safe conduct of the study, including by abiding to DSMB&#xD;
      recommendations, decide on the DSMB recommendations, review and approve the statistical&#xD;
      analysis plan, guarantee the integrity of data collection and analyses and to decide on the&#xD;
      publication- and presentation policy of the final results and ancillary studies 9.3.2 Study&#xD;
      management and coordination committee (SMCC) The SMCC has the overall clinical responsibility&#xD;
      of the study. Its tasks and responsibilities are to review the protocol, review the CRF,&#xD;
      support the EXC by advice, monitor progress of study enrollment, address/resolve study&#xD;
      management problems and participate in the analysis and presentation of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Member (author group):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Independent adjudication committee (IAC) has the following roles: A. Blinded review of&#xD;
      clinical events (IAC- function), i.e. all suspected recurrent thromboembolic events, bleeding&#xD;
      of any kind, any vascular events and all deaths during the study period and the observational&#xD;
      period will be evaluated by IAC .The study nurse will provide the IAC with all relevant&#xD;
      documentation related to the events but the IAC will be blinded as to the monitoring method&#xD;
      of each patient while evaluating events. Adjudication results will be the basis for the final&#xD;
      analyses. and B. Data safety and monitoring (DSMB-function), i.e. this committee also has the&#xD;
      responsibility to provide the EXC with recommendations related to the protection of the&#xD;
      patients' safety, including stopping recruitment and stopping the study. For this purpose,&#xD;
      the DSMB will review all incidences of recurrent thromboembolism and bleeding every 3 months,&#xD;
      see Chapter 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.3.4 External monitoring of study Adherence to study protocol will be monitored by an&#xD;
      external agency. 10 ETHICAL AND LEGAL ASPECTS 10.1 Ethical committees (EC) The study will we&#xD;
      conducted in accordance with the Helsinki declaration. Documented approval from appropriate&#xD;
      ethical committees (EC) (applications will be sent to National Bioethics Committee (NBC)&#xD;
      (&quot;VÃ­sindasiÃ°anefnd&quot;), The Data Protection Authority (&quot;PersÃ³nuvernd&quot;) and from the Landspitali&#xD;
      Medical Director will be obtained prior to the start of the study, according to good clinical&#xD;
      practice (GCP), local laws, regulations and organizations. Regulatory authority&#xD;
      approvals/authorizations notifications will be in place and fully documented prior to study&#xD;
      start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.2 Ethical conduct of the study The procedures set out in this protocol, pertaining to the&#xD;
      conduct, evaluation, and documentation of this study, are designed to ensure that the&#xD;
      investigators abide by GCP Guidelines and under the guiding principles detailed in the&#xD;
      declaration of Helsinki. The study will also be carried out in keeping with applicable local&#xD;
      law(s) and regulation(s). This may include an inspection by regulatory authority&#xD;
      representatives at any time, including allowing direct access of source documents to the&#xD;
      regulatory authority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.3 Subject information and consent A core information and informed consent form will be&#xD;
      provided. Written informed consent must be obtained before any study specific procedure takes&#xD;
      place. Participation in the study and date of informed consent given by the subject should be&#xD;
      documented appropriately in the subject's files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.4 Insurance All subjects participating in the study will be covered by the Landspitali&#xD;
      Hospital patient insurance in line with applicable laws and/or regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.5 Confidentiality All records identifying the subject will be kept confidential and, to&#xD;
      the extent permitted by the applicable laws and/or regulations, will not be made publicly&#xD;
      available. Only the subject number will be recorded in the CRF. A list with names and&#xD;
      subjects numbers will be kept separately by the EXC and its employees. If the results of the&#xD;
      study are published, the subject's identity will remain totally confidential. The&#xD;
      investigator will, however, maintain a list to enable subjects' records to be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.6 Archiving of data The investigator will arrange for the retention of the study&#xD;
      documentation file for 5 years. All data and documents should be made available if requested&#xD;
      11 STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL METHODS 11.1 Statistical analysis plan (SAP) The plan is&#xD;
      described in the following sections. However, the SAPs will allow protocol amendments or&#xD;
      unexpected issues in study execution or data that affect planned analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.2 Analysis populations The intention-to-monitor (&quot;ITM&quot;) population will consist of all&#xD;
      patients who have been randomized, i.e., when the patient number and allocated monitoring&#xD;
      method are recorded in study-data base.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be analyzed by the monitoring method assigned. Patients will contribute to&#xD;
      patient years during the time they are in the study For patient year analysis the following&#xD;
      patients will be censored at the last day the patient had a complete assessment for study&#xD;
      outcomes within the intended treatment duration. Patients who did not have a thromboembolic&#xD;
      or bleeding event during the time of the predefined randomized test duration, patients lost&#xD;
      to follow-up patients who died because of other reasons than thromboembolic events patients&#xD;
      who withdrew informed consent before the end of the predefined treatment duration and who did&#xD;
      not have an efficacy or safety outcome. The per-protocol-population (PPP) will consist of all&#xD;
      randomized patients without any major deviation from the protocol. The following deviations&#xD;
      will lead to exclusion from the PP population: Patients not tested according to allocation or&#xD;
      no VKA treatment received at all 11.3 Study population/sample size and power/ demographics&#xD;
      and patient characteristics Baseline characteristics: Demographic characteristics (including&#xD;
      age, sex, indications for anticoagulation, concomitant drug use) will be summarized by&#xD;
      treatment group using descriptive statistics and the groups will be compared with regard to&#xD;
      baseline characteristics using traditional statistical methods. As, all major clinical events&#xD;
      are likely to be admitted to Landspitali, the only acute care hospital in the Reykjavik area,&#xD;
      loss to follow-up is expected to be negligible. Therefore, no adjustment of sample size is&#xD;
      considered necessary. Patients excluded from the analysis population in the per protocol&#xD;
      analysis will be listed by test method and reason for exclusion. The number and percentage of&#xD;
      randomized patients who discontinued from the study prematurely will be tabulated by main&#xD;
      reason for discontinuation and treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.3.1 Non-inferiority margin estimation This study is powered for analysis of successful&#xD;
      anticoagulation treatment and monitoring. For this calculation we have used data from studies&#xD;
      on the clinical outcome of patients with mixed indications for anticoagulation, monitored and&#xD;
      dosed by anticoagulation management centers (Palareti, Leali et al. 1996; Wilson, Wells et&#xD;
      al. 2003; Abdelhafiz and Wheeldon 2004; Menendez-Jandula, Souto et al. 2005). In these&#xD;
      studies the combined endpoints of major bleeding and thromboembolic events ranged from 2.7 to&#xD;
      7.3 per 100 patients years and event rate for thromboembolic events was 0.9 to 5.4 per 100&#xD;
      patient years (0.9-5.4%) with the lower margin of the 95% CI ranging form 2.9 to 8.2%. The&#xD;
      largest observational study (Palareti, Leali et al. 1996; Wilson, Wells et al. 2003;&#xD;
      Abdelhafiz and Wheeldon 2004; Menendez-Jandula, Souto et al. 2005) and the only randomized&#xD;
      study (Palareti, Leali et al. 1996; Wilson, Wells et al. 2003; Abdelhafiz and Wheeldon 2004;&#xD;
      Menendez-Jandula, Souto et al. 2005) had an TE event rate of 3.5 and 5.4% respectively. We&#xD;
      therefore chose to use 3% TE-event rate as our expected TE-event rate (97% success rate) and&#xD;
      the non-inferiority of 5.5% (94.5% success rate for efficacy). We consider this 2.5%&#xD;
      difference one that is clinically significant, yet within the 95% CI for event rate in some&#xD;
      prior studies. Based on these considerations, the appropriate number of participants needed&#xD;
      to demonstrate statistical non-inferiority of clinically important events for the test method&#xD;
      with an 80% certainty after one year of observation are about 600 (576) patients in each&#xD;
      group, i.e. 600 (576) patient years in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.4 Major event analysis (Efficacy and safety analysis) Major events analyses, primarily the&#xD;
      TE event rate (efficacy) but also the secondary end points of the rate of bleeding and major&#xD;
      bleeding (safety) as well as the combined endpoint of TE events and major bleeding events&#xD;
      will be based on the ITT population. For the primary and secondary endpoints, event free&#xD;
      survival will be compared in the two groups using Kaplan-Meier curves. Optionally, the time&#xD;
      to the first events will be analyzed using Cox's proportional hazard models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.5 Interim analysis 11.5.1 Study monitoring The study progress will be monitored&#xD;
      continuously. Interim analysis for safety purposes is planned at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Based&#xD;
      on this, risk-benefit will be evaluated by the DSMB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.6 Surrogate endpoint analysis Median time within target range, time until stable INR as&#xD;
      well as other surrogate parameters will be evaluated using the Mann-Whitney test for numeric&#xD;
      rows or other appropriate statistical tests.&#xD;
