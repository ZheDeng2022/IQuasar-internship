    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double blind, cross-over study to evaluate the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of CNV1014802 in subjects with neuropathic pain from lumbosacral radiculopathy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study consists of two treatment periods of 22 days with randomized CNV1014802 350mg or&#xD;
      placebo administered twice daily. In addition, single blind placebo will be administered&#xD;
      during a two week run-in, a two week wash-out period between the two treatment periods, and a&#xD;
      one week run-out phase.&#xD;
