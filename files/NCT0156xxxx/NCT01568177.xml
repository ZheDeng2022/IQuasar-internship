      Microvascular coronary dysfunction (MCD) (abnormities in small blood vessels/arteries in&#xD;
      heart) with symptoms of persistent chest pain impacts women. There are an estimated 2-3&#xD;
      million women in the US with MCD and about 100,000 new cases annually. Autonomic nervous&#xD;
      system (ANS) is part of the central nervous system to help people adapt to changes in their&#xD;
      environment. It controls what are normally involuntary activities, such as heart rate,&#xD;
      respiration (breathing), body temperature, blood pressure, and urinary function. However,&#xD;
      there is a limited understanding of the role of ANS in MCD. This research is proposed to&#xD;
      investigate cardiovascular reactivity to mental stress and the cardiac (heart) nervous system&#xD;
      in women with MCD using mental stress testing, peripheral vascular testing, advanced cardiac&#xD;
      imaging and cardiac autonomic function testing. 100 participants will be recruited in the&#xD;
      next five years.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are three groups in this study: 40 MCD subjects with abnormal coronary reactivity&#xD;
      testing (CRT), 20 CSX subjects with symptoms and nomral stress testing, and 40 normal&#xD;
      controls. Normal controls will complete two study visits while MCD subjects may have up to&#xD;
      three study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruiting participants from Protocol 14906:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no participants from Protocol 14906 have completed the study yet. All the&#xD;
      participants who are currently enrolled in 14906 will be approached by the investigator at&#xD;
      their next study visits. Prospectively new participants will be approached while they are&#xD;
      consented for 14906.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruiting participants from Protocol 11753:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are currently enrolled in Protocol 11753 will be approached at their next&#xD;
      study visits. Prospectively new participants will be approached while they are consented for&#xD;
      11753. Research staff may also identify past patients who have completed 11753 and fulfill&#xD;
      the requirements for healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to undergo research procedures including mental stress tasks,&#xD;
      heart rate variability, cold pressor testing, and peripheral arterial tonometry. These&#xD;
      procedures are described below by visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT ONE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MENTAL STRESS TESTING Mental Stress Testing will be used to study what happens to heart rate,&#xD;
      blood pressure, heart rhythm, and blood vessels in arms and hands when participants are in a&#xD;
      stressful situation. It will take up to 3 hours to complete all the procedures in the mental&#xD;
      stress testing including the following specific procedures: In Mental Stress Tasks, different&#xD;
      types of stress testing, including a speech task over a situation that made participants&#xD;
      upset or angry, and/or a math test involving adding or subtracting numbers under a specific&#xD;
      constraint, and/or a memory test, will be administered to study the effect of stress on&#xD;
      heart; In Heart Rate Variability (HRV), participants will be asked to wear a Holter monitor&#xD;
      that measures heart rate and rhythm for approximately 24 hours; In Cold Pressor Testing,&#xD;
      participants' heart rate, blood pressure, heart rhythm, and blood vessels will be monitored;&#xD;
      In Peripheral Arterial Tonometry (PAT), a blood pressure cuff will be placed on one arm and&#xD;
      probes will be placed on participants' fingers. The probes and cuff are attached to a&#xD;
      monitoring device that transfers a waveform graph of participants' pulse. Then the blood&#xD;
      pressure cuff will be inflated for 5 minutes. At the end of the 5-minute period, the blood&#xD;
      pressure cuff will be deflated to get the final tracings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESPERATE BREATHING TRIAL In subjects who have MCD, to know whether a controlled breathing&#xD;
      relaxation technique using an FDA-approved paced breathing device, RESPeRATE, helps with&#xD;
      chest pain and shortness of breath and to test to see if this form of biofeedback or&#xD;
      relaxation technique helps with heart rate variability during mental stress, MCD subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized to completing a RESPeRATE breathing trial or performing their own choice&#xD;
      of relaxation technique for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT TWO:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SINGLE PHOTON EMISSION COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (SPECT) CARDIAC SCAN WITH 123I-MIBG AND MYOVIEW&#xD;
      Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) cardiac scan with 123I-mIBG and Myoview&#xD;
      will be used to measure cardiac sympathetic activity. The test will take approximately 5&#xD;
      hours with approximately 3.5 hours of break in the middle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT THREE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      REPEATED MENTAL STRESS TESTING Only subjects with MCD will have the visit that will take&#xD;
      about 3 hours to complete. During this visit, MCD subjects will be asked to complete repeated&#xD;
      Mental Stress Testing, including Mental Stress Tasks, Holter Heart Rate Variability, and PAT&#xD;
      testing as outlined above&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the procedures are research-related. Participants may consent to some but not all of the&#xD;
      procedures due to our current limited funding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no collaborations with other sites.&#xD;
