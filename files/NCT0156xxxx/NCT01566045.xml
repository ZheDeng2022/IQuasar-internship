      This study will determine if targeted (Magnetic Resonance (MR) / Ultrasound (US) fusion&#xD;
      biopsy) plus conventional biopsy is superior to conventional biopsy alone in diagnosing&#xD;
      subjects with prostate cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The efficacy of targeting lesions for surgery may be limited by the visibility of a target&#xD;
      during the procedure. The successful outcome of surgical intervention depends upon accurate&#xD;
      device placement, which may be very challenging in certain settings, such as when a kidney&#xD;
      tumor only is visible for a brief moment during the transient arterial phase of a contrast&#xD;
      injection, and soon disappearing on dynamic imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, prostate cancer was diagnosed by digitally guided trans-rectal prostate&#xD;
      biopsies. With PSA (Prostate SPecific Antigen) screening and improvements in ultrasonography,&#xD;
      trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided prostate biopsy have become the standard of care to&#xD;
      screen and diagnose localized prostate cancer. Standard US 12-14 core prostate biopsy is now&#xD;
      common practice, detecting cancer in 27% to 44% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate MR imaging with the addition of an endorectal-coil probe and a 3 Tesla magnet&#xD;
      dramatically improves diagnostic utility dramatically but biopsies are difficult,&#xD;
      time-consuming, and require specialized equipment, which increases the cost significantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To meet this challenge TRUS images are overlaid on a previously obtained prostate MRI,&#xD;
      combined with an electromagnetic tracking system. The urologist then performs directed&#xD;
      prostate biopsies at MR-identified targets in addition to the standard 12-14 core biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of comparison of the standard of care (TRUS guided prostate biopsy)&#xD;
      with the protocol biopsy which consists of a TRUS guided prostate biopsy and a MR/US fusion&#xD;
      tracked prostate biopsy. Each patient will act as their own control.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. All patients must have a pre-operative MRI performed in accordance with our&#xD;
             NSHSLIJ/NIH MR prostate imaging guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age greater than 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No serious concurrent medical illness that would preclude the patient from making a&#xD;
             rational informed decision on participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent form, and&#xD;
             to comply with the protocol. If in question, an ethics consult will be obtained.&#xD;
