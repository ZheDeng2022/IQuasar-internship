  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability, and the biological&#xD;
      effects of the chimeric anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody Chi Lob 7/4, given intravenously,&#xD;
      weekly for 4 weeks in the treatment of patients with advanced malignancies refractory to&#xD;
      conventional anti-cancer treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to establish the safety and maximum tolerated dose of&#xD;
      Chi Lob 7/4. In line with other established antineoplastic, chimeric monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      therapies such as Rituximab, Chi Lob 7/4 will be given by slow intravenous infusion once&#xD;
      every week for a total of four weeks. This treatment regimen will facilitate early, rapid and&#xD;
      dose dense administration of antibody to a patient group with advanced malignancy refractory&#xD;
      to conventional treatment. The starting dose for each infusion of Chi Lob 7/4 will be 0.5mg&#xD;
      (giving a total dose per patient of 2mg divided over 4 weeks). Escalation from one treatment&#xD;
      dose level to another will only be permitted when at least 3 patients have completed&#xD;
      treatment without dose limiting toxicity.&#xD;

    <description>3 patients will receive treatment at each dose level. Escalation from one treatment dose level to another will only be permitted once at least 3 patients have completed treatment without any DLTs. Starting weekly dose of Chi Lob 7/4 will be 0.5mg (giving a total dose per patient of 2mg divided over 4 weeks). Subsequent individual, weekly dose levels of 1.6mg, 5mg, 16mg, 50mg and 160mg (resulting in total patient doses of 6.4mg, 20mg, 64mg 200mg and 640mg respectively). Further dose escalation can continue to 240mg and 320mg dose per week (resulting in 960mg and 1280mg. Patients may be treated at a lower or intermediate dose level to define the MTD/BAD.</description>
