  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether a focused questionnaire and laboratory tests can&#xD;
      better define risk factors associated with possible genetic porphyria. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the genetic carrier state of acute porphyria is distinctive enough that the&#xD;
      Genetic Carrier Profile the investigators devise through this study will be useful in&#xD;
      identifying carriers of genetic porphyria among the large population with undiagnosed&#xD;
      abdominal pain.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The porphyrias are a group of genetic diseases caused by disturbances in the formation of&#xD;
      heme, an essential component of hemoglobin and other proteins, leading to either acute&#xD;
      (neurologic) and/or chronic (cutaneous) symptoms. Acute porphyria is often difficult to&#xD;
      diagnose because symptoms may not be specific and, unless the patient is in an active attack,&#xD;
      laboratory values typically may not be useful for diagnosing porphyria. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to test whether a focused questionnaire and laboratory evaluation tool can better&#xD;
      define risk factors associated with possible genetic porphyria. The goals of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the presence and number of abnormal lab tests and porphyria-like symptoms&#xD;
           in adult family members of the first person in a family who has been diagnosed with a&#xD;
           disease of acute porphyria, 50% of whom are expected to carry the same genetic defect of&#xD;
           the index case.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To devise a Genetic Carrie Profile that could be used to screen people in whom the&#xD;
           diagnosis of porphyria is being considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the Profile in patients with symptoms suggestive of HCP and/or urine tests&#xD;
           showing some elevation of porphyrins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explain other possible causes of minor increases in porphyrin levels in patients with&#xD;
           recurrent abdominal pain who have not been diagnosed with porphyria&#xD;

        Group 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals who are first-degree relatives of a patient with one of the acute porphyrias&#xD;
        (AIP, HCP, VP). They will complete questionnaires and laboratory tests, including genetic&#xD;
        testing for porphyria. The data will be used to develop a clinical profile for the risk&#xD;
        factors associated with the genetic carrier state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who possibly have acute porphyria, but do not have a confirmed diagnosis based on&#xD;
        genetic testing. They will serve to test the validity of the clinical index derived from&#xD;
        Group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have been seen by one of the Porphyria Consortium physicians/investigators 10&#xD;
        or more years ago, but were not given a diagnosis of porphyria. They will complete a&#xD;
        questionnaire to determine whether they received a porphyria diagnosis, or another&#xD;
        diagnosis that might explain the initial presentation.&#xD;
