  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children hospitalized due to an acute disease may suffer from acute malnutrition or chronic&#xD;
      malnutrition caused by chronic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aimed to evaluate the use of the Screening Tool for the Assessment of Malnutrition in&#xD;
      Pediatrics (STAMP) among children admitted in a pediatric hospital, and assess its effect on&#xD;
      medical staff's awareness to nutritional status and health outcomes at discharge.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition prevalence upon admission to paediatric hospitals remains considerably high,&#xD;
      ranging from 7.3 to 17.9% in the developed world with higher prevalence rates in infants and&#xD;
      toddlers and particularly high rates for specific medical conditions. Several studies have&#xD;
      reported deterioration of nutritional status during hospitalization. Screening children for&#xD;
      malnutrition risk is recommended by a number of international organizations such as the&#xD;
      American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN), the European Society for&#xD;
      Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ESPEN) and the European Society for Paediatric&#xD;
      Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Tool for the Assessment of Malnutrition in Pediatrics (STAMP) was chosen for this&#xD;
      study because it is highly applicable, frequently used by nurses and has shown high&#xD;
      reproducibility, as well as concurrent and predictive validity. The tool was developed by&#xD;
      McCarthy et al11 in England. It collects the following information to assess nutritional risk&#xD;
      for a patient: discrepancy between the weight and height percentile weight for the age&#xD;
      expected nutritional risk caused by clinical diagnosis, recent changes in the appetite. The&#xD;
      assessment results are used to define if there is a need for a referral to a full nutritional&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;

      Pediatrics among children admitted in a pediatric hospital, and assess its effect on medical&#xD;

    <description>The growth chart tables accepted in England, CDC (Centers for Disease Control will be used in order to compare weight and height and generate them into the BMI. The children will be divided into 3 nutritional risk groups: low, moderate and high according to the STAMP toll assessment and the results will be compared to the dietician's complete assessment. Nutritional assessment will include: demographic and medical data, daily nutritional intake, blood tests, anthropometric measurements.</description>
