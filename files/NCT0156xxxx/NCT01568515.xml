      Introduction: Although vaccination against HPV and subsequent HPV-related cancers is a&#xD;
      significant breakthrough, uptake is low. We sought to understand whether a low-cost&#xD;
      intervention of electronic (text and/or email) appointment reminders coupled with electronic&#xD;
      health educational messaging about HPV and the HPV vaccine could increase HPV vaccine uptake&#xD;
      and knowledge among college students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Study participants included both female and male English speaking students between&#xD;
      the ages of 18-26 who attended a large university in North Carolina. Students were randomized&#xD;
      to the intervention or control group. Intervention group participants received the electronic&#xD;
      messaging while the control group received standard of care at the student health center&#xD;
      across a 7-month study period. Baseline and follow-up survey data was collected. Main outcome&#xD;
      measures were completion of HPV-2 and HPV-3 and HPV and HPV vaccine knowledge. Study&#xD;
      recruitment ran from August 2011 to December 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Completion rates for the intervention and control group were similar for HPV-2 (53%&#xD;
      vs. 52%) and HPV-3 (34% vs. 32%), respectively. The mean knowledge score at follow-up for&#xD;
      intervention group participants (n=44, mean knowledge score = 93%, SD = 0.08) was&#xD;
      significantly higher (p=0.01) than the mean knowledge score at baseline (n=44, mean knowledge&#xD;
      score = 87%, SD = 0.11). No significant changes in knowledge from baseline to follow-up were&#xD;
      found for control group participants. The single most important predictor of HPV vaccine&#xD;
      uptake overall was female gender where female participants were 2.35 times [confidence&#xD;
      interval (CI) 1.17-4.69] as likely to complete the series as compared to male participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: In this sample of college students, the electronic messaging intervention&#xD;
      increased knowledge but not uptake. More randomized controlled trials on the efficacy of HPV&#xD;
      vaccine electronic reminder interventions for catch-up age populations for both females and&#xD;
      males are needed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oncogenic types of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection can cause cervical cancer, with HPV&#xD;
      types 16 and 18 causing roughly 70% of cervical cancers worldwide.1 Persistent HPV infection&#xD;
      has also been linked to vaginal and vulvar cancer in women, penile cancer in men, as well as&#xD;
      oral pharyngeal cancer, anal cancer, and genital warts in both sexes.2-4 There are two safe&#xD;
      and effective vaccines which protect against HPV types 16 and 18 and one of the two vaccines&#xD;
      (HPV4) also protects against two additional HPV types that account for 90% of the cases of&#xD;
      genital warts.5 Because HPV vaccination provides maximum protection if administered prior to&#xD;
      sexual debut, HPV4 guidelines recommend administration to males and females ages 11 and 12,&#xD;
      with catch-up vaccination up to age 26, for the prevention of cervical and anal cancers as&#xD;
      well as for the prevention of genital warts.1,5-8 Although vaccination against HPV-related&#xD;
      cancers is a significant breakthrough, uptake is low. The National Immunization Survey-Teen&#xD;
      (NIS-teen) estimated that in 2013, HPV vaccination coverage for 13-17 year-old females was&#xD;
      37.6%, while for males in the same age group coverage was 13.9%. Additionally, coverage for&#xD;
      13-17 year-old females dropped slightly between 2011 and 2012.9 Although vaccination coverage&#xD;
      for teens has been increasing over time overall, these rates are far from meeting the Healthy&#xD;
      People 2020 goal of 80% of 13-15 year old females being fully vaccinated against HPV by 2020.&#xD;
      In addition to teens, it has been shown that there is a benefit to providing HPV vaccines to&#xD;
      young adults, even those who have already been sexually active. However, an NIS-adult study&#xD;
      showed that only 10-12% of 18-26 year-old women are completing the HPV vaccine series.10&#xD;
      Additionally, studies have found significantly lower completion rates among African&#xD;
      Americans.9,11-12 This is problematic given that African American women demonstrate a&#xD;
      mortality rate from cervical cancer that is twice that of Caucasian women.13 It has also been&#xD;
      suggested that lack of knowledge may be a barrier to vaccine adherence14 and that educational&#xD;
      interventions may increase adherence among 18-26 year-old women.12 Given the importance of&#xD;
      immunizing young adults for the prevention of cancer and given the low uptake of HPV vaccines&#xD;
      in this group, it is important to develop and evaluate strategies to increase use and&#xD;
      adherence among this population. We sought to understand whether a low-cost intervention of&#xD;
      electronic (text and/or email) appointment reminders coupled with electronic health&#xD;
      educational messaging about HPV and the HPV vaccine could increase HPV vaccine utilization,&#xD;
      adherence, and knowledge among college students (both female and male) attending a large&#xD;
      university in eastern North Carolina. Although we only found one peer-reviewed study that&#xD;
      assessed text and email electronic HPV reminders primarily among adolescents, we found a few&#xD;
      other studies that assessed mail and telephone HPV vaccination reminders among adolescents.&#xD;
      All of these studies found vaccination reminders to be effective in increasing adherence&#xD;
      among adolescents and/or young adults.15-17 Hard copy and electronic messaging reminders have&#xD;
      also proven to be effective when coupled with other prevention strategies such as&#xD;
      immunizations for influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia as well as screening for colon,&#xD;
      breast, and cervical cancer in adults.18 We found no literature that tested electronic HPV&#xD;
      vaccine interventions among a college population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary hypothesis was that students who receive the intervention would be more compliant&#xD;
      in their uptake of the second (HPV-2) and third (HPV-3) doses of the vaccine as compared to&#xD;
      the control group. Secondarily, we further hypothesized that students that receive the&#xD;
      intervention will demonstrate higher knowledge about HPV and the HPV vaccine as compared to&#xD;
      the control group and that African American students and younger students (defined as 18-19&#xD;
      years of age) would be less compliant as compared to Caucasian and older students (defined as&#xD;
      students 20 and older), as demonstrated in the literature. Lastly, we sought to describe&#xD;
      satisfaction of health messages and reminders among those that received it.&#xD;
