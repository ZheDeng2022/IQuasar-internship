      The rehabilitation of patients affected by defects of the jaws after tumor resection is still&#xD;
      very challenging. Resection can lead to significant facial deformity, impaired oral functions&#xD;
      such as speech, swallowing, saliva retention, and concomitant psychological problems.&#xD;
      Moreover, the loss of teeth and the alveolar and basal jawbone can lead to significant&#xD;
      impairment of mastication. The reconstruction of such defects with autogenous bone grafts or&#xD;
      revascularized free flaps has become a valuable means for the rehabilitation of these&#xD;
      patients. Major benefits of such procedure include an usually low morbidity of the donor site&#xD;
      and an extensive length of the bone graft. Moreover, vascularized grafts provide a good bulk&#xD;
      of bone in which to place implants and a satisfactory contour. In fact, after reconstruction,&#xD;
      local hard and soft tissue conditions often exclude the integration of conventional dentures&#xD;
      because of the impairment of dental prosthetic retention by thin cutaneous tissue, the&#xD;
      thickness of subcutaneous tissues, the absence of a perilingual and vestibular groove, and&#xD;
      the fragility of soft tissues. In Literature it has been well established the high biologic&#xD;
      value of vascularized fibula grafts regarding the potential of implant osseointegration,&#xD;
      which seemed to be equal to regional mandibular or maxillary bone and eventually capable to&#xD;
      provide sufficient stabilization of prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It must be kept in mind that the final prosthetic success may be affected by some&#xD;
      difficulties in this clinical scenario. These include the limited opening of the&#xD;
      scar-contracted oral cavity, the huge amount of soft tissue covering the fibula, with little&#xD;
      information about the profile of the underlying harvested bone, the need for limited bony&#xD;
      exposure in a field that may well have been irradiated and they all may cause poor&#xD;
      prosthetically-guided implant positioning and eventually disappointing results in dental&#xD;
      rehabilitation, either functionally or esthetically. It can be postulated that these&#xD;
      complications can be overcome, or at least reduced, by adopting the new methods of computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT)-assisted implant surgery.&#xD;
