      This purpose of this study it to characterize the walking patterns of children diagnosed with&#xD;
      Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)and Lymphoblastic Lymphoma (LL) at different times in the&#xD;
      treatment protocol and after completion of treatment. Their walking patterns will be compared&#xD;
      to children without ALL or LL to see if their walking patterns are different at specific&#xD;
      times in their treatment program or up to 10 years after completion of their treatment. The&#xD;
      investigators will gather data by observing how the child walks, runs, hops on one foot and&#xD;
      climbs stairs and by recording walking patterns on a pressure sensitive mat. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare this data to children without ALL and LL.&#xD;

      Cases will be identified and referred by the primary oncologist or by the Childhood Cancer&#xD;
      Survivorship team. When a possible subject has been identified they will be contacted via&#xD;
      telephone or during a routine clinic visit to determine their interest in the study. Two&#xD;
      hundred subjects will be recruited for participation with the goal of 5-10 subjects at each&#xD;
      of the 14 times points across the treatment protocol and survivorship. These time points to&#xD;
      include: at diagnosis, the start of consolidation therapy, the start of interim maintenance&#xD;
      therapy, the start of delayed intensification therapy, Day 29 of delayed intensification&#xD;
      therapy, the start of interim maintenance II therapy (if applicable), Day 1 of cycle 1,3,5 of&#xD;
      maintenance therapy, end of therapy, and 1, 3, 5, and 10 years off therapy ( +/-1 year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will be collected from the medical record, roadmaps documenting cancer-directed&#xD;
      therapy, direct patient interview and examination by the physical therapist during the study&#xD;
      evaluation. Clinical data will include: Date of birth (to calculate age at diagnosis and&#xD;
      current age); Gender; Race and Ethnicity; Primary cancer diagnosis; Date of Primary Cancer&#xD;
      Diagnosis; Chemotherapeutic agents received (agent name, cumulative dose and date received);&#xD;
      Radiation therapy (date received, site radiated, and dose delivered); Any other clinical&#xD;
      conditions affecting musculoskeletal performance; Dates of previous PT; Pain score at the&#xD;
      time of study participation. Height, weight, shoe size and leg length will be collected at&#xD;
      time of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete a self report of the PedsQL™ Generic Core Scale and the parents will&#xD;
      complete the parental report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observation gait assessment will include hopping on one foot, running and walking 30' and&#xD;
      ascending/descending stairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temporal spatial gait parameters will be recorded on the GaitRite mat&#xD;
