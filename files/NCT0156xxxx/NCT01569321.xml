    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the first cancer in women, the second etiology of death by cancer and the&#xD;
      first cause for women between 35 and 55 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic tools and large screening have been realized with positive impact in a recent&#xD;
      review with 31% less likely to die of breast cancer over nearly 30 years compared to women&#xD;
      who didn't get regular screening mammograms. Diagnostic tools and treatment also are&#xD;
      improving continuously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, for some women, breast cancer diagnosis is difficult, in case of high density&#xD;
      breast, breast modifications after surgery… In these cases, breast MRI is currently the best&#xD;
      imaging tool, with high sensitivity about 90% but with a lower specificity about 60%, that&#xD;
      lead to futile biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, molecular imaging with PET-CT scan with 18FDG has permitted to widely modify cancer&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, PET-CT scan is not a good imaging tool for initial diagnostic of breast tumor&#xD;
      because of a lack in spatial resolution about 8mm. So, researchers developed dedicated PET&#xD;
      scan for breast, called Positron Emission Mammography. Our project is in this field of view&#xD;
      and is named CLEARPEMSONIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First clinical studies with PEM showed very good performance of this imaging modality for&#xD;
      initial evaluation of breast tumors. PEM performance is not affected by breast density,&#xD;
      hormonal status. Spatial resolution is less than 3mm. PEM seems complementary with MRI,&#xD;
      adding a better specificity value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the field of CERIMED, ClearPemSonic Project aims to evaluate an new imaging tool which&#xD;
      combined PEM scan and ultrasonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technologic evaluation was made. Now a feasibility study is the first step for clinical&#xD;
      applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this project is to confirm the feasibility of PEM scan with the&#xD;
      ClearPEmSonic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to compare results with other conventional imaging modalities and&#xD;
      MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard will be histology of the breast tumor.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years&#xD;

          -  Mammary Néoplasia ready(in position) (diagnosed on histological taking of type(chap)&#xD;
             biopsy)&#xD;
