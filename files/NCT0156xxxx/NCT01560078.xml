    <textblock>
      Tubercular pleural effusion is the second most common form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis&#xD;
      (EPTB) seen in clinical practice after tuberculosis (TB) lymphadenitis. It is common that&#xD;
      after complete treatment of the patient with tubercular pleural effusion with six months of&#xD;
      the short-course chemotherapy under Directly Observed Treatment Short-Course (DOTS), pleural&#xD;
      effusion has not resolved completely. In these cases treatment need to be extended for one or&#xD;
      two more months by giving extension pouches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since DOTS does not recommend demonstration of complete resolution of tubercular pleural&#xD;
      effusion at the end of treatment completion, there is paucity of data in terms of the&#xD;
      patients declared cure for the sputum negative pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB as such which&#xD;
      includes TB pleural effusion as well. This project aims to look into the patient&#xD;
      characteristics, treatment outcome, and compute the number of cases which require an extended&#xD;
      regimen and to what extent is the pleural effusion persistent at the end of six months of&#xD;
      standard DOTS therapy.&#xD;

      India's Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP), based on Directly Observed&#xD;
      Treatment Short-Course (DOTS) strategy, began as a pilot project in 1993 and was launched as&#xD;
      a national program in 1997. Three categories of treatment were recommended based on disease&#xD;
      characteristics. Category III regimen comprised of thrice-weekly isoniazid, rifampicin and&#xD;
      pyrazinamide in the intensive phase; with isoniazid and rifampicin in the continuation phase.&#xD;
      This regimen was recommended for sputum smear negative and extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB)&#xD;
      patients who were not seriously ill. The omission of ethambutol in non-cavitary,&#xD;
      smear-negative pulmonary TB patients who were known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
      negative was endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. However, in view of&#xD;
      high level of initial resistance to isoniazid in many areas, recent guidelines recommend&#xD;
      adding ethambutol in the intensive phase, effectively eliminating category III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed as a multicentre, longitudinal observational study and was carried&#xD;
      out between 2006 and 2011. Three hundred and sixty patients were planned to be enrolled&#xD;
      across 4 centres, namely AIIMS (New Delhi), SMS Medical College (Jaipur), SVIMS (Tirupati)&#xD;
      and BJ Medical College (Ahmedabad); i.e. 90 patients at each centre. Lost to&#xD;
      follow-up/default rate of 12% was expected in the study. Recruitment was done from the study&#xD;
      sites directly as well as from referrals via nearby DOTS centres, hospitals and chest&#xD;
      clinics.&#xD;
