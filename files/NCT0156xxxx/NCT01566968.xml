  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sensitivity of a person's cough reflex can be measured by getting them to breathe in&#xD;
      (inhale) irritant chemicals. There are different methods by which subjects are asked to&#xD;
      inhale these chemicals, either by taking one deep breath in, or by asking them to just&#xD;
      continue to take a number of breaths. The purpose of this clinical research study is to see&#xD;
      if the coughing responses are different in healthy people and people with respiratory&#xD;
      problems that make them cough when they are given these chemicals in these two methods.&#xD;
