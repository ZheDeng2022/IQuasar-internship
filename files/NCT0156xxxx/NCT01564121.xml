  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The giant cell tumor (GTC) is an aggressive benign bone tumor, growing at the&#xD;
      metaphyseal-epiphyseal regions of long bones, especially around the knee and the distal&#xD;
      radius.It is responsible for bony destruction in para-articular zone fracture and leading to&#xD;
      the breakdown and destruction of the underlying joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologically, the tumor cell contains a contingent of monocytic cells round, a contingent&#xD;
      of giant type cell of type osteoclastic responsible for bone resorption that accompanies&#xD;
      these tumors and a contingent of lengthened cells fibroblast-like considered to be contingent&#xD;
      tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment is exclusively surgical; or by resection of the lesion which takes away tumour&#xD;
      and its environment, solution which, if it prevents local recurrence, imposes an important&#xD;
      bony and articular reconstruction, always limited and deteriorating rapidly over time in&#xD;
      these young patients; or by curettage of lesion, by &quot;hollowing-out&quot; of the bone, creating a&#xD;
      hole which it will be necessary to fill up by a bony grafting or a substitute of the bone&#xD;
      (cement). This last solution, if it preserves a better function, exposes at risk of local&#xD;
      recurrence,putting into play the prognosis of articulation near, most often the knee.Despite&#xD;
      different local adjuvants treatments used during surgical operation, after having curetted&#xD;
      the cavity and before filling it up, the recidivism rates vary from 12 % to 41 % (average 25&#xD;
      %) in literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The beneficial effect of the adjuvants therapeutics suggests the concept broadly accepted by&#xD;
      a tumoral microscopic residual at the origin of the local recidivism .Biphosphonates (BP) is&#xD;
      molecules which settle in vivo on the hydroxyapatite of the bone; they inhibit the&#xD;
      recruitment of the osteoclast forerunners and the activity of mature osteoclast. Besides,&#xD;
      biphosphonates containing some nitrogen (N-BP), leads to the apoptose of mature osteoclast.&#xD;
      These molecules also have a direct effect on tumor cells , causing apoptosis of neoplastic&#xD;
      cells of myeloma, of breast cancer. Clinical controlled studies confirm the experimental data&#xD;
      of N-BP. Two work also showed their effect on osteoclasts and stroma cells of tumours with&#xD;
      giant cells but no clinical study assessed potential on the prevention of the local&#xD;
      recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators offer a study phase 2 of the effectiveness of N-BP (acid zoledronique) on&#xD;
      the prevention of the local recurrence of tumours with primary huge cells after surgical&#xD;
      treatment by curettage - filing by a surgeon referent in oncologic orthopedic surgery.&#xD;

      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Main: occurrence of recurrence detectable by Reasonable Magnetic Imaging (IRM) and / or&#xD;
      standardized radiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local recurrence will be discussed in the presence or appearance on the radiographic and IRM&#xD;
      monitoring of an osteolysis in the periphery of the cavity curetted, does not exist on the&#xD;
      radio in post-operative with IRM signal abnormalities in the same location,taking the&#xD;
      gadolinium. If in doubt, a new surgical biopsy will confirm or not the diagnosis of local&#xD;
      recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
      secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical: patient interview, clinical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  biological Complete blood count, creatinine, serum calcium, phosphate, magnesium&#xD;

    <description>Treatment with zoledronic acid will be initiated during hospitalization, the day after the removal of redundant. Intravenous injection of 4 mg. of zoledronate diluted in sodium chloride 9 / 1000 or a solution of 5% dextrose in intravenous over 15 minutes. In the absence of intolerance clinic, an infusion of zoledronic acid in the same doses and modalities will be performed in a hospital (on the occasion of a follow-up visit after surgery) at the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th weeks after the first, or 5 injections. )</description>
