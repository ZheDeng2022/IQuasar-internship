  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multi-center, open-label study of approximately 24 months duration&#xD;
      (including follow up survival) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of obatoclax mesylate in&#xD;
      combination with carboplatin and etoposide versus carboplatin and etoposide alone in&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has histologic or cytologic confirmation (upon local review) of small cell&#xD;
             lung cancer (SCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), as defined by&#xD;
             National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has measurable disease as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria&#xD;
             Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has not received any prior chemotherapy, biological agent, or&#xD;
             investigational drug for SCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0&#xD;
             or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is 18 years of age or older at the time informed consent is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must be accessible for study treatment and follow-up. Patients enrolled in&#xD;
             this study must be treated at participating study centers for all 3 days of study drug&#xD;
             administration in either treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has normal organ function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test 72 hours&#xD;
             prior to study enrollment. Women of childbearing potential and men with partners of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of contraception throughout&#xD;
             the entire study and up to 8 weeks after the last dose of any study drug (including&#xD;
             obatoclax maintenance). Effective contraception or birth control is defined as those&#xD;
             with a low failure rate (less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women must not be breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with asymptomatic brain metastases may be enrolled and if clinically&#xD;
             indicated, may be treated with steroids to be tapered as tolerated by the patient.&#xD;
             Patients with symptomatic brain metastases will be eligible for the study after they&#xD;
             have received therapeutic whole brain irradiation (WBI), which must be completed at&#xD;
             least 7 days before the day of first treatment with study drugs. Since these patients&#xD;
             will also be treated with steroids it is recommended that steroids be tapered as&#xD;
             clinically indicated and tolerated by the patient. The use of chronic, low-dose&#xD;
             steroids is not contraindicated for these patients (or any other patients).&#xD;
             Stereotactic radiation will be allowed for 1 to 3 brain metastatic lesions that meet&#xD;
             appropriate criteria for that procedure; however, this must be discussed with the&#xD;
             study monitor prior to consideration for enrollment into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must be willing and able to comply with study restrictions and to remain&#xD;
             at the study center for the required duration during the study period and willing to&#xD;
             return to the study center for the follow-up evaluation as specified in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has had any prior systemic therapy for ES-SCLC other than radiation&#xD;
             therapy or surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a history of prior malignancy with the exception of cervical&#xD;
             intraepithelial neoplasia, basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or other&#xD;
             localized malignancy that has undergone potentially curative therapy and is deemed by&#xD;
             his or her treating physician to be at low risk for recurrence for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a history of hypersensitivity or allergic reactions attributed to&#xD;
             components of the obatoclax mesylate formulation (ie, polysorbate 20 and polyethylene&#xD;
             glycol [PEG] 300) or to carboplatin or etoposide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient currently has leptomeningeal disease or paraneoplastic syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             symptomatic neurologic illness; active, uncontrolled systemic infection considered&#xD;
             opportunistic, life-threatening, or clinically significant at the time of treatment;&#xD;
             symptomatic congestive heart failure; unstable angina pectoris; clinically significant&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia; significant pulmonary disease or hypoxia; or psychiatric illness&#xD;
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is a pregnant or lactating woman. (Any women becoming pregnant during the&#xD;
             study will be withdrawn from the study but will be monitored for safety.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a positive test result for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or&#xD;
             antibodies to hepatitis C virus (HCV Ab) or a known positive history of antibodies to&#xD;
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and is receiving combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
