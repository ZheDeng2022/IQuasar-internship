        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Probable AD by DSM IV and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females must be surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, both ovaries removed or&#xD;
             hysterectomy) or post-menopausal for at least 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  &gt; 50 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Residing in the community at baseline (includes assisted living facilities, long-term&#xD;
             care nursing facilities)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mini Mental State Examination at screen of 12-26 (inclusive)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No medical contraindications to study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fluent in English at least 8 years of education.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Supervision available for study medication. Caregiver/study partner to accompany&#xD;
             participant to all visits. Study partner must have direct contact with the participant&#xD;
             &gt; 2 days/week&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to ingest oral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neuroimaging (CT or MRI or PET) consistent with the diagnosis of AD at some time after&#xD;
             the onset of the memory decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical laboratory values must be within normal limits or, if abnormal, must be&#xD;
             judged to be clinically insignificant by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable use of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine is permitted if doses are stable&#xD;
             for 3 months prior to enrollment. Dose should be stable throughout the study unless it&#xD;
             is clinically necessary to adjust the medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable use of anti-depressants is permitted if doses are stable for 3 months prior to&#xD;
             enrollment. Dose should be stable throughout the study unless it is clinically&#xD;
             necessary to adjust the medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dementia not due to probable Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy, breastfeeding. The rationale is that retinoids are teratogenic and are&#xD;
             excreted in breast milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of clinically significant stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Modified Hachinski Ischemia score â‰¥ 4&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current evidence or history in past two years of epilepsy, seizure, focal brain&#xD;
             lesion, head injury with loss of consciousness or DSM IV criteria for any major&#xD;
             psychiatric disorder including psychosis, major depression, bipolar disorder, severe&#xD;
             alcohol or substance abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sensory impairment which would prevent subject from participating in or cooperating&#xD;
             with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of another investigational agent within two months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of any significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that renders the&#xD;
             participant unsuitable for receiving an investigational new drug including clinically&#xD;
             significant or unstable hematologic, hepatic, cardiovascular (including history of&#xD;
             ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia), pulmonary, gastrointestinal,&#xD;
             endocrine, metabolic, renal, or other systemic disease or laboratory abnormality.&#xD;
             Abnormal liver function test, including AST, ALT, total bilirubin, or prothrombin&#xD;
             time. The rationale is that retinoids can be hepatotoxic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants receiving behavioral medications (including antidepressants,&#xD;
             antipsychotics and anxiolytics) must be on stable doses for at least 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active neoplastic disease and any medical conditions requiring concurrent&#xD;
             immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypertriglyceridemia greater than 500 mg/dL despite statin/fibrate therapy. The&#xD;
             rationale is that retinoids can increase lipids, particularly triglyceride and this&#xD;
             can lead to pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical conditions requiring concurrent use of tetracycline, minocycline, or&#xD;
             doxycycline. The rationale is due to enhanced risk of increased intracranial pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to retinoids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of psychosis or hallucinations at baseline as determined by Neuropsychiatric&#xD;
             inventory or Geriatric Depression Scale-short form greater than or equal to five&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of any unstable cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled diabetes, chronic&#xD;
             inflammatory or infectious conditions. Retinoids have been associated with chest pain&#xD;
             of unclear etiology, increased serum glucose, myelosuppression and increased risk of&#xD;
             infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of Drugs and supplements such as: Vitamin A supplements beyond 100% RDA, other&#xD;
             immunosuppressants (corticosteroids, chemotherapeutic agents, etc.), Warfarin , Fish&#xD;
             Oil (DHA)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other disease or medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that&#xD;
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product&#xD;
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into&#xD;
             this clinical trial.&#xD;
