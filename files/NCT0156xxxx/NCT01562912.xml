  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia affecting the Canadian population. AF&#xD;
      is associated with increased risk of stroke,HF, and even mortality. AF can cause debilitating&#xD;
      symptoms, adversely affect patient's (pt's) quality of life and functional status. Hence a&#xD;
      strategy of sinus rhythm (SR) may be pursued over a strategy of allowing AF to persist.&#xD;
      Percutaneous catheter ablation is an effective alternative to antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) for&#xD;
      maintaining SR. The success rate of PV isolation off AAD is about 80-90% in pt's with PAF,&#xD;
      but repeat procedures are required in up to 40% of pt's. After one ablation, the success rate&#xD;
      may only be 50-70% off drugs.Current standard ablation procedures for PV antral isolation&#xD;
      employ mapping systems which reconstructions of the LA and PV anatomy are created.&#xD;
      Visualization may be supplemented by integration of CT/ MRI images and/or intracardiac&#xD;
      echocardiography. Robotic navigation has been employed to assist in ablation. Based on single&#xD;
      point unipolar radiofrequency (RF) ablation catheter where lesions are created point-by-point&#xD;
      around the PVs to obtain electrical isolation.This results in lengthy complex, costly&#xD;
      procedures,often more than 4 hours, which requires high degree of operator skill.Creation of&#xD;
      contiguous, transmural lesions is challenging with standard single-point RF. A novel&#xD;
      multipolar catheter ablation system has been evaluated for achieving PV isolation (PVAC&#xD;
      catheter, Medtronic Inc.) An over-the-wire circular mapping/ablation catheter can be advanced&#xD;
      into the PV antrum, and multiple lesions around the circumference of the catheter can be&#xD;
      delivered simultaneously using duty-cycled unipolar and bipolar RF energy. Early reports, the&#xD;
      system can achieve complete PV isolation with reduced fluoroscopy and procedural times using&#xD;
      lower powers to achieve more reliable lesion sets.Long-term efficacy also seems comparable to&#xD;
      standard RF ablation.This novel technology has potential to broaden the application of AF&#xD;
      ablation, making procedures less time-consuming, less complex without compromising procedural&#xD;
      efficacy. Published data PVAC technology outcomes are limited to studies with small sample&#xD;
      sizes of 12-102 pt's. Data has been restricted to a small number of European centers&#xD;
      performing moderate numbers of PVAC procedures. There is no prospective, multicenter data.&#xD;
      Little is known about the efficiency of PVAC procedures, allowing for an assessment of&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness in using this technology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open label, prospective, cohort study. Patients undergoing ablation&#xD;
      with PVAC technology in up to 15 centers across Canada will be enrolled, ablated, and&#xD;
      followed for one year post-ablation. Both primary and secondary objectives of the study will&#xD;
      be determined from this cohort of patients. Comparisons to the traditional ablation methods&#xD;
      will be made by collecting data from a prospective group of control subjects who are&#xD;
      undergoing AF ablation with traditional ablation technology at the same centers by the same&#xD;
      operators. Control patients will be enrolled in a 1:2 ratio compared to the PVAC cohort.&#xD;
      While the final ratio of control to PVAC patients must be 1:2 by study end for each operator,&#xD;
      the ratio may vary while the study is conducted to allow some flexibility in patient&#xD;
      recruitment. However, the absolute difference between [# of PVAC patients] and 2x[# control&#xD;
      patients] should not exceed 5 at any given time for any operator in any study center&#xD;

    <description>Intervention is the use of PVAC technology. The PVAC is deployed in the left atrium over a 0.032-inch guidewire inside the PV and advanced until it is wedged within the antrum proximal to the ostium. Energy is delivered through selected electrode pairs with local potentials as well as adjacent electrode pairs, allowing bipolar current to flow to the target electrode(s) from both sides. Each application lasts for 60 seconds. When the temperature does not rise above 50°C within 15 seconds, the application should be discontinued to improve position. The PVAC may be manipulated within the antrum to ablate in a pattern of overlapping circular lesions.</description>
