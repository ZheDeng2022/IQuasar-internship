  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder that causes the red blood cells to&#xD;
      change their shape from a round shape to a half-moon/crescent or sickled shape. Sickle-shaped&#xD;
      cells can cause problems by getting stuck in blood vessels, blocking blood flow, and can&#xD;
      cause inflammation and injury to important body parts. There are no specific treatments that&#xD;
      improve this condition and promote blood flow hindered by sickle cell blockages. Another big&#xD;
      challenge in managing sickle cell disease is that there are no good measures to determine&#xD;
      changes and improvements in blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is a technique currently used to detect blood flow in the heart,&#xD;
      muscles, and other organs. It is extremely sensitive and can detect blood flow in the&#xD;
      smallest of blood vessels. It would be very useful in helping healthcare providers know&#xD;
      whether treatment strategies are improving blood flow during sickle cell blockages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that contrast-enhanced ultrasound will be a feasible tool for determining&#xD;
      changes in blood flow of subjects with sickle cell disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that affects one of every 400&#xD;
      African-Americans newborns in the United States. Sickle cell disease causes the red blood&#xD;
      cells to change their shape from a round shape to a half-moon sickle shape. Individuals who&#xD;
      have sickle cell disease have a different type of protein that carries oxygen in the blood&#xD;
      (hemoglobin) than individuals without sickle cell disease. This different type of hemoglobin&#xD;
      makes the red blood cell change into a crescent shape under certain conditions. Sickle shaped&#xD;
      cells are a problem because the often get stuck on blood vessels blocking the flow of blood,&#xD;
      and cause inflammation and injury to important areas of the body. These symptoms can lead to&#xD;
      a painful occurrence called a &quot;sickle cell crisis&quot;. Many individuals have to be admitted into&#xD;
      the hospital because of the pain caused by a sickle cell crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regadenoson is a drug that may help prevent inflammation and injury caused by the sickle&#xD;
      shaped cells. This drug is approved by the FDA to be used as a bolus during a heart stress&#xD;
      test in people unable to exercise enough to put stress on the heart by making it beat faster.&#xD;
      In a recent Phase I study, a safe dose for regadenoson was determined for adults with sickle&#xD;
      cell disease. This dose was given by a slow IV infusion for a 24-48 hour period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydroxyurea is the only FDA approved drug for the treatment of sickle cell disease.&#xD;
      Hydroxyurea is a pill taken orally and works well but is not useful during a severe sickle&#xD;
      cell crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study researchers will use a new method, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEU), to&#xD;
      visualize tiny blood vessels in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Changes in CEU measurements&#xD;
      before, during and after administration of regadenoson will be examined. Contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      ultrasounds will also be performed in individuals who are not having a sickle cell crisis.&#xD;
      Some of those individuals will also undergo CEU while they are having a sickle cell crisis to&#xD;
      compare those measurements . Lastly CEU results will be compared between individuals with&#xD;
      sickle cell anemia and healthy African-Americans. These CEU's will be used to determine if&#xD;
      there are changes in the blood flow of tiny blood vessels in certain conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study wants to know if this new method of contrast-enhanced ultrasound will be a useful&#xD;
      tool for physicians to use in individuals with sickle cell anemia. The researchers also want&#xD;
      to determine if this new method of CEU can be used to reveal if some treatments for sickle&#xD;
      cell anemia work better than others.&#xD;
