  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a growing disease and it is a public health concern, and&#xD;
      projections of its future effect are alarming. About one third of those affected will develop&#xD;
      diabetic nephropathy at 20 years after diagnosis. Of these patients, 20% will develop&#xD;
      clinically end-stage renal disease ESRD, requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). Patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes account for most patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) and RRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of the investigators knowledge, the effects of MMF on diabetic nephropathy in&#xD;
      patients with DM type II were not studied so far. Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the effects of Mofetil Mycophenolate (MMF) on proteinuria and progression of&#xD;
      kidney disease of diabetic origin, in patients at high risk for progressive renal failure in&#xD;
      whom other treatment modalities are insufficient or had failed.&#xD;

      The pathophysiology of the diabetic nephropathy was initially considered to be merely&#xD;
      secondary to a non-immune mechanism, specifically due to metabolic (hyperglycemia) and&#xD;
      hemodynamic (glomerular capillary hypertension - mechanical stretching) factors. However, our&#xD;
      understanding of the pathophysiological processes that lead to diabetic nephropathy and its&#xD;
      progression is now clearer and involved not only a non immune mechanism, but also&#xD;
      immune-mediated and inflammatory mechanism. Activation of the immune system, with the&#xD;
      participation of a chronic inflammatory state, plays a central role in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      diabetic nephropathy. Evidence for the involvement of the immune system in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of diabetic nephropathy was derived from the elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-18, and TNF-α. These factors are important predictors of the&#xD;
      development of diabetic nephropathy, and recently it was shown that these inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines play a determinant role in the development and progression of the microvascular&#xD;
      diabetic nephropathy. The first published study that showed the implication of the&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of the diabetic nephropathy was in 1991.&#xD;
      Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) is an immunosuppressant drug, used to prevent rejection,&#xD;
      especially acute rejection in various organ transplantations, mainly kidney transplantation&#xD;
      since 1995. In the last decade there are increasing reports describing the beneficial use of&#xD;
      MMF in immune- mediated and auto-immune disorders such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, IGA&#xD;
      nephropathy and other glomerulopathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the potentially beneficial effects of MMF on diabetic nephropathy were not&#xD;
      examined in clinical DM and is limited to diabetic rats. In a recent study, Utimura et al.&#xD;
      have demonstrated that MMF largely prevented the development of albuminuria and glomerular&#xD;
      injury in experimental diabetic nephropathy. The beneficial effect of MMF was not related to&#xD;
      its action on glomerular hemodynamic or improvement of metabolic control, but probably&#xD;
      related directly to its immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties.&#xD;
