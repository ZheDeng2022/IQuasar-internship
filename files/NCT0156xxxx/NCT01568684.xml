      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Antidepressants help many people with depression, however, some do not seem to benefit as&#xD;
      much. Currently, it is not possible to determine who will improve with certain&#xD;
      antidepressants. Studies have shown that genes may influence whether an antidepressant works&#xD;
      for an individual. Other studies have shown that depressed people tend to have lower levels&#xD;
      of a chemical called glutamate in parts of their brain, and that glutamate levels increase&#xD;
      after recovering from depression. Researchers want to study the antidepressant citalopram&#xD;
      (Celexa) to see how it affects glutamate levels in the brain. They also want to study how a&#xD;
      person s genes affect their response to this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see whether glutamate levels and certain genes affect how a person responds to a&#xD;
      particular antidepressant medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 25 and 55 years of age who have been diagnosed with major depression&#xD;
      (without psychotic features). Participants may not have tried more than three antidepressant&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will answer&#xD;
           questions about mood and current feelings of depression, as well as family history of&#xD;
           depression. Blood and urine samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will have two phases. The first phase may last up to 7 weeks depending on&#xD;
           current antidepressant use and involves one to seven outpatient visits. The second phase&#xD;
           lasts 8 weeks and involves five outpatient visits, one every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the first phase, participants will stop taking their current antidepressant&#xD;
           medications for at least 2 weeks before the next phase of the study. Participants who&#xD;
           are on fluoxetine (Prozac) will need to be off it for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of this phase, participants will have brain imaging studies to look at brain&#xD;
           function and chemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the second phase, participants will take citalopram at the standard dose. They will&#xD;
           answer questions about mood and response to the medication. They will also provide blood&#xD;
           and saliva samples for tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of this phase, participants will have brain imaging studies to look at brain&#xD;
           function and chemistry.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious, debilitating, life-shortening illness that&#xD;
      affects many persons of all ages and backgrounds. Although many patients suffering from MDD&#xD;
      can expect improvement with antidepressant treatment, only a minority experience full&#xD;
      remission, and little is known about the basis for individual differences in treatment&#xD;
      outcome. The rationale for this study follows from the findings that treatment response in&#xD;
      major depression is associated with: 1) variation in the genes encoding the serotonin 2A&#xD;
      receptor (HTR2A) and the KA1 subunit of the glutamate-kainate receptor (GRIK4); and 2)&#xD;
      increases in prefrontal glutamate/glutamine (glx) concentration measured by [+H] magnetic&#xD;
      resonance spectroscopy (MRS). The central hypothesis is that genes associated with citalopram&#xD;
      treatment outcome modulate glutamate concentrations in prefrontal brain (PFB) and thus&#xD;
      facilitate response to citalopram treatment. Such information is important because it would&#xD;
      ultimately allow the development of better treatments for MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 104 moderate to severe MDD outpatients aged 25-55 with a baseline 17-item Hamilton&#xD;
      Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score of greater than or equal to18 who meet DSM-IV criteria&#xD;
      for non-psychotic major depressive disorder (MDD) will be enrolled in the course of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened with an on-site research psychiatric evaluation using a structured&#xD;
      interview (MINI plus). After screening, participants will provide a DNA sample, which will be&#xD;
      analyzed to determine the patient s genotype at several relevant loci. All patients will then&#xD;
      complete an eight-week period of citalopram treatment, during which time they will be&#xD;
      evaluated bi-weekly with self-report questionnaires and clinician ratings to determine change&#xD;
      of MDD symptoms. Participants will also undergo pre- and post-treatment MRS scans to&#xD;
      determine glutamate concentration in the prefrontal brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Clinician-Rated (QIDS-C16) will be the&#xD;
      primary clinical outcome measure and will be collected at baseline and at each treatment&#xD;
      visit. Additionally, levels of glutamate in the prefrontal regions of the brain will be&#xD;
      measured by MRS. Clinical response will be defined as a decrease of 50 percent or greater in&#xD;
      QIDS-C16 score from baseline, and remission will be defined as a QIDS-C16 score of less than&#xD;
      6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal is part of a K99 training grant and has undergone extensive external review&#xD;
      (K99MH085098-01A2).&#xD;
