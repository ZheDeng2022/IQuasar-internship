  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypotension is extremely common after induction of spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery.&#xD;
      Anesthetic blockade of the sympathetic outflow of the spinal cord causes vasodilation, and is&#xD;
      one cause of this hypotension. The higher the spread of the blockade will result in a higher&#xD;
      incidence of hypotension. Injected hyperbaric medication has about 15 minutes to spread&#xD;
      within the intrathecal space before it will be taken up by the nerve roots. The time that a&#xD;
      patient remains in one position after medication injection will affect the spread of the&#xD;
      resultant anesthetic block. A patient who is left sitting for a longer period of time after&#xD;
      injection of hyperbaric medication will have a lower level of block than someone who is&#xD;
      placed supine immediately. In this study, the investigators wish to use up down sequential&#xD;
      analysis to determine the time period a patient should remain seated after intrathecal&#xD;
      injection of hyperbaric bupivacaine that will result in a 50% rate of hypotension.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Up down sequential analysis is a method developed by Dixon to determine the point where 50%&#xD;
      of people will have a positive response and 50% will have a negative response to an&#xD;
      intervention. It is a very powerful technique that has been used to determine the median&#xD;
      effective dose (referred to as ED50) of many medications. Using this method, patient number 1&#xD;
      is given a certain amount of the intervention being studied. If patient 1 has the desired&#xD;
      response, patient 2 in the series is given less of the intervention, and if patient 1 does&#xD;
      not have the desired response, patient 2 is given more of the intervention. This is repeated&#xD;
      through a series of patients until the dose where there is a 50% response rate is determined.&#xD;
      In this study, we wish to use up down sequential analysis to determine the time period a&#xD;
      patient should remain seated after intrathecal injection of hyperbaric medication that result&#xD;
      in a 50% rate of hypotension, what we will call the ET50 (Estimated Time for 50% of patients&#xD;
      to have hypotension). We would like to explore this relationship with 2 clinically used doses&#xD;
      of hyperbaric bupivicaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients scheduled for cesarean delivery arrive in the birthing centre 1-2 The patients will&#xD;
      be given the same anesthetic care routinely used in the birthing centre, except that we will&#xD;
      control the time that the patient remains seated after injection of intrathecal hyperbaric&#xD;
      bupivacaine. The baseline blood pressure and heart rate will be recorded. After intravenous&#xD;
      access is obtained, an infusion of normal saline will be commenced at a rate of 100 cc per&#xD;
      hour. The patient will be brought to the operating room, and the standard monitors will be&#xD;
      placed. The intravenous fluid will be administered at a rate of 500 ml per hour for one hour.&#xD;
      The patient will be placed in a sitting position. The landmarks of the spinal canal will be&#xD;
      identified with an ultrasound, then using sterile technique, an epidural catheter will be&#xD;
      placed in the L2-L3 spinal interspace, and then a 27 gauge whitacre needle will be used to&#xD;
      access the intrathecal space at the L4-L5 spinal interspace. After identification of the&#xD;
      intrathecal space, hyperbaric bupivacaine will be injected over 30 seconds. The patient will&#xD;
      then be left in the sitting position for the predetermined time. The patient will then be&#xD;
      placed supine, with a 15 degree wedge under the right hip. The noninvasive blood pressure&#xD;
      will be set to measure the blood pressure every minute. Hypotension will be defined as a drop&#xD;
      in blood pressure to more than 20% of the patient's preoperative blood pressure. The&#xD;
      medications used for treatment of hypotension will be left to the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      anesthesiologist. The height of the anesthetic blockade will be measured bilaterally with ice&#xD;
      at 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes after the patient has been placed supine. If the block has&#xD;
      not reached T6 by 20 minutes after the patient has assumed the supine position, or if the&#xD;
      patient experiences any pain during the cesarean delivery, 5 ml of 2% lidocaine will be&#xD;
      administered through the epidural catheter. If this does not suitably manage the pain, the&#xD;
      treating anesthesiologist will be allowed to manage the pain as they see fit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of the time in the sitting position:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study patient will be considered a success if the duration of time in the sitting&#xD;
      position results in no pre-delivery hypotension. The study patient will be considered a&#xD;
      failure if the time spent in the sitting position results in pre-delivery hypotension. A&#xD;
      patient will be considered an indeterminate result if the ice test fails to show a block&#xD;
      reaching T6 by 15 minutes. A patient following a success will be left in the sitting position&#xD;
      for 15 seconds less than the preceding patient, and the patient following a failure will be&#xD;
      left in the sitting position for 15 seconds more than the preceding patient. A patient&#xD;
      following an indeterminate result will remain in the sitting position for the same time as&#xD;
      the preceding patient. The first patient in the series will be left in the sitting position&#xD;
      for 3 minutes after the injection of the intrathecal medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage determination and blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if ET50 is dependent on the dosage of medication given, we will determine the ET50 for&#xD;
      2 doses of hyperbaric bupivicaine. Both of the doses we will study are used routinely in&#xD;
      clinical practice. Using a computerized randomization schedule, we will randomly assign&#xD;
      patients to receive either 2 ml or 1.5 ml of 0.75% hyperbaric bupivacaine, for a total of 15&#xD;
      mg or 12.5 mg of bupivacaine respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recorded data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will record the demographic data of the patient, including height, weight, age, gravidity,&#xD;
      parity, weeks gestation, and reason for the cesarean delivery. We will record the medical&#xD;
      history of the patient, and medications that the patient takes. We will record the admission&#xD;
      heart rate, blood pressure and saturation. We will record the time that the intrathecal&#xD;
      medication is injected, and the time that that the patient remains seated after the spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia has been commenced. We will record the level of anesthetic blockade at&#xD;
      1,5,10,15,and 20 minutes after the patient has been placed supine. We will record the blood&#xD;
      pressure, and heart rate every minute after the patient has been placed supine until the baby&#xD;
      has been delivered. We will record any medications used to treat blood pressure before the&#xD;
      baby has been born, and any medications used to treat breakthrough pain. We will record the&#xD;
      birth time, the baby gender, weight, apgar, and umbilical cord pH.&#xD;
