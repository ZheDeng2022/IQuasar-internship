  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An explosion of interest in the numerous therapeutic properties of Punica granatum over the&#xD;
      last decade has led to numerous in vitro, animal, and clinical trials. Pomegranate is a&#xD;
      potent antioxidant, superior to red wine and equal to or better than green tea. In addition,&#xD;
      anticarcinogenic and anti-inflammatory properties suggest its possible use as a therapy or&#xD;
      adjunct for prevention and treatment of several types of cancer and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      Because of pomegranate's antimicrobial properties, it may aid in preventing infection by&#xD;
      dental pathogens, pathogenic E. coli O157:H7, and antibiotic-resistant organisms such as&#xD;
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Pomegranate's effect on bacterial&#xD;
      pathogens has only been tested in vitro, however, necessitating human trials to refute or&#xD;
      substantiate any clinical effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possibility that pomegranate extracts may also have an effect on several other disease&#xD;
      processes, such as Alzheimer's and obesity, underscores the need for more clinical research.&#xD;
      Currently, numerous clinical trials are in progress exploring the therapeutic potential of&#xD;
      pomegranate extracts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The investigators want to evaluate the effect of Punica granatum components on Chronic&#xD;
      sinusitis, nasal polyps and chronic rhinitis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There are many publications indexed by Medline dealing with pomegranate and Punica granatum&#xD;
      and there is interest in pomegranate as a medicinal and nutritional product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pomegranate tree, Punica granatum, especially its fruit, possesses a vast ethnomedical&#xD;
      history and represents a phytochemical reservoir of heuristic medicinal value. The tree/fruit&#xD;
      can be divided into several anatomical compartments: (1) seed,(2) juice, (3) peel, (4) leaf,&#xD;
      (5) flower, (6) bark, and (7) roots, each of which has interesting pharmacologic activity.&#xD;
      Juice and peels, for example,possess potent antioxidant properties, while juice, peel and oil&#xD;
      are all weakly estrogenic and heuristically of interest for the treatment of menopausal&#xD;
      symptoms and sequelae. The use of juice, peel and oil have also been shown to possess&#xD;
      anticancer activities, including interference with tumor cell proliferation, cell cycle,&#xD;
      invasion and angiogenesis. These may be associated with plant based anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      effects. The phytochemistry and pharmacological actions of all Punica granatum components&#xD;
      suggest a wide range of clinical applications for the treatment and prevention of chronic&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pomegranate as few medical applications as gastrointestinal infections, oral wounds and&#xD;
      others. There is a publication on the positive use of pomegranate, in reducing of trigeminal&#xD;
      pain post Herpes Zoster infection (1). Another work described the synergistic effect of&#xD;
      pomegranate extraction and antibiotics for Staphyloccocus Areus (2). Pomegranate extraction&#xD;
      was used for viral delay of HIV I in AIDS patients (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's antiviral effect was examined against HSV and RSV (6). There was a positive effect on H7&#xD;
      -E. COLI 0157(4). Pomegranate extraction was found to help as antibacterial effect as other&#xD;
      Mexican extraction drugs, for Gastrointestinal infections (5). High concentrations of phenol&#xD;
      substances was evaluated in wound healing and it was efficient (7). Methanolic substances&#xD;
      from pomegranate extraction was evaluated and found efficient for all the bacteria that was&#xD;
      examined (8). Recently pomegranate extraction was found active in antibacterial effect and in&#xD;
      synergism with tetracyclin against staphyloccocus Areus with Methicillin resistance (MRSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pomegranate polyphenol extract (PPE) has anti-influenza properties. Using real time PCR,&#xD;
      plaque assay, and TCID 50% hemagglutination assay, the investigators have shown that PPE&#xD;
      suppresses replication of influenza A virus in MDCK cells. PPE inhibits agglutination of&#xD;
      chicken red blood cells (cRBC) by influenza virus and is virucidal. The single-cycle growth&#xD;
      conditions indicated that independent of the virucidal effect PPE also inhibits viral RNA&#xD;
      replication. PPE did not alter virus ribonucleoprotein (RNP) entry into nucleus or&#xD;
      translocation of virus RNP from nucleus to cytoplasm in MDCK cells. The investigators&#xD;
      evaluated four major Polyphenols in PPE (ellagic acid, caffeic acid, luteolin, and&#xD;
      punicalagin) and demonstrated that punicalagin is the effective, anti-influenza component of&#xD;
      PPE. Punicalagin blocked replication of the virus RNA, inhibited agglutination of chicken&#xD;
      RBC's by the virus and had virucidal effects. Furthermore, the combination of PPE and&#xD;
      oseltamivir synergistically increased the anti-influenza effect of oseltamivir. In&#xD;
      conclusion, PPE inhibited the replication of human influenza A/Hong Kong (H3N2) in vitro.&#xD;
      Pomegranate extracts should be further studied for therapeutic and prophylactic potential&#xD;
      especially for influenza epidemics and pandemics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Commonly found in many plants, ellagic acid exhibits powerful anticarcinogenic and&#xD;
      antioxidant properties, propelling it to the forefront of pomegranate research. Many&#xD;
      commercially available pomegranate extracts are being standardized to contain 40-percent (or&#xD;
      more) ellagic acid. Lansky's research confirms the synergistic action of several pomegranate&#xD;
      constituents is superior to ellagic acid in suppressing prostate cancer. To quote Lansky,&#xD;
      &quot;The recent profusion onto the nutraceuticals marketplace of products standardized to 40&#xD;
      percent (or even higher) ellagic acid represents a cynical, lucre-driven attempt to replace&#xD;
      the power of the pomegranate with the power of ellagic acid. The pomegranate needs no such&#xD;
      tricks or enhancements. It is rather an extraordinary, albeit mysterious (and messy), fruit&#xD;
      with a complete medicinal power contained within its juice, peel, and seeds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topical applications of pomegranate preparations have been found to be particularly effective&#xD;
      for controlling oral inflammation, as well as bacteria and fungal counts in periodontal&#xD;
      disease and Candida-associated denture stomatitis. A hydroalcoholic extract of Punica&#xD;
      granatum fruit (HAEP) was investigated for antibacterial effect on dental plaque&#xD;
      microorganisms. Sixty healthy patients (33 females/27 males; ages 9-25) with fixed&#xD;
      orthodontic appliances were randomized to three groups of 20:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) control group who rinsed with 15 mL distilled water; (2) a group who rinsed with 15 mL&#xD;
      chlorhexidine, a standard antiplaque mouth rinse; and (3) a group who rinsed with a 15-mL&#xD;
      HAEP solution. HAEP decreased the number of colony forming units (CFU) of dental plaque&#xD;
      bacteria 84 percent, comparable to chlorhexidine (79-percent inhibition) but significantly&#xD;
      better than the control rinse (11-percent inhibition). Both HAEP and chlorhexidine were&#xD;
      effective against Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Klebsiella, and Proteus species, as well as&#xD;
      E. coli. The ellagitannin, punicalagin, is thought to be the fraction responsible for&#xD;
      pomegranate's antibacterial activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial Infections The only human trials examining the antibacterial properties of&#xD;
      pomegranate extracts have focused on oral bacteria. However, several in vitro assays&#xD;
      demonstrate its bacteriocidal activity against several highly pathogenic and sometimes&#xD;
      antibiotic-resistant organisms. Brazilian researchers evaluated the synergistic effect of a&#xD;
      P. granatum methanolic extract with five antibiotics on 30 clinical isolates of&#xD;
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus.75&#xD;
      Antibiotics tested were chloramphenicol, gentamicin, ampicillin, tetracycline, and oxacillin.&#xD;
      Although synergistic activity between the pomegranate extract and all five antibiotics was&#xD;
      noted in the S. aureus isolates, synergy with ampicillin was the most pronounced. Based on&#xD;
      earlier research and the results of this study, the ellagitannin, punicalagin, is thought to&#xD;
      be the primary constituent responsible for the observed antibacterial effects. Another&#xD;
      organism that can cause significant disease in humans is enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli&#xD;
      (E. coli O157:H7). An ethanolic PPE, one of the two most effective extracts against E. coli&#xD;
      O157:H7, was shown to be both bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal, indicating PPE may be an&#xD;
      effective adjunct treatment for E. coli O157:H7 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the above information the investigators will try and evaluate the clinical efficacy of&#xD;
      topical nasal Pomegranate fruit extract (PFE) (Punica Granatum) for patients with Chronic&#xD;
      rhinitis, chronic sinusitis, nasal polyps and chronic rhinitis.&#xD;
