      This study examines using oral anti coagulant warfarin in the management of unexplained&#xD;
      oligohydramnios improve the perinatal outcome with little or no complications to the mother&#xD;
      or the neonates.&#xD;

      A randomized controlled study with 200 pregnant women with idiopathic oligohydramnios between&#xD;
      28 and 32 weeks. Women were randomized to receive 3 mg warfarin daily (Warfarin group) or&#xD;
      placebo (Placebo group). Outcomes included amniotic fluid index (AFI), duration of pregnancy&#xD;
      and perinatal outcomes including Apgar score, Neonatal intensive care admission (NICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were 28t to 32 weeks of pregnancy and age 18-35&#xD;
      years and diagnosed to have idiopathic oligohydramnios excluded by medical history and&#xD;
      detailed u/s examination,the cut off AFI was less than 5cm. A written informed consent was&#xD;
      taken. Gestational age was determined on the basis of the last menstrual period, confirmed by&#xD;
      an ultrasound scan conducted between 6 and 14 weeks of gestation The clinical work-up&#xD;
      included a history taken prior to enrollment, examination, obstetric ultrasound evaluation,&#xD;
      and biophysical profile taken after 32 weeks of pregnancy Exclusion criteria were&#xD;
      chronichypertension, anaemia ,cardiac diseases ,or history of premature rupture of membrane&#xD;
      or structural malformations. Sterile speculum examination was done to exclude rupture of&#xD;
      membrane. Detailed level 2D ultrasonography to determine the possible etiology and to exclude&#xD;
      the multiple pregnancy and fetal death. All fetuses were alive with fetal weight were prior&#xD;
      treatment and each follow up visits. Doppler ultrasound for uterine, umbilical and middle&#xD;
      cerebral arteries, and fetal ascending aorta was done using resistant index (RI), pulsetilty&#xD;
      index (PI) and systolic/diastolic (S/D) ratio before and in each follow up visits. Laboratory&#xD;
      tests were obtained included complete blood picture, liver function test, immunological tests&#xD;
      to exclude antiphospholipid antibodies was done. After these all patients with unknown major&#xD;
      cause were classified as idiopathic oligohydramnios and the treatment started to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were randomly allocated to 2 treatment groups using computer-generated numbers&#xD;
      in sealed envelopes. Treatment was started immediately after the test result was known, and&#xD;
      continued until 36 completed weeks of pregnancy or active onset of labor. The patients were&#xD;
      randomized to receive either a daily dose of 3 mg warfarin oral tablet or a daily placebo&#xD;
      sachet The placebo sachets were especially manufactured to look identical to warfarin&#xD;
      tablets. The tablets were placed in sacs and then stored in envelopes numbered from 1 to 200&#xD;
      The envelopes were numbered and randomized according to computer-generated randomization&#xD;
      tables to ensure an equal number of patients in each arm. Throughout the trial, access to the&#xD;
      randomization code was available only to the pharmacist who manufactured the placebo and&#xD;
      packed the envelopes and was not available to any of the treating physicians or patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One tablet of 3 mg of warfarin was provided daily to each patient in Warfarin group and&#xD;
      placebo to Placebo group. After starting the treatment; weekly follow up of the patient for&#xD;
      four weeks till 36 weeks and 2 weeks thereafter. Each follow up visit the following were&#xD;
      done; assessment of the amniotic fluid, biophysical profile including non stress test (NST),&#xD;
      Doppler U/S of fetal ascending aorta, uterine, middle cerebral and umbilical arteries.&#xD;
      Laboratory measurement of prothrombine time and concentration and INR are checked daily until&#xD;
      in the therapeutic range for 2 consecutive days, then twice a week for 1-2 weeks, then weekly&#xD;
      until stable. Change in a patient's condition, e.g. liver disease, intercurrent illness, and&#xD;
      new drug started necessitates more frequent testing. Patients should be advised to report any&#xD;
      bruising or bleeding immediately, as advised, avoid aspirin but use paracetamol for pain&#xD;
      ,avoid contact sports and activities carrying a risk of head injury. During labor or cesarean&#xD;
      section visual inspection of blood loss and 48 hours follow up for the occurrence of&#xD;
      hematomas and neonatal follow up for any bleeding problems. Discontinuation of treatment was&#xD;
      done if after two weeks of treatment no changes of the amniotic fluid, manifestation of fetal&#xD;
      distress appeared or the patient completed 36 weeks of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of outcome measures The primary outcome was improvement of the amniotic fluid and&#xD;
      improving the biophysical profile. The secondary outcome is prolongation of pregnancy till&#xD;
      suitable time of fetal maturity. The baseline characteristics of the study participants were&#xD;
      analyzed including amniotic fluid index, Doppler indices changes of the fetal and maternal&#xD;
      vessles, mode of the delivery and the rate of continuation of pregnancy. Finally, the&#xD;
      maternal and neonatal complications and the cost of the treatment were calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Data collected and analyzed by computer program SPSS version 17 Chicago -USA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data expressed as mean ± S.D, number and percentage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using Paried t.test to determine significance for numeric variable&#xD;
