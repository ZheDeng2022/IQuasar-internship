      The 3F Applicator (A3F) is indicated for use in dermatological procedures requiring ablation&#xD;
      and resurfacing of the skin, and for the treatment of facial wrinkles. This study was&#xD;
      designed in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the A3F for treatment of facial&#xD;
      wrinkles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The need for cosmetic facial enhancement procedures with minimal down time and low risk has&#xD;
      led to the development of methods for non-surgical skin rejuvenation. Various ablative lasers&#xD;
      were developed, which remove the full skin surface in a controlled manner1,2. However, the&#xD;
      prolonged recovery and the significant risks prompted the development of fractional lasers&#xD;
      which ablate the skin in a fractional manner, leaving untreated areas to improve healing&#xD;
      process3. In the past few years, fractional RF systems have been introduced that enable&#xD;
      controlled skin resurfacing accompanied with dermal collagen remodeling4,5,6. The new 3F&#xD;
      Applicator (A3F, trade name TriFractional) from Pollogenâ„¢ is designed to enable skin&#xD;
      resurfacing and treatment of wrinkles using radiofrequency energy.&#xD;

    <description>Efficacy of using the 3F Applicator (A3F) for treatment of facial wrinkles will be established by level of wrinkle reduction. The treated area will be photographed, using high-resolution macro photography prior to the treatments and at the follow up visits. The pre - and post-treatment photographs will be compared and scored by two independent uninvolved physicians.</description>
