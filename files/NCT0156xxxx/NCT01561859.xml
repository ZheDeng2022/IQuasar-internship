      The proposed project is designed to examine the effects of cognitive rehabilitation on brain&#xD;
      structure and function in a randomized trial of 102 early course schizophrenia patients&#xD;
      treated for 18 months with either cognitive enhancement therapy (CET) or an Enriched&#xD;
      Supportive Therapy (EST) control, and then followed-up at 1-year post-treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a chronic and highly disabling disorder, making it imperative to apply&#xD;
      interventions that alter its deleterious effects as early as possible. Impairments in&#xD;
      neurocognition and social cognition, which appear to be linked to impaired structural and&#xD;
      functional integrity in key brain regions, are the strongest predictors of functional&#xD;
      disability in early course schizophrenia,making them key targets for early intervention.&#xD;
      Although pharmacologic treatment of cognitive impairments is currently limited,our studies&#xD;
      and others, including meta-analyses have shown that cognitive rehabilitation can be effective&#xD;
      for addressing cognitive impairment in chronic patients. Most notably, Cognitive Enhancement&#xD;
      Therapy (CET), a unique integrated approach to the rehabilitation of social and non-social&#xD;
      cognitive impairments developed and tested by Hogarty and colleagues in our group, has shown&#xD;
      substantial and lasting effects in chronic schizophrenia patients. Recently, the&#xD;
      investigators have shown that the beneficial effects of CET can be successfully extended to&#xD;
      those in the early phase of the disorder, resulting in large functional improvements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have posited that CET can be particularly effective as an early&#xD;
      intervention strategy by capitalizing on a fronto-temporal plasticity reserve, and the&#xD;
      investigators are now observing compelling, albeit preliminary evidence that CET can indeed&#xD;
      slow the progression of gray matter loss in these very regions of the brain, which is&#xD;
      associated with significantly improved cognition (see Preliminary Studies). Preserved&#xD;
      structural integrity and improved brain function in fronto-temporal regions may be the&#xD;
      critical mechanisms for supporting cognitive improvement in early course schizophrenia, yet&#xD;
      remarkably little is known about the neurobiologic effects of cognitive rehabilitation, the&#xD;
      durability of these effects post-treatment, and whether an initial fronto-temporal reserve&#xD;
      portends a greater treatment response. Our exciting preliminary findings of the&#xD;
      neuroprotective effects of CET represent the first study to demonstrate that the structural&#xD;
      integrity of the brain in the early course of schizophrenia can be altered using cognitive&#xD;
      rehabilitation. It is critical that these morphologic findings are examined with more&#xD;
      advanced imaging techniques in larger samples to gain a precise understanding of the&#xD;
      underlying neurobiologic mechanisms and predictors of cognitive and functional enhancement in&#xD;
      early course schizophrenia. These goals are reflective of the strategic plan of NIMH to&#xD;
      identify underlying neural mechanisms of mental disorders that can facilitate treatment, and&#xD;
      personalize care to optimize treatment response. To accomplish this, the investigators&#xD;
      propose to use comprehensive structural and functional imaging methods to study 102 new early&#xD;
      course schizophrenia patients treated for 18 months in a randomized trial of CET or Enriched&#xD;
      Supportive Therapy (EST) and: Aim #1: Confirm the neuroprotective effects of CET on&#xD;
      fronto-temporal brain structure. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessments will&#xD;
      be collected along with cognitive and functional outcome data at baseline, 9, and 18 months.&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that patients treated with CET will demonstrate decreased loss of&#xD;
      fronto-temporal gray matter relative to EST, and that this neuroprotection will be a&#xD;
      mechanism of cognitive and functional improvement. Effects on other key brain regions will&#xD;
      also be explored; Aim #2: Examine the effects of CET on fronto-temporal brain function.&#xD;
      Functional MRI data using established executive and social cognition paradigms will be&#xD;
      collected at baseline, 9, and 18 months along with cognitive and functional outcome data. It&#xD;
      is hypothesized that CET patients will demonstrate enhanced fronto-temporal brain activity&#xD;
      during these tasks relative to EST (see Section 3C.6.2 for specific predictions), and that&#xD;
      this enhanced brain activity will be a mechanism of cognitive and functional improvement.&#xD;
      Changes in fronto-temporal functional connectivity and their relations with improved brain&#xD;
      structure and cognition will also be explored; and Aim #3: Examine the durability of CET&#xD;
      effects on fronto-temporal brain structure and function, cognition, and functional outcome at&#xD;
      1 year post-treatment. Identical neuroimaging, cognitive, and behavioral data will be&#xD;
      collected as those assessed during active treatment. It is hypothesized that the differential&#xD;
      neurobiologic benefits of CET relative to EST observed in Aims 1 and 2, and the cognitive and&#xD;
      functional benefits of CET observed during active treatment will be sustained 1 year&#xD;
      post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim: Explore the effects of a fronto-temporal structural and functional reserve&#xD;
      on CET treatment response. Moderator analyses will examine whether pre-treatment&#xD;
      fronto-temporal structural and functional brain reserves (operationalized in Section 3C.8.2)&#xD;
      predict larger cognitive and functional gains in CET. Exploratory analyses will also examine&#xD;
      the degree to which later (18 mo) treatment improvement is dependent upon early (9 mo)&#xD;
      neuroprotection and increased brain function, which may reflect plasticity.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be included if they have:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder verified by the SCID (in our&#xD;
             data patients with both conditions respond similarly to CET);&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. duration since first psychotic symptom of &lt; 10 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. stable positive symptoms based on medical record review and SCID for at least 2&#xD;
             months;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. are currently maintained on and compliant with prescribed antipsychotic medication;&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. age 18-55 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. significant social and cognitive disability based on the Cognitive Style and Social&#xD;
             Cognition Eligibility Interview utilized in previous CET studies;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. current IQ &gt;= 80; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. the ability to read (sixth grade level or higher) and speak fluent English. This is a&#xD;
             study of early course schizophrenia, not first-episode schizophrenia. A duration of&#xD;
             illness since first psychotic symptom of &lt; 10 years is adequate to define the early&#xD;
             phase of the illness, particularly given that the average duration of untreated&#xD;
             psychosis is a year or more. Eligibility criteria regarding IQ are justified from&#xD;
             previous experience with CET indicating that individuals with severe mental incapacity&#xD;
             are better served with less cognitively advanced programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to avoid confounders likely to affect cognition and limit response to cognitive&#xD;
        rehabilitation, we will exclude those with:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. significant neurological or medical disorders that may produce cognitive impairment&#xD;
             (e.g., seizure disorder, traumatic brain injury);&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. persistent suicidal or homicidal behavior;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. a recent (within the past 3 months) history of substance abuse or dependence; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. any MRI contraindications such as ferromagnetic objects in the body.&#xD;
