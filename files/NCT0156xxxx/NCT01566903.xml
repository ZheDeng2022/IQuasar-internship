  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MR angiography (MRA) has become essential in the treatment of neurovascular diseases,&#xD;
      including ischemic stroke - the first cause of disability in occidental countries, vascular&#xD;
      malformations such as aneurysms, arteriovenous fistulas and malformations, whose treatments&#xD;
      are improving year after year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRA is an alternative to digital substracted angiography (DSA), circumventing th use of&#xD;
      endovascular catheterism, irradiation and injection of iodinated contrast agent.&#xD;
      Contrast-Enhanced MRA (CE-MRA) with gadolinium injection is currently the reference standard&#xD;
      for vascular MR exploration but still presents many limitations inherent to the injection of&#xD;
      contrast medium. Hence, the synchronization of the acquisition with bolus contrast injection&#xD;
      limits the improvement of spatial and temporal resolutions and requires an accurate&#xD;
      synchronization of the acquisition with the arrival of the bolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the acquisition can be repeated as required as it does not require any contrast&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides, the increase in nephrogenic systematic fibrosis clinical cases, which would be&#xD;
      secondary to gadolinium chelates injection, in patients with chronic renal insufficiency has&#xD;
      restricted the use of CE-MRA. More than 500 cases were described to date in the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its occurrence is currently estimated around 4 % for patients in terminal chronic renal&#xD;
      insufficiency and its mortality around 30 %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the recommendations of AFSSAPS from August, 2007, two gadolinium contrast agent&#xD;
      (Gadodiamide-OMNISCAN *, General Electric HealthCare and Gadopentetate Dimeglumine-MAGNEVIST&#xD;
      *, Bayer HealthCare) are contraindicated if the glomerular filtration rate is lower than 30&#xD;
      ml/mn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-contrast enhanced MR angiography (NCE MRA) techniques have been proposed to provide&#xD;
      complete and non-invasive investigation of the vasculature, thus offering patients with&#xD;
      chronic renal insufficiency, as well as pregnant or nursing women a surrogate with no side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the use of high field (3T) MR imaging offers improved signal to noise ratio.&#xD;
      Combined with the use of phased array coils and parallel imaging, new NCE MRA sequences can&#xD;
      achieve juxta-millimeter isotropic spatial resolution and temporal resolution of about 50 ms&#xD;
      close to those of cerebral DSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These sequences allow a joint hemodynamical and morphological assessment of lesions, both at&#xD;
      the cervical and cerebral levels, whether at diagnosis or during patient follow-up&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to evaluate the quality of the NCE images obtained in the exploration&#xD;
      of neurovascular diseases, at the cervical and cerebral levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to compare the NCE MRA sequences with the CE MRA sequences used in the clinical routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the anatomic and hemodynamic changes observable with sequences in the&#xD;
           follow-up of patients, particularly those treated with partial embolization or&#xD;
           radiosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By circumventing the limitation to short bolus duration synchronization, the new dynamic&#xD;
      sequences have the potential to achieve higher temporal resolution without compromising&#xD;
      spatial resolution. Arteries and arteriovenous shunts may be more precisely identified and,&#xD;
      due to a better visibility of small vessels allow a more accurate dynamic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the sequence being derived from arterial spin labeling, and differing from time of&#xD;
      flight or phase contrast sequences, should allow for an exploration less dependent on the&#xD;
      vascular geometry with better anatomical analysis. For example, the tendency to overestimate&#xD;
      arterial stenoses could be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The robustness of sequences allow the non-invasive monitoring of patients including it&#xD;
      possible to monitor the hemodynamic changes after radiosurgery or embolization.&#xD;
