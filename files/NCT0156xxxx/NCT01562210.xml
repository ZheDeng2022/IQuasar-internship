    <textblock>
      Phase I dose escalating trial. Primary objective of this study is to define the maximal&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD)of Olaparib in combination with high dose radiotherapy with or without&#xD;
      daily dose Cisplatin in locally advanced NSCLC. Secondary objectives include to define safety&#xD;
      profile, determine PK/Pd variables and document preliminary evidence of objective tumor&#xD;
      response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the treatment of choice for patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC. The cure rates however need to be improved. The main mechanism by which both&#xD;
      radiation and Cisplatin kill tumor cells is by an accumulation of un- or misrepaired DNA&#xD;
      damage.PARP inhibitors increase radiation and chemotherapy (Cisplatin) response in&#xD;
      preclinical studies including lung cancer models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This open label dose escalating trial consists of a screening phase, a treatment phase and a&#xD;
      follow up phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening phase: patients who can tolerate concurrent cisplatin will receive Olaparib, RT&#xD;
      and Cisplatin. Patients who can not tolerate concurrent cisplatin will receive Olaparib and&#xD;
      RT with or without prior sequential chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment phase:dose escalation of Olaparib will be performed in cohorts of 3 subjects.&#xD;
      The decision to escalate to the next dose level will be based on the occurrence of DLTs&#xD;
      during the DLT evaluation period (i.e. 3 months following the last day of irradiation) and&#xD;
      will be made after all patients within the cohort have completed their third month of follow&#xD;
      up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active follow-up phase: frequent follow up will take place during the first 3 months (acute&#xD;
      toxicity). Thereafter patients will be monitored for late toxicity and for disease activity&#xD;
      3-monthly throughout the first year and thereafter 6-monthly until 5 years, when patients are&#xD;
      deemed to be cured and follow up is no longer warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Olaparib will be given orally BID for 36 consecutive days, administrated with a 12 hour&#xD;
      interval. Olaparib will start 2 days before start of RT and will continue for 2 days after&#xD;
      the last RT fraction. Olaparib is also given during the non-radiotherapy days but no&#xD;
      maintenance treatment is given after radiotherapy is finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy (for all patients): a total dose of 66Gy will be given in 24 fractions from week&#xD;
      1 to 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisplatin (concurrent chemoradiotherapy): daily dose Cisplatin 6mg/m2 (5 days/week), 1-1.5 hr&#xD;
      before the irradiation (week 1 to 5), given as a 5-minutes intravenous infusion.&#xD;
