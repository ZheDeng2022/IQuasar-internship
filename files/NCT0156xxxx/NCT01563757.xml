      The investigators are studying what causes Plastic Bronchitis and Protein Losing Enteropathy.&#xD;
      The investigators think that these problems are from too much of two small proteins called&#xD;
      Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) and Substance P. VIP and Substance P are important&#xD;
      proteins in the body that normally tell the body to make small amounts of fluid and they help&#xD;
      the intestines work. Normally, VIP and Substance P are made in the intestines and then&#xD;
      destroyed in the lungs after they do their normal work. The investigators think that kids who&#xD;
      have Plastic Bronchitis and/or Protein Losing Enteropathy who also had the Fontan surgery&#xD;
      might have too much VIP and Substance P in their bodies. The investigators think this causes&#xD;
      too much fluid to go in the lungs and too much protein in the intestines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Protein losing enteropathy (PLE) has emerged as an increasingly common complication of single&#xD;
      ventricle palliation in children born with cyanotic congenital heart disease. This entity&#xD;
      becomes manifest months or years after the modified Fontan operation and is thought to affect&#xD;
      5-15% of all patients with Fontan physiology. Patients with PLE often suffer from symptoms&#xD;
      related to severe hypoproteinemia and intestinal malabsorption, including edema, ascites,&#xD;
      pleural and pericardial effusions, chronic diarrhea and poor growth. Mortality is strikingly&#xD;
      high, with only 50% of patients surviving for more than 5 years following diagnosis. The&#xD;
      pathophysiology is poorly understood and several theories are presented as possible&#xD;
      mechanisms which includes: 1) chronic low cardiac output and intestinal injury leading to&#xD;
      loss of intestinal integrity, 2) chronic intestinal inflammation leading to loss of&#xD;
      intestinal integrity, 3) chronic elevated portal venous pressure with intestinal injury&#xD;
      leading to loss of intestinal integrity. Treatment is sporadically successful and has&#xD;
      included 1) creating a fenestration between the Fontan pathway and pulmonary venous atrium&#xD;
      which decreases Fontan pressure and increases cardiac output, 2) chronic use of&#xD;
      unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin to reconstitute the intestinal basement&#xD;
      membrane, 3) Use of oral steroids to reduce intestinal inflammation, 4) Use of pulmonary&#xD;
      vasodilators to reduce Fontan pressure and increase cardiac output 5) implantation of&#xD;
      pacemakers to treat sinus node dysfunction and improve cardiac output, 6) heart&#xD;
      transplantation. Short of cardiac transplantation, no treatment of PLE, including efforts to&#xD;
      change systemic and/or gastrointestinal hemodynamics, is routinely successful. Thus, it&#xD;
      appears that the etiology of PLE is more complex than simply &quot;high venous pressure in the&#xD;
      gut&quot; as has been previously believed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second entity seen in patients after modified Fontan procedure is &quot;plastic bronchitis&quot;&#xD;
      (PB). This is a highly morbid clinical picture of persistent production of high&#xD;
      mucoprotein-containing airway secretions that causes severe airway obstruction leading to&#xD;
      increased work of breathing, V/Q mismatch and progressive respiratory failure leading to&#xD;
      death. The etiology of plastic bronchitis is not understood at all and beyond supportive,&#xD;
      palliative measures such as lung lavage, there is no current treatment for plastic&#xD;
      bronchitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIP and Substance P are both small peptides with significant autocrine and paracrine&#xD;
      signaling ability. The role of VIP in controlling gut protein and solute secretion has been&#xD;
      understood for approximately 20 years. The clinical entity where this has been best described&#xD;
      are in rare &quot;VIP-omas&quot; and some other chromophore secreting gut tumors where massive amounts&#xD;
      of VIP are secreted by the tumor and overwhelm the body's normal ability to clear VIP through&#xD;
      cleavage by neutral endopeptidases in the pulmonary endothelium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until very recently, Substance P was known primarily for its role in peptidogenic signaling&#xD;
      in sensory pathways. As described below, an important and previously not understood role for&#xD;
      Substance P in the control of human airway mucus secretion has recently been described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific Basis for Proposed Research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basis for this proposal arises from three, independent streams of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First, extensive investigations in patients with increased portal venous pressures,&#xD;
           usually from cirrhosis, has shown that increased portal venous pressures lead to&#xD;
           significant increases in the excretion of a wide variety of small peptide signaling&#xD;
           molecules. Included in these molecules are VIP, 5-HT and Substance P.As patients with&#xD;
           Fontan physiology always have increased portal and gut venous pressures as a direct&#xD;
           consequence of their anatomic palliation, it stands to reason that they should likewise&#xD;
           have increased GI production of these signaling peptides.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Second, clearance of gut-derived signaling peptides such as VIP, Substance P,&#xD;
           angiotensin, brandykinin and others occurs primarily in the lungs via peptide cleavage&#xD;
           catalyzed by the neutral endopeptidases, a class of enzymes heavily resident in the&#xD;
           pulmonary circulation. The role of the neutral endopeptidases is to cleave and thus&#xD;
           inactivate small peptides and 'protect&quot; the systemic circulation from the plethora of&#xD;
           vasoactive peptides that come from the systemic circulation. With respect to the&#xD;
           potential role of VIP and/or Substance P in the etiology of PLE or PB, it is important&#xD;
           to note that in patients with Fontan physiology current practice is to fenestrate the&#xD;
           Fontan shunt to allow some portion of the systemic venous blood flow to bypass the&#xD;
           lungs. Thus, any vasoactive / signaling peptides returning in the lower body systemic&#xD;
           venous circulation will bypass the pulmonary clearance mechanisms in proportion to the&#xD;
           degree of fenestration shunt at the moment. This pulmonary clearance bypass physiology&#xD;
           is relative unique in medicine to older patients with Fontan-palliated congenital heart&#xD;
           disease and thus may be, in part, the basis that PLE and PB are seen almost uniquely in&#xD;
           Fontan patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Further implicating derangements in active peptide clearance physiology in the etiology&#xD;
           of PLE and PB is the fact that the classic member of the neutral endopeptidase class is&#xD;
           (the misnamed) Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) , which actually cleaves a number of&#xD;
           these small peptide signaling molecules including VIP and Substance P. Virtually all&#xD;
           patients with Fontan physiology are on large doses of ACE-inhibitors to lower systemic&#xD;
           afterload. Captopril-induced inhibition of VIP and Substance P inactivation would&#xD;
           significantly increase already elevated systemic levels of these signaling peptides and&#xD;
           further potentiate the etiology of PLE and PB in Fontan-palliated patients. Variations&#xD;
           of neutral endopeptidase inhibitor (&quot;ACE inhibitor&quot; ) drug dosage and/or genotype&#xD;
           variation of ACE which causes dramatically altered activity can in part explain the&#xD;
           variable incidence of PLE and PB in Fontan physiology patients. In this study, the use&#xD;
           and dose of ACE inhibitor that each patient is on will be recorded to see if there is a&#xD;
           correlation between ACE inhibitor dose and measured VIP and Substance P levels. There&#xD;
           are wide variation of ACE gene genomics that have been described for decades.&#xD;
           Intriguingly, approximately 10-15% of all persons have a newly described genomic&#xD;
           variation of the ACE gene which leads to profoundly reduced circulating levels of ACE&#xD;
           and increased susceptibility to ACE inhibition and 10-15% of patients with Fontans&#xD;
           develop PB or PLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Lastly, very recent work has completely changed our understanding of the control of&#xD;
           normal, basal mucus and solute secretion in the human airways and gut. Here-to-fore it&#xD;
           was believed that cholinergic mechanisms controlled airway mucus secretion. This recent&#xD;
           and still emerging work shows that in fact it is VIP and Substance P which act&#xD;
           individually and synergistically in the control of both normal basal human airway mucus&#xD;
           production and in regulating gut secretion. This very new work gives a unifying&#xD;
           hypothesis to the seemingly disparate entities of PLE and PB: since Substance P and VIP&#xD;
           control normal basal human airway secretion and stimulated human gut protein secretion,&#xD;
           increases in pulmonary venous and/or gut arterial levels of these peptides can be the&#xD;
           basis for PLE and PB. The GI, cardiac and pulmonary physiology and pharmacologic&#xD;
           treatment of patients with fenestrated Fontans is a perfect setting for this interaction&#xD;
           to occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken in totality, these three streams of independent research give a strong basis for the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the palliative physiology and pharmacologic treatment of Fontan patients&#xD;
      leads to increased levels of VIP, Substance P or both, and they may be causal in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of PB and PLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for Current Study Design and Subject Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consistent with our Aims and Hypotheses, four patient groups will be studied: i)Fontan&#xD;
      Physiology Patients with PLE and PB Patients ii) Fontan Physiology Patients without PLE and&#xD;
      PB iii) Patients with Glenn Physiology Congenital Heart Disease and iv) Patients with 2&#xD;
      ventricle physiology and an atrial septal defect who will serve as a Control group.&#xD;
      Measurement of mixed venous and arterial levels of substance P and VIP in these 4 groups of&#xD;
      subjects will allow us to determine the effects of elevated portal venous pressure on the&#xD;
      production and clearance of substance P and VIP and well as the effects of altered&#xD;
      hepatic-pulmonary blood flow on the clearance of substance P and VIP. This should allow us to&#xD;
      determine if 1) systemic arterial levels of substance P and VIP levels are elevated in Fontan&#xD;
      patients when compared to controls, and if elevated, 2) whether this is due to increased&#xD;
      hepatic production, reduced pulmonary clearance or both. The rationale for the inclusion of&#xD;
      each patient group is summarized below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with Fontan physiology (Group I and II) have a unique physiology where both the&#xD;
      superior vena cava (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC) are connected directly to the pulmonary&#xD;
      arteries thereby bypassing the heart. This palliation scheme allows for separation of the&#xD;
      pulmonary and systemic circulations in patients with univentricular hearts and essentially&#xD;
      eliminates cyanosis. These patients have non-pulsitile pulmonary artery flow with elevated&#xD;
      central venous and portal venous pressures. Therefore, it is suspected that these patients&#xD;
      will have increased production of substance P and VIP. In addition, a fenestration (or hole),&#xD;
      is created between the Fontan conduit and the atrium at the time of Fontan surgery in order&#xD;
      to lower central venous pressure and increase cardiac output by creating a right to left&#xD;
      intracardiac shunt. It is suspected that these patients will have elevated systemic venous&#xD;
      and arterial levels of vasoactive peptides as a result of 1) increased hepatic/gut&#xD;
      production, 2) decreased pulmonary vascular clearance, and/or 3) intracardiac right to left&#xD;
      shunting. Studying these subjects will allow us to determine how systemic venous and systemic&#xD;
      arterial levels of Substance P and VIP are altered by the Fontan circulation. By comparing&#xD;
      systemic arterial and venous levels of vasoactive peptides among control, Glenn physiology&#xD;
      and Fontan physiology groups we hope to measure differences in vasoactive peptide levels that&#xD;
      could be responsible for the development of PLE and PB in Fontan physiology patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with Glenn physiology (Group III) have a unique physiology where hepatic venous and&#xD;
      lower body venous blood returns to the heart and enters the systemic ventricle and is&#xD;
      recirculated to the body after combining with the pulmonary venous blood. There is no direct&#xD;
      connection thru the heart for hepatic venous blood to enter the pulmonary arteries.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is suspected that these patients will likely have elevated systemic arterial&#xD;
      circulating levels of Substance P and VIP due to intracardiac right to left shunting and&#xD;
      reduced pulmonary clearance. However, since these patients typically have normal portal&#xD;
      venous pressures, they are not thought to have increased production of these vasoactive&#xD;
      peptides. In addition, these patients historically are not at risk for developing PLE and PB.&#xD;
      Studying these subjects will allow us to determine how systemic venous and systemic arterial&#xD;
      levels of Substance P and VIP are altered by the Glenn circulation. By comparing systemic&#xD;
      arterial and venous levels of vasoactive peptides among control, Glenn physiology and Fontan&#xD;
      physiology groups we hope to measure differences in vasoactive peptide levels that could be&#xD;
      responsible for the development of PLE and PB in Fontan physiology patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group subjects (Group IV) will have normal hepatic-pulmonary blood flow and normal&#xD;
      portal venous pressures. An atrial septal defect allows for left to right shunting of blood&#xD;
      thru the heart but does not typically result in elevated pulmonary artery or right&#xD;
      ventricular pressures. These subjects will have normal flow of hepatic venous blood into the&#xD;
      pulmonary capillary bed. Therefore they should have normal hepatic production and pulmonary&#xD;
      clearance of substance P and VIP.&#xD;
