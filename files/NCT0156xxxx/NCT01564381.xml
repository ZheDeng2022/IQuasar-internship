  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hope to learn if resveratrol supplementation can be beneficial for the&#xD;
      cardiovascular system. Seeing that resveratrol is rapidly metabolized, the investigators are&#xD;
      interested in learning if a novel form of resveratrol, ResA, which is a mixture of&#xD;
      resveratrol with amino acid, may have greater bioavailability and lead to greater improvement&#xD;
      in vascular function, compared to standard resveratrol supplement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States.&#xD;
      To reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its associated health care costs,&#xD;
      nutrition and health recommendations strongly advocate the consumption of a diet rich in&#xD;
      fruits and vegetables. In addition to essential vitamins and minerals, fruits and vegetables&#xD;
      contain a number of bioactive compounds that may be involved in vascular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;French Paradox&quot; refers to diet patterns that, despite being high in saturated fat, are&#xD;
      associated with a relatively low cardiovascular risk. An important aspect of many of the&#xD;
      diets that were identified in the French Paradox studies is a significant intake of wine,&#xD;
      particularly red wine, which can contain an array of phytochemicals that have been postulated&#xD;
      to improve cardiovascular health. A polyphenolic that has received particular attention is&#xD;
      this regard is resveratrol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stilbene resveratrol is found predominately in red grapes, red wine, peanuts and some&#xD;
      berries, and it has been touted in the popular press for its potential health-promoting&#xD;
      benefits. Emerging evidence suggests a role for resveratrol in the protection against&#xD;
      numerous degenerative health problems including CVD and certain cancers, diabetes and some&#xD;
      forms of neurodegeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of resveratrol in most foods is very low; thus obtaining the amounts of this&#xD;
      compound that have been associated with improved health in animal models is difficult for&#xD;
      humans. ResA is a product produced using patented technology that physically binds&#xD;
      resveratrol to arginine, creating a novel conjugate. In the preliminary studies the ResA&#xD;
      conjugate produced higher peak plasma levels, as well as total plasma levels that persist for&#xD;
      a longer period of time when fed to rats. Whether similar results would occur in humans, and&#xD;
      the extent to which increasing blood resveratrol concentration can be associated with&#xD;
      positive cardiovascular effects in an at-risk population is the subject of this project.&#xD;
