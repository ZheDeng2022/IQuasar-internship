  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymphomas are comprised of a diversity of tumors with different pathologic and clinical&#xD;
      features. While distinct differences in gene expression profiles have been elucidated in&#xD;
      different lymphomas, there has been inconsistent correlation with the few published proteomic&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Greater insights into the biology of lymphomas may be achieved by integrating current genomic&#xD;
      information with additional studies focused on the interrelationships in tumors of the&#xD;
      patterns of chromatin protein expression, chromatin protein modification, and RNA expression&#xD;
      profiling (both within bulk tumor and within specific microscopic tumor niches accessible by&#xD;
      microdissection and cell sorting approaches).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this protocol are to identify the global levels of all histones (including&#xD;
      variant histones) and non-histone chromosomal proteins, and to measure the relative levels of&#xD;
      most known covalent modifications on histone and non-histone chromosomal proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a limited number of cases illustrative of selected pathological entities, we propose to&#xD;
      map the genome-wide distribution of those modifications judged to be biochemically&#xD;
      instructive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work will involve the analysis of a broad panel of lymphoma and lymphoid samples, which&#xD;
      were previously procured under multiple protocols at the NIH, and for which there is excess&#xD;
      tissue available for research. We also request permission to extend this analysis to surplus&#xD;
      materials to be accrued under existing protocols, upon completion of all superseding&#xD;
      diagnostic tests and medical/scientific studies. The criteria for inclusion in this study are&#xD;
      subsumed under the enveloping protocols. The number of cases to be included is dependent upon&#xD;
      the size of these protocols; because statistical significance improves with increasing&#xD;
      numbers. We hope to include up to 300 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lysates from surplus samples will be prepared and arrayed onto microarrays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These arrays will be probed with panels of protein and modification specific antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antibody reactivity will be quantified and samples will be subjected to statistical&#xD;
      analysis, especially hierarchical clustering to correlate patterns of reactivity with&#xD;
      clinical and histological features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Representative cases for which sufficient surplus tissue remains will be subjected to&#xD;
      ChIP-Seq to map the distribution of modifications across the genome.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        We propose to analyze the histone and chromatin modifications from several classes of&#xD;
        patients: 1) patients bearing the diagnosis of lymphoid malignancies made or confirmed at&#xD;
        the NIH. Solid tumors of the lymphoid system would constitute the major source of these&#xD;
        tissues, however tissue samples from patients with malignant diagnoses that involve&#xD;
        circulating malignant cells (Mycosis fungoides, Sezary syndrome, etc.) would also be&#xD;
        appropriate for analysis; 2) non-malignant lymphoid tissue obtained for diagnostic purposes&#xD;
        or normal lymphoid tissue obtained incidentally during surgery (in all cases only residual&#xD;
        and surplus tissue will be used, only with the express approval of the appropriate clinical&#xD;
        investigator(s). Primarily included among these tissues would be hyperplastic lymphoid&#xD;
        tissue especially tonsils. Other hyperplastic and non-malignant lymph node samples showing&#xD;
        proliferative responses or sinus histiocytosis would also be appropriate to compare with&#xD;
        the malignant samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Only cases with sufficient frozen biopsy material from initial biopsy and/or biopsies at&#xD;
        relapse of disease to obtain adequate tissues lysates for proteomic-based analyses and in&#xD;
        selected cases for ChIPSeq following analysis of RNA expression as performed under&#xD;
        superseding protocols. In some cases, for some histone modifications, it may be possible to&#xD;
        recover appropriate tissue from paraffin embedded blocks, however no such samples will be&#xD;
        used for this study without prior consultation and approval from the clinical investigator&#xD;
        and hematopathologist associated with the superseding protocols. Samples from minors &lt;18&#xD;
        years old will not be used.&#xD;
