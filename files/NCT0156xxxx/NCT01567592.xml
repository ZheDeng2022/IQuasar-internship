  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low intensity shockwaves have been proven in animal studies to induce local growth of new&#xD;
      blood vessels from existing ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that shockwave therapy could improve the symptoms of patients&#xD;
      with refractory angina not amenable to revascularization with angioplasty or bypass surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low intensity shockwaves (1/10 the ones used in Lithotripsy) are delivered to myocardial&#xD;
      ischemic tissue. Shockwaves are created by a special generator and are focused using a&#xD;
      shockwave applicator device. The treatment is guided by standard echocardiography equipment.&#xD;
      The shockwaves are delivered in synchronization with Patient R-wave to avoid arrhythmias. The&#xD;
      treatment is painless.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At first, the patient undergoes stress- SPECT testing to identify the ischemic areas.&#xD;
      Following that, the same area is localized by the ultra-sound device and the shockwaves are&#xD;
      focused to the ischemic area. Several treatments are required for optimal results.&#xD;
