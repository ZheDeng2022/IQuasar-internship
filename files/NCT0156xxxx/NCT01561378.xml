  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the potential ability of intranasal insulin to prevent&#xD;
      post-operative cognitive decline and post-operative delirium in an elderly cardiac surgery&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly half of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions consist of adults &gt; 65 years old, an&#xD;
      age group that is at high risk for developing cognitive decline and delirium in the ICU. Over&#xD;
      50% and 70% of critically ill cardiac surgery patients develop post-operative delirium (POD)&#xD;
      and post-operative cognitive decline (POCD), respectively. These two forms of acute cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction are associated with increased mortality and poor functional recovery. While&#xD;
      distinct conditions, POD has been associated with the subsequent development of POCD,&#xD;
      suggesting a mechanistic link.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No proven pharmacologic treatments targeting the prevention of both POD and POCD in elderly&#xD;
      patients exist to date. Recent data suggest that insulin administered into the central&#xD;
      nervous system via intranasal delivery improves cognitive function in elderly patients with&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment. However, its utility in preventing POD and&#xD;
      POCD in elderly critically ill patients has not been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that intranasal insulin can prevent POD and POCD in elderly&#xD;
      critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit after undergoing cardiac surgery.&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded Phase II study&#xD;
      will enroll 60 patients &gt;= 65 years old undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft&#xD;
      and/or valve surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass, and will treat them with either 40 IU&#xD;
      of aspart insulin or placebo intranasally before surgery and then four times a day for 7 days&#xD;
      or until hospital discharge (whichever occurs first).&#xD;
