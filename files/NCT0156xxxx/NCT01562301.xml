  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of Anvirzel&#xD;
      (Nerium Oleander) that can be given to lung cancer patients receiving standard therapy with&#xD;
      carboplatin and docetaxel. Researchers also want to learn what effect Nerium Oleander may&#xD;
      have in combination with carboplatin and docetaxel.&#xD;

      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are eligible and agree to take part in the study, you will be assigned to a dose level&#xD;
      of nerium oleander based on when you join this study. Up to 5 dose levels of nerium oleander&#xD;
      will be tested. At least 3 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group&#xD;
      of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose&#xD;
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until&#xD;
      the highest tolerable dose of nerium oleander is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take nerium oleander by mouth by placing it under your tongue. You should hold the&#xD;
      nerium oleander under your tongue for 3 minutes before swallowing. It is very important for&#xD;
      you to hold the nerium oleander under your tongue for 3 full minutes. Holding it under your&#xD;
      tongue for 3 minutes before swallowing helps your body to take in the highest amount of the&#xD;
      drug that you can receive. If you hold the nerium oleander under your tongue for less than 3&#xD;
      minutes, your body will not receive as much of the study drug and may not possibly benefit as&#xD;
      much. You will take nerium oleander 3 times a day while participating in this study. Nerium&#xD;
      oleander should be taken on an empty stomach or at least 15 minutes before any large meal, to&#xD;
      help your body take in as much of the drug as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of your chemotherapy cycles are 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each week while on study, you will complete the questionnaire about any symptoms you may be&#xD;
      having. It should take about 5 minutes to complete it each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day -7 (7 days before you start chemotherapy):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the questionnaire about your physical and mental health. It should&#xD;
           take about 5 minutes to complete it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn 6 times over 8 hours for&#xD;
           pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body&#xD;
           at different time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn to learn if the study drug is reducing&#xD;
           inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to test the effect of the study drug on your&#xD;
           immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day -6, blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn 1 time for PK testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 (the day you start chemotherapy):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any symptoms you may be having or drugs you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn 6 times over 8 hours for PK testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn to learn if the study drug is reducing&#xD;
           inflammation.&#xD;

&#xD;
      On Day 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK testing.&#xD;

           immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 8 (+/- 2 days):&#xD;
&#xD;

           inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to test the effect of the study drug on your&#xD;
           immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 2-3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any symptoms you may be having or drugs you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of weight and vital signs.&#xD;
