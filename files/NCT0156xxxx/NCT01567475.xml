    <textblock>
      This study is an open label, multicenter study with two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I is a dose escalation study of RAD001 in combination with one injection of&#xD;
           Rituximab 375 mg/m² per week during 4 weeks (28 days) in patients CD20 positive&#xD;
           non-Hodgkin's lymphomas to determine the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and maximum&#xD;
           tolerated dose (MTD). The purpose of the study is to assess the feasibility of the&#xD;
           combination based on - rate of dose limiting toxicities (DLT) and PK drug-drug&#xD;
           interaction (DDI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II will define the efficacy and safety profile of RAD001 and Rituximab combination&#xD;
           at the RP2D in patients with lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with lymphomas will be treated at the RP2D established during phase I and evaluated&#xD;
      for clinical benefit rate, comprising complete responses (CR + CRu), partial responses (PR)&#xD;
      and stable disease (SD), and time to progression using the IWG criteria for treatment&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction therapy will follow the same schedule than during the phase I study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance therapy: Monthly cycles for up to 2 years with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily RAD001 at the same dose than during induction therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rituximab infusion every other cycle at 375 mg/m2 that correspond to the usual&#xD;
           maintenance schedule for Rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response to therapy will be assessed between day 42 and day 49, then every two months.&#xD;

    <description>The same disease response assessment used for complete response rate will be considered to determine the Overall Response Rate. Patient is defined as a responder if he/she has a complete response (CR/CRu) or partial response (PR) at the end of treatment. A descriptive analysis will also be performed considering as nonresponders all patients who relapsed or died during treatment phase even if they were prematurely withdrawn as responder.</description>

    <measure>PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-Free Survival will be measured from the date of inclusion to the date of first documented disease progression, relapse or death from any cause. Responding patients and patients who are lost to follow up will be censored at their last tumor assessment date.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>OVERALL SURVIVAL</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival will be measured from the date of inclusion to the date of death from any cause. Patients who are alive at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of the last contact.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>DURATION OF RESPONSE</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response will be measured from the date of first documentation of a response (CR/CRu or PR after induction or at the end of treatment) to the date of first documented evidence of progression/relapse or death from any cause.
