  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to create a long-term storage of bile and brushings of&#xD;
      pancreato-biliary duct in patients diagnosed with pancreato-biliary stricture for future&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a lot of research has been done to test for certain markers in the bile and&#xD;
      brushings to detect cancer in a stricture. The samples will be used to measure biomarkers&#xD;
      (proteins) in biliary diseases.&#xD;

      Recently, a lot of research has been done to test for certain markers like fluorescence in&#xD;
      situ hybridization (FISH), digital image analysis (DIA), and quantifiable morphometric&#xD;
      results in biliary stricture brushings. Recently, polysomy FISH has been studied as a&#xD;
      promising marker in predicting cancer in a pancreato-biliary stricture. Many genetic,&#xD;
      epigenetic, and protein alterations arise during pancreaticobiliary tumor process. The types&#xD;
      of markers that have been commonly evaluated as diagnostic assays are mutations, chromosomal&#xD;
      gains and losses, and DNA methylation alterations. However there are only a few studies in&#xD;
      this area. Testing for these markers can help determine whether the narrowing or stricture in&#xD;
      your bile duct is cancer or not.&#xD;
