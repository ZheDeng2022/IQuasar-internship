      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of a flexible high dose of lurasidone to a&#xD;
      standard dose of lurasidone in patients with treatment resistant schizophrenia or&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder. Efficacy of both dosage groups will be measured through testing of&#xD;
      positive symptoms and other components of psychopathology (negative symptoms, general&#xD;
      psychopathology, anxiety, depression, cognitive function, global function, severity of&#xD;
      illness and tolerability). Patients must qualify for treatment resistance after two or more&#xD;
      antipsychotic drug trials to be included in this trial.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder according to DSM-IV&#xD;
             criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must be capable of giving written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The criteria for treatment resistance (TR) will be those of Kane et al, (1988) which&#xD;
             are:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  failure to respond adequately to two or more trials with typical or atypical&#xD;
                  antipsychotic drugs, of adequate dose and duration (at least 6 weeks) lifetime&#xD;
                  and at least one such trial within the last two years. No patient with a history&#xD;
                  of a successful trial of this nature within the last two years will be eligible&#xD;
                  for inclusion. The minimum doses of antipsychotic drugs permitted in these&#xD;
                  unsuccessful trials are specified in Table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must have scores of 4 (using a 1-7 scale) or more on at least two of the&#xD;
                  following Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) items: delusions [P1],&#xD;
                  hallucinations [P3] or unusual thought content [G9]&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must have a total PANSS score of 70 or above&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients will have had no episodes of good functioning in the previous three&#xD;
                  years (as defined by current CGI - Severity of moderate to severe, GAF below 60;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Personal and Social Performance Scale of 60 or below.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Requirement for previous exposure to antipsychotic treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who meet treatment resistance criteria must have had at least two trials with&#xD;
        approved antipsychotic drugs, typical or atypical, in the standard dose range. It is&#xD;
        recognized that some treatment resistant patients will have had good responses to&#xD;
        antipsychotic drugs before meeting treatment resistant criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have a Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) scale score at&#xD;
             screening of at least moderate severity, and must have a PSP score of 60 or below.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may initially be inpatients or outpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of child bearing potential will be admitted only if they are on stable birth&#xD;
             control medication and understand that they should not get pregnant during the course&#xD;
             of the study. Pregnancy tests will be done at baseline and at approximately 2 month&#xD;
             intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have stable housing at the current time or will be discharged to a&#xD;
             stable outpatient setting for housing, if an inpatient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be willing to remain compliant on oral medication throughout the&#xD;
             duration of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to provide written, informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a diagnosis other than schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients currently taking clozapine or have failed an adequate trial of clozapine&#xD;
             which lasted at least 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have already failed trials with high doses of other atypical&#xD;
             antipsychotic drugs such as risperidone or olanzapine..&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant females and females who are currently breastfeeding will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a diagnosis of substance dependence at screening or up to one year prior&#xD;
             to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of non-compliance to oral medication to a degree that would&#xD;
             interfere with the determination of treatment resistance or diminish likelihood of&#xD;
             complying with this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients &gt; age 60&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled medical conditions or recent myocardial infarction or stroke&#xD;
