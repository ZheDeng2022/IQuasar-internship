      Objective: Previous studies have suggested that psycho-educational interventions delivered by&#xD;
      telephone improve adherence to initial colposcopy after an abnormal Pap smear. To further&#xD;
      explore strategies for enhanced follow-up to medical care recommendations, we studied the&#xD;
      impact of a theory-guided cognitive-affective barriers counseling intervention, delivered at&#xD;
      2-4 weeks before the colposcopy appointment, for inner city women. The comprehensive&#xD;
      telephone barriers intervention was compared to an enhanced comparison group and a group that&#xD;
      received tailored print materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Participants (N = 211) were recruited through a colposcopy clinic and randomly&#xD;
      assigned to: 1) telephone assessment of barriers to follow up adherence recommendations&#xD;
      combined with tailored telephone barriers counseling; 2) telephone assessment combined with&#xD;
      tailored barriers print brochure; or 3) telephone assessment with no barriers counseling.&#xD;
      Participants were assessed at baseline, 1-week, 9 and 15 months post-colposcopy.&#xD;

      Objective: Previous studies have shown that theory-based, tailored telephone barriers&#xD;
      counseling significantly improves adherence to a colposcopy appointment after an abnormal pap&#xD;
      smear result among low-income, minority women. This study built on these research findings&#xD;
      and explored the efficacy of a state-of-the-science telephone counseling intervention&#xD;
      utilizing a more rigorous study design. This enhanced counseling intervention was tailored to&#xD;
      individual's distinctive cognitive-affective barriers profile, as assessed by the&#xD;
      Cognitive-Social Health Information Processing (C-SHIP) model-guided barriers assessment&#xD;
      tool, and with counseling messages targeted to all five domains of individual's barriers to&#xD;
      adherence. In addition, the current study design was improved in two ways. First, the&#xD;
      comparison group in this current study was an enhanced one that received a notification&#xD;
      letter, assessment of cognitive-affective barriers by telephone, and a telephone appointment&#xD;
      reminder. Second, this study had a longer follow-up period to allow testing of the&#xD;
      intervention effect beyond initial colposcopy adherence. The participants were followed for&#xD;
      15 months post-colposcopy so that participants' adherence to medical follow-up&#xD;
      recommendations (if any) within the 12 months after initial colposcopy can be collected and&#xD;
      studied. Adherence to medical follow-up at 6 months and 12 months was measured at 9 months&#xD;
      and 15 months, respectively, to allow 3 months for rescheduling, attending, and recording of&#xD;
      the appointment. Overall, this study tested whether an enhanced tailored telephone barriers&#xD;
      counseling intervention improve adherence to medical follow-up after abnormal pap smear among&#xD;
      low-income, minority women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Participants (211) were randomized to the following baseline conditions: a) standard&#xD;
      care (SC), i.e., a cognitive-affective barriers (CAB) assessment delivered via phone, receipt&#xD;
      of a notification letter from physician regarding abnormal Pap test result and need to&#xD;
      undergo colposcopy, and also including appointment date and clinic contact numbers, plus&#xD;
      telephone confirmation and post-card appointment reminder; b) SC plus CAB counseling&#xD;
      delivered by phone (CAB-C -T), i.e., culturally-relevant/sensitive barrier-specific messages&#xD;
      drawn from a pre-developed library designed to counsel individuals regarding their specific&#xD;
      barriers to adherence, e.g., by increasing risk-related knowledge, providing accurate outcome&#xD;
      and self-efficacy expectancies, addressing health-related values and goals, moderating&#xD;
      risk-related affect, or offering active plans and strategies to assist with self-regulation;&#xD;
      c) SC plus CAB counseling delivered via Mail-Home Print Material (CAB-C-P), which included&#xD;
      exactly the same applicable messages as were delivered by phone, but in print form. The&#xD;
      tailoring of messages to a participant's cognitive-affective barriers profile was based on&#xD;
      the two barriers in each of the five Cognitive-Social Health Information Processing (C-SHIP)&#xD;
      categories (a total of 10 messages) that she rated most important on a five-point scale.&#xD;
      There were 23 cognitive-affective adherence barriers grouped into the following C-SHIP&#xD;
      categories: 1) risk-related encodings/perceptions (i.e., purpose of colposcopy, presence and&#xD;
      progression of HPV-related disease); 2) risk-related expectancies and beliefs (i.e.,&#xD;
      confidence in ability to keep appointment, fatalistic beliefs about cancer); 3) risk-related&#xD;
      values and goals (i.e., maintaining modesty, importance of having children); 4) risk-related&#xD;
      affect (i.e., worries about necessary procedures and/or progression of disease, concerns&#xD;
      regarding fertility); and 5) risk-related self-regulation (i.e., remembering appointment,&#xD;
      overcoming child-care or work-related conflicts, transportation difficulties, ability to&#xD;
      manage any negative risk-related affect). With regard to assessments, they were conducted at&#xD;
      the following time points: baseline, and 1-week, 9-month, and 15-month post-colposcopy and&#xD;
      included the following: the CAB assessment; background variables, including demographic&#xD;
      (e.g., gender, age, ethnicity, education, marital and employment status, household income,&#xD;
      number of children); medical and screening history (e.g., cancer diagnosis, previous Pap&#xD;
      smears and frequency; breast exams (self and clinical); mammograms and abnormal results;&#xD;
      results of the index colposcopy and physician recommendations from medical records; a&#xD;
      potential moderating dispositional variable, attentional style (Monitoring-Blunting Style&#xD;
      Scale); potential mediating variables, including affective variables (Spielberger State-Trait&#xD;
      Anxiety Inventory, the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale), and&#xD;
      cognitive-affective process variables (knowledge, risk perceptions, expectancies and beliefs,&#xD;
      affect, values and goals, regulatory skills); outcome variables, including adherence to&#xD;
      initial diagnostic colposcopy and to 6- and 12-months colposcopically-based follow-up&#xD;
      diagnostic and medical management recommendations, and an intervention evaluation. All&#xD;
      assessments used scales developed in previous research, except the Powe Fatalism Inventory&#xD;
      used to assess fatalism and the Revised Impact of Events Scale used to assess affect (i.e.,&#xD;
      stress-related intrusive and avoidant thoughts). Assessed at baseline were background&#xD;
      variables (except medical recommendations), the moderating variable, and all mediating&#xD;
      variables. The cognitive-affective barriers were assessed only at baseline. Assessed at&#xD;
      1-week post-colposcopy and at the 9-month and 15 month follow-ups were all mediating&#xD;
      variables (except the cognitive-affect barriers) and outcome variables. The medical&#xD;
      recommendations were assessed only at the 1-week post-colposcopy. Medical history was also&#xD;
      re-assessed at the 15-month follow-up relating to the interim period from baseline.&#xD;
