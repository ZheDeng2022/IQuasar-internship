      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Gum disease is a condition in which the tissue around the tooth root becomes swollen and&#xD;
      infected. This condition can cause tooth loss if it is not treated. Who gets gum disease and&#xD;
      how bad it will be depends on (1) the different bacteria in the mouth and (2) how the immune&#xD;
      system of an individual handles these bacteria. Researchers want to look at the oral bacteria&#xD;
      and genetic immune problems of different people to learn how these affect gum disease and&#xD;
      other conditions of the mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study how immune system problems may lead to problems in the mouth, including gum&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children and adults at least 7 years of age who have genetic problems with their immune&#xD;
           system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy adults that have periodontal disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health adults that do not have periodontal disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will involve a screening visit and a study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, blood work and a full oral and&#xD;
           dental exam, including dental x-rays and photos.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study visit will involve collection of blood, urine, and other samples, including&#xD;
           saliva, plaque, and gum swabs. Any abnormal tissue will sampled for a biopsy. Additional&#xD;
           oral and dental exams will be performed. Participants will also answer questions about&#xD;
           any current medical or dental problems.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a cross sectional/natural history protocol designed to investigate the clinical,&#xD;
&#xD;
      microbiologic, and immunologic consequences of genetic immune defects in the oral cavity. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that genetic immune defects will lead to alterations in the local immune&#xD;
      response and microbial colonization and ultimately predispose to susceptibility to oral&#xD;
      infections and inflammatory conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the cross-sectional phase the following individuals will be enrolled, evaluated and&#xD;
      screened for presence and severity of periodontitis, presence of a genetic defects and&#xD;
      sampled for studies in oral immunity and microbiome: 1) individuals diagnosed with genetic&#xD;
      immune defects 2) individuals with severe periodontitis of suspected genetic etiology and&#xD;
      their family members 3) healthy volunteers. Subjects identified with a genetic immune defect&#xD;
      and with presence of oral disease (primarily periodontitis) may enter the natural history&#xD;
      phase of the study to be clinically followed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) over&#xD;
      time. This protocol aims to determine whether specific genetic immune defects will predispose&#xD;
      to oral disease (primarily periodontitis) and to better understand consequences of immune&#xD;
      deficiency on the oral immune response and microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigate the degree, scope, etiology and natural history of oral manifestations in&#xD;
           patients with genetic immune defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Characterize the immune response in the oral cavity of patients with genetic immune&#xD;
           defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Characterize the microbiome in the oral cavity of patients with genetic immune defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assay development/validation for the study of tissue immunity and microbiome&#xD;
           characterization&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Establishment of normative values for immune mediators and microbial elements at the&#xD;
           oral cavity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population (s)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects with genetic immune defects&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects with severe periodontitis of suspected genetic etiology and their family&#xD;
           members&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Healthy volunteers (with/without periodontal disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross-sectional/natural history study for the evaluation of clinical, immunologic,&#xD;
      and microbiologic oral manifestations (primarily periodontitis) in patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      genetic immune defects or those with severe periodontitis of suspected genetic etiology and&#xD;
      healthy volunteer subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross Sectional Phase: Three groups of subjects will be enrolled in the cross-sectional phase&#xD;
      of the study 1) individuals diagnosed with genetic immune defects 2) individuals with severe&#xD;
      periodontitis of suspected genetic etiology and their family members that include parents or&#xD;
      siblings 3) healthy volunteers (with/without periodontal disease). All groups will be&#xD;
      evaluated for oral disease (periodontitis) and sampled for oral immunity, systemic immunity&#xD;
      and microbiome characterization. Individuals with severe periodontitis in the&#xD;
      presence/absence of a genetic defect may be offered the option of receiving standard of care&#xD;
      inflammatory control periodontal treatment at NIH without travel compensation, following the&#xD;
      cross-sectional portion of the study. Family members (parents or siblings) of individuals&#xD;
      with periodontal disease of suspected genetic may be asked to participate in this study.&#xD;
      During the course of genetic testing, family members may be enrolled in the cross sectional&#xD;
      phase of the study for phenotyping and genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natural History Phase: Subjects identified with a genetic defect with the presence of oral&#xD;
      disease may enroll in the natural history phase of the study to be followed clinically over&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical intraoral characterization (i.e., presence and severity of periodontitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Characterize the immune response in the oral cavity of patients with genetic immune&#xD;
           defects&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Characterize the microbiome in the oral cavity of patients with genetic immune defects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assay development/validation for the study of tissue immunity and microbiome&#xD;
           characterization&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Establishment of normative values for immune mediators and microbial elements at the&#xD;
           oral cavity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial data from this study may generate new hypotheses for investigation as part of this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
