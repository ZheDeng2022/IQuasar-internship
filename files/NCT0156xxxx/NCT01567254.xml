    <textblock>
      Background: Pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus are known to be a challenging&#xD;
      group for achieving recommended glycemic control. Coping with the demands of self-managing&#xD;
      IDDM in children and adolescents can be a formidable task, requiring a healthy and balanced&#xD;
      diet, monitoring and regular insulin injections. Most patients are non-compliant to the&#xD;
      treatment. A number of controlled studies have examined the efficiency of psychosocial&#xD;
      interventions for improving compliance and glycemic control among diabetic youth. None has&#xD;
      examined the effectiveness of guided imagery in treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To asses simultaneously the effect of listening to auditory guided imagery&#xD;
      and blood glucose variability, compared to variability in blood glucose while listening to&#xD;
      songs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective To assess the effect of routine auditory guided imagery to glycemic&#xD;
      control and quality of life in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus, compared to listening&#xD;
      listening to songs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: 14 youth ages 7-16 years with type 1 diabetes mellitus , for at least 6 months, and&#xD;
      not during the honey moon period will be recruited, and will be blindly randomized to receive&#xD;
      intervention (auditory guided imagery group) or control (regular auditory music).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A randomized Controlled Blinded Study Intervention: 14 randomly numbered CD's will be&#xD;
      prepared at study initiation, half containing auditory guided imagery and half containing&#xD;
      music.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol: After an initial check up, including HbA1C levels, and explanation of study&#xD;
      procedures the participants will be given either the intervention or the control CD, to be&#xD;
      used twice a day for five days. During this period continuous glucose monitoring will be&#xD;
      performed. On days one and five the procedure will take place while the participants are&#xD;
      connected to biofeedback. QOL questionnaires will be completed at the beginning of day one,&#xD;
      or before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second part of the study the children will use the intervention / control CD at home&#xD;
      twice a week for 12 weeks. At the end of the study period they will again be evaluated,&#xD;
      including HbA1C, and all subjects will again complete QOL questionnaires&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      14 participants will be assigned research numbers in a consecutive recruitment order.(01-14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      14 auditory disks will be prepared ahead of study initiation, 7 with the guided imagery&#xD;
      program and 7 with regular songs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All will look similar from the outside. The disks will be numbered 01-14. Disks numbering&#xD;
      will be performed by an investigator who is not part of treatment team, without knowing which&#xD;
      disk contains which content. So that the team and participants are blinded to the disk&#xD;
      content at initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and parents will be aware of the type of auditory disk after initial auscultation at&#xD;
      visit number 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The team will continue to be blinded to type of disk until end of study. 3. All participants&#xD;
      will be aware at study initiation that they may receive the auditory guided imagery disk or a&#xD;
      regular songs / story auditory disk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Visit no. 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Will be arranged on date of their regular clinic visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Guidance to disk usage&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Biofeedback for autonomic parameters assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Participants will be connected to the continuous glucose monitoring system (A system&#xD;
           which the patient is blinded to glucose readings).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Participants and parents will fill QOL questionnaire [The Diabetes Treatment&#xD;
           Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) by Bradley C. et Al (16)], if not filled before.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Participants will listen to disk for the first time in clinic, alone in a room with the&#xD;
           parent&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. At this stage participants will be aware of the group they are in (treatment vs.&#xD;
           control), but team is still unaware.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Participants will be able to come with brothers and parents and recreational activity&#xD;
           will be available at site for all for entertainment 5. Visit no. 2-5: 6. Participants&#xD;
           will listen to disk twice a day for the next four days alone in a room in our clinic.&#xD;
           They will be able to come with brothers and parents, and recreational activity will be&#xD;
           available at site for all for entertainment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7. 5th day visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Participants will listen to disk for the last times in clinic, alone in a room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. Participants will be disconnected from CGMS c. Biofeedback for autonomic parameters&#xD;
      assessment 8. Participants will listen to disk at least twice a week, for additional 11&#xD;
      weeks, at their choice of time and day, and will record the specific time of listening on&#xD;
      study chart 9. Visit no. 6:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Will be arranged on date of their regular clinic visit (12-14 weeks after visit no. 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Biofeedback for autonomic parameters assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants and parents will fill QOL questionnaires (The Diabetes Treatment&#xD;
           Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) by Bradley C. et Al (16)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. End of study 10. Data will be collected from charts from dates of visit no. 1 and visit&#xD;
           no. 3 regarding: weight, height, BMI, 14 days average blood glucose levels, HbA1c.&#xD;
