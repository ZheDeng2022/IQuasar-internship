  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate repeat doses of isavuconazole on cardiac repolarization in&#xD;
      healthy adult subjects. Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of four treatment groups&#xD;
      and be confined for 17 days including pre-dosing days. Moxifloxacin will be given as an&#xD;
      active control on the last dosing day to healthy subjects in one of the four groups. All&#xD;
      treatments, except the moxifloxacin dose, are double-blinded (neither the subject nor the&#xD;
      study doctor will know the treatment assignment). Subjects will undergo continuous ECGs on&#xD;
      three study days. ECGs, vital signs, blood draws will be obtained throughout the study for&#xD;
      safety and to assess the amount of study drug in body.&#xD;
