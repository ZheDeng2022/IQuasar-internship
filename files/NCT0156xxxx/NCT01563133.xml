    <textblock>
      This study focuses on three different lesions: pancreatic cysts, lymph nodes near the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract and pancreatic masses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On one hand, the results obtained during previous studies are more advanced for the&#xD;
      assessment of the diagnostic performance of Cellvizio needle-based Confocal Laser&#xD;
      Endomicroscopy (nCLE) system for Pancreatic cysts. Safety and technical feasibility have&#xD;
      already been performed, and an interpretation criteria classification exists. On the other&#xD;
      hand, results for pancreatic masses and Lymph nodes are less developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study therefore comprises two sub-studies, one on the pancreatic cysts, and another on&#xD;
      pancreatic masses and lymph nodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cysts The primary hypothesis of the study is that using nCLE in addition to EUS-FNA and&#xD;
           tissue sampling allows better characterization of pancreatic cysts and improves&#xD;
           appropriate therapeutic decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For physicians, integrating nCLE into the diagnostic algorithm of pancreatic cysts could&#xD;
           impact patient management by :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ruling out malignancy for patients with benign appearing nCLE images.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Characterizing more malignant tumors in the pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pancreatic masses and Lymph nodes The primary hypothesis of the study is that in vivo&#xD;
           imaging of lymph-nodes near the gastrointestinal tract and pancreatic masses during&#xD;
           EUS-FNA procedures is feasible and that descriptive criteria can be defined to further&#xD;
           differentiate the different types of lesions.&#xD;

      1. Medical background Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death&#xD;
           in the United States. This disease is associated with a high mortality rate: the 5-year&#xD;
           survival rate is estimated to be 4%. This is mainly due to the fact that the disease is&#xD;
           often discovered at an already advanced disease state, which carries a dismal prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1. Pancreatic Cysts&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pancreatic cysts are quite rare, but are being increasingly recognized due to the&#xD;
           expanding use of cross-sectional imaging. They are classified into three main classes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pseudocysts&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serous cysts : either serous cystic neoplasms (SCN) or Solid pseudo-papillary&#xD;
                neoplasm (SPN)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mucinous cystic neoplasms : either Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm (IPMN)&#xD;
                or mucinous cystadenomas/mucinous cystadenocarcinoma(MCN) Mucinous cystic neoplasms&#xD;
                are considered to be malignant or pre-malignant and are considered for surgical&#xD;
                resection, whereas pseudocysts and serous cysts are considered benign and with a&#xD;
                low potential for malignancy. Pseudocysts and serous cysts are usually only&#xD;
                considered for surgical resection when symptomatic or enlarging.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. Pancreatic masses Pancreatic solid masses can be either exocrine or endocrine&#xD;
           tumors, or metastatic.Exocrine tumors are by far the most common type of pancreas&#xD;
           cancer. Most of them are malignant. About 96% of cancers of the exocrine pancreas are&#xD;
           adenocarcinomas, which is the most aggressive form of pancreas cancer.Endocrine tumors&#xD;
           are uncommon. They represent 4% of pancreas tumors. They are known as neuroendocrine&#xD;
           tumors (NETs), or islet cell tumors. These tumors can be benign or malignant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3. Lymph nodes Lymph nodes are examined in a patient with a suspicion of, or&#xD;
           confirmed, cancer, as part of the staging. They may be either normal, inflammatory, or&#xD;
           malignant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical background&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1. EUSFNA Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) is the diagnostic method of choice when a&#xD;
           pancreatic lesion is found incidentally on cross-sectional imaging. Endoscopic&#xD;
           UltraSound-guided Fine Needle Aspiration (EUS FNA) (respectively Endobronchial&#xD;
           Ultrasound-guided Fine Needle Aspiration (EBUS FNA)) are procedures where a target&#xD;
           tissue in proximity to the GI tract (respectively the pulmonary tract) is biopsied using&#xD;
           a fine needle guided in real time by an ultrasound probe fixed at the tip of an&#xD;
           endoscope.It may therefore be applied to pancreatic lesions, or lymph nodes examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2. nCLE The principle of needle-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy (nCLE) is to image&#xD;
           organs within or adjacent to the GI or respiratory tracts with a miniprobe inserted&#xD;
           through an endoscopic needle. The fundamental technology as well as the principle of&#xD;
           operation of nCLE are substantially similar to pCLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical evidence More than 100 patients have already underwent an nCLE procedure, in&#xD;
           the past studies. A first feasibility study enabled to define the final type of probe&#xD;
           which would fit into a EUSFNA needle, and the INSPECT study enabled to define&#xD;
           interpretation criteria on the micro-structure of pancreatic cysts. Less data is&#xD;
           available on pancreatic masses and lymph nodes, except for a few images done in the&#xD;
           first feasibility study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1. Cysts 4.1.1. The primary objective of the study is to assess the diagnostic&#xD;
           performance of the Cellvizio nCLE system in diagnosing pancreatic cysts, when associated&#xD;
           with other diagnostic information.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1.2. The secondary objectives are to assess the potential impact of the Cellvizio nCLE&#xD;
           system on patient management and validate the interpretation classification criteria&#xD;
           that were created during the previous INSPECT study on cysts.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2. Pancreatic masses and Lymph nodes 4.2.1. The primary objective of the study is to&#xD;
           define criteria of nCLE sequences in lymph nodes and pancreatic masses.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2.2. The secondary objectives are to evaluate feasibility and safety of the Cellvizio&#xD;
           nCLE during EUS-FNA procedures, build an atlas of images of nCLE sequences of pancreatic&#xD;
           masses and lymph nodes, and, finally, retrospectively assess the diagnostic performance&#xD;
           of nCLE in the diagnosis of pancreatic masses and lymph nodes, when associated with&#xD;
           other diagnostic information&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Design This study will be conducted in three centers in France.&#xD;
