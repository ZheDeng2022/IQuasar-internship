  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is an inflammatory condition of the nose and sinuses. It affects&#xD;
      about 5 to 10% of Canadians. Patients suffer from congestion in the nose and sinuses, nasal&#xD;
      discharge, pressure in the face, and a reduced sense of smell. This affects people's&#xD;
      enjoyment of life. Medical management uses sprays or pills to treat these symptoms but for&#xD;
      some patients sinus surgery is needed. This type of surgery is called endoscopic sinus&#xD;
      surgery (ESS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no single correct approach to take care of patients after sinus surgery. Most&#xD;
      experts would use a nasal spray and a short-course of oral steroid pills to reduce sinus&#xD;
      swelling and minimize complications related to scarring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Steroid-eluting nasal spacers&quot; are devices placed inside the sinus during surgery and slowly&#xD;
      release topical steroids into the sinuses better than steroid sprays. These &quot;spacers&quot; have&#xD;
      been shown to improve results following sinus surgery. When using these special &quot;spacers&quot;,&#xD;
      there may no longer be a need for oral steroid pills following surgery. This would help to&#xD;
      avoid potential side effects associated with these medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether taking oral (systemic) steroid pills&#xD;
      following sinus surgery is necessary to improve surgical results, now that steroid-eluting&#xD;
      nasal spacers are commonly used during surgery.&#xD;
