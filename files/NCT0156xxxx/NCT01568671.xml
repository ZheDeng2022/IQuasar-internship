      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The way that the body burns calories is known as energy expenditure. Some studies show that&#xD;
      when we are cold, we burn more calories to keep our bodies warm. Brown fat is a special kind&#xD;
      of fat that can use energy to keep the body warm. Small animals and infants have been known&#xD;
      to have brown fat for many years. Recently, it has been suggested that adult humans also have&#xD;
      brown fat. If brown fat becomes active (burns calories) in adult humans when exposed to cold,&#xD;
      then these people would tend to burn off more calories and might not gain weight easily.&#xD;
      Learning more about the relationship between energy expenditure, brown fat, environmental&#xD;
      temperature, and body temperature may help explain why some people become obese and other&#xD;
      people do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To better understand how the body burns calories when exposed to different temperatures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study brown fat and how it burns calories in cold temperatures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy men between 18 and 35 or 55 and 75 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy women between 18 and 35 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To control for ethnicity, participants must be non-Hispanic whites or African Americans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will stay in the Metabolic Unit of the National Institutes of Health&#xD;
           Clinical Center as inpatients for no more than 14 days. The length of the hospital stay&#xD;
           will depend on how participants respond to the different study temperatures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every afternoon, participants will walk for 30 minutes on a treadmill. All meals will be&#xD;
           provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will stay up to 5 hours per day in a specialized room with different&#xD;
           temperature settings. Temperatures will range from about 61 degrees to 88 degrees&#xD;
           Fahrenheit. Body temperature, activity, calorie burning, and cold/hot sensations will be&#xD;
           monitored. On the study day of the coldest temperature, participants will have an&#xD;
           imaging study to look for brown fat activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be compensated for their time and participation at the end of the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Surprisingly little is understood about how the body regulates heat production (energy&#xD;
      expenditure, EE) in response to subtle changes in environmental temperature. For example,&#xD;
      only recently has it been realized that brown adipose tissue is functional in adult humans.&#xD;
      It is plausible that the mechanisms governing heat production contribute to regulation of&#xD;
      body weight and thus may be contributing to the current obesity epidemic: even small changes&#xD;
      in EE, if not compensated by changes in food intake, can have long-term effects on body&#xD;
      weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The thermoneutral zone (TNZ) is the environmental temperature range over which EE is at a&#xD;
      minimum and does not change with environmental temperature. The lower and upper critical&#xD;
      temperatures define the temperature limits of the TNZ. At environmental temperatures below&#xD;
      the lower critical temperature, the EE vs. environmental temperature graph is reported to be&#xD;
      a straight line with the extrapolated X-axis intercept being the defended body temperature.&#xD;
      Some of these parameters are predicted to be different for obese as compared to lean&#xD;
      individuals. With the global obesity epidemic coinciding with improved indoor temperature&#xD;
      control, a better understanding of the relationship between EE and thermoregulation is&#xD;
      desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol has three phases. The first is a pilot in lean males to optimize procedures and&#xD;
      establish the feasibility, sensitivity, and behavior of the assays. Second, lean and obese&#xD;
      male cohorts will be compared to ensure that the expected differences can be observed. Third,&#xD;
      additional variables will be examined, such as age, race, sex, and menstrual phase in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, we will map the resting EE response to environmental temperatures from 16-31&#xD;
      degrees Celsius during inpatient stays in the NIH Metabolic Clinical Research Unit. Each day&#xD;
      resting EE will be measured in a room respiration calorimeter with a different environmental&#xD;
      temperature (subjects will be blinded as to room temperature). The remainder of each study&#xD;
      day will be spent at 23-25 degrees Celsius in the individual patient room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard diet and physical activity will be maintained and body weight will be held stable.&#xD;
      Additionally core body and skin temperatures, heart rate and variability, muscle activity by&#xD;
      surface electromyography, and thermal comfort and hunger using visual analog scales will be&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will establish techniques and provide baseline normative data, allowing insight&#xD;
      into the mechanisms regulating the EE in humans and how these are affected by obesity. It is&#xD;
      envisioned that this study will provide the basis for investigation of the effects of acute&#xD;
      and chronic weight change and the effects of drug therapy.&#xD;
