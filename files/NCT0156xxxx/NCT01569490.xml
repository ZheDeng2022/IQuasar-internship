  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test the hypotheses that incentives can increase both participation&#xD;
      in smoking cessation treatment and resulting cessation rates, when they are offered to&#xD;
      Medicaid BadgerCare Plus pregnant smokers.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1: To determine the extent to which contingent financial &quot;treatment incentives&quot; (i.e.,&#xD;
      incentives for biochemical verification visits, treatment engagement, and abstinence) versus&#xD;
      &quot;attendance incentives&quot; (i.e., incentives for only attending the biochemical verification&#xD;
      visits), increase rates of prenatal and postnatal smoking abstinence. Participants will be&#xD;
      BadgerCare Plus members who are recruited into the First Breath program while pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine the extent to which treatment incentives, versus attendance incentives,&#xD;
      increase rates of engagement in First Breath smoking cessation intervention when offered to&#xD;
      pregnant and postpartum BadgerCare Plus members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To determine the cost-effectiveness and reach of the First Breath intervention&#xD;
      delivered to pregnant and postpartum smokers when it is paired with treatment incentives and&#xD;
      when paired with only attendance incentives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To determine if the First Breath intervention with treatment incentives, in comparison&#xD;
      to that intervention with only attendance incentives, produces significantly greater benefits&#xD;
      in pregnant and postpartum women with regards to nonsmoking health outcomes: i.e., reduced&#xD;
      depression, increased levels of breast feeding, and greater perceived support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 5: To identify moderating and mediating effects of treatment incentives when offered in&#xD;
      the context of the First Breath intervention delivered to pregnant and postpartum women.&#xD;
