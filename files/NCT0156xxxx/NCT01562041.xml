    <measure>Change From Baseline in Maximum ST Segment Change Adjusted for Heart Rate (ST-HR) Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>ST/HR index was measured as the average change in ST segment depression relative to heart rate change over the entire duration of exercise, monitored by ECG during the exercise treadmill tests. Change in maximum ST/HR index between the average of tests 1-3 (pre Ranexa® treatment) performed during baseline period and test 4 (post Ranexa® treatment) during treatment period was reported.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Maximum ST Segment Change Adjusted for Heart Rate (ST-HR) Slope</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>ST-HR slope is an index of exercise induced ischemia. Linear regression was used to determine the slope of the ST/HR relationship in a participant's ECG response monitored during the exercise treadmill test. The highest ST segment/heart rate slope from among all the ECG leads and the X-axis intercept of the associated line were used to generate the maximum slope. Change in maximum ST-HR slope between the average of tests 1-3 (pre Ranexa® treatment) performed during baseline period and test 4 (post Ranexa® treatment) during treatment period was reported.</description>

    <description>Linear regression was used to determine the slope of the ST/HR relationship in a participant's ECG response monitored during the exercise treadmill test. Change in X- axis intercept of ST-HR slope between the average of tests 1-3 (pre Ranexa® treatment) performed during baseline period and test 4 (post Ranexa® treatment) during treatment period was reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Exercise Duration</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Total exercise duration was defined as the elapsed time between the start of exercise and termination of exercise for severe angina, dyspnea or extreme fatigue assessed during the exercise treadmill test. Change in the duration of exercise between the average of tests 1-3 (pre Ranexa® treatment) performed during baseline period and test 4 (post Ranexa® treatment) during treatment period was reported.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Time to Onset of 1 mm ST Segment Depression (Time to Ischemia)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise-induced ischemia was defined as the new development of horizontal or down sloping ST-segment depression (≥ 1 mm at 60 milliseconds after the J point) vs. baseline tracings. Change in time to onset of 1 mm ST depression between the average of tests 1-3 (pre Ranexa® treatment) performed during baseline period and test 4 (post Ranexa® treatment) during treatment period was reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Time to Onset of Angina</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Time to onset of angina was defined as the elapsed time between the start of exercise and the onset of anginal chest pain as reported by the participant. Change in time to angina between the average of tests 1-3 (pre Ranexa® treatment) performed during baseline period and test 4 (post Ranexa® treatment) during treatment period was reported.</description>
