      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety, and feasibility of a device, which&#xD;
      enables LV volume and radius reduction through scar exclusion in patients whose systolic HF&#xD;
      is due to ischemic cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate subjects will have akinetic or dyskinetic scar located in the antero-septal LV&#xD;
      distribution. Use of this device replicates the geometric reconfiguration of the ventricle&#xD;
      achieved through surgical Left Ventricular Reconstruction (LVR), but on a beating,&#xD;
      unsupported heart, thereby creating the option of avoiding the use of cardiopulmonary bypass&#xD;
      pump (CBP).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congestive heart failure is the &quot;epidemic&quot; of cardiovascular disease (Eugene Braunwald, NEJM&#xD;
      1997), yet there is no cure. The American Heart Association (AHA) reports the nearly five&#xD;
      million Americans are afflicted. Approximately 1.5 million admissions in the US are due to&#xD;
      heart failure (HF); it is the number one cost-item for Medicare, comprising 6% of its total&#xD;
      expenditures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the limitations of existing therapy, physicians have sought alternative&#xD;
      treatments. In this regard, there has been longstanding interest in surgical reconstruction&#xD;
      of the failing heart. The underlying premise has been to surgically reduce the size of the&#xD;
      ventricular chamber by removing a portion of the ventricular wall to decrease chamber radius.&#xD;
      A reduction of chamber radius reduces wall stress for a given pressure so that the remaining&#xD;
      muscle is put into a more favorable mechanical state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BioVentrix PliCath HF System consists of implantable anchors, the delivery system, and&#xD;
      accessories, which are sterile and biocompatible. These devices are used in the&#xD;
      reconfiguration of the abnormal cardiac geometry that is causing dysfunction by excluding a&#xD;
      portion of the left ventricular chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure is based on the premise that the beneficial effects of Left Ventricular&#xD;
      Reconstruction (LVR) via radius and volume reduction, can be realized by excluding a portion&#xD;
      of the scarred left ventricle wall circumference. The procedure is similar to a Dor procedure&#xD;
      except that it utilizes a series of anchors in place of the Fontan stitch and patch to&#xD;
      exclude infarcted tissue and reduce the size of the left ventricle chamber and the scarred&#xD;
      left ventricle wall. Because the ventricle is not resected, it is possible to do the&#xD;
      procedure without a cardiopulmonary bypass pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The validity of this concept has been documented. Geometric confirmation was initially&#xD;
      accomplished in a bench model, where radius was decreased by 24% and volume was diminished by&#xD;
      35% after exclusion of an antero-septal wall segment in dilated, explanted porcine hearts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When using the PliCath System in accomplishing LV reconfiguration, the fundamental technical&#xD;
      maneuver is placement of a hollow needle through a predetermined site in the anterior wall&#xD;
      scar, across the LV chamber, and through a predetermined site in the scarred interventricular&#xD;
      septum. Once achieved, a flexible guidewire is advanced through the needle and into the free&#xD;
      right ventricular (RV) chamber. Once the wire is completely through the septum, a dilator&#xD;
      enables passage of a 14Fr Introducer to traverse the needle route, allowing introduction of&#xD;
      an internal, elongated anchor which can be oriented into appropriate alignment and matched&#xD;
      with an external anchor of identical length and alignment. The anchors, which are placed in&#xD;
      the RV and on the epicardium as a result of the original needle passage, can be brought&#xD;
      toward each other until contact between the two walls is established and they are apposed&#xD;
      along their lengths. The action is repeated (i.e., repeated needle sticks and anchor&#xD;
      placement), along the long axis of the LV until a linear portion of antero-lateral wall is in&#xD;
      contact with a corresponding portion of the septum, excluding the entire intervening wall&#xD;
      segment from the circumference of the chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device is designed to allow removal at any stage of deployment prior to removal of the&#xD;
      &quot;Leash&quot; attached to the hinged, internal anchor.&#xD;
