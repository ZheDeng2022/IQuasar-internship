      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - About one-tenth of adults with sickle cell disease have pulmonary hypertension (high blood&#xD;
      pressure in the lungs). This condition can cause shortness of breath, pain crisis, and&#xD;
      congestive heart failure. It may even lead to death. Researchers want to test the drugs&#xD;
      imatinib and carvedilol to see if they can treat high blood pressure in the lungs. Both drugs&#xD;
      have been used to treat other types of heart problems, but they have not been tested as a&#xD;
      treatment for high blood pressure related to sickle cell disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if imatinib and carvedilol are safe and effective treatments for high blood pressure&#xD;
      in the lungs in adults with sickle cell disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults at least 18 years of age who have sickle cell disease and have or may have high&#xD;
      blood pressure in the lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also&#xD;
           have different tests of heart and lung function, including a walking test and imaging&#xD;
           studies. Blood and urine samples will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who meet specific criteria will take one of two possible study drugs. Those&#xD;
           who receive imatinib will take it daily. Those who receive carvedilol will take it twice&#xD;
           a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have weekly study visits for blood tests and other exams. The study&#xD;
           drug dose will be adjusted at each weekly visit. It will be increased slowly to reach a&#xD;
           target dose(based on the participant s weight) or to find a stable effective dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may continue to take their study drug for up to 24 weeks, with weekly study&#xD;
           visits. Regular blood samples and heart and lung function tests will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 24 weeks, qualified participants may continue to take their study drug for up to 6&#xD;
           more months. They will have regular study visits to monitor the treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sickle Cell Disease related pulmonary hypertension is a heterogeneous condition that results&#xD;
      in a high mortality and for which no therapy has been documented to be beneficial. We propose&#xD;
      to perform a safety and tolerability study of treatments based on right heart catheterization&#xD;
      derived hemodynamic profiles associated with higher mortality in our cohort. These same&#xD;
      hemodynamic profiles have previously been described and confirmed in other large cohorts as&#xD;
      well. We propose treatment of sickle cell subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension&#xD;
      (PAH), defined hemodynamically by pulmonary arterial mean pressures (mPAP) of 25 mmHg or&#xD;
      greater, with low estimated left ventricular filling pressures (low pulmonary capillary wedge&#xD;
      pressures, or PCWP), and high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), with imatinib, a tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase inhibitor that modifies the Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) pathway. PDGF is&#xD;
      involved in Sickle Cell related PAH and there is now evidence that imatinib is effective in&#xD;
      the treatment of idiopathic PAH. The hemodynamic profile of elevated mPAP with elevated left&#xD;
      ventricular filling pressures is also associated with higher mortality rates, and we propose&#xD;
      to treat this subgroup with carvedilol, a unique beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist that has&#xD;
      been demonstrated to attenuate the adrenergic response and improve right and left heart&#xD;
      function. The third subgroup with elevated mPAP is the hyperdynamic group, which by&#xD;
      definition has low PVR and the absence of elevated left ventricular filling pressures. This&#xD;
      group is also at higher risk but over a longer period of time and for less evident reasons.&#xD;
      We will continue with aggressive sickle cell management in the hyperdynamic group according&#xD;
      to the expertise offered by the Sickle Cell Group at the Clinical Center while systematically&#xD;
      following them and intervening with optimal care. Those who do not quality for any of the&#xD;
      three subgroups described above will go into a fourth subgroup and be followed for mortality&#xD;
      and data sharing. Our primary endpoint is the safety and tolerability of these interventions&#xD;
      and our secondary endpoints will be the clinical efficacy of these treatments.&#xD;
