  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of an investigational drug&#xD;
      called APS001F when given with flucytosine (5-FC) for treatment of solid tumors. APS001F is a&#xD;
      recombinant Bifidobacterium longum (a live bacteria normally found in the digestive tract)&#xD;
      that has been modified to produce an enzyme, cytosine deaminase (CD). The patient will first&#xD;
      receive an injection of APS001F followed by oral 5-FC. APS001F is expected to go to the site&#xD;
      of the tumor(s) where the agent will produce CD enzyme. CD enzyme will convert the 5-FC into&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU) which is a standard chemotherapy drug for several types of cancer.&#xD;
      Additionally, some patients will also receive 10% maltose injection, a sugar that has been&#xD;
      shown to enhance the growth and effectiveness of APS001F in animals. This is the first study&#xD;
      where APS001F is being used in humans.&#xD;
