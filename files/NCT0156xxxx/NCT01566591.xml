      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of H1-Coil deep brain rTMS in&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a multi center, randomized, double blind study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      H1-Coil deep brain rTMS in subjects with bipolar depression, taking mood stabilizers and&#xD;
      previously unsuccessfully treated with antidepressant medications. The study is designed for&#xD;
      a period of 8 weeks of which up to 3 weeks subjects will be tapered down from their&#xD;
      medications and treated for 5 weeks. Two follow up visits will be performed at week 6 and 8&#xD;
      after the last TMS treatment. Mood and mental status will be closely monitored with standard&#xD;
      psychological scales and assessments&#xD;
