      The study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an intravenously administered&#xD;
      drug in recipients of kidneys from cardiac death donors who are risk for developing delayed&#xD;
      graft function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal transplantation is the most effective and cost-efficient form of renal replacement&#xD;
      therapy for a burgeoning population that presents with end-stage renal disease. Although&#xD;
      organ donation has become a national priority, the gap between the number of patients&#xD;
      awaiting a kidney versus the number of available kidneys continues to widen exponentially. In&#xD;
      many countries within the European Union, utilization of &quot;donation after cardiac death&quot; (DCD)&#xD;
      kidneys is steadily increasing, expanding the donor pool by &gt; 50%. Given the high incidence&#xD;
      of cardiac deaths in the US, aggressive pursuit of the DCD kidney pool could potentially&#xD;
      reduce waitlist periods to months, if not days. Risk for delayed graft function (DGF) with&#xD;
      the attendant risks for increased recipient morbidity, chronic allograft nephropathy and&#xD;
      increased medical costs has however tempered DCD kidney utilization in this country.&#xD;
      Development of strategies that limit normothermic reperfusion injury, promote renal repair,&#xD;
      reduce the incidence and/or duration of DGF and improve long-term outcome can greatly enhance&#xD;
      acceptance and recruitment of DCD kidneys. The study is designed to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of an intravenously administered drug in recipients of kidneys from DCD donors who&#xD;
      are risk for developing DGF. This trial is unique in that it compares drug versus placebo&#xD;
      outcome in kidney recipients from the same donor with direct evaluation of function&#xD;
      (creatinine clearance) in the graft.&#xD;
