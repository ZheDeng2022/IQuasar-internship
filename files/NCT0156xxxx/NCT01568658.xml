      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Some nerve and muscle disorders that start early in life (before age 25), like some forms&#xD;
      of muscular dystrophy, can run in families. However, the genetic causes of these disorders&#xD;
      are not known. Also, doctors do not fully understand how symptoms of these disorders change&#xD;
      over time. Researchers want to learn more about genetic nerve and muscle disorders that start&#xD;
      in childhood by studying affected people and their family members, as well as healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To better understand nerve and muscle disorders that start early in life and run in&#xD;
      families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 4 weeks old with childhood-onset muscular and nerve disorders,&#xD;
           including those who have a later onset of a disorder that typically has childhood onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Affected and unaffected family members of the individuals with muscular and nerve&#xD;
           disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers at least 4 weeks old with no nerve or muscle disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Genetic&#xD;
           information will be collected from blood, saliva, cheek swab, or skin samples. Urine&#xD;
           samples may also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers and unaffected family members will have imaging studies of the&#xD;
           muscles. These studies will include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound&#xD;
           scans. Results will be compared with those from the affected participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants with nerve and muscle disorders will have multiple tests, including the&#xD;
           following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging studies of the muscles, including ultrasound and MRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging studies of the bones, such as x-rays and DEXA scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart and lung function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nerve and muscle electrical activity tests and biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Video and photo image collection of affected muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Speech, language, and swallowing evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lumbar puncture to collect spinal fluid for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests of movement, attention, thinking, and coordination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with nerve and muscle disorders will return to the Clinical Center every&#xD;
           year. They will repeat the tests and studies at these visits.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To diagnose and elucidate the underlying disease mechanism in patients with neuromuscular and&#xD;
      neurogenetic disorders with congenital or pediatric onset (phase 1 of the protocol) and to&#xD;
      study the natural history and mechanism of disease in neuromuscular and neurogenetic&#xD;
      disorders of childhood (phase 2 of the protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with childhood onset neuromuscular and neurogenetic disorders, their affected and&#xD;
      unaffected family members, and healthy volunteers. Patients with later onset of a disorder&#xD;
      that is known to typically have childhood onset will be included as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic and prospective longitudinal natural history study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnose and characterize patients with neuromuscular and neurogenetic disorders with&#xD;
      congenital or pediatric onset and study the natural history and underlying disease mechanism.&#xD;
      In the characterized patient population identify and develop effective outcome measures for&#xD;
      use in future clinical trials, including applicable motor scales, quality of life scales,&#xD;
      biomarkers from blood and urine, imaging studies, and pulmonary function tests.&#xD;
