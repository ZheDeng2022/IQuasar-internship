      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Many people with sickle cell disease have repeated episodes of severe pain that lasts for&#xD;
      days, requiring hospital care. These episodes, called pain crises, may be caused by changes&#xD;
      in blood flow. Researchers want to study blood flow in people with sickle cell disease who&#xD;
      are having a pain crisis and compare it with their blood flow after the pain crisis has&#xD;
      resolved. They also want to compare these measurements against blood flow in healthy people&#xD;
      who do not have sickle cell disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study whether changes in blood flow cause pain crises in people with sickle cell&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have sickle cell disease and are being treated&#xD;
           for a pain crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have sickle cell disease and are not&#xD;
           experiencing a pain crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers matched by age and gender with the participants who have sickle cell&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants having a sickle cell pain crisis will have two visits, one during the&#xD;
           crisis and one about 4 weeks after the crisis has resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants not having a sickle cell pain crisis will have one or two study visits.&#xD;
           Blood samples will be collected during at least one of these visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers will have one or two study visits. Blood samples will be collected&#xD;
           during at least one of these visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During each visit for all participants, cameras and blood flow monitoring equipment will&#xD;
           be used to measure blood flow in the forearm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe recurrent pain is the most common cause of acute morbidity in sickle cell disease1.&#xD;
      The underlying pathogenesis was initially thought to be ischemia from obstruction of&#xD;
      capillary beds by stiffened red blood cells; however, there is evidence that other factors&#xD;
      contribute to the pathogenesis of sickle cell pain crisis, such as inflammation and&#xD;
      coagulation, ischemia-reperfusion injury, angiogenesis balance, and vasomotor tone processes&#xD;
      that are regulated by endothelial nitric oxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent clinical data suggest that subjects with sickle cell disease suffer from chronically&#xD;
      impaired nitric oxide bioavailability. This has been attributed to increased consumption of&#xD;
      nitric oxide by hemoglobin and reactive oxygen species, or decreased production of nitric&#xD;
      oxide by endothelial cells; however the roles of nitric oxide bioavailability and endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction during acute pain crisis are controversial and incompletely understood. Although&#xD;
      there have been several studies of endothelial function in steady state sickle cell disease,&#xD;
      there has been no comprehensive study of endothelial function during pain crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, our primary objective is to measure the reactive hyperemia index (a measure of&#xD;
      the endothelial response to shear stress) in twenty sickle cell subjects during acute pain&#xD;
      crisis and to compare it with the reactive hyperemia index measured after recovery from pain&#xD;
      crisis. This will identify whether there are acute changes in endothelial cell function&#xD;
      during sickle cell pain crisis. Our secondary objective is to compare the reactive hyperemia&#xD;
      index of thirty-five sickle cell subjects in steady state versus the reactive hyperemia index&#xD;
      of thirty-five healthy control subjects. This will identify whether there are chronic&#xD;
      differences in endothelial function between sickle cell subjects and healthy control&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will determine if there are defects in endothelium-dependent vasodilation in&#xD;
      response to shear stress during sickle cell pain crisis. Moreover, this study provides an&#xD;
      opportunity to evaluate new physiologic biomarkers of sickle cell pain crisis based on&#xD;
      measurements of blood flow, temperature, and oxygenation in the skin. These measurements may&#xD;
      serve as clinical endpoints in future studies of disease pathogenesis or therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions for sickle cell disease.&#xD;
