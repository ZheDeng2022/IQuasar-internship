      Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) and cardiac magnetic resonance (DCMR) are both&#xD;
      established non-invasive techniques, used in the clinical routine for the diagnostic&#xD;
      classification and risk stratification of patients with suspected or known coronary artery&#xD;
      disease (CAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard, regional wall motion abnormalities (WMA) during dobutamine stress, precede&#xD;
      the development of ST-segment depression and anginal symptoms, enabling the detection of&#xD;
      anatomically significant CAD and the assessment of clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a head-to-head comparison between the 2 techniques, favourable diagnostic characteristics&#xD;
      in terms of higher sensitivity and accuracy were noted for DCMR compared to DSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it has been reported that stress induced WMA both in DCMR and in DSE are independent&#xD;
      predictors for hard cardiac events such as cardiac death or myocardial infarction, the value&#xD;
      of the 2 techniques for the risk stratification of patients with CAD has not been compared to&#xD;
      each other so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of these 2 non-invasive techniques is important, because referring physicians need&#xD;
      to know which modality is more reliable for the identification of patients at higher risk for&#xD;
      subsequent cardiac events, who would benefit from early invasive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the investigators study the investigators therefore sought to compare the ability of DSE&#xD;
      versus DCMR to predict subsequent hard cardiac events and revascularization procedures in a&#xD;
      patient cohort with high CAD prevalence. Their predictive value was compared to that of&#xD;
      conventional atherogenic risk factors and to resting WMA. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      sought to determine if both techniques are equally suitable for structuring invasive or&#xD;
      conservative treatment according to the presence or absence of inducible ischemia,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;

      Background: Both DSE and DCMR are implemented in the daily diagnostic work-up of patients&#xD;
      with ischemic heart disease. Although DCMR was previously shown to aid the diagnostic&#xD;
      classification of patients with suspected CAD with higher sensitivity and accuracy compared&#xD;
      to that provided by DSE, the value of the 2 techniques for the risk stratification of&#xD;
      patients with CAD has not been investigated so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients with suspected or known CAD underwent either DSE or DCMR for clinical&#xD;
      reasons using the same standardised high-dose dobutamine/atropine protocol. Patient matching&#xD;
      was performed for age, gender and coronary risk factors. Wall motion was assessed at rest and&#xD;
      during maximum stress, and outcome data including cardiac death and non-fatal myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (defined as hard cardiac events) and 'late' revascularization performed &gt;90 days&#xD;
      after the MR-scans were prospectively collected at least 6 months after DSE or DCMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Data: Personnel unaware of the stress testing results contacts each subject or an&#xD;
      immediate family member and the date of this contact was used for calculating the follow-up&#xD;
      time duration. Outcome data is collected from a standardized questionnaire and determined&#xD;
      from patient interviews at the outpatient clinic or by telephone interviews. Reported&#xD;
      clinical events are confirmed by review of the corresponding medical records in our&#xD;
      electronic Hospital Information System (HIS), contact with the general practitioner,&#xD;
      referring cardiologist or the treating hospital. Cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial&#xD;
      infarction are registered as major cardiac events. Cardiac death is defined as death from any&#xD;
      cardiac cause (lethal arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, or congestive heart failure) or&#xD;
      sudden unexpected death occurring without another explanation. Myocardial infarction is&#xD;
      defined by angina of &gt;30 minutes duration and either ST segment elevation of ≥2mm in 2&#xD;
      consecutive ECG leads or a rise in troponin T of ≥0.03µg/l.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other events include clinically indicated coronary arterial revascularization by percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary angioplasty (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of 2 simultaneous cardiac events, the worst event was selected (cardiac&#xD;
      death&gt;non-fatal myocardial infarction&gt;revascularization).&#xD;
