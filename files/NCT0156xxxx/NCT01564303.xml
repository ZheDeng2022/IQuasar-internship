      CIAKI is a common iatrogenic. Up to date the suggested treatments for CIAKI are partially&#xD;
      effective and have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration yet. The lack of&#xD;
      effective nephroprotective drug for CIAKI, emphasizes the need not only for additional new&#xD;
      drugs but also for new strategies that might also clarify CIAKI pathophysiology. To the best&#xD;
      of our knowledge, the potentially beneficial effect of carnitine and PDE5 inhibitors on CIAKI&#xD;
      prevention has not been examined, so far.&#xD;

      Hypothesis 1: More studies are focusing now on strategies to preserve tissue mitochondria and&#xD;
      subsequently to maintain normal organ functioning [62]. One of these strategies is the use of&#xD;
      Carnitine. Carnitine was first described in the early beginnings of the 20th century. In&#xD;
      humans, 75% of carnitine is obtained from diet [63], whereas the rest is synthesized from two&#xD;
      essential amino acids, lysine and methionine in kidney, liver and brain [64]. Carnitine&#xD;
      transports long-chain acyl groups from fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix, so they can&#xD;
      be broken down through β-oxidation to acytl-coenzyme-A to obtain energy balance across cell&#xD;
      membranes of tissues that derive much of their energy from fatty acid oxidation such as&#xD;
      cardiac and skeletal muscles [66,67].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma concentration of free carnitine is in dynamic balance with acylcarnitines with the&#xD;
      acyl to free carnitine ratio of ≤ 0.4 being considered normal [65], however, in uremic&#xD;
      patients, this balance is disrupted, and this ratio is altered because of a larger amount of&#xD;
      free carnitine is esterified to acyl-carnitine to &quot;buffer&quot; the excess of acyl groups,&#xD;
      modulating the bound CoA to free CoA [68]. This may cause several metabolic disturbances at&#xD;
      the cellular level, including impaired mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and energy&#xD;
      production, accumulation of toxic acyl moieties, and inhibition of key enzymes of metabolic&#xD;
      pathway [69]. These metabolic abnormalities may lead to the several clinical alterations&#xD;
      often observed in these patients, such as muscle weakness and myopathy, loss of body protein&#xD;
      and cachexia, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, plasma lipid abnormalities, anemia&#xD;
      refractory to erythropoietin (EPO) treatment, cardiomyopathy, and intradialytic symptoms&#xD;
      [70,71,72]. Thus, the imbalanced in acyl/free carnitine ratio may explain the higher risk of&#xD;
      patients with chronic renal failure to CIAKI. However, Carnitine supplementation may&#xD;
      contribute to the regeneration of sequestrated free CoA and to maintain normal metabolic&#xD;
      processes [66,67].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental studies shows that L-propionylcarnitine, a propionyl ester of L-carnitine, was&#xD;
      able to prevent cyclosporine (immunosuppressive agent following organ transplantation)&#xD;
      induced acute nephrotoxicity, reducing lipid peroxidation and significantly lowering blood&#xD;
      pressure. L-propionylcarnitine prevented the decline in creatinine clearance in cyclosporine&#xD;
      chronically treated animals [73]. Patients treated with carnitine displayed improved physical&#xD;
      performance and treatment-related chronic fatigue, cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes,&#xD;
      and other chronic syndromes, caused by impaired carnitine production in kidney disease&#xD;
      [36-38]. In the last decade there are increasing reports describing the beneficial use of&#xD;
      carnitine for a better energy metabolism (mitochondrial metabolism). Carnitine increases&#xD;
      albumin and protein levels, restores antioxidant defenses, and improves nutritional status,&#xD;
      cardiac, vascular smooth muscle, and muscular function [39-42]. The postulated beneficial&#xD;
      effect of carnitine treatment is by directing lipids towards oxidation and ATP production.&#xD;
      Another possible protective effect of carnitine on contrast media induced lesions is its&#xD;
      ability to suppress the development of oxidative stress and free radical generation [74].&#xD;
      Free radicals, and in particular hydroxyl radical, lead to lipid peroxidation of cell&#xD;
      membranes, causing degradation of phospholipids, resulting in increased production of renal&#xD;
      vasoconstrictors [75].&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be emphasized that carnitine is available as a medication and is approved by the&#xD;
      FDA for treating secondary deficiency due to metabolic diseases. Intravenous administration&#xD;
      of carnitine is safe, and its pharmacokinetics can be analyzed just by knowing the pre-dose&#xD;
      level in plasma [76]. Further, after single-dose intravenous administration of (0.5 g) of&#xD;
      acetyl-L-carnitine, its rapidly, but not completely hydrolyzed, and acetyl-L-carnitine and&#xD;
      L-carnitine concentrations return to baseline within 12 hours. Even in high doses;&#xD;
      intravenous doses as high as 300 mg/kg have been administered with no apparent toxicity.&#xD;
      However, the most commonly reported adverse effects are few and nonserious including&#xD;
      gastritis, diarrhea, and body odor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The beneficial carnitine supplies have been extensively evaluated in animals and humans&#xD;
      during the last 20 years. As a result, several experts have already aimed to revise the&#xD;
      clinical evidence supporting its therapeutic use. In Addition to the light of the growing&#xD;
      experimental evidences for the beneficial effects of carnitine as an antioxidant and as a&#xD;
      beneficial modulator of mitochondrial energy expenditure, it is tempting to explore the&#xD;
      possibility that carnitine may exert nephroprotective effects in CIAKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Another new upraising strategy that has been used in attenuating renal injury&#xD;
      in experimental studies is the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor agents [77,&#xD;
      78]. PDE5 inhibitors are approved by the FDA for erectile dysfunction and pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension. The latter have been found to exert a significant antiapoptotic effect on renal&#xD;
      tubular cells exposed to partial unilateral ureteral obstruction [79]. Part of the&#xD;
      physiological process of PDE5 inhibition involves the release of nitric oxide (NO). Brando et&#xD;
      al. linked the increase in available pool of cyclic 3,5 guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) by&#xD;
      phosphodiesterases inhibitors to prevention and ameliorating chronic renal damage mainly by&#xD;
      attenuating hypertension and retarding progression of renal disease [80]. Furthermore a PDE 5&#xD;
      inhibitor has been demonstrated to be able to ameliorate nephrotoxicity. Noami H. et al. have&#xD;
      shown that FR226807, a selective PDE5 inhibitor, ameliorates cyclosporine A nephrotoxicity&#xD;
      with further increases in cGMP content [81]. These observations may be of relevance for&#xD;
      contrast media induced renal injury and suggest PDE5 inhibition as a potential therapeutic&#xD;
      approach to this clinical entity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In sum, CIAKI is a common iatrogenic. Up to date the suggested treatments for CIAKI are&#xD;
      partially effective and have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration yet. The&#xD;
      lack of effective nephroprotective drug for CIAKI, emphasizes the need not only for&#xD;
      additional new drugs but also for new strategies that might also clarify CIAKI&#xD;
      pathophysiology. To the best of our knowledge, the potentially beneficial effect of carnitine&#xD;
      and PDE5 inhibitors on CIAKI prevention has not been examined, so far.&#xD;
