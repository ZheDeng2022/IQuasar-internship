      Study Hypothesis: That the test product will reduce thigh cellulite more that the placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving subjects with distinctive&#xD;
      cellulite appearance on both thighs. Subjects will apply test cream to one thigh and placebo&#xD;
      to the other, by random allocation, and cellulite appearance will be measured at week 0, 8&#xD;
      and 16. Cellulite photographs will also be assessed by a (study blinded) trial researcher,&#xD;
      who will assess cellulite appearance on a precisely-measured upper leg area. The subjects'&#xD;
      own perception of cellulite appearance, from their diaries, will be numerically coded, and&#xD;
      all three measures will be collated and analysed statistically.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty subjects will be recruited through advertisements in local newspapers. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be asked to visit the lab, where they will sign an information/consent form and&#xD;
      answer a series of questions to determine their eligibility. If eligible, each subject will&#xD;
      be asked to have their upper leg cellulite photographed, and thigh circumference will be&#xD;
      measured. They will be given two containers of cream, labelled R (for right thigh) and L (for&#xD;
      left thigh) which have been pre-weighed in their containers, and they will be instructed on&#xD;
      how to apply the cream. They will record their perception of the amount of cellulite on a&#xD;
      weekly basis, and they will also record any adverse events. At the two and four-month&#xD;
      time-points, they will return to the lab with their diaries and cream. The cream in its&#xD;
      container will be weighed to ensure compliance, and the diaries will be examined and returned&#xD;
      to the participants. Thighs will again be photographed and circumference measured. At the&#xD;
      four-month visit, subjects will return any remaining product for weighing, as well as their&#xD;
      diaries for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photographs from each subject will be coded and cellulite marks assessed by arranging the&#xD;
      photographs chronologically, i.e. timepoint 1, timepoint 2 and timepoint 3. They will also be&#xD;
      assessed by a (blinded) trial researcher, who will assess cellulite appearance on a&#xD;
      precisely-measured upper leg area in the photographs. The subjects' own perception of&#xD;
      cellulite appearance, from their diaries, will be numerically coded, and all three measures&#xD;
      will be collated and analysed statistically.&#xD;
