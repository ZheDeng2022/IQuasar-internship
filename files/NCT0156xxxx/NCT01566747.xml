  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II open label, single arm study evaluating treatment with pazopanib post&#xD;
      sunitinib treatment in 43 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Patients will&#xD;
      receive 800mg pazopanib per day given continuously until disease progression. Patients must&#xD;
      have received treatment with sunitinib and relapsed. Patient must have received prior&#xD;
      treatment with sunitinib for at least 12 weeks. Prior treatment with either temsirolimus or&#xD;
      everolimus in addition to sunitinib is allowed. The trial design uses a Simons two stage&#xD;
      design with an interim analysis planned after the first 15 evaluable patients. If 8 or more&#xD;
      of the first 15 evaluable patients remains disease free at 4 months, then a further 28&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled for a total of 43 metastatic renal cell cancer patients. It is&#xD;
      estimated that there could be up to 10% of patients dropping out and so to achieve the&#xD;
      required number of 43 evaluable patients the study will recruit up to 48 patients to ensure&#xD;
      that 43 complete if stage 2 is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      withdrawal of patient consent. Response assessments will be carried out every 8 weeks until&#xD;
      disease progression. Safety assessments will be carried out every 4 weeks (plus a visit for&#xD;
      liver function tests after 2 weeks) for the first six months and then every eight weeks until&#xD;
      disease progression. A further safety assessment will be carried out 4 weeks after treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects must provide written informed consent prior to performance of study-specific&#xD;
             procedures or assessments, and must be willing to comply with treatment and follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Procedures conducted as part of the subject's routine clinical management (e.g., blood&#xD;
             count, imaging study) and obtained prior to signing of informed consent may be&#xD;
             utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided these procedures are conducted as&#xD;
             specified in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: It is not necessary that informed consent be obtained within the&#xD;
             protocol-specified screening window.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnosis of metastatic/unresectable renal cell carcinoma of the clear cell type or&#xD;
             with a component of clear cell histology&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Eligible patients must have been treated with sunitinib for a minimum of 12 weeks (2&#xD;
             cycles). Patients must have evidence of progressive disease following treatment with&#xD;
             sunitinib as assessed by the site investigator on the basis of CT scans and other&#xD;
             appropriate clinical documentation. Patients who received sunitinib for 12 weeks&#xD;
             (2cycles) but stopped the drug due to toxicity rather than disease progression are&#xD;
             also eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             The Investigator should be aware of the patient's intolerance/toxicity with prior&#xD;
             sunitinib treatment and take this in to account when assessing eligibility for the&#xD;
             pazopanib study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients who have had prior treatment with either temsirolimus or everolimus are also&#xD;
             eligible for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
             No other prior treatment with bevacizumab, sorafenib, immunotherapies, chemotherapy,&#xD;
             biologic therapy or investigational therapy is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Previous radiotherapy (RT) is permissible provided the measurable disease is outside&#xD;
