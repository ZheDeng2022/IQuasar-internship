  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with malignant mesothelioma of the lung lining (called pleura) who&#xD;
      are planning to have pemetrexed-cisplatin chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are investigating whether giving a vaccine called TroVax® with pemetrexed-cisplatin&#xD;
      chemotherapy is both safe and potentially beneficial in patients with mesothelioma. This&#xD;
      vaccine has been used in combination with chemotherapy in other types of cancer and has been&#xD;
      shown to be safe. Cancer vaccines work by stimulating the person's immune system to fight the&#xD;
      disease, in a similar way to the immune system fighting infection. In laboratory experiments,&#xD;
      the vaccine has been shown to stimulate an immune response to a particular protein widely&#xD;
      found on mesothelioma cells called 5T4. In patients with mesothelioma it is hoped that the&#xD;
      vaccine will stimulate the immune system to attack mesothelioma cells carrying the 5T4&#xD;
      protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pemetrexed-cisplatin chemotherapy is currently seen as the best treatment for patients with&#xD;
      mesothelioma, and this is why we plan to combine it with the vaccine. It is hoped that the&#xD;
      combination of the TroVax® vaccine and chemotherapy is more beneficial than chemotherapy&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pemetrexed-cisplatin will be given into a vein in the arm (intravenously) every 3 weeks. The&#xD;
      TroVax® vaccine will be given as an injection into the shoulder muscle (intramuscularly) 3&#xD;
      weeks before chemotherapy starts, one week before chemotherapy starts, then every 3 weeks.&#xD;
      Each participant will receive 4 chemotherapy and 9 vaccine treatments if they complete the&#xD;
      planned trial schedule. We aim to recruit 26 patients into the trial over a two year period.&#xD;
      If this study shows that pemetrexed-cisplatin chemotherapy plus the TroVax® vaccine is safe&#xD;
      and beneficial in terms of stimulating the immune system, the combination will be tested&#xD;
      further in larger clinical trials.&#xD;
