        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Willing and able to give written, signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male and female subjects 18 to 50 years of age (inclusive)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Body mass index 19 to 30 kg/m2 (inclusive), and weigh at least 55 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. No clinically important abnormal physical findings at the screening or Period 1, Day&#xD;
             -1 examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Normal blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). These will be measured after resting&#xD;
             seated or supine for approximately 5 minutes. Normal BP is defined as 90 to 140 mm Hg&#xD;
             systolic and 50 to 85 mm Hg diastolic. Normal HR is defined as 45 to 90 beats per&#xD;
             minute&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Negative for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody within the last 3 months (documentation must be&#xD;
             provided for confirmation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. No clinically relevant abnormalities in the results of Screening or Period 1, Day -1&#xD;
             laboratory evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Ability to communicate effectively with the Investigator and to comply with all study&#xD;
             requirements, restrictions, and direction of the clinic staff&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. For women of childbearing potential, documentation of a negative serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             at Screening and a negative urine pregnancy test on Period 1, Day -1. Female subjects&#xD;
             should not be breast feeding. All female subjects of childbearing potential must be&#xD;
             using a highly effective method of birth control during the study and for at least 1&#xD;
             month after completion of study drug dosing. A highly effective method of birth&#xD;
             control is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (i.e., &lt;1% per year) when&#xD;
             used consistently and correctly, such as condom + diaphragm, condom + spermicide,&#xD;
             diaphragm + spermicide, or IUD with documented failure rate of &lt;1% per year, or&#xD;
             oral/injectable/implanted hormonal contraceptives used in combination with an&#xD;
             additional double barrier method, or sexual abstinence. Women are considered to be not&#xD;
             of childbearing potential if they have had a total hysterectomy or bilateral tubal&#xD;
             ligation or are at least 2 years postmenopausal&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. All male subjects must agree to use a highly effective method of birth control with&#xD;
             partners of childbearing potential during the study and for 1 month after study dosing&#xD;
&#xD;

             asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of dosing), hematological, endocrine,&#xD;
             pulmonary, GI, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, or neurological disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (e.g., previous surgery on the GI&#xD;
             tract [including removal of parts of the stomach, bowel, liver, gall bladder, or&#xD;
             pancreas])&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any other condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would confound or&#xD;
             interfere with study participation; evaluation of safety, tolerability, or PK of the&#xD;
             investigational drug; or prevent compliance with the study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have participated in another clinical trial of an investigational drug (or medical&#xD;
             device) within 30 days (or 5 half lives of the investigational drug if longer than 30&#xD;

             investigational drug (or medical device), or intending to participate in another trial&#xD;
             of an investigational drug (or medical device) before completion of all scheduled&#xD;
             safety evaluations in this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Unwilling to abstain from ingestion of caffeine or xanthine containing products (e.g.,&#xD;
