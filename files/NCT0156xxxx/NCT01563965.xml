  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prolonged pre-operative fasting increases postoperative hospital stay and current evidence&#xD;
      recommends carbohydrate (CHO) drinks 2 hours before surgery. Our hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      addition of hydrolized protein to a CHO-based drink not only reduces the inflammatory&#xD;
      response but also diminish hospitalization.&#xD;

      This was a randomized, double-blind, clinical study carried out at the Julio Muller&#xD;
      University Hospital (Mato Grosso State, Brazil). The study was approved by the hospital&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee registered under number 723/CEP-HUJM/09 and is in accordance with&#xD;
      the ethics principals set out in the Helsinki Declaration (2000), and meets Brazilian&#xD;
      national legal specifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria includes adults (18-65 years-old), of both sexes, and candidates to&#xD;
      elective major operations such as subtotal gastrectomy, colectomy, and anterior resection of&#xD;
      the rectum for malignancies. Exclusion criteria were having diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney&#xD;
      failure, chronic liver disease or serum bilirubin greater than 2 mg/dL, body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
      above 35Kg/m2, American Anesthesiologists Association (ASA) score above 3, gastro-esophageal&#xD;
      reflux, gastroparesis or intestinal obstruction. Patients with any non-compliance with the&#xD;
      study protocol, or who had associated operations, or presented severe intraoperative&#xD;
      complications (any type of shock, cardiac arrest, coagulations problems), or experienced&#xD;
      prolonged operations (lasting more than 6 hours) were also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient randomization was carried out on admission to the hospital using random numbers&#xD;
      issued by a computer program (www.graphpad.com). For the randomization the precepts of the&#xD;
      CONSORT flow diagram were followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were randomized into two groups: the study group and the control group. The&#xD;
      patients were given a specific drink to their group on the evening prior to surgery and three&#xD;
      hours before the operation. The study group received 400 ml (evening drink) or 200 ml (3h&#xD;
      prior to operation drink) of a solution containing 11% de protein (pea hydrolized proptein),&#xD;
      89% de carbohydrates (maltodextrin 79% and saccharose 21%) e 0% of lipids (Providextra,&#xD;
      Fresenius Kabi, São Paulo, Brasil) and the control group received conventional 6-8h fast. All&#xD;
      the patients fasted for solids at least 6 hours from the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day before the surgery and on the second postoperative day blood samples were&#xD;
      collected for glucose, insulin, triglycerides, albumin, pre-albumin, CRP, and α-1-acid&#xD;
      glycoprotein (α-1-GA) assays. The HOMA-IR (Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance)&#xD;
      equation was used to assess insulin resistance according to the formula: HOMA-IR = insulin&#xD;
      (µU/mL) x glycaemia (mg/dL) / 405. To assess inflammatory activity the PINI (CRP (mg/L) x&#xD;
      α-1-GA (mg/L)/ albumin (g/L) x pre-albumin (mg/L) and the CRP/albumin ratio were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean outcome variable was the length of postoperative stay. Other endpoints included the&#xD;
      infectious morbidity, the insulin resistance assessed by HOMA-IR, and the inflammatory&#xD;
      indexes or markers mentioned above.&#xD;
