    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well vorinostat works in treating patients with melanoma of&#xD;
      the eye that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic). Vorinostat may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall objective response rate (RR) to vorinostat in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic uveal melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Overall survival (OS). II. Progression free survival (PFS). III. To determine the&#xD;
      tolerability of vorinostat in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To correlate clinical outcome with changes in histone acetylation status by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To correlate clinical outcome with changes in known proliferation and apoptotic markers&#xD;
      including Ki67 by immunohistochemistry and BIM, survivin, c-myc, Mcl-1, cleaved PARP,&#xD;
      gamma-H2AX and RAD51 by western blot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess for changes in pathways such as the MAPK pathway with treatment. IV. To&#xD;
      describe the evolution of circulating cell-free, tumor-derived deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)&#xD;
      levels measured by pyrophosphorolysis activated polymerization (PAP) in plasma of patients&#xD;
      under treatment for metastatic uveal melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To correlate overall objective RR with GNAQ, GNA11, SF3B1 and BAP1 mutational status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 3 days weekly for 4 weeks.&#xD;
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have metastatic histologically or cytologically confirmed uveal&#xD;
             melanoma. (If histologic or cytologic confirmation of the primary is not available,&#xD;
             confirmation of the primary diagnosis of uveal melanoma by the treating investigator&#xD;
             can be clinically obtained, as per standard practice for uveal melanoma). Pathologic&#xD;
             confirmation of diagnosis will be performed at Columbia University, Memorial&#xD;
             Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) or Vanderbilt University Medical Center&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
             Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;= 18 years. Because limited dosing or adverse event data are currently available&#xD;
             on the use of vorinostat in patients &lt; 18 years of age, children are excluded from&#xD;
             this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric single-agent trials, if&#xD;
             applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 9.0 g/dL not requiring transfusions within the past 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN); =&lt; 3 x&#xD;
             institutional ULN if the patient has Gilbert's syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase&#xD;
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT])&#xD;
             =&lt; 2.5 x institutional ULN if no liver metastasis present; =&lt; 5 x institutional ULN if&#xD;
             liver metastases are present&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vorinostat is toxic to the developing human fetus. For this reason and because Class D&#xD;
             agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must&#xD;
             agree to use effective contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men&#xD;
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after&#xD;
             completion of vorinostat administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have had any number of prior therapies. At least 3 weeks must have&#xD;
             elapsed since the last dose of systemic therapy. At least 6 weeks must have elapsed if&#xD;
             the last regimen included BCNU or mitomycin C. At least 6 weeks must have elapsed if&#xD;
             the last regimen included an anti-CTLA4 antibody. Patients must have experienced&#xD;
             disease progression on their prior therapy in the opinion of the treating investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active or untreated brain metastases. Treated brain metastases must have&#xD;
             been stable for at least 2 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to vorinostat&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving HDAC inhibitors or compounds with HDAC inhibitor like activity,&#xD;
             such as valproic acid, are ineligible. Patients who have received such agents may&#xD;
             enroll on this study after a 14-day washout period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on warfarin will be excluded from the trial if they cannot be switched to an&#xD;
             acceptable alternative medication (i.e. low molecular weight heparin [LMWH]).&#xD;
             Prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) were&#xD;
             observed in patients receiving vorinostat concomitantly with coumarin-derivative&#xD;
             anticoagulants&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because vorinostat is a Class D agent with&#xD;
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with vorinostat, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with vorinostat&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy will be eligible unless the CD4 count is &lt; 200 cells/mm^3 within one month of&#xD;
             study enrollment (as requested by Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program [CTEP]). These&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A second malignancy requiring active therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No concomitant anti-cancer chemotherapy or other systemic drugs. Palliative radiation&#xD;
             therapy will be allowed as long as the patient meets all other eligibility criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g., inflammatory&#xD;
             bowel disease), or significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 475 milliseconds&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who cannot swallow capsules&#xD;
