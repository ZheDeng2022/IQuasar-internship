  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is based upon the following points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Resistance to trastuzumab, either primary or secondary, is a clinically relevant issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PI3K/AKT activation, due to loss of expression/function of PTEN and/or activating&#xD;
           mutations of PIK3CA, is a mechanism of resistance with clinical relevance in breast&#xD;
           cancer. Such activation can be detected by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  IHC evaluation of PTEN protein expression&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  genotyping of PIK3CA exon 9 and 20&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  IHC evaluation of phospho-AKT expression&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. BKM120 is an effective PI3K inhibitor. BKM120 and anti-HER2 therapy may have a&#xD;
           synergistic antitumor activity in preclinical model of HER2+ breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Lapatinib is an effective anti-HER2 therapy in trastuzumab-resistant disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. For the evaluation of novel targeted therapies, selecting a patient population enriched&#xD;
           for activation of the target to be modulated should allow to maximize the differences in&#xD;
           clinical outcome that are expected in the experimental arm, and thus to minimize the&#xD;
           patient number to include.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. We propose to test in a phase I/II study the combination of lapatinib and BKM120 in&#xD;
           trastuzumab-resistant HER2+ MBC patients, enriched for activation of PI3K/AKT as&#xD;
           detected by loss of expression of PTEN (IHC), and/or mutation of PIK3CA and/or&#xD;
           overexpression of phospho-AKT (IHC). Only for phase II patients, mutational status will&#xD;
           be an inclusion criteria. For phase I patients molecular status will be a retrospective&#xD;
           exploratory analysis.&#xD;
