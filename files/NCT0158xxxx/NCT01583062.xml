  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Facial fractures make up a significant proportion of injuries in trauma patients. Treatment&#xD;
      of these fractures often results in standard surgical interventions. While up to the early&#xD;
      1980's perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in maxillofacial surgery was controversial, its&#xD;
      efficacy is well accepted today. Chole and his team could show that the administration of&#xD;
      antibiotics one hour preoperatively and eight hours after the intervention reduces the&#xD;
      incidence of infectious complications in facial fractures from 42,2% to 8.9%. However there&#xD;
      is still no consensus about the duration of the postoperative administration. In literature&#xD;
      postoperative prophylaxis in facial fractures varies from single-shot 6-7 up to a duration of&#xD;
      7 and even ten days postoperatively 8-10. The use of antibiotics can be associated with&#xD;
      allergic or toxic reactions, adverse effects, drug interactions and increasing bacterial&#xD;
      resistance. In addition some authors assume that a prolonged administration of antibiotics&#xD;
      might increase the risk of infectious complications via superinfection. On the other hand a&#xD;
      short term or single shot administration might not be enough to prevent the onset of an&#xD;
      postoperative infection. Up to date there is no standard to support the administration of&#xD;
      antibiotics after surgical repair of a facial fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this prospective, randomized double-blinded trial is to investigate the&#xD;
      utility of antibiotics administered in the postoperative period after surgical revision of&#xD;
      facial fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: a short-term antibiotic prophylaxis of 1 day postoperatively is equally effective&#xD;
      as a long-term administration of 5 days in facial fractures.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      While up to the early 1980's perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in maxillofacial surgery&#xD;
      was controversial its efficacy is well accepted today. Chole et al. showed that the&#xD;
      administration of antibiotics reduces the incidence of infectious complications in facial&#xD;
      fractures from 42,2% to 8.9%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However there is still no consensus about the duration of the postoperative administration.&#xD;
      In literature postoperative prophylaxis varies from single-shot up to 7 and even ten days&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotic use is costly and associated with allergic reactions, toxic reactions, adverse&#xD;
      effects, drug interactions and increasing bacterial resistance. Additionally some authors&#xD;
      assume that a prolonged administration of antibiotics might even increase the risk of&#xD;
      infectious complications via superinfection. On the other hand one might risk an increase of&#xD;
      postoperative infections with a short term or single shot administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a medline search only few studies could be found which deal with antimicrobial prophylaxis&#xD;
      in maxillofacial surgery and in facial trauma surgery in particular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Articles which advocate a single shot administration contain a very inhomogeneous group of&#xD;
      patients. Merten et al. compared a single shot with a 48h regimen. The study included cleft&#xD;
      patients, tumor resections, dental surgery, sinus revisions, plastic surgery and trauma. He&#xD;
      concluded that a one shot administration of 1500mg cefuroxime is equally effective as a 48h&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second study which investigated the efficacy of single-dose antibiotic prophylaxis&#xD;
      included preprosthetic, plastic, orthognathic, tumor and trauma surgery. Here also single&#xD;
      shot administration was found to be sufficient in preventing postoperative infection. Studies&#xD;
      about antibiotic single shot administration which included trauma patients only do not exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies compared a 12 or 24 hour with a 5 day postoperative regime: Johnson et al.&#xD;
      conducted a study with one hundred nine patients requiring pedicled flap reconstruction in&#xD;
      the region of the head and neck. He investigated if 5 days of antibiotic administration would&#xD;
      be more effective than 1 day and concluded that no beneficial effect from administration of&#xD;
      antibiotics for longer than 24 hours postoperatively can be achieved in patients who undergo&#xD;
      myocutaneous flap reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bentley et al. studied the effect on infection rates of 1-day and 5-day administration of&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotics in orthognathic surgical procedures. He concluded that antibiotic&#xD;
      prophylaxis for orthognathic surgical procedures should continue beyond the immediate&#xD;
      postoperative period for 5 days since the infection rate was significantly higher in the one&#xD;
      day regimen (60% vs. 6.7%). It must be stated that in this study very strict criteria for&#xD;
      wound infection (such as spontaneous wound dehiscence in the absence of pus drainage) were&#xD;
      applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abubaker et al. evaluated the difference between the effect of a 5-day postoperative course&#xD;
      and a 12 hour administration of antibiotics in 30 Patients on the incidence of postoperative&#xD;
      infection in uncomplicated fractures of the mandible. He concluded that a prolonged&#xD;
      administration of antibiotics has no benefit in reducing the incidence of infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other surgical fields guidelines concerning the perioperative antibiotic use have been&#xD;
      established. The East practice management guidelines for example recommend to limit the&#xD;
      postoperative administration in open fractures to 48 hours after wound closure. Unfortunately&#xD;
      these guidelines can not be uncritically applied to maxillofacial trauma patients out of&#xD;
      several reasons. Not only the fracture patterns are basically different from those in&#xD;
      orthopedics but also the surgical treatment differs in many aspects: the impossibility of&#xD;
      complete wound disinfection, the continuing contamination by saliva even after primary&#xD;
      closure, the lack of casts or sterile wound dressings, the impossibility of extensive wound&#xD;
      debridement or open wound treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmaceutical study substance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-amoxiclav is an antibacterial combination consisting of the semisynthetic antibiotic&#xD;
      amoxicillin and the ß-lactamase inhibitor, clavulanate potassium. It was introduced as&#xD;
      &quot;Augmentin®&quot; in 1984 by Glaxosmithkline and Smithkline Beecham (collectively &quot;GSK&quot;). Since&#xD;
      the patent expired in december 2002 several generic versions were approved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is used in the treatment of lower respiratory, middle ear, sinus, skin and urinary tract&#xD;
      infections. In ENT and maxillofacial surgery it is used for prophylaxis and therapy for&#xD;
      several indications. In the investigators' department the present prophylaxis regimen for&#xD;
      facial fractures varies from 5 to 8 days postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this study is to evaluate the difference between the effect of a five- vs. a one-day&#xD;
      postoperative course of antibiotics on the incidence of postoperative infections in facial&#xD;
      fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a facial fractures, which need surgical revision, are randomly assigned into&#xD;
      two groups. Both groups receive amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 1.2 g intravenously every eight&#xD;
      hours from admission up to 24 hours postoperatively. Group A then receives&#xD;
      amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 625 mg orally every eight hours for four days. Group B receives&#xD;
      oral placebo using the same schedule for the same duration as group A. Follow up appointments&#xD;
      are 1, 2, 4, 6 and 12 weeks and 6 months after surgery. The developement of a surgical site&#xD;
      infection (according to CDC) is defined as primary end point.&#xD;
