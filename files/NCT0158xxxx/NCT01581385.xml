  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot clinical trial to assess the ability of a new ultrasound-based imaging&#xD;
      method, Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) ultrasound, to describe the composition and&#xD;
      structure of atherosclerotic plaques. The hypothesis being tested is that in vivo,&#xD;
      transcutaneous ARFI ultrasound delineates plaque composition and structure in human carotid&#xD;
      arteries.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) ultrasound&#xD;
      imaging for describing the composition and structure of atherosclerotic plaques. The surgical&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaques of 16 patient volunteers undergoing clinically indicated carotid&#xD;
      endarterectomy (surgical removal of plaque from the carotid artery) will be imaged&#xD;
      preoperatively by ARFI. ARFI imaging will occur during the volunteers' preoperative workup&#xD;
      visits (inpatient or outpatient), in the surgical holding area (inpatient or outpatient), or&#xD;
      at the patient bedside (inpatient). Then, the routinely excised plaque specimens will be sent&#xD;
      for histopathological processing to determine plaque composition and structure. The&#xD;
      histopathological data will be used to validate ARFI imaging performance for plaque material&#xD;
      and structural characterization. This will end the participant's involvement in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two experimental components to this study beyond what is standard practice for&#xD;
      carotid endarterectomy patients: 1) preoperative ARFI ultrasound imaging of ipsilateral&#xD;
      (surgical) carotid arteries, and 2) submission of sections of the carotid plaque excised&#xD;
      intraoperatively to the UNC Hospitals clinical laboratories for immunohistochemical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will commence with ARFI ultrasound imaging at the time of the patient volunteer's&#xD;
      preoperative workup for carotid endarterectomy surgery (outpatients and inpatients), while&#xD;
      the patient is in the holding area for surgery (outpatients and inpatients), or at the&#xD;
      patient bedside (inpatients). If the patient volunteer is an outpatient, ARFI ultrasound&#xD;
      imaging will be performed up to two weeks prior to surgery. Preoperative ARFI ultrasound&#xD;
      imaging will be performed in addition to the patient volunteer's routine preoperative duplex&#xD;
      ultrasound and any other exams used to determine if carotid endarterectomy is clinically&#xD;
      indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARFI ultrasound is a noninvasive diagnostic imaging technology performed using commercially&#xD;
      available clinical ultrasound imaging equipment - the Siemens SONOLINE or Acuson Antares&#xD;
      imaging systems equipped for research purposes and VF10-5 or VF7-3 linear array transducers&#xD;
      (Siemens Medical Solutions, USA Inc. Ultrasound Division). ARFI imaging will be carried out&#xD;
      by a professional sonographer trained in peripheral vascular ultrasound and faculty (Caterina&#xD;
      Gallippi, Ph.D., Associate Professor, study PI) and/or graduate student research assistants&#xD;
      in the UNC-CH Joint Department of Biomedical Engineering. The sonographer will acquire ARFI&#xD;
      ultrasound data with matched B-Mode (for anatomical reference) in ipsilateral (surgical)&#xD;
      carotid arteries of patient volunteers. Patient volunteers will be asked to lie on an&#xD;
      examination table (outpatients) or to remain in their hospital beds (inpatients). The head of&#xD;
      the exam table/bed may be raised to an approximate 45 degree angle to best visualize the&#xD;
      carotid arteries with ultrasound imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the patient volunteer is positioned, ultrasound gel will be applied to the patient&#xD;
      volunteer's neck. The ultrasound imaging transducer will then be placed on top of the gel.&#xD;
      Once the carotid artery is located, ARFI ultrasound imaging will begin. In the ipsilateral&#xD;
      (surgical) carotid artery, the imaging field of view will be centered on the carotid plaque,&#xD;
      with axial focal depth directed to the position of the near or far wall containing the&#xD;
      thickest portion of the plaque. Data acquisitions will be gated to diastole. Two repeated&#xD;
      acquisitions will be acquired for each of four ARFI imaging sequences. The position of&#xD;
      landmarks such as arterial branch points and morphological features such as arterial wall&#xD;
      thickness will be recorded for spatial registration to duplex ultrasound and histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The length of time for ARFI data collection in the carotid artery is estimated to be less&#xD;
      than 30 minutes. Once the ipsilateral (surgical) carotid artery is imaged, the study&#xD;
      procedure will be completed for the first portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the second part of the study, sections of the carotid plaque specimen routinely extracted&#xD;
      during carotid endarterectomy surgery will be photographed and then fixed and paraffin&#xD;
      embedded in the UNC Tissue Procurement core facility. The specimens will then undergo&#xD;
      sectioning and staining in the UNC Histopathology core facility. These experimental sections&#xD;
      will be in addition to the sections routinely sent for immunohistochemical processing after&#xD;
      carotid endarterectomy. Sectioning will be directed by the surgeon per standard&#xD;
      histopathology protocol and per laboratory sampling protocol. The sections will be stained&#xD;
      with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) for baseline, Verhoeff van Giesen (VVG) for elastin, Sirius&#xD;
      Red (SR) with polarized light microscopy for collagen sub-types I and III, von Kossa (VK) for&#xD;
      calcium, and/or Lillie modification of Masson's trichrome (MT) for fibrin, or other&#xD;
      comparable stains. This will conclude part two of the study. However, excised plaque&#xD;
      specimens will be stored in Dr. Gallippi's (PI) laboratory for a period of up to five years&#xD;
      following study completion. Their storage will enable re-sectioning as need to achieve proper&#xD;
      spatial alignment with ARFI imaging. The stored specimens will not be used for future&#xD;
      research; they are for verification purposes only. The specimens will be submerged in&#xD;
      formalin and stored in sealed plastic containers. No identifiable information will be&#xD;
      recorded with the samples, and all HIPAA guidelines and procedures will be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient volunteers' participation will end once both study parts one (ARFI ultrasound&#xD;
      imaging) and two (immunohistochemical processing of excised plaque specimens) are completed.&#xD;
      Therefore, there will be no follow-up visits required or additional demands placed on the&#xD;
      patient volunteers. A Patient volunteer is asked to consent to (1) ARFI ultrasound imaging of&#xD;
      his/her ipsilateral (surgical) carotid arteries before his/her clinically indicated&#xD;
      endarterectomy surgery, and (2) sections of his/her routinely excised plaques specimens&#xD;
      undergoing immunohistochemical processing (in addition to any sections routinely sent for&#xD;
      immunohistochemical processing after carotid endarterectomy). No additional procedures or&#xD;
      requirements are proposed. Every other aspect of the volunteers' preoperative workup for&#xD;
      surgery and the endarterectomy surgery itself will be carried out in the normal standard of&#xD;
      care as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no control group in this study. This is a pilot study to determine if ARFI&#xD;
      ultrasound imaging in this patient population may be relevant to delineating the composition&#xD;
      and structure of carotid plaques with immunohistochemical validation.&#xD;
