      Despite advances in the treatment of heart attacks the complications and death rates from&#xD;
      failure of the heart to pump properly after treatment remain high. A heart attack occurs when&#xD;
      one or more of the arteries that supply blood to the heart become blocked, causing the heart&#xD;
      to be starved of oxygen and nutrients. This results in damage to the heart and so the the&#xD;
      heart pumps less well. The main treatment for a heart attack is balloon treatment to open the&#xD;
      blocked artery (called primary angioplasty). Whilst re-opening the artery is essential and&#xD;
      allows blood to flow to the area of the heart starved of oxygen, this process also causes&#xD;
      damage itself (called reperfusion injury) and increases the size of the heart attack further.&#xD;
      Currently there are no treatments available that reduce this reperfusion injury. The&#xD;
      investigators and others have shown that a substance called sodium nitrite reduces&#xD;
      reperfusion injury in experimental models of a heart attack. The aim of this research is to&#xD;
      perform a trial to investigate whether during a heart attack, an infusion of sodium nitrite&#xD;
      into the damaged artery protects against reperfusion injury and reduces heart attack size in&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease is still the commonest cause of death in the UK (in the main as a&#xD;
      consequence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI)). Presently, timely and effective&#xD;
      reperfusion with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) remains the most effective&#xD;
      treatment strategy for limiting infarct size, preserving left ventricular ejection fraction&#xD;
      (LVEF), and improving the clinical outcomes in such patients. However, substantial mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity rates still persist with respect to longer term outcome. One of the main&#xD;
      determinants of prognosis after AMI is the size of the infarct. Thus, identification of&#xD;
      additional strategies that might decrease infarct size is desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence from pre-clinical studies suggests that inorganic nitrite administration reduces&#xD;
      infarct size in animal models of AMI. In this study we aim to translate these findings into&#xD;
      man. We will test the hypothesis that in patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI, an&#xD;
      intra-coronary injection of nitrite, initiated prior to establishment of full reperfusion&#xD;
      reduces infarct size through prevention of ischemia-reperfusion injury.&#xD;
