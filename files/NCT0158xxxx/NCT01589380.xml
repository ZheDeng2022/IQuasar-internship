      We hypothesized that fimasartan, a new generation ARBs, would improve exercise capacity and&#xD;
      decrease the rate of progression of AS by modifying hemodynamic factors and reducing adverse&#xD;
      LV remodeling favorably in patients with asymptomatic moderate to severe AS.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis (AS) is common valvular disorder, affecting 2% to 4% of adults older than 65&#xD;
      years. It is gradually but constantly progressive disease whit a long asymptomatic phase, but&#xD;
      once symptoms develop, the prognosis is poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, treatment strategy is focused mainly to watchful monitoring and judicious timing&#xD;
      of aortic valve replacement (AVR). However, not all patients are proper candidate of&#xD;
      corrective surgery and the needs of development of medical treatment are increasing. Various&#xD;
      mechanisms have been suggested in progression of AS and recent observational studies&#xD;
      suggested not only mechanical stress of &quot;wear and tear&quot; but also active inflammatory process&#xD;
      likewise atherosclerosis may contribute the progression of AS. Through clinical descriptive&#xD;
      studies, atherosclerotic risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia,&#xD;
      obesity, smoking, and metabolic syndrome have been known to facilitate the progression of AS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is activated at an early stage of AS, promoting&#xD;
      developemtnt of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), myocardial fibrosis, and diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction. Lipid lowering therapy and RAS blockade have emerged potential medical treatment&#xD;
      to slow the progression of AS, however, many clinical trials did not show consistent&#xD;
      beneficial effect of statins.8-10 RAS blockers are perceived as being relative&#xD;
      contraindication due to concerns about increasing pressure gradient. However, patients with&#xD;
      AS tolerate RAS blocker well on initiation and the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)&#xD;
      inhibitors appears to confer long term survival benefit on patients considered to have a&#xD;
      contraindication including AS.Pressure overload of LV, activation of RAS, and subsequent&#xD;
      adverse LV remodeling, myocardial fibrosis, and LV dysfunction may potential therapeutic&#xD;
      target to retard the progression of AS and to improve exercise capacity, and even long-term&#xD;
      outcomes. RAS blocker including ACEI or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been known&#xD;
      to improve exercise capacity and long term outcome in patient with hypertension, congestive&#xD;
      heart failure, or myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that fimasartan, a new generation ARBs, would improve exercise capacity and&#xD;
      decrease the rate of progression of AS by modifying hemodynamic factors and reducing adverse&#xD;
      LV remodeling favorably in patients with asymptomatic moderate to severe AS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial with enrollment of normotensive or&#xD;
      hypertensive patients of age 20 to 75 who require echocardiography for a clinical indication,&#xD;
      which typically consists of known aortic stenosis or presence of cardiac murmur. Moderate to&#xD;
      severe aortic stenosis will be defined as a continuous wave Doppler determined peak aortic&#xD;
      valve jet velocity of 3.0 - 4.5 m/s or mean pressure gradient of 25 - 49 mmHg, or aortic&#xD;
      valve area of 0.76 - 1.5 cm2. Patients meeting inclusion criteria without any exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be randomized 1:1 to angiotensin receptor blocker, Fimasartan, or placebo.&#xD;
      After 1-year enrollment period, all patients will be followed for 1 year. Cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      exercise test will be performed at baseline enrollment period, and at the end of follow-up.&#xD;
      Echocardiographic evaluation will be performed at regular interval of baseline and 6 months&#xD;
      interval until the end of study.&#xD;
