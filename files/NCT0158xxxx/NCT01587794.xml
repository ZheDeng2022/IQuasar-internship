      Experimental retinal detachment and reattachment models have demonstrated the recovery&#xD;
      process of successfully reattached retina. However, optical coherence tomography analysis of&#xD;
      each retinal layers following retinal reattachment has not been investigated This study&#xD;
      investigated changes in thickness profiles of retinal layers after resolution of recent-onset&#xD;
      rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) using optical coherence tomography images.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is a sight-threatening condition that occurs when the&#xD;
      neurosensory retina separates from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium and fluid&#xD;
      accumulates within this potential space.Surgical reattachment of a detached retina is the&#xD;
      mainstay of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental retinal detachment and reattachment models have demonstrated the recovery&#xD;
      process of successfully reattached retina, including regrowth and reconfiguration of the&#xD;
      photoreceptor inner and/or outer segments,reorganization of photoreceptor-RPE&#xD;
      interface,increased synaptic terminals in the outer plexiform layer, inhibition of glial cell&#xD;
      proliferation,and recovery of normal distribution of proteins. These microscopic changes are&#xD;
      thought to be the reason for visual function recovery following retinal reattachment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent development in spectral domain optical coherence tomography, which provides faster&#xD;
      imaging speed and higher resolution, allows more detailed retinal layer evaluation. Previous&#xD;
      studies using spectral domain optical coherence tomography have revealed abnormalities of&#xD;
      retinal microstructure in reattached retina. However, these studies mainly focused on the&#xD;
      photoreceptor layer and/or external limiting membrane, although abnormalities of various&#xD;
      retinal layers have been revealed in previous microscopic studies. In addition, qualitative&#xD;
      rather than quantitative analysis was performed in most of the studies, and most importantly,&#xD;
      all previous studies were observational and comparisons between the affected and normal&#xD;
      control regions were not performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study involves a series of recent-onset primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment&#xD;
      that were managed with surgical retinal reattachment. The investigators quantified the&#xD;
      thickness of each retinal layer based on spectral domain optical coherence tomography images&#xD;
      and compared the thicknesses of reattached regions and undetached normal regions. The primary&#xD;
      purpose of this study was to evaluate the changes in thickness profiles of each retinal layer&#xD;
      in reattached retina after acute RRD.&#xD;
