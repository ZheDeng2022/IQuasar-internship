      In patient with a platinum sensitive ovarian cancer recurrence is demonstrated that the&#xD;
      re-challenge with a compound of platinum-based, or a treatment with carboplatin in&#xD;
      combination with paclitaxel , determines a rate of clinical response similar to the primary&#xD;
      treatment, which is all the more important as the longer the time to progression from the&#xD;
      primary therapy.In the clinical setting there are many studies that have shown activity of&#xD;
      oxaliplatin and docetaxel in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Two recent studies have&#xD;
      shown clinical efficacy of the combination carboplatin / docetaxel in the first line&#xD;
      oxaliplatin / paclitaxel to recurrence of disease, confirming the data already obtained from&#xD;
      studies of activity in a single agent.In surgery it has been demonstrated in a meta-analysis&#xD;
      including approximately 7000 patients in advanced stages of disease, that the extent of&#xD;
      cytoreduction is the most powerful determinant of survival.The role of secondary surgical&#xD;
      cytoreduction in case of recurrent disease has yet to be determined because of the lack of&#xD;
      prospective randomized clinical studies that may highlight the superiority of such aggressive&#xD;
      treatment.The combination of aggressive cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic&#xD;
      intraperitoneal intraoperative chemotherapy (CHIP) used in recent clinical studies showed a&#xD;
      prolonged time to progression and disease-free survival in patients with ovarian cancer.&#xD;
      However, these studies were conducted on groups of patients with very different among&#xD;
      themselves and with other drugs, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions.Given the&#xD;
      activities of oxaliplatin and docetaxel and their non-cross-resistance we designed a Phase 2&#xD;
      clinical trial on treatment of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, platinum-sensitive,&#xD;
      treated with surgical cytoreduction with hyperthermic oxaliplatin-based intraoperative&#xD;
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy and following consolidation treatment with oxaliplatin and&#xD;
      docetaxel systemically every 21 days.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Among the malignancies of the female genital tract, ovarian cancer is the second most common&#xD;
      cancer after the endometrial tumor, but the more lethal, representing the fifth leading cause&#xD;
      of death among women in industrialized countries. For the most part, these are epithelial&#xD;
      tumors (&gt;70%), who begin with vague gastrointestinal symptoms, general malaise, abdominal&#xD;
      bloating, weight loss and fatigue. Because of the non-specificity oh the symptoms and the&#xD;
      often late presentation, about 70% of the diagnosis is made at an advanced stage of disease&#xD;
      (IIIC). In the last two decades only a modest improvement in survival was achieved. Moreover,&#xD;
      even after optimal cytoreduction followed by adjuvant chemotherapy based on platinum and&#xD;
      taxane, which is currently the standard for this type of disease, most patients with stage&#xD;
      III disease developed a recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rational of HIPEC in recurrent ovarian cancer: the cytoreduction. Contrary to what happens in&#xD;
      the primary disease is not yet clear what is the standard treatment in recurrent epithelial&#xD;
      ovarian cancer (EOC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who experience a recurrence within 6 months from the end of the first-line&#xD;
      chemotherapy are considered platinum-resistant and have applied for a salvage treatment with&#xD;
      second line drugs with low response rates and poor survival. Patients who recur after 6&#xD;
      months are considered platinum-sensitive and, therefore, subject to a new chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment with a platinum compound possibly in combination with paclitaxel (re-challenge). In&#xD;
      these patients it is possible to achieve a clinical response rate similar to the primary&#xD;
      treatment, with median survival reported between 12 and 24 months. Recently surgery affirmed&#xD;
      a major role not only in the primary treatment but also in recurrent chemo-sensitive ovarian&#xD;
      cancer. A meta-analysis of 2019 patients has shown that obtain an optimal secondary&#xD;
      cytoreduction independently correlates with survival (OS) after recurrence. However, a recent&#xD;
      Cochrane, showed that, from the studies available nowadays, is not possible to substantiate a&#xD;
      difference in prognosis between the exclusive chemotherapy treatment and the association of&#xD;
      surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the multicenter trial DESKTOP I show that, even in the presence of peritoneal&#xD;
      carcinomatosis, the 2-year survival improves if an optimal cytoreduction is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rational of HIPEC in recurrent ovarian cancer: intraperitoneal chemotherapy Many patients who&#xD;
      undergo optimal cytoreduction may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy administered&#xD;
      intraperitoneally (IP). Several randomized trials have demonstrated improved survival&#xD;
      associated with IP platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line adjuvant therapy after optimal&#xD;
      cytoreduction, although it is still unclear which patients might benefit most, or what would&#xD;
      be the best drug , its dose or the right number of cycles. The adjuvant IP therapy, however,&#xD;
      seems to have more side effects than intravenous therapy (IV) and consequently a worsening of&#xD;
      the quality of life (QOL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rational use of HIPEC in recurrent ovarian cancer: hyperthermia The association of&#xD;
      hyperthermia plus chemotherapy to the surgery based its rational on the cytotoxic effect of&#xD;
      hyperthermia, which not only cause a rupture of cell membranes due to protein denaturation&#xD;
      (direct effect), but also an increase in the permeability of new vessels and an impairment of&#xD;
      receptor protein complexes (indirect effect). The sensitivity of the solid tumors to&#xD;
      hyperthermia is probably linked to the creation of a microenvironment with a low pH, low&#xD;
      oxygen tension, low glucose levels in response to high temperature. Inactivation of tumor&#xD;
      cells is time and temperature dependent, and starts at 40-41 ° C. Experimental data show that&#xD;
      human tumor cell lines are more sensitive to a moderate hyperthermia (41-42 ° C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the ability of its cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, including mitomycin C,&#xD;
      doxorubicin, cisplatin and oxaliplatin, is enhanced by hyperthermia itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary cytoreduction (CRS), HIPEC and ovarian cancer Since its first appearance in 1980,&#xD;
      the HIPEC associated with surgery has had an increasingly important role in the treatment of&#xD;
      several types of cancer with peritoneal dissemination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rational for this therapeutic approach is based on the achievement of higher drug&#xD;
      concentrations in contact with the peritoneal surface with a lower systemic concentrations,&#xD;
      resulting in a decrease in the systemic toxicity of treatment. The addition of hyperthermia&#xD;
      proved to be able to have a cytotoxic effect on tumor cells directly and indirectly, and a&#xD;
      synergistic effect with several cytotoxic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two recent trials including heterogeneous populations of patients with EOC have demonstrated&#xD;
      that the use of the HIPEC in association with CRS is followed by an overall survival (OS) of&#xD;
      three years after the recurrence that vary between 20-63%. Data from a trial which took place&#xD;
      at this Institution and was recently published about the use of HIPEC platinum-sensitive&#xD;
      recurrent EOC patients, showed a median disease-free interval (PFS) and OS of 24 and 38&#xD;
      months respectively, with an estimated PFS and OS at 3 years of 44% and 92% respectively.&#xD;
      These data not only confirm those previously reported in the literature, but are more&#xD;
      significant, probably because of the highly selected population, a characteristic that&#xD;
      contrasts with the wide heterogeneity of most of the other trials made until now.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, as demonstrated by the meta-analysis by Bristow et al, the median survival after&#xD;
      recurrence in the same group of patients treated with CRS and standard adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      alone was 30.3 months. This difference in survival compared with that of our trial could be&#xD;
      justified by the increased rate of optimal cytoreduction obtained in our Institution (95.3%&#xD;
      vs. 52.2%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, on the basis of the criteria developed by Markman, that any second-line&#xD;
      treatment after recurrence which reaches a PFS similar or comparable to that after the&#xD;
      primary disease is considered to be effective, our data show an additional benefit obtained&#xD;
      by HIPEC. In the series of patients underwent CRS + HIPEC at this Institution, in fact, the&#xD;
      median PFS after primary disease was substantially equal to that after recurrence with values&#xD;
      of 25 and 24 months respectively (p = ns). Therefore treatment with CRS associated with HIPEC&#xD;
      in with platinum-sensitive recurrent EOC patients would seem to offer the same opportunities&#xD;
      in terms of prognosis than primary treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the complications linked to this procedure, the trials completed at our&#xD;
      Institution, showed morbidity and mortality rates about of 35% and 0%, consistent with the&#xD;
      data presented by recent review (12 - 52% and 0,9-5,8% respectively), which are however more&#xD;
      heterogeneous due to differences between the considered studies. In addition, the analysis&#xD;
      divided into two blocks per year of execution of the procedure, has demonstrated a&#xD;
      significant reduction in the percentage of complications (up to 26.7%) with a statistically&#xD;
      significant difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, despite the presence of a strong biological and pharmacological rational and the&#xD;
      over 10 years application in EOC, the use of HIPEC in the clinical practice continues to&#xD;
      receive mixed reviews. The limit to the confidence in this procedure is the lack of&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials and the heterogeneity of the different phase II studies conducted,&#xD;
      which resulted in a lack of scientific evidence level I-II. Moreover, the finding of high&#xD;
      rates of the related morbidity and mortality, has precluded the use of this procedure to many&#xD;
      patients with peritoneal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is therefore to assess whether the use of CRS in&#xD;
      combination with HIPEC is able to offer an effectively advantage in terms of survival&#xD;
      compared to the exclusive optimal CRS or the only chemotherapy, in platinum-sensitive&#xD;
      recurrent EOC patients.&#xD;
