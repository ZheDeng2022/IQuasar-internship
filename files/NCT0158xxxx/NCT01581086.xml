      This study is looking for high blood pressure in the lungs (Pulmonary artery hypertension&#xD;
      PAH) in HIV and COPD patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The goal of the project is to identify and characterize populations at risk for developing&#xD;
      pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The project will establish a PAH subphenotype core&#xD;
      cohort (CORE) to evaluate mechanistic pathways and test novel therapeutic agents. This core&#xD;
      cohort serves as a resource for the Translational Program Project grant, Vascular&#xD;
      Subphenotypes of Lung Disease (Mark Gladwin, PI). In order to construct the CORE, we have&#xD;
      chosen to recruit COPD and HIV patients, two populations with advanced lung and systemic&#xD;
      diseases that are enriched for PAH. We have selected these as prototypic conditions because:&#xD;
      A) both COPD patients and HIV-infected patients develop PAH at a rate significantly greater&#xD;
      than the general population, B) morbidity and mortality are greatly increased in&#xD;
      dually-affected persons, C) mechanisms responsible for development of the PAH &quot;subphenotype&quot;&#xD;
      are not well-understood, D) clinical and genetic characteristics of the subgroup with PAH are&#xD;
      not known, and E) effects of PAH therapies in subphenotypes are incompletely studied. There&#xD;
      is also some overlap between COPD and HIV, with HIV-infected patients having accelerated COPD&#xD;
      even with effective antiretroviral therapy. Participants with COPD, HIV, or HIV-uninfected&#xD;
      controls will be recruited to the study based on entry criteria of elevated N-terminal&#xD;
      pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and/or an abnormal echocardiogram. These subjects&#xD;
      will then undergo a 6-minute walk test, blood collection, questionnaire, medical record&#xD;
      review, and echocardiography (if not previously performed). Selected subjects will then be&#xD;
      recruited to undergo right heart catheterization. The goals of the study are to establish a&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension cohort for translational investigations, to determine the utility of&#xD;
      NT-proBNP as a biomarker of PAH, to determine clinical characteristics and relationship of&#xD;
      lung function to PAH in COPD and HIV, and to establish a biorepository for mechanistic&#xD;
      studies of PAH phenotypes.&#xD;
