  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The registry aims to evaluate the safety, performance and efficacy of the Everolimus-eluting&#xD;
      bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) system in patients with de novo native coronary artery&#xD;
      lesions in all-day clinical practice.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bioresorbable scaffolds are transient implants. They act like drug-eluting metallic stents&#xD;
      (DES) during the first 3 months by supporting the vessel wall thereby keeping the artery&#xD;
      patent. Subsequently, resorption of the scaffold begins and its structure loosens. As a&#xD;
      result of everolimus release, neointimal growth is inhibited similar to DES. Finally the&#xD;
      implant is reabsorbed completely in about 2-3 years. BVS in terms of late stent thrombosis&#xD;
      may be safer than DES. Transiently scaffolded vessels may regain their natural curvature and&#xD;
      angulation as well as response to nitroglycerine and endothelial function.&#xD;

        The recommendation to implant BVS in an individual patient is purely based on clinical&#xD;
        grounds. These are determined by the instructions for use (IFU) of the BVS and by the&#xD;
        clinical experience accumulated so far from clinical studies.These studies suggest that the&#xD;
        BVS should be implanted under certain conditions, which are determined by the patient and&#xD;
