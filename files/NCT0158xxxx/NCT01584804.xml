      This study aims to observe the therapeutic effect of Su-Huang antitussive capsule on cough&#xD;
      variant asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cough score and cough reflex sensitivity will be improved after treatment with Su-Huang&#xD;
      antitussive capsule.&#xD;

      Study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 patients diagnosed with CVA will be randomised into two groups as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1:Su-Huang antitussive capsule The patients with cough variant asthma received Su-Huang&#xD;
      antitussive capsule (0.45g) 3 capsules Tid for 2 weeks (swallowed by warm water at 0.5-1h&#xD;
      after each meal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: placebo The patients with cough variant asthma received placebo 3 capsules Tid for 2&#xD;
      weeks (swallowed by warm water at 0.5-1h after each meal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be divided into following phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First Visit (Visit s, day -14):&#xD;
&#xD;
           A full medical history and physical examination to be undertaken to determine whether&#xD;
           patients meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the informed consent has been signed, the following samples are obtained from all&#xD;
           patients: blood samples for routine clinical laboratory tests (haematology, biochemistry&#xD;
           and electrocardiogram, chest x-ray). A urine pregnancy test will be performed in women&#xD;
           of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Spirometry and methacholine bronchial provocation test were performed to determined the&#xD;
           presence of bronchial non-specific hyper-responsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Screening Period (day -14 to day 0, 14 Days) Patients can take medications other than&#xD;
           corticosteroid , β2 agonist, inhaled sodium cromoglycate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Second Visit (Visit 1, Week 0):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients are given the Diary Card.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A physical examination were to be performed. All laboratory tests results are obtained&#xD;
           to determine whether patients meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Concurrent&#xD;
           medication were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Capsaicin challenge test and FENO were performed and hypertonic saline induced sputum&#xD;
           samples for cell differential were taken from enrolled patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Enrolled patients were randomized into different groups, and the study medication were&#xD;
           dispensed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. During Treatment 1(Week 0 to Week 1, 7 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients were to take study medication for 14 days and completed Diary Card for 7 days&#xD;
           from Week 0 to Week 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Third Visit (Visit 2, Week 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
           A physical examination were to be performed. The Diary Card were collected and reviewed.&#xD;
           Adverse events, secondary complications, concurrent medication will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Diary Card were collected, reviewed and assessed whether treatment is efficient for&#xD;
           cough symptom (symptom score improved 1 at least).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. During Treatment 2 (Week 1 to Week 2, 7 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were to take study medication for 14 days and completed Diary Card for 7 days from&#xD;
      Week 1 to Week 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometry and bronchial provocation test by methacholine&#xD;
      inhalation,electro-cardiogram,capsaicin challenge test and FENO were performed and hypertonic&#xD;
      saline induced sputum samples for cell differential were taken from enrolled patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for routine clinical laboratory tests (haematology and biochemistry) were&#xD;
      obtained, if a clinically significant laboratory abnormal result was noted at the visit 2, AE&#xD;
      and a follow-up visit would be considered.&#xD;
