    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare which of the two mood stabilizers (drugs that help to&#xD;
      steady/stabilize mood in patients with bipolar disorder (BD)), lithium and divalproex, is&#xD;
      more effective in patients with bipolar disorder over 26 weeks. The study will also compare&#xD;
      if lithium or divalproex used alone versus lithium or divalproex used with quetiapine versus&#xD;
      lithium or divalproex used with lamotrigine is more effective when symptoms of depression&#xD;
      develop.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This open methods advancement study will randomize BD patients with clinically significant&#xD;
      symptoms to treatment with one of two mood stabilizers (MS), lithium [Li] or divalproex&#xD;
      [Div]. Those who develop protocol defined depression will then be randomized to a MS alone,&#xD;
      MS + quetiapine [QTP] or MS + lamotrigine [LTG]. A SMART strategy employs a rule for adding&#xD;
      new treatments based on each patient's current illness state and response during the trial,&#xD;
      mimicking the adaptive nature of treatment selection which occurs in clinical settings, but&#xD;
      in a controlled way which allows application of causal inference. By using early indices of&#xD;
      response to dynamically alter treatment decisions to improve outcome, SMART eliminates&#xD;
      unmeasured confounders associated with treatment decisions that are not randomized, as occurs&#xD;
      in data mining exercises and in other non-randomized decisions in studies which randomize one&#xD;
      variable at baseline. This sequential adaptive design represents a methodological innovation&#xD;
      in bipolar trial history which will have particular implications for effectiveness studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim A.1: Assess the feasibility of a SMART design in the conduct of an effectiveness&#xD;
      study over 26 weeks in patients with BD (bipolar disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim A.2 Compare the effectiveness of Li to Div as a primary component of treatment for BD&#xD;
      over 26 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim A.3: Assess the effectiveness of MS + QTP and MS + LTG versus MS in subjects who develop&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A4. Exploratory Aims: 1.Determine the effects of ethnicity, language facility, education and&#xD;
      stress as moderators of treatment outcomes; 2. Explore the use of novel statistical&#xD;
      methodologies to more informatively characterize illness trajectories in response to the&#xD;
      interventions. In the aggregate these aims also will clarify whether the SMART confirms&#xD;
      results provided by traditional, single point randomized controlled trials (RCTs).&#xD;

    <measure>Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale (BISS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BISS uses a structured interview to assess the full spectrum of symptoms associated with all primary clinical states in bipolar disorder, yielding a total severity, a depression, a mania, as well as dimensional scale scores. There are 42 items; each item is rated on a 0-4 scale. The BISS is a clinician-rated instrument. The Scale is rated as follows:&#xD;
0 Not at all&#xD;
Slight&#xD;
Mild&#xD;
Moderate&#xD;
Severe Each of the 42 items is rated separately, with a score, based on the most recent 7 day period. The mean score is calculated from the total score, giving an overall score out of 4, where 0 is slight and 4 is the most severe symptoms. A negative score indicated an improvement from baseline to 26 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Global Assessment of Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale (CGI-S) is used to assess global illness severity&#xD;
The CGI-S score change is measured from baseline to 26 weeks and is rated on a 7-point scale. The scale is read as follows:&#xD;
very much improved since the initiation of treatment&#xD;
much improved&#xD;
minimally improved&#xD;
no change from baseline (the initiation of treatment)&#xD;
minimally worse&#xD;
much worse&#xD;
very much worse since the initiation of treatment The score is calculated as a mean of all items, where 1 indicates improvement from inititation of visit, and 7 indicates the condition to be much worse since the inititation of treatment. A negative score indicates a change from worse to better.</description>

        <title>Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale (BISS)</title>
        <description>The BISS uses a structured interview to assess the full spectrum of symptoms associated with all primary clinical states in bipolar disorder, yielding a total severity, a depression, a mania, as well as dimensional scale scores. There are 42 items; each item is rated on a 0-4 scale. The BISS is a clinician-rated instrument. The Scale is rated as follows:&#xD;
0 Not at all&#xD;
Slight&#xD;
Mild&#xD;
Moderate&#xD;
Severe Each of the 42 items is rated separately, with a score, based on the most recent 7 day period. The mean score is calculated from the total score, giving an overall score out of 4, where 0 is slight and 4 is the most severe symptoms. A negative score indicated an improvement from baseline to 26 weeks.</description>

        <title>Global Assessment of Functioning</title>
        <description>The Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale (CGI-S) is used to assess global illness severity&#xD;
The CGI-S score change is measured from baseline to 26 weeks and is rated on a 7-point scale. The scale is read as follows:&#xD;
very much improved since the initiation of treatment&#xD;
much improved&#xD;
minimally improved&#xD;
no change from baseline (the initiation of treatment)&#xD;
minimally worse&#xD;
much worse&#xD;
very much worse since the initiation of treatment The score is calculated as a mean of all items, where 1 indicates improvement from inititation of visit, and 7 indicates the condition to be much worse since the inititation of treatment. A negative score indicates a change from worse to better.</description>
