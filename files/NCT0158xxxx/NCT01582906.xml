    <textblock>
      After treatment women surviving gynaecological cancer may experience lateeffects and longterm&#xD;
      challenges specific to their disease and treatment resulting in functional deficits and a&#xD;
      reduction in societal integration (Yabroff et al., 2004, Yadav, 2007). The available research&#xD;
      on best models of posttreatment rehabilitation support for women posttreatment for&#xD;
      gynaecological cancer is limited. The primary objective of this study is to determine if&#xD;
      there is any additional benefit, over usual rehabilitation care, of additional rehabilitation&#xD;
      appointments to develop a survivorship care plan on cancer specific health related quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to determine any additional benefit to general selfefficacy, generic&#xD;
      health related quality of life or social and health economics for patients who have completed&#xD;
      treatment for stage I or II gynaecological cancer. Also to explore the patient's perspectives&#xD;
      of the intervention. The study will be open to patients attending the outpatient&#xD;
      gynaecological clinics of the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust having recently completed&#xD;
      treatment for Stage I or II gynaecological cancer. They will report that they have&#xD;
      experienced a physical or psychosocial need resulting from the disease or its treatment; be&#xD;
      aged over 18 years and be willing and able to articulate their needs. The study will last for&#xD;
      six months for each participant. It will involve completing questionnaires and attending two&#xD;
      extra rehabilitation appointments to develop a survivorship care plan at the hospital may&#xD;
      also include attending for an interview about being involved in the study for those&#xD;
      randomised to the intervention group&#xD;

      Purpose and design We conducted a preliminary qualitative study last year (Rec Ref&#xD;
      10/H0608/56) where gynaecological patients reported unmet rehabilitation care needs, both&#xD;
      physical and psychosocial. At the end of treatment patients said that they were unaware of&#xD;
      how to resolve these needs. They also reported that they wanted support and information to&#xD;
      manage consequences of cancer and treatment themselves rather than become 'overmedicalised'&#xD;
      and require treatment from a professional, if that were possible (Sandsund et al., 2011).&#xD;
      Since there is as yet no body of evidence to prove a best model of delivery we have developed&#xD;
      this study to reflect the intervention participants in the study suggested would best support&#xD;
      them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the preliminary study participants made suggestions that may improve their journey&#xD;
      through treatment. Of the five focus groups all suggested a meeting in clinic with a&#xD;
      rehabilitation professional at the end of their treatment to explore their rehabilitation&#xD;
      needs. The intervention was as such described and defined by the patients in the preliminary&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the study was analysed and presented to the Rehabilitation Research Group discussions&#xD;
      started regarding research questions and a design for this interventional study. The Head of&#xD;
      Therapies, a representative from the Psychological Care/ Psychological Support Service and a&#xD;
      Nurse Consultant in Living with and Beyond Cancer have been involved in the development of&#xD;
      the protocol from the preliminary study in order to ensure its' conduct will be feasible&#xD;
      within The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust (RM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been discussions amongst the research group and the authors as to the best way to&#xD;
      clinically screen for physical and psychosocial problems. The FACTG, the EORTC and the&#xD;
      Distress Thermometer were most thoroughly considered. The Distress Thermometer was chosen as&#xD;
      the questions were felt to best cover issues we felt the participant group may have. It has&#xD;
      been used in a National Cancer Survivorship Initiative/ Department of Health project for&#xD;
      which RM was one of the sites. on evaluation of the project it was found to be clinically&#xD;
      useful as a screening tool and was acceptable to our patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of life Questionnaire&#xD;
      - C30 (EORTC QLQC30),General Self Efficacy Scale (GSES), Short Form 36 (SF36) were chosen for&#xD;
      their wide use in rehabilitation intervention studies because of their ability to detect&#xD;
      change over time reliably in cancer populations. We believe that the primary outcome measure&#xD;
      the EORTC will be sensitive enough to detect changes due to the intervention. The&#xD;
      statistician has given advice to this regard and provided the statistical support for the&#xD;
      study to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Health Economist who is involved with other studies at RM has developed the study specific&#xD;
      forms to measure the economic evaluation of impact on health and social care provision. She&#xD;
      will perform the cost analysis of this information to see if the intervention has had any&#xD;
      health or social economic impact. The patient's perspectives of the intervention will be&#xD;
      sought using qualitative interviews for a randomised sample of those completing the study.&#xD;
      This will be used to assess the acceptability of the intervention to patients.&#xD;

    <description>Participants randomised to the intervention group will be offered two rehabilitation appointments at three month intervals. They will complete the screening tool, the Distress (Concerns) Thermometer before the first appointment; this will be reviewed after three months. Appointments will make use of communication skills recognised to promote motivation via self-efficacy. Self efficacy is a person's belief in their ability to achieve a goal. Their sense of mastery will influence their behaviour, their perception of stress and the effort they put into achieving that goal.</description>

        We aim to capture patients with gynaecological cancers at Stage I or II. Overall there were&#xD;
        approximately 500 referrals of patients with Stage I or II gynaecological cancer to the&#xD;
        Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust (RM) in the year April 2009 to April 2010. There were&#xD;
        729 gynaecological referrals of all stages of cancer. Of these, 333 were referred to the&#xD;
        surgical team and 396 to the medical teams. Of those 729 patients, 378 were referred to the&#xD;
        Rehabilitation Department, the majority of whom were referred post-surgery and seen as&#xD;
        inpatients, leaving 48% of patients with gynaecological cancer never seen by a&#xD;
        rehabilitation professional at RM.&#xD;
