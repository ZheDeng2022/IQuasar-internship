    <textblock>
      Locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) is treated with various&#xD;
      combinations of radiation and chemotherapy. Docetaxel and cisplatin have been combined in&#xD;
      Phase II trials in recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer with very encouraging&#xD;
      results. Induction therapy with docetaxel/cisplatin followed by chemoradiotherapy was&#xD;
      investigated in a randomized Phase II study in nasopharyngeal cancer and showed superior PFS&#xD;
      and OS in comparison with chemoradiation alone. Cetuximab is a chimerized EGFR monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody that has produced positive results in Phase III trials in combination with either&#xD;
      radiation for locally advanced disease or chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Upregulation&#xD;
      of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been associated with cetuximab resistance.&#xD;
      Bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody is currently being investigated in SCCHN with promising&#xD;
      results. The investigators have previously shown that cisplatin, docetaxel and cetuximab&#xD;
      (TPE) followed by radiotherapy, cisplatin and cetuximab (XPE) is feasible and highly&#xD;
      efficacious in locally advanced SCCHN (Argiris, A. et al.JCO 2011). In this Phase II study&#xD;
      the investigators evaluate the addition of bevacizumab to induction therapy with TPE (TPE-A)&#xD;
      and to subsequent XPE (XPE-A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the rate of complete responses with induction therapy (primary endpoint) and&#xD;
      progression-free survival, overall survival and objective response rates. Also, the&#xD;
      investigators plan to investigate a panel of EGFR and angiogenesis biomarkers in pre- and&#xD;
      post- treatment tumor biopsies. Finally, the investigators will evaluate the associated&#xD;
      treatment toxicities and the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll patients with previously untreated locally advanced SCCHN (see&#xD;
      detailed eligibility criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction therapy consists of 3 cycles of bevacizumab 15mg/kg on day 1, docetaxel 75mg/m2 on&#xD;
      day 1, loading dose of cetuximab 400mg/m2 on cycle 1, day 1, then 250 mg/m2 on all subsequent&#xD;
      administrations (Day 8 and 15 of cycle 1 and days 1,8,15 of cycles 2 and 3), cisplatin&#xD;
      75mg/m2 on day 1, docetaxel 75mg/m2 on day 1, repeated every 21 days. After 3 cycles of&#xD;
      induction therapy, patients will receive standard radiation 70-74 Gy/ 200 cGy/ daily, 5 days/&#xD;
      week with concurrent weekly cisplatin 30mg/m2, cetuximab 250mg/m2 and bevacizumab 15mg/kg&#xD;
      every 3 weeks x 3. There is optional surgery for non-responders in the primary (stable&#xD;
      disease) after TPE-A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical design and sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II, two-stage study with complete response rate after induction therapy as the primary&#xD;
      endpoint. The sample size is 33 patients.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with AJCC 7th edition stage III-IVB head and neck cancer, all sites,&#xD;
             including unknown primary tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior to entry in the study the resectability and alternative treatment options for&#xD;
             each patient will be determined by a team composed of an Ear, Nose, and Throat&#xD;
             Surgeon, a Radiation Oncologist and a Medical Oncologist. Stage determination, optimal&#xD;
             local treatment, and its timing according to this protocol will be determined at this&#xD;
             evaluation. The unequivocal demonstration of distant metastasis (M1) confers&#xD;
             ineligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell or poorly&#xD;
             differentiated carcinomas, or WHO types I-III of the nasopharynx.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unidimensionally measurable disease is required (RECIST 1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior chemotherapy, biologic/molecular targeted therapy (including any prior&#xD;
             therapy which specifically and directly targets the EGFR pathway), or radiotherapy for&#xD;
             head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior surgical therapy will consist only of incisional or excisional biopsy, and organ&#xD;
             sparing procedures such as debulking of airway compromising tumors or neck dissection&#xD;
             in a patient with an existing primary tumor. Any non-biopsy procedure must have taken&#xD;
             place &gt; 4 weeks but &lt; 3 months of initiating protocol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed consent must be obtained from all patients prior to beginning therapy.&#xD;
             Patients should have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients should have their tumor tissue tested for HPV (in situ hybridization&#xD;
             and/or p16 staining by immunohistochemistry), and results must be known prior to study&#xD;
             entry, and will consent to have available archival tumor samples, unstained slides or&#xD;
             blocks from previous diagnostic or therapeutic procedures submitted for correlative&#xD;
             studies, including assessment of target molecules EGFR, VEGF and related biomarkers.&#xD;
             Also, patients must agree to submit blood samples for correlative studies at least at&#xD;
             baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count at or above 1500/µl, Platelet count at or above 100,000/µl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine clearance 60 ml/min or higher calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Calculated Creatinine Clearance = (140-age) X actual body wt (kg)/ 72 X serum creatinine&#xD;
        Multiply this number by 0.85 if the patient is female&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin within normal limits and AST/ALT less than 3 times the upper limit of&#xD;
             normal.&#xD;
&#xD;

             dipstick result is &gt; 1+, a calculation of Urine Protein Creatinine (UPC) ratio is&#xD;
             required. Patients must have a UPC ratio &lt; 1.0 to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        NOTE: UPC ratio of spot urine is an estimation of the 24-urine protein excretion - a UPC&#xD;
        ratio of 1 is roughly equivalent to a 24-hour urine protein of 1gm. UPC ratio is calculated&#xD;
        using one of the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  [urine protein]/[urine creatinine] - if both protein and creatinine are reported in&#xD;
             mg/DI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  [(urine protein) × 0.088]/[urine creatinine] - if urine creatinine is reported in&#xD;
             mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with a prior history of squamous cell or basal carcinoma of the skin or&#xD;
                  in situ cervical cancer must have been curatively treated. Patients with a&#xD;
                  history of other prior malignancy must have been treated with curative intent and&#xD;
                  must have remained disease-free for 3 years post diagnosis.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior severe infusion reaction to a monoclonal antibody or known hypersensitivity to&#xD;
             any component of bevacizumab&#xD;
&#xD;

             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients will have a baseline EKG. If abnormalities consistent with active&#xD;
