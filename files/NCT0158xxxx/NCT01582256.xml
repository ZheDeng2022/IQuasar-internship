  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate whether neuropsychological function (particularly cognitive&#xD;
      flexibility and executive function), functional (assessed by resting functional MRI, rfMRI)&#xD;
      and structural connectivity (assessed by DSI), and electrophysiological function (assessed by&#xD;
      event-related potential [ERP]: mismatch negativity, MMN and P50) can be effective cognitive&#xD;
      endophenotypes (biomarkers) for Autism spectrum disorders (ASD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is a common severe, multi-factorial, highly heritable,&#xD;
      clinically and genetically heterogeneous, life-long impairing childhood-onset&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental disorder. Due to its high prevalence and severe lifelong impairment&#xD;
      without effective prevention and pharmacological treatment, this disastrous disease has been&#xD;
      prioritized for epidemiological, molecular genetic and biomarker studies in the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To validate the structural and functional connectivity in fronto-temporal, and&#xD;
           cortico-striato-thalamic circuitry as effective imaging endophenotypes by demonstrating&#xD;
           the differences between ASD probands with CNVs findings (n=22) and their unaffected&#xD;
           siblings (n=22), probands without CNVs and known genetic markers related to ASD (n=22)&#xD;
           and their unaffected siblings (n=22), and matched neurotypicals (n=22 for each);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To validate the neuropsychological functioning (particularly set-shifting and executive&#xD;
           function) as effective neuropsychological endophenotypes by demonstrating the&#xD;
           differences among the six groups;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To validate the electrophysiological functioning assessed by ERP as effective&#xD;
           neurophysiological endophenotypes by demonstrating the differences among the 6 groups;&#xD;
           and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To correlate the data from structural and functional connectivity, neuropsychology, and&#xD;
           electrophysiology involving altered brain functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that probands with CNVs may have higher level of decreased&#xD;
      structural and functional connectivity, impaired ERP and neuropsychological functioning than&#xD;
      probands without CNVs. The alterations in the structural and functional connectivity,&#xD;
      neurophysiological and neuropsychological functioning would be observed in the unaffected&#xD;
      siblings as compared to neurotypical participants. If CNV in the probands is proved to be de&#xD;
      novo mutation and their unaffected siblings did not have such results, the likelihood of&#xD;
      different functioning between their unaffected siblings and neurotypical participants would&#xD;
      be decreased. The genetic dosage (CNV, rare mutation with moderate to large clinical effect,&#xD;
      versus multiple common variants with very small effects, with regards to unaffected siblings,&#xD;
      and neurotypicals) is anticipated to pose the strongest effects on the microstructural&#xD;
      integrity of white matter, followed by functional connectivity and electrophysiological&#xD;
      function, and neuropsychological function with the least effect.&#xD;

        The sample (6 groups) consists of 44 individuals with clinical diagnosis of ASD confirmed&#xD;
        by the ADI-R and ADOS assessments (22 with CNVs and 22 without CNVs), their unaffected&#xD;
        siblings (n=22 for each group) and age-, sex-, handedness-, and IQ-matched school&#xD;
