      The study consists of measurement of antidepressant-induced excessive sweating and its&#xD;
      treatment with an experimental medication, glycopyrrolate (approved to treat ulcers), which&#xD;
      will be added to the antidepressant. This is an open-label study (no placebo group or&#xD;
      concealment of the nature of the treatment) that will last 8 weeks, including two weeks of&#xD;
      baseline measurement without treatment with the study medication followed by six weeks of&#xD;
      treatment with the study medication. The study is pilot study by Dr. Rajnish Mago that is&#xD;
      based on the hypothesis that glycopyrrolate will be effective in reducing the severity of&#xD;
      excessive sweating caused by antidepressant treatment, and will have minimal side-effects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sweating is a common and bothersome adverse effect of treatment with antidepressants.&#xD;
      Tricyclics and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have both been clearly shown&#xD;
      to cause sweating. Increased sweating has been reported with venlafaxine (Pierre and Guze,&#xD;
      2000) and bupropion (Feighner et al. 1984) as well. It is unclear to what extent tolerance&#xD;
      develops to antidepressant-induced sweating. It may continue to be a problem even after 6 or&#xD;
      more months on the antidepressant (e.g., Mavissakalian et al., 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of sweating with SSRIs is estimated to be between 7% and 19% depending on the&#xD;
      drug (Ashton &amp; Weinstein 2002). According to the Physician's Desk Reference, excessive&#xD;
      sweating occurs in 3-11% patients in clinical trials of SSRIs. Considering the fairly high&#xD;
      prevalence of excessive sweating during antidepressant use and its consequences of patient&#xD;
      distress and treatment noncompliance, it is important that more intensive efforts be made to&#xD;
      understand the phenomenon and to systematically study potential treatments for it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of antidepressant-induced sweating has not been clearly elucidated and there is&#xD;
      no generally accepted treatment for it. Initially, a reduction in the dose may be attempted&#xD;
      to resolve antidepressant-induced sweating. However, a reduction of dose may not always be&#xD;
      helpful (Leeman, 1990; Ashton &amp; Weinstein 2002) as it has been noted that the presence of&#xD;
      sweating is not a clear dose-related symptom. As well, reducing the dose of the&#xD;
      antidepressant may lead to a worsening of depression and therefore be an unrealistic&#xD;
      alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antiadrenergic drugs like clonidine and terazosin (Feder, 1995; Mago and Monti, 2007; Mago et&#xD;
      al., 2009) may be effective for the treatment of antidepressant-induced excessive sweating&#xD;
      because the nervous system control of sweating is initially mediated by adrenergic receptors.&#xD;
      However, antiadrenergic treatment may be associated with a decrease in blood pressure in some&#xD;
      patients, which may lead to dizziness, especially on standing up. Also, the improvement in&#xD;
      excessive sweating may not be complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, additional approaches are needed. Sweat glands are innervated by nerve fibers that&#xD;
      release acetylcholine. Anticholinergic medications could be used as a potential treatment for&#xD;
      the excessive sweating. In case reports, the anticholinergic drug benztropine has been&#xD;
      successfully used to treat antidepressant-induced excessive sweating (Garber and Gregory,&#xD;
      1997; Feder and Guze, 2000). However, this has not been confirmed in a clinical trial. Also,&#xD;
      benztropine readily crosses the blood-brain barrier; therefore, in addition to its desired&#xD;
      effect peripherally on the sweat glands, it tends to cause cognitive side effects through its&#xD;
      central effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glycopyrrolate is an anticholinergic medication that is preferred for a variety of clinical&#xD;
      uses because it does not cross the blood-brain barrier to a great extent. It has been used&#xD;
      for many years by anesthesiologists to dry secretions during surgical procedures. In a case&#xD;
      series based on chart review (Tran et al., 2009), it was found to be effective for&#xD;
      antidepressant-induced excessive sweating.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Within 2 months of initiation of an antidepressant or increase in the dose, there was&#xD;

             and failure to respond to or tolerate an alternative antidepressant&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Decrease in dose of the antidepressant is either not clinically viable due to the&#xD;
             benefit obtained at the current dose OR decrease in dose of the antidepressant has&#xD;
             been tried but was not effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
