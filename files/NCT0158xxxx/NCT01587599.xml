      Design and Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design is a randomised controlled multi-centre pilot study. 18 community pharmacies&#xD;
      located in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany, were randomised to either a control or an&#xD;
      intervention group. These pharmacies recruited eligible patients out of their clientele and&#xD;
      invited them to take part in the study. Participants were visited at home by the pharmacist&#xD;
      and home-based medication reviews were conducted. The survey form has been developed by the&#xD;
      research team and comprised amongst others items to adherence, adverse effects, drug intake,&#xD;
      storage and quality of life. Thereafter all data were analysed by the pharmacist with a newly&#xD;
      developed document called &quot;analysis guide&quot; aiming at the detection of drug related problems.&#xD;
      Pharmacists of the intervention group discussed the results with the family doctor of the&#xD;
      patients and the patients and tried to solve the drug related problems. This procedure was&#xD;
      not undertaken in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six months later a second medication review was carried out in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmaceutical care reduces the overall number of drug-related problems of elderly patients&#xD;
      with diabetes and impairments in mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to show that pharmaceutical care reduces the overall number of&#xD;
      drug-related problems of elderly diabetes-patients with impairments in mobility and leads to&#xD;
      both an improved health status and an improved quality of life.&#xD;
