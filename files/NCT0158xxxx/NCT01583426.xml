  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current guidelines as those from the AGO-Breast commission recommend for neoadjuvant breast&#xD;
      cancer patients either a sequence of 4 cycles EC followed by 4 cycles of a taxane or 6 cycles&#xD;
      of TAC based on previous large scale studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of patients with HER2-positive disease should include also simultaneous application&#xD;
      of trastuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solvent-based taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel) cause severe toxicities not only by the active&#xD;
      agents itself but also by the solvents like cremophor. Nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®) is a&#xD;
      solvent-free formulation of paclitaxel encapsulated in albumin. It does not require&#xD;
      premedication with corticosteroids or antihistamines to prevent the risk of solvent-mediated&#xD;
      hypersensitivity reactions. This new formulation improves safety profile, allows higher&#xD;
      dosing with shorter infusion duration, and produces higher tumor drug concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As neoadjuvant treatment does not only allow to compare competing treatment approaches with a&#xD;
      very high quality (homogenous treatment population, precise assessment of response by&#xD;
      histological assessment), but also to identify predictive markers, this trial will compare&#xD;
      weekly nab-paclitaxel with solvent-based paclitaxel at their currently optimal doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of HER2-positive tumor status patients receive Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab&#xD;
      additionally.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the pathological complete response (pCR=ypT0 ypN0) rates of neoadjuvant treatment&#xD;
      of nab-paclitaxel with solvent-based paclitaxel as part of neoadjuvant treatment of operable&#xD;
      or locally advanced primary breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the pCR rates per arm separately for the stratified subpopulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the rates of ypT0/is ypN0; ypT0 ypN0/+; ypT0/is ypN0/+; ypT(any) ypN0; and&#xD;
           regression grades.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the response rates of the breast tumor and axillary nodes based on physical&#xD;
           examination and imaging tests (sonography, mammography, or MRI) after treatment in both&#xD;
           arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess clinical response rate after taxane in both groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the breast conservation rate after each treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the toxicity and compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the time of onset of grade 3 neuropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the time of resolution of grade 3/4 neuropathy to at least grade 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine loco-regional invasive recurrence free survival (LRRFS),&#xD;
           distant-disease-free survival (DDFS), invasive disease-free survival (IDFS), and overall&#xD;
           survival (OS) in both arms and according to stratified subpopulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess regional recurrence free survival (RRFS) in patients with initial&#xD;
           node-positive axilla converted to negative at surgery and treated with sentinel node&#xD;
           biopsy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pCR rate and local recurrence free survival (LRFS) in patients with a&#xD;
           clinical complete response (cCR) and a negative core biopsy before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine and compare pre-specified molecular markers such as SPARC, gp60, calveoline 1&#xD;
           and other markers potentially differentially predicting efficacy of nab-paclitaxel and&#xD;
           solvent-based paclitaxel on core biopsies before, during and after chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of Substudies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess, characterize, and correlate circulating tumor cells and proteins with the&#xD;
           effect of treatment (CTC Substudy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes with the associated&#xD;
           toxicity and histologically assessed treatment effect (Pharmacogenetic substudy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess ovarian function measured by amenorrhea rate in correlation with changes in&#xD;
           E2, FSH, LH , Anti-Müller Hormone, ultrasound-follicle count in patients aged &lt; 45&#xD;
           years.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be eligible for study participation only if they comply with the following&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent for all study according to local regulatory requirements&#xD;
             prior to beginning specific protocol procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complete baseline documentation must be sent to GBG Forschungs GmbH.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unilateral or bilateral primary carcinoma of the breast, confirmed histologically by&#xD;
             core biopsy. Fine-needle aspiration alone is not sufficient. Incisional biopsy is not&#xD;
             allowed. In case of bilateral cancer, the investigator has to decide prospectively&#xD;
             which side will be evaluated for the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor lesion in the breast with a palpable size of &gt;= 2 cm or a sonographical size of&#xD;
             &gt;= 1 cm in maximum diameter. The lesion has to be measurable in two dimensions,&#xD;
             preferably by sonography. In case of inflammatory disease, the extent of inflammation&#xD;
             can be used as measurable lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be in the following stages of disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  - cT2 - cT4a-d or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  cT1c and cN+ or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  - cT1c and pNSLN+ or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  - cT1c and ER-neg and PR-neg or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  - cT1c and Ki67 &gt; 20%&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  - cT1c and HER2-pos&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In patients with multifocal or multicentric breast cancer, the largest lesion&#xD;
                  should be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Centrally confirmed ER/PR/HER-2, Ki-67 and SPARC status detected on core biopsy. ER/PR&#xD;
             positive is defined as &gt;1% stained cells and HER2-positive is defined as IHC 3+ or&#xD;
             in-situ hybridisation (ISH) ratio &gt;2.0. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)&#xD;
             breast tissue from core biopsy has therefore to be sent to the Dept. of Pathology at&#xD;
             the Charité, Berlin prior to randomization.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Normal cardiac function must be confirmed by ECG and cardiac ultrasound (LVEF or&#xD;
             shortening fraction) within 3 months prior to randomization. Results must be above the&#xD;
             normal limit of the institution. For patients with HER2-positive tumors LVEF must be&#xD;
             &gt;= 55%.&#xD;

             chest X-ray (PA and lateral), abdominal ultrasound or CT scan or MRI, and bone scan&#xD;
             done. In case of positive bone scan, bone X-ray is mandatory. Other tests may be&#xD;
             performed as clinically indicated.&#xD;
