  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of hLL1-DOX, and to&#xD;
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) regimen (in terms of a dose and its associated&#xD;
      dosing schedule). The secondary objectives are to obtain information on efficacy,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity, and to determine the optimal dose for&#xD;
      subsequent studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients receive hLL1-DOX at one of 4 dose levels administered on Days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of&#xD;
      21-day treatment cycles which are continued in the absence of progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity up to a total of 8 cycles. After treatment, follow-up will be done at 4, 8 and 12&#xD;
      weeks post-treatment and will continue to be done every 3 months for up to 2 years.&#xD;

    Study was terminated due to lack of efficacy, as a result, the stability program for the drug&#xD;

    <description>For the primary efficacy evaluations, the proportion of responders (defined as patients with a best response of PR or CR) will be tabulated for each dose level. In addition, the progression-free survival (PFS, as measured from start of treatment to disease progression, death or last follow-up) will be summarized using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis methods.&#xD;
Similarly, for responders at each dose level, the duration of response (DR, as measured from time of first response to relapse or last follow-up) will also be summarized using Kaplan- Meier survival analysis methods, if appropriate.</description>
