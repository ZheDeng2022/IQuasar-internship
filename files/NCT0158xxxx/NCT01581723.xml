      Bladder cancer is a common urological malignant disease. Patients with bladder cancer will&#xD;
      first be managed with transurethral resection (TUR) of bladder tumor. For many years,&#xD;
      monopolar transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURP) has been the gold standard for&#xD;
      treatment. However, complications including bleeding, bladder perforation and inadequate&#xD;
      sampling of deep tumor biopsy remain the major concerns. Recently published papers suggested&#xD;
      that the newer bipolar TUR technology has similar surgical outcomes but less complications&#xD;
      comparing with monopolar TUR. In this study, investigators will investigate the benefit of&#xD;
      new technology as compared with conventional monopolar resection on tumor clearance,&#xD;
      complication and recurrence rates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transurethral resection (TUR) of bladder tumor is one of commonest procedures in urology&#xD;
      practice. It is the surgery of choice for staging and treating non-muscle invasive bladder&#xD;
      cancer. Short lengths of hospital stay, simple and safe are the main advantages of the&#xD;
      surgery. Conventional TUR is performed with monopolar diathermy, which commonly elicits&#xD;
      obturator reflexes in lateral-located tumor. However, it is not without complication.&#xD;
      Bleeding and bladder perforation with or without obturator reflex are the most significant&#xD;
      complications after TUR of bladder tumor. The charring effect of monopolar is also a concern&#xD;
      as the diagnosis of muscle invasion by tumor is determined by the integrity of tumor base&#xD;
      biopsy. Mariappan et al. reported that as high as 33% of the specimen had no detrusor muscle&#xD;
      present for assessment. The absent of muscle not only affect the staging procedure but also&#xD;
      associated with higher cancer recurrence rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bipolar resection has been widely used in transurethral resection of prostate (TURP). As&#xD;
      compared with the traditional monopolar technology, the electric current passes through the&#xD;
      instrument sheath. The advantage of bipolar technology includes less obturator reflex, good&#xD;
      hemostasis and early recovery. Study has showed that the cautery artifact is more severe on&#xD;
      monopolar resection as compared with bipolar in prostate tissues. Due to the clean and&#xD;
      precise cutting, there will be less charring on the specimen and thermal injury to peripheral&#xD;
      tissues. Applying to bladder tumor resection, this will improve the staging accuracy with&#xD;
      better determination of the depth of invasion. Furthermore, with the use of saline instead of&#xD;
      glycine as irrigation fluid, risk of TUR syndrome is minimized. There is no randomized trial&#xD;
      on the benefit of using bipolar instrument on TUR bladder cancer. In this study, investigator&#xD;
      will investigate the role of bipolar technology in TUR bladder cancer as compared with&#xD;
      traditional monopolar resection.&#xD;
