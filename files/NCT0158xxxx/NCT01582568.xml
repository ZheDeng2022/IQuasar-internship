      The primary objective of this study is to assess perianal and perirectal fistula healing&#xD;
      (complete closure) based on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) evaluation at 3 months and by PDAI&#xD;
      (Pouchitis Disease Activity Index) and Fistula Drainage assessment by 6 months, showing no&#xD;
      fistula (new or recurrence) in treatment of Crohn's' disease patient with Certolizumab&#xD;
      (Cimzia).&#xD;

      Peri-anal ( located around the anus, the opening of the rectum to the outside of the body)&#xD;
      fistulae are a major complication of Crohn's disease and occur in almost 30% of patients.&#xD;
      Patients with perianal fistulae suffer from severe pain, perianal drainage, and have&#xD;
      significant impairment of quality of life. Initial studies of Infliximab and Adalimumab in&#xD;
      patients with CD have shown perianal fistula healing with these medications. Infliximab and&#xD;
      Adalimumab are medications which reduce the effects of a substance in the body that can cause&#xD;
      inflammation. They are also used to treat Crohn's disease after other drugs have been tried&#xD;
      without successful treatment of symptoms. Although no studies have specifically evaluated&#xD;
      Certolizumab (Cimzia) treatment in fistulizing Crohn's disease, there is evidence to its&#xD;
      efficacy. Certolizumab reduces the effects of a substance in the body that can cause&#xD;
      inflammation. Certolizumab is used to treat the symptoms of Crohn's disease after other drugs&#xD;
      have been tried without successful treatment of symptoms. Studies with a small number of&#xD;
      patients who use Cimzia did not show any significant effect on fistula closure. However, in a&#xD;
      larger subgroup of patients with fistulae in PRECiSE 2 43.3% of those who received 3&#xD;
      induction injections of certolizumab followed by placebo, and 53.6% of those on certolizumab&#xD;
      400mg continuous treatment had fistula closure defined as no drainage on gentle compression&#xD;
      of at least 50% of open fistulae at any 2 consecutive visits, at least 3 weeks apart.&#xD;
      Perianal disease activity is usually monitored clinically. In clinical studies, two&#xD;
      evaluation methods have been used in attempts to unify the definition of perianal disease&#xD;
      activity. One method is the perianal Crohn's disease activity index (PDAI) which involves&#xD;
      questions regarding discharge, pain/ restriction of activities, restriction of sexual&#xD;
      activity, type of perianal disease, degree of induration (with scores &gt;/=5 indicating active&#xD;
      disease, with decrease in PDAI of 2 or more points indicates improvement, and consider 0 as&#xD;
      healed. PDAI scale (Pouchitis Disease Activity Index). This scale analyzes and summarizes&#xD;
      different criteria: clinical, endoscopic and histological. Among clinical symptoms, an&#xD;
      important factor is the number of stools exceeding the post-operative average, bleeding,&#xD;
      re-occuring stomachaches, as well as body temperature above 37.8°C or 100°F. &quot;Pouchitis&quot; is a&#xD;
      term to describe inflammatory changes in the pouch created from the lower part of the ileum.&#xD;
      The patients suffer from high body temperature, stomachaches and watery stools with small&#xD;
      amounts of mucus, blood and soiling. An exam based technique, used in the Precise trials is&#xD;
      the Fistula Drainage Assessment indicating improvement or remission with closure of&#xD;
      individual fistulae defined as no fistula drainage despite gentle finger compression,&#xD;
      improvement defined as a decrease from baseline in the number of open draining fistulae of&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 50 percent for at least 2 consecutive visits (i.e. at least 4&#xD;
      weeks), and remission defined as closure of all fistulae that were draining at baseline for&#xD;
      at least 2 consecutive visits (i.e., at least 4 weeks). However both have not been validated,&#xD;
      and the response levels are usually evaluated several months into treatment. If another&#xD;
      method could provide early assessment / predictors of healing, it could make the decision for&#xD;
      the treatment of the gastroenterologist as well as the patient, easier to determine if they&#xD;
      should continue the biologic or stop. Studies have evaluated the use of endoscopic ultrasound&#xD;
      (EUS) to follow fistula assessment and healing, but none have specifically assessed this in&#xD;
      response to certolizumab treatment. EUS is increasingly used and has been found to be equally&#xD;
      accurate in the evaluation of perianal fistulae compared to MRI of the pelvis. An accurate&#xD;
      assessment and classification of fistulae can facilitate further management including&#xD;
      surgical planning, further medical treatment, or a combination of both. EUS can evaluate for&#xD;
      fistulae as well as abscesses and the relation to the anatomic landmarks of the rectum&#xD;
      including the sphincter muscles as well as adjacent organs such as vagina and the bladder.&#xD;
      EUS has the advantage of being more convenient for the patient than an MRI. An MRI can take a&#xD;
      long duration, can cause anxiety in those that are claustrophobic, and is expensive. EUS is&#xD;
      usually performed with sedation and by the treating physician allowing a more personal&#xD;
      evaluation of the fistula anatomy and correlation of endoscopic mucosal findings. Thus, we&#xD;
      propose to evaluate the use of certolizumab in Crohn's disease patients with peri-anal and&#xD;
      peri-rectal fistulae (an abnormal passage that leads from an abscess or hollow organ or part&#xD;
      to the body surface or from one hollow organ or part to another) and to assess their response&#xD;
      and healing (A perirectal abscess is a collection of pus in the deep tissues surrounding the&#xD;
      anus. Perirectal and perianal abscesses are thought to develop from the glands surrounding&#xD;
      the anus) based on EUS findings. This study can help provide recommendations on fistula&#xD;
      classification of EUS and use this classification to provide EUS - based early predictors of&#xD;
      response of treatment with certolizumab.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Conventional therapy here indicates non-biologic therapy. Study subjects would have&#xD;
             failed conventional and standard regimens of treatment such as immunomodulators&#xD;
             (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate) or mesalamines or corticosteroids.&#xD;
             Certolizumab is actually an approved regimen of treatment for Crohn's disease as&#xD;
             patients with perianal fistulas fall under those with moderately to severely active&#xD;
             disease. It is not an off-label indication, therefore would not require an IND. The&#xD;
             study goal is to look at EUS as a tool to determine how fistula healing occurs with&#xD;
             the use of certolizumab which is one of the biologic therapies used to treat&#xD;
             fistulizing Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease patients with peri-anal or peri-rectal&#xD;
             fistulizing disease. Moderate to severe Crohn's disease patients between the ages of&#xD;
             18 and 70 years with active peri-anal or peri-rectal fistula.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-existing fistula improving on current medical therapy. Contraindication to&#xD;
             certolizumab use. Prior use of anti-TNF-alpha.&#xD;
