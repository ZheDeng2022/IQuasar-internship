  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The virtual requirement that substance abuse programs use evidence-based treatments (EBT) has&#xD;
      prompted the development of dissemination strategies to promote EBT technology transfer.&#xD;
      Implementation research, clinical trial training methods, and clinician training studies&#xD;
      suggest that clinical supervision that involves direct observation, fidelity rating-based&#xD;
      feedback, and coaching of therapeutic skills is a promising dissemination approach. However,&#xD;
      clinical supervision delivered within substance abuse programs by on-site supervisors has&#xD;
      never been directly tested in a randomized controlled trial to determine the impact of&#xD;
      supervision on both clinician EBT skills and client treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent results from two NIDA CTN protocols testing the effectiveness of Motivational&#xD;
      Interviewing (MI) have shown that community program clinicians can learn to deliver MI with&#xD;
      fidelity when receiving MI supervision from their program supervisors after workshop training&#xD;
      and that their implementation of MI early in treatment improves client retention and primary&#xD;
      substance use outcomes. A MI supervision manual called MIA: STEP (Motivational Interviewing&#xD;
      Assessment: Supervisory Tools for Enhancing Proficiency) was developed from these protocols&#xD;
      and has begun to be widely distributed by NIDA in partnership with SAMHSA for community&#xD;
      program use. The effectiveness of the MIA: STEP supervision approach is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will directly test the effectiveness of MIA: STEP supervision on clinician MI&#xD;
      fidelity and on client outcomes by randomly assigning 60 clinicians and 420 substance-using&#xD;
      outpatients from 11 community programs within Connecticut to one of two conditions in which&#xD;
      clinicians in both conditions will deliver a 1-session MI intervention to clients as the&#xD;
      enter treatment. The conditions are: 1) workshop training plus MIA: STEP supervision, and 2)&#xD;
      workshop training alone with supervision-as-usual practices used at each program. This&#xD;
      project will be the first randomized trial to examine the impact of clinical supervision in&#xD;
      an empirically based treatment on both clinician and client outcomes. Moreover, because it&#xD;
      will provide workshop training and supervision completely within the context of community&#xD;
      programs and utilize in-house program supervisors, it will provide a rigorous evaluation of a&#xD;
      feasible model for disseminating EBTs such as MI.&#xD;

    <description>The main outcome for the client participant trial is program retention at 4-week and 12-week followups after having received a 1-session intake. Program retention is defined as the the percent days of program attendances (days attended/# days scheduled) and percent sessions attended (sessions attended/# sessions scheduled) verified by administrative record and interview with clinical staff</description>

    <description>Change in clinician participant motivational interviewing (MI) adherence and competence will be measured from baseline to a post-trial point and from baseline to a 16-week post-trial follow-up point. The timeframe for the trial phase for each clinician participant will vary depending on how long it takes to be assigned and deliver the MI-base intake to 7 client participants.</description>
