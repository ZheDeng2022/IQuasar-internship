  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy is often used to help shrink the cancer temporarily and may improve survival for&#xD;
      patients with incurable pancreas cancer that has spread to other organs. In Canada, the&#xD;
      gemcitabine chemotherapy is used to treat pancreas cancer that has spread. The combination of&#xD;
      oxaliplatin with other chemotherapies, including 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan&#xD;
      has also been studied and has benefit for patients with advanced pancreas cancer. To date,&#xD;
      there is no test that can be done on a patient's tumour to tell if chemotherapy will work in&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer. Human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) has been shown to be&#xD;
      a possible predictor that gemcitabine may or may not work but this needs to be proven in a&#xD;
      randomized study where patients get treated with gemcitabine or a different kind of&#xD;
      chemotherapy while their tumours get tested for hENT1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being done because we want to prove that hENT1 can predict if gemcitabine will&#xD;
      work in advanced pancreas cancer and if it can, we also would like to show that a different&#xD;
      chemotherapy combination called FOLFOX (a combination of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and&#xD;
      oxaliplatin) will be helpful for patients whose tumours don't have hENT1.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-clinical and retrospective clinical data indicates hENT1 may be a predictive and&#xD;
      prognostic biomarker for gemcitabine (Gem) efficacy. To ultimately prove its use as a&#xD;
      biomarker, a prospective randomized study with hENT1 stratification is required. This study&#xD;
      would provide the highest level of confidence, and would, if positive, vault Gem into the&#xD;
      select few anticancer agents for which a truly sensitive population can be rationally&#xD;
      treated. By this &quot;molecular triage&quot;, the risk/benefit ratio of Gem therapy for pancreas&#xD;
      cancer (PC) could be meaningfully improved while also providing rationale for the use of a&#xD;
      different treatment regimen should tumours have low hENT1. The comparator arm of FOLFOX was&#xD;
      chosen because of the recent data showing impressive patient outcomes with the use of&#xD;
      oxaliplatin-based treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, open-label, multicentre, phase III trial in which eligible patients&#xD;
      with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be randomized between Gem and FOLFOX with&#xD;
      predefined upfront testing for hENT1. To be eligible, patients will have to have adequate&#xD;
      tissue available for hENT1 testing which the Cross Cancer Institute (CCI) will ensure prior&#xD;
      to treatment randomization. Patients will have their tumour sample tested for the expression&#xD;
      of hENT1. A blinded pathologist with expertise knowledge and experience with hENT1 staining&#xD;
      at the lead centre (CCI) will be responsible for pathologic hENT1 classification via IHC.&#xD;
      hENT1 IHC will be determined and scored as previously outlined.(1) Once hENT1 status has been&#xD;
      confirmed, patients will then be randomized 1:1 between Gem and FOLFOX. Patients will be&#xD;
      treated on study until disease progression, overwhelming toxicity, or patient withdrawal of&#xD;
      consent. Dose adjustments for one or more of the study drugs will be based on toxicities&#xD;
      encountered by individual patients. Specific dose-adjustment and treatment guidelines for&#xD;
      hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities including neutropenia, diarrhea, renal toxicity,&#xD;
      and neurotoxicity will be outlined in the protocol. Prior to enrolment, screening procedures&#xD;
      will document compliance with inclusion and exclusion criteria. The primary endpoint will be&#xD;
      determination of the difference in PFS in the two study arms, defined from the study start&#xD;
      date until either an increase in the sum of the products of the diameters of measurable&#xD;
      lesions by ≥ 20% bases on revised RECIST guidelines version 1.1 (2), the appearance of any&#xD;
      new lesion, or a deterioration in clinical status that is consistent with disease&#xD;
      progression. Secondary endpoints will be determination of the differences in overall response&#xD;
      rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and overall survival (OS). Administered dose&#xD;
      intensity of Gem and FOLFOX will be reported. Health-related quality of life (HRQL) will be&#xD;
      assessed for the duration of active treatment on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population: The target population is patients with measurable metastatic&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who have not been previously treated with systemic therapy for&#xD;
      their metastatic disease and who have tumour samples amenable to hENT1 testing. Fine needle&#xD;
      aspiration biopsies will not be permitted. Patients who have received prior chemotherapy&#xD;
      delivered as part of initial curative therapy (i.e. neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and/or&#xD;
      concurrently delivered with radiation and/or surgery) are permitted as long as that treatment&#xD;
      was completed at least 6 months prior to study start date. Patients may have received prior&#xD;
      radiotherapy or surgery ≥ 4 weeks before study entry and must have recovered from the toxic&#xD;
      effects from any prior therapy. Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas&#xD;
      will be excluded. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To determine the difference PFS between Gem and FOLFOX treated patients in&#xD;
      hENT1 high and hENT1 low pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: 1) To determine the difference in ORR between the two treatment arms;&#xD;
      2) To determine the rate of disease control, defined as the sum of complete response rate,&#xD;
      partial response rate, and stable disease between the two treatment arms; 3) To determine the&#xD;
      difference in OS between the two treatment arms; 4) To determine the differences in HRQL of&#xD;
      patients on the two treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives: 1) To investigate the role of hCNT3 and its interaction with&#xD;
      hENT1-related patient outcomes. 2) To evaluate excision repair cross complementing 1 (ERCC1)&#xD;
      and microsatellite instability (MSI) in tumour samples, both of which are increasingly being&#xD;
      linked to efficacy in oxaliplatin-based therapy but for which information in PC is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Treatment: Treatment will continue until objective or symptomatic disease&#xD;
      progression, overwhelming toxicity, or patient withdrawal of consent. A patient may continue&#xD;
      to receive all or any combination of study drugs for as long as the investigator feels is&#xD;
      appropriate, but will be discontinued from study in case of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Clinical and/or radiological documented disease progression (as determined by revised&#xD;
      RECIST 1.1 criteria).(2) All drugs will be discontinued and the patient removed from study;&#xD;
      2) Occurrence of unacceptable toxicity (this may be due to one or more drugs resulting in one&#xD;
      or more study drug discontinuation); if all three drugs are discontinued the patient will be&#xD;
      removed from study; 3) Failure to recover from hematologic and/or non-hematologic toxicity to&#xD;
      re-treatment level despite dosing interruption of up to 28 days (this may be due to one or&#xD;
      more study drugs resulting in one or more study drug discontinuation); if all drugs in&#xD;
      regimen are discontinued the patient will be removed from study; 4) Patient's request&#xD;
      (withdrawal of consent) or Investigator's recommendation (this may be one or more study&#xD;
      drugs); if all three study drugs are discontinued patient will be removed from study; 5)&#xD;
      Patient death (complete Serious Adverse Event Report for deaths occurring within 30 days&#xD;
      after last study drug dose OR for deaths occurring after 30 days, only if considered related&#xD;
      to study drug).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Endpoints: Response assessments will be performed every 8 weeks, regardless of&#xD;
      treatment cycle. History, physical exam, laboratory work, imaging, ECOG performance status&#xD;
      (PS), will be required at each response assessment. PS will be measured using the ECOG&#xD;
      performance status scale. Tumor marker (CA19-9) may be followed at the discretion of the&#xD;
      investigator but should not be used in determination of disease response and are not a&#xD;
      requirement of the study. Tumor response will be evaluated according to the revised RECIST&#xD;
      criteria 1.1.(2) Symptomatic progression will be defined as new or worsening disease symptoms&#xD;
      deemed by the treating oncologist to incompatible with continuation of study medication or&#xD;
      the requirement for palliative radiation therapy or a fall in ECOG performance status to ≥ 3&#xD;
      deemed to be due to disease and not study treatment. Should symptomatic progression occur,&#xD;
      imaging to confirm progression is advised but if not possible due to performance status, the&#xD;
      study stop date will be recorded as the date of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: The NCI CTCAE (version 4.0) will be used to evaluate the clinical safety of the&#xD;
      treatment in this study. Subjects will be assessed for adverse events at each clinical visit&#xD;
      and as necessary throughout the study. Safety will be assessed via vital signs, physical&#xD;
      exams, laboratory tests (including hematologic, serum chemistry, and liver function testing),&#xD;
      and adverse event determination. Pregnant and nursing females will be excluded from&#xD;
      participation in the trial.&#xD;
