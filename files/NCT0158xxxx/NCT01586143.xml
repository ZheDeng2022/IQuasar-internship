      This is a clinical study that aims to investigate and compare the efficacy of transbuccal&#xD;
      paracetamol 125 mg with that of paracetamol 1g administered intravenously in patients with&#xD;
      acute pain of moderate intensity accepted to emergency room following a minor trauma of the&#xD;
      lower limbs and/or superiors. To this end, several pain scoring will be performed using a&#xD;
      visual analogue scale (VAS) at various times after drug administration.&#xD;
