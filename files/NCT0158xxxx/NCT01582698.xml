    <description>Blood will be drawn to assess the seropersistence of TBE virus antibodies at 82, 94, 106 and 118 months after the first booster vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.5ml administered during the first precursor study. Timing of the second booster vaccination will depend on the level of serum TBE antibodies observed during the study. Blood will be drawn 21 - 35 days after vaccination to assess the booster response.</description>
