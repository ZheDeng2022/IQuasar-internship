    <textblock>
      As individuals age, they undergo transitions in many aspects of their lives. These&#xD;
      transitions include social, economic and health transitions. People review their lives, and&#xD;
      reflect on past choices. Future time is limited by the increasing proximity to end of life.&#xD;
      This may lead to regrets and, in people with the ability to use compensatory mechanisms, a&#xD;
      redoubling of efforts to achieve valued goals or a reprioritization of valued goals. In the&#xD;
      context of aging, individuals' past, present, and future-oriented subjective well-being (SWB)&#xD;
      may change. There is an incomplete understanding of the relationship of SWB, intra- and&#xD;
      inter-personal resources, and outcomes, (particularly health and healthcare-cost outcomes).&#xD;
      These issues have complicated the use of SWB measures and the investigators are left with&#xD;
      traditional metrics such as life expectancy, infant mortality, wealth, and poverty to assess&#xD;
      healthy aging, resulting in an incomplete picture of healthy aging. This project will examine&#xD;
      the relationships among SWB, intra- and inter-personal resources, and health and&#xD;
      healthcare-cost outcomes. It will advance the understanding of SWB and its role in healthy&#xD;
      aging in order to assist policy makers in valuing the potential benefits of improving SWB on&#xD;
      health and healthcare costs. The investigators will accomplish this through the following&#xD;
      specific aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine how SWB (past, present, and future-oriented): (1) is affected by life&#xD;
      transitions, and (2) affects outcomes after life transitions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Aim: To determine how Subjective Well-Being (SWB; past, present, and future-oriented): (1) is&#xD;
      affected by life transitions, and (2) affects outcomes after life transitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Social, economic, and health transitions are common in aging populations.&#xD;
      Adaptation to these transitions likely impacts SWB and therefore may alter subsequent health&#xD;
      and healthcare-cost outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: Negative life transitions will negatively impact assessments of present and&#xD;
      future-oriented SWB and result in worse health and healthcare-cost outcomes. More positive&#xD;
      intra- and inter-personal resources will lessen this impact. Having better present or&#xD;
      future-oriented SWB will diminish the impact of the transition on health and healthcare-cost&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach: Investigators will establish an observational cohort of adults aged 50 and older&#xD;
      (n=600) seen in the same primary care practice stratified by gender, race, and SWB.&#xD;
      Investigators will collect information at baseline and each of two annual follow-up&#xD;
      assessments regarding SWB, intra- and inter-personal resources, and outcomes. Investigators&#xD;
      will compare those who experience life transitions to those who do not in terms of their&#xD;
      changes in the temporal perspectives of SWB, health, and healthcare-cost outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The successful completion of this project will disentangle temporal perspectives in SWB,&#xD;
      further the understanding of the impact of aging and life transitions on SWB, relate&#xD;
      individuals' SWB to health and healthcare-cost outcomes, and clarify the relationship of&#xD;
      experienced SWB to evaluative SWB, all within the context of intra- and inter-personal&#xD;
      resources. It will enable researchers, clinicians, and policy makers to better use SWB as a&#xD;
      metric assessing the health and welfare of individuals and societies. The study population is&#xD;
      primarily older adults from a primary care practice, University of Pittsburgh's General&#xD;
      Internal Medicine Oakland (GIMO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To determine how SWB (past, present, and future-oriented): 1) is affected by life&#xD;
      transitions and 2) affects outcomes after life transitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C.2.a. Overview of the Aim Social, economic, and health transitions, commonly occur in aging&#xD;
      populations. Adaptation to these transitions likely impacts SWB and subsequent health and&#xD;
      healthcare-cost outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will enroll a purposive sample (n=600) of adults aged 50 and older seen at the&#xD;
      GIMO primary care practice. Investigators will collect information at baseline and each of&#xD;
      two annual follow-up assessments regarding SWB, intra- and inter-personal resources and&#xD;
      outcomes. Investigators will compare those who experience life transitions to those who do&#xD;
      not in terms of their changes in temporally-oriented SWB and health and healthcare-cost&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures In addition to basic demographics including age, gender, ethnicity, race,&#xD;
      educational attainment, marital status, and employment status, investigators will collect&#xD;
      data described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective Well-Being. Investigators will use the temporal measure of SWB by Pavot, Deiner,&#xD;
      and Suh8 which includes 15 items-5 representing each of past, present, and future-oriented&#xD;
      SWB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra- and inter-personal resources. These constructs were selected because they are&#xD;
      important to the understanding of SWB and the relationships between SWB and the outcomes&#xD;
      tested in our model. Each instrument has been related to health outcomes, healthcare-cost&#xD;
      outcomes, SWB, and/or health-related quality of life in prior work and key citations are&#xD;
      provided. Bringing together such a comprehensive assessment battery to understand&#xD;
      temporally-oriented SWB and its relationship to these measures and outcomes, the impact of&#xD;
      transitions on these relationships, and the relationship of experiences and experienced SWB&#xD;
      to evaluative SWB, as proposed in the current project, is necessary to advance the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of transitions. Separate groups will be defined for those who undergo, or do not&#xD;
      undergo, three broad categories of transitions: social, economic, and health, or any of the&#xD;
      three transitions; individuals may have more than one type transition. In addition to &quot;any&quot;&#xD;
      transition, each transition type will be analyzed separately. As described in the&#xD;
      significance section, investigators have found that these transitions are common in older&#xD;
      adults. Participants will complete items from the Life Events Scale at each time-point.&#xD;
      Investigators will use MARS and EpicCare to identify any new health conditions (based on&#xD;
      additions to the problem list or past medical history) supplement the identification of&#xD;
      health transitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health and healthcare costs. Investigators will use health and healthcare costs to assess the&#xD;
      predictive validity of our measure in the Primary care sample. Health and healthcare-cost&#xD;
      measures will be obtained from both the using the Medical Archival System (MARS)43 and the&#xD;
      EpicCare electronic medical record (EMR). MARS data include all patients seen at the&#xD;
      University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's (UPMC) twenty hospitals, four long-term care&#xD;
      facilities, and 350 physician offices and outpatient clinics. The MARS repository houses 209&#xD;
      million clinical reports, 460 million financial transactions, and patient demographic&#xD;
      information. EpicCare, GIMO's EMR, electronically contains all information required in a&#xD;
      traditional paper medical record. All documentation (including past medical history), orders,&#xD;
      and results are captured. Any paper result, for example laboratory testing done out of state,&#xD;
      is abstracted as discrete data items into EpicCare. The primary measure will be healthcare&#xD;
      costs. Cost outcomes, from MARS and EpicCare, will include the total healthcare charges&#xD;
      documented within the UPMC system (including outpatient prescription medications at the&#xD;
      average retail cost) in the year following the assessment. As the largest provider of care in&#xD;
      Western Pennsylvania, UPMC delivers the vast majority of care received by GIMO patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why use costs as the primary measure in this sample? Healthcare costs provide a relatively&#xD;
      simple summary of overall care intensity across people with a variety of health concerns and&#xD;
      is particularly relevant to health policy. It is broadly applicable and is responsive to this&#xD;
      request for applications. Two alternative endpoints are diagnosis of a new medical condition&#xD;
      or disease management process measures. Based on our prior experience, we expect the majority&#xD;
      of participants to develop new medical conditions, so treating a new diagnosis as the primary&#xD;
      measure would give minimal variation in the measure and would limit our ability to see a&#xD;
      difference based on temporally associated SWB. GIMO's clinical variety makes disease&#xD;
      management process measures an impractical primary measure. Investigators have chosen to&#xD;
      examine two common primary care conditions, diabetes and coronary artery disease, that&#xD;
      require both patient and physician participation in management as a secondary measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary health measures will include (1) number of new diagnoses developed, (2)&#xD;
      hospitalization (yes or no) and, among those hospitalized, length of stay, and (3) disease&#xD;
      management over one year. Investigators will track the development of the following&#xD;
      conditions identified by Verbrugge and Patrick: arthritis, visual impairment, hearing&#xD;
      impairment, ischemic heart disease, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, and malignant neoplasm.42 A diagnosis will be considered new if it is used&#xD;
      as a billing diagnosis and has not been used previously as a billing diagnosis or listed on&#xD;
      the problem list or past medical history. Because all participants will have been seen in the&#xD;
      past at GIMO we will be able to easily differentiate new from previously existing diagnoses.&#xD;
      Hospitalization will be defined as admission to one of twenty UPMC medical or psychiatric&#xD;
      hospitals and length of stay. Disease management will be based on percent of fulfilled&#xD;
      quality metrics (total number of metrics fulfilled, divided by the total number of metrics)&#xD;
      defined by NCQA44 and used as quality measures in GIMO.&#xD;
