  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the Netherlands a 2 center investigator-driven phase I/II clinical trial is initiated in&#xD;
      June 2010 testing the oncolytic adenovirus Delta24-RGD to treat glioblastoma patients. The&#xD;
      virus is administrated using convection-enhanced delivery by 4 catheters as delivery&#xD;
      technique, targeting solid tumor as well as infiltrated tumor cells within the peri-tumoral&#xD;
      brain. Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3 per dose-level. The dose levels to be&#xD;
      explored are: 10^7, 10^8, 10^9, 10^10, 3*10^10 and 10^11 viral particles (vp). Once the MTD&#xD;
      has been determined, or the study has reached the highest dose cohort, a further 6 or 9&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled at the MTD and evaluated for safety and preliminary signs of&#xD;
      efficacy, such that in total at least 12 patients have received the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of Delta-24-RGD&#xD;
      administered by CED to the tumor and the surrounding infiltrated brain in patients with&#xD;
      recurrent GBM. Secondary objectives are to determine the Progression Free Survival (PFS),&#xD;
      Overall Survival (OS), and tumor response rate in patients with recurring tumors amenable for&#xD;
      surgical resection and treated at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebrospinal fluid as well as brain interstitial fluid by microdialysis next to the&#xD;
      routinely collected samples of blood at various timepoints before, during and after virus&#xD;
      infusion. Various neurodegenerative biomarkers as well as markers of immune response will be&#xD;
      assessed in these samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore extensive sampling and PCR analyses will be performed to evaluate distribution&#xD;
      and shedding of the virus.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with histologically proven primary Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) will be&#xD;
             eligible for this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must show unequivocal evidence for tumor recurrence or progression by MRI&#xD;
             scan within 3 weeks prior to registration after failing prior resection (surgery or&#xD;
             biopsy) and/ or chemo- and/or radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Recurring tumors must either be accessible for surgery, or , when not accessible for&#xD;
             surgery meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. unifocal&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. midline shift &lt; 0.5 cm&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. no radiological signs of uncal herniation&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. All recurring tumors must be restricted to one hemisphere, without signs of&#xD;
             subependymal spreading.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Before start of virus treatment histological analysis of the resected, or biopsied&#xD;
             tumor recurrence must confirm the diagnosis of GBM (based on frozen section).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients may or may not have had prior chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must be able to read and understand the informed consent document and must&#xD;
             sign and date the informed consent. Procedures to obtain such informed consent should&#xD;
             be according to ICH-GCP, the local regulatory requirement and the rules followed at&#xD;
             the institute.&#xD;

             completion of this study protocol, e.g. uncontrolled seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Because of the potential risk of a recombinant virus containing a gene involved in&#xD;
             cellular growth regulation and differentiation which could potentially affect a&#xD;
