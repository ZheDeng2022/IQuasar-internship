  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Screening tests for Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC) [also called Lynch&#xD;
      Syndrome], are among the few available validated genetic tests that have been recommended as&#xD;
      an evidence-based practice that can save lives. However, more than half of patients who meet&#xD;
      well-established and accepted screening criteria do not receive screening. This is a critical&#xD;
      failure for patients and for the health-care delivery system because HNPCC mutation carriers&#xD;
      are at exceptionally high risk for colorectal and other HNPCC-related cancers, and because&#xD;
      clinical strategies can prevent future cancers, or provide early detection, for individuals&#xD;
      affected with HNPCC and their relatives. HNPCC testing is also cost-effective compared to&#xD;
      treating individuals with a diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this shortfall in practice, our proposed research mobilizes the resources of an&#xD;
      integrated health-delivery system with extensive electronic clinical data to implement and&#xD;
      evaluate a new strategy to maximize screening of CRC patients for HPNCC. The Evaluation of&#xD;
      Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention (EGAPP) working group recommended that all&#xD;
      newly diagnosed CRC patients be screened for HPNCC, but was not able to recommend a&#xD;
      best-strategy to accomplish this aim. Therefore, using the Practical Robust Implementation&#xD;
      and Sustainability Model (PRISM), developed by one of our co-investigators, to guide the&#xD;
      analyses, the investigators will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #1: Conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of a universal&#xD;
      laboratory test-based HNPCC screening program compared to the current practice of physician&#xD;
      referral and self-referral.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #2: Elucidate patient, provider, and system factors important to success of&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #3: (revised and approved during year 1): To create, refine, and disseminate an&#xD;
      implementation guide for HNPCC screening by combining the results from Aims 1-2 and the&#xD;
      perspectives from informant interviews of key staff at future diverse&#xD;
      dissemination-implementation sites: Case Western Reserve University, Oregon Health &amp; Sciences&#xD;
      University, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Kaiser Permanente&#xD;
      Georgia, Kaiser Permanente Hawaii, and Safety Net West Clinics. Addition to Aim 3: We will&#xD;
      contribute materials to the LSSN website for dissemination of implementation materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate implementation of a novel HNPCC screening program and assess, for&#xD;
      all stakeholders, facilitators and barriers to program implementation and success. Results&#xD;
      from this study will help achieve the Healthy People 2020 objective of reducing CRC&#xD;
      mortality. It will add to the growing literature in the increasingly important area of&#xD;
      translating research findings into real-world practice, a subject of the NIH Roadmap. Many of&#xD;
      the findings will be useful in other clinical areas and will be broadly applicable to other&#xD;
      health care organizations aiming to improve access to genetic tests for cancers.&#xD;
