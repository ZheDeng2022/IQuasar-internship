      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of GL-ONC1 administered&#xD;
      intravenously in combination with radiation therapy and cisplatin (CDDP)in patients with&#xD;
      locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GL-ONC1, an oncolytic vaccinia virus, has shown the ability to preferentially locate,&#xD;
      colonize and destroy tumor cells in more than 40 different human tumors. A First-in-Man,&#xD;
      Phase I clinical study focusing on the safety and tolerability of GL-ONC1 intravenously&#xD;
      administered to patients with a variety of advanced solid tumor entities has shown that&#xD;
      GL-ONC1 is well-tolerated at therapeutic dose levels, with documented evidence of antitumor&#xD;
      activity. Preclinical studies have further shown synergistic effects with the use of&#xD;
      chemotherapy (Cisplatin) and viral therapy with GL-ONC, as well as favorable results when&#xD;
      cancer cells are irradiated and then treated with GL-ONC1 in animal models. This Phase I&#xD;
      study seeks to evaluate the safety, tolerability and early signs of efficacy of GL-ONC1&#xD;
      administered intravenously in combination with standard of care (SOC) radiation therapy (RT)&#xD;
      and cisplatin (CDDP)in patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer. Patients&#xD;
      will be individually assessed for safety and dose limiting toxicity. Viral colonization in&#xD;
      tumors, replication and anti-tumoral activity will also be evaluated.&#xD;
