      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal transplant recipients have a greater risk of morbidity and mortality primarily due to&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease when compared to the general population. Cardiovascular disease is&#xD;
      responsible for 50% to 60% percent of deaths amongst renal transplant population and death&#xD;
      from cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of functioning graft loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity is an effective form of secondary prevention in existing cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease reducing all-cause mortality by 25%-30% and has demonstrated positive effects overall&#xD;
      on quality of life and well-being. Transplant patients who participated in regular&#xD;
      cardiovascular exercise have significant more positive scores on the SF-36 Health Status&#xD;
      Questionnaire in comparison to inactive transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active video gaming is evolving as an innovative method to increase physical activity. Active&#xD;
      video gaming has supported physical activity in children and youth. There is however a&#xD;
      paucity of literature examining interactive games as a means to facilitate physical activity&#xD;
      and its impact on CVD and quality of life in the adult population nor any literature&#xD;
      examining AVG and its impact on an adult surgical population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study is designed to determine if Active Video Gaming is feasible and is able to&#xD;
      lead to behavioral modifications and Quality of Life improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study during which 10 patients who have undergone renal transplant will be&#xD;
      selected to exercise with Active Video Gaming for a duration of 3 months. The program&#xD;
      activity will begin 6 months post surgery.&#xD;
