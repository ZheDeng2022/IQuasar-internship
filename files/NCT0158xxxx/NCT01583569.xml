  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complex Dynamic Systems in Mood Disorders is an observational, exploratory study of the&#xD;
      relationship between voice samples, heart rate, respiration, movement, galvanic skin&#xD;
      conductance, and sleep architecture with mood states in patients with Major Depressive&#xD;
      Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, and healthy controls. The overall hypothesis is that nonlinear&#xD;
      dynamic analyses will be able to reveal hidden patterns of complexity in each domain of&#xD;
      voice, heart rate variability, movement, arousal, and sleep stage data.&#xD;

      Aim 1: To assess multichannel physiologic measures associated with mood disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The overall hypothesis is that nonlinear dynamic analyses will be able to reveal&#xD;
      hidden patterns of complexity in each domain of voice, heart rate variability (RR intervals),&#xD;
      movement, arousal, and sleep stage data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To assess differences in patterns and complexity of multiple physiological measures in&#xD;
      patients with MDD compared to healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: MDD will be associated with decreased measures of complexity and increased&#xD;
      measures of approximate entropy compared to healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To assess differences in patterns and complexity of multiple physiologic measures in&#xD;
      patients with BD compared to healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: BD will be associated with decreased measures of complexity and increased&#xD;
      measures of approximate entropy compared to healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To assess changes in patterns and complexity of multiple physiologic measures at&#xD;
      baseline and after 2 weeks of treatment for patients with MDD and BD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Measures of complexity will increase and measures of approximate entropy will&#xD;
      decrease in the first two weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 5: To assess the relationship between changes in patterns and complexity of multiple&#xD;
      physiologic measures and changes in mood state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Measures of complexity will increase and measures of approximate entropy will&#xD;
      decrease, especially for those who are much or very much improved&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 and &lt; 65.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meet DSM-IV criteria for MDD (n=5), BD (n=5), or healthy controls with no psychiatric&#xD;
             diagnosis (n=5).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to wear a wearable device to measure sleep parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to provide voice samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with MDD must not be taking psychiatric medications at the time of&#xD;
             evaluation.Subjects with BD can be taking psychiatric medications, since it is not&#xD;
             feasible for patients with BD to be completely free of mood stabilizing medications.&#xD;
             These medications will be limited to lithium, second generation antipsychotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently a patient or research participant at the DCRP or the BCRP or are healthy&#xD;
             controls enrolled in evaluation studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary sleep disorder, including restless legs syndrome, difficulties in initiating&#xD;
             and maintaining sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Movement disorders (e.g. Parkinson's, Huntington's, tardive dyskinesia, primary&#xD;
             chorea).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active substance abuse or dependence in the past 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, including uncontrolled hypertension, arrhythmias,&#xD;
             history of myocardial infarction, asthma, COPD, or pulmonary carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiovascular or pulmonary medications (aspirin and statins are allowable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anticonvulsants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sedative/hypnotics (e.g. benzodiazepines, eczopiclone).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy.&#xD;
