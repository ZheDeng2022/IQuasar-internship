  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is about a drug called enoxaparin which is used to prevent or treat blood clots.&#xD;
      There are no studies about the use of this drug in obese adolescents and yet the&#xD;
      investigators use it to prevent clots when they have surgery at Children's National for&#xD;
      weight loss. The investigators hypothesis is that the obesity leads to increased kidney size&#xD;
      and faster drug clearance. Therefore the investigators think they might be underdosing these&#xD;
      adolescents. This study will check the drug levels at different points after the drug dose to&#xD;
      see whether the investigators are achieving the expected levels for prevention of clots.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Enoxaparin is the drug of choice for prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE)&#xD;
      in children and adults. A major concern with any antithrombotic therapy is an increased risk&#xD;
      of hemorrhage. There are not many concrete data published for enoxaparin use in children and&#xD;
      adolescents, and absolutely no guidance is available for (morbidly) obese children and&#xD;
      adolescents as they are not included in clinical trials during the clinical phases of drug&#xD;
      development. Physicians often find themselves puzzled when selecting a dose for obese&#xD;
      children. This study aims to find the optimal way to dose enoxaparin in (morbidly) obese&#xD;
      children and adolescents that will result in a safe and effective use of this drug as&#xD;
      prophylaxis during bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimum therapeutic/preventive dose of a drug depends on its pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic properties. Both these processes can be affected by body composition and the&#xD;
      physiological changes that occur in obese children. Obesity not only increases the total fat&#xD;
      amount, but also the lean body mass. However, the percentage of fat tissue increases more&#xD;
      than the lean body mass. Obesity as a disease state is also associated with changes in plasma&#xD;
      protein constituents, decreases in tissue perfusion; and increases in adipose tissue mass,&#xD;
      lean body mass, cardiac output, and splanchnic blood flow, as compared with normal-weight&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High BMI is believed be an independent risk factor for VTE. Therefore, obese adolescents are&#xD;
      also being prescribed prophylactic doses of enoxaparin in situations where there is risk of&#xD;
      VTE. The 2008 recommended guidelines by the American College of Chest Physicians does not&#xD;
      mention any type of dosing considerations of anticoagulants in obese children. However, it&#xD;
      states that higher than usual doses be used in adult patients undergoing bariatric surgery.&#xD;
      The use of enoxaparin is not approved for children but is being used widely for the&#xD;
      prophylaxis and treatment of VTE in a wide variety of settings in children of all age groups.&#xD;
      There are very limited number of studies that involve enoxaparin use in children. Out of&#xD;
      these most of the data are available for the use of enoxaparin for the treatment of VTE and&#xD;
      not prophylaxis of VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown several age related physiologic differences between pediatric and adult&#xD;
      patients. Neonates exhibit an accelerated clearance rate and a larger volume of distribution&#xD;
      as compared with adults. Children treated for malignancy required higher doses compared to&#xD;
      adults. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies that have included children do not provide&#xD;
      specific data on different age groups. Further more, the sample size is very small and mostly&#xD;
      involve patients that were treated for VTE or thrombophilia. There is no information&#xD;
      specifying dosing for prophylactic therapy.&#xD;

        A total of 12 patients will be enrolled. The population for this study will include both&#xD;
        male and female adolescent patients from all ethnic backgrounds with BMI greater than or&#xD;
        equal to 95 percentile. Each patient will receive enoxaparin SC q 12 hours. The blood&#xD;
        samples for the study would be taken prior to the second dose.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The research participant will be a Children's National Medical Center (CNMC) patient&#xD;
             admitted for bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The age ranges will be between 12 and 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. All racial and ethnic groups will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The Body Mass Index (BMI) will be calculated using height and weight and will include&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 95th percentile. At our bariatric center the minimum BMI is&#xD;
             35 to qualify for surgical intervention for weight loss. In other words, all patients&#xD;
             having bariatric surgery will be eligible for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Informed consent and assent will be obtained prior to each investigation from the&#xD;
             patients' parents and when legally appropriate from the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. This is a non-interventional study and patients would be routinely screened for&#xD;
             history of bleeding disorders or at risk of bleeding as a part of standard complete&#xD;
             history and exam. As a standard, patients receiving platelet inhibitors including&#xD;
             acetylsalicylic acid, salicylates, Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)&#xD;
             (including ketorolac tromethamine), dipyridamole, or sulfinpyrazone would be closely&#xD;
             monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any patient with prior dosing with enoxaparin or any other anticoagulant within the&#xD;
             past 24 hours would be excluded.&#xD;
