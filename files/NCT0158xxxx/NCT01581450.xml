  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluation of the effects of 35%/15%/50% N2O/N2/O2 mixtures on the area of hyperalgesia&#xD;
      induced by remifentanil in the CCES (Continuous Cutaneous Electrical Stimulation) model in 20&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of participation for each volunteer is expected to be around 9 weeks with the&#xD;
      performance of 4 experimental session 2 weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selection visit will last half a day; each experimental session will last half a day; the&#xD;
      study end will last 2 hours maximum.&#xD;

      Single site, exploratory, comparative, double-blind, randomised, cross-over study. Three&#xD;
      physicians will be involved in the conduct of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physician 1 will include and randomise the subjects, prepare and administer the study&#xD;
           products (namely Investigational Medicinal Products (IMPs)) in an open manner and will&#xD;
           assess subject safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physician 2, kept IMP blinded, will perform all evaluation measurements and sedation&#xD;
           assessments during all experimental sessions. Physician 2 will always be the same person&#xD;
           throughout the whole study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physician 3 will be available if needed to reinforce subject safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A group of 20 assessable subjects who will undergo 4 randomised experimental sessions&#xD;
      of CCES on 4 separate study days, 2 weeks apart preceded by a 2 week period between selection&#xD;
      and first experimental session and followed by a 1 week period between last experimental&#xD;
      session and study end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the selection visit, each visit corresponds to one of the 4 experimental sessions named&#xD;
      A, B, C, D differing by the gas mixture inhaled and the intravenous medicine administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The order of these experimental sessions A, B, C, D, will be assigned according to a&#xD;
      pre-established list that the investigator will not know.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each experimental session includes a set-up-phase followed by an evaluation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The set up phase will last 20 mn during each an electrical stimulation will generate a&#xD;
      spontaneous pain: every 2 minutes the electrical stimulation will increase and the subject&#xD;
      will be asked to rate the pain on a visual scale from 0 to 100. When a stable levels of pain&#xD;
      intensity will be reached, the regimen of the electrical stimulation will be kept constant up&#xD;
      to the end of the experimental session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Evaluation phase will last 160 mn : the electrical stimulation will be constant during&#xD;
      160 mn as detailed above. During this phase the subject will inhale a gas mixture with a face&#xD;
      mask during 60 minutes combined with an intravenous administration of medicine during 30 mn&#xD;
      starting at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 5 minutes the subject will be asked to rate the pain and at predefined times the&#xD;
      spontaneous pain and the area of allodynia and hyperalgesia will be measured and recorded as&#xD;
      well as safety parameters (transcutaneous oxygen saturation, respiratory parameters, sedation&#xD;
      score, blood pressure and heart rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 4 experimental sessions named A, B, C, D differ by the gas mixture inhaled and the&#xD;
      intravenous medicine administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the placebo session, inhaled gas mixture will be 50%/50% N2/O2 and intravenous&#xD;
      administration will be an isotonic saline solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the three other sessions, inhaled gas mixture will differ from a session to the other one&#xD;
      (35%/15%/50% N2O/N2/O2 or 50%/50% N2/O2 or 50%/50% N2O/O2), and remifentanil will be&#xD;
      administered intravenously at each of these sessions.&#xD;
