  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quetiapine is one of atypical antipsychotics with good efficacy and better side effect&#xD;
      profiles than conventional antipsychotics, so it is being widely used beyond the treatment of&#xD;
      schizophrenia. Recently, the BOLDER I and II study showed that quetiapine monotherapy is an&#xD;
      effective and well-tolerated treatment for depressive episodes in bipolar disorder. However,&#xD;
      most c1inicians did not have confidence with quetiapine monotherapy yet, and most practice&#xD;
      guidelines recommend the monotherapy with mood stabilizer as the first-line treatment. The&#xD;
      Korean medication algorithm for bipolar disorder published in 2006 also recommend the&#xD;
      monotherapy with lithium, divalproex, or lamotrigine in the treatment of mild to moderate&#xD;
      depressive episode of bipolar disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is investigating the efficacy and safety of quetiapine&#xD;
      monotherapy when compared with mood stabilizer monotherapy. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      are going to reveal the quality of sleep and quality of life, of the two groups of patients.&#xD;
