  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The timing and quality of sleep is governed by environmental and physiologic factors.&#xD;
      Environmental factors, especially ambient lighting can impact the circadian system and alter&#xD;
      the timing and structure of sleep. Light exposure can also acutely alter neural activation&#xD;
      state and impair sleep. These effects all demonstrate marked sensitivity to short-wavelength&#xD;
      blue light with maximal sensitivity in the 460-480 nm range. The alerting effects of blue&#xD;
      light in the evening persist for at least 3-4 hours after the lights are turned off, and can&#xD;
      disturb subsequent sleep. Avoiding these deleterious effects of light exposure prior to sleep&#xD;
      on subsequent sleep would be beneficial to sleep quality and potentially health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare the effects of two light sources, equated for visual stimulus&#xD;
      (lux), on multiple non-visual responses to light. The investigators will compare a 90 lux&#xD;
      exposure of a commercially available Compact Fluorescent Light (CFL) with a novel LED white&#xD;
      light source that is depleted in the short-wavelength visible range (Biological Illumination&#xD;
      LCC, FL). In a within-subject design, the investigators will test the hypotheses that&#xD;
      exposure to a blue-depleted LED as compared to a CFL exposure at (1) 90 lux or (2) 50 lux&#xD;
      will cause significantly:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Less melatonin suppression between melatonin onset and bedtime;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Less subjective and objective alerting responses before bedtime;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Less disruption of nocturnal sleep structure and quality.&#xD;

    <measure>Melatonin Suppression</measure>
    <time_frame>6-h constant posture interval of the light exposure</time_frame>
    <description>Melatonin suppression is measured as the percentage of melatonin AUC relative to the AUC measured in dim light on the previous day. AUC was calculated during the 6 h of light exposure and the corresponding 6-h interval 24 hours earlier. Higher values indicate more light-induced melatonin suppression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Structure</measure>
    <time_frame>8-h time in bed immediately following CFL/LED light exposure.</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep efficiency assessed by polysomnography. Sleep efficiency refers to the percentage of time a person sleeps, in relation to the amount of time a person spends in bed trying to sleep. The percentage is calculated by dividing the Total Sleep Time by the Total Time in Bed.</description>

    <measure>Sleep Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>First morning after 8-h time in bed immediately following CFL/LED light exposure.</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported sleep quality was assessed using a post sleep questionnaire. Score on subjective scale range 1-7, higher scores indicate higher sleep quality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Alerting Response</measure>
    <time_frame>6-h constant posture interval of the light exposure.</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported sleepiness measured during the light exposure using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Range of scores 1-9, higher score indicate higher subjective sleepiness. Measures were taken hourly throughout the 6-hour constant posture interval of the light exposure and then averaged to calculate a single value per participant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Alerting Response</measure>
    <time_frame>6-h constant posture interval of the light exposure</time_frame>
    <description>Mean reaction time assessed using the 10-minute psychomotor vigilance test. Higher numbers indicate slower reaction times indicating less alertness. Measures were taken hourly throughout the 6-hour constant posture interval of the light exposure and then averaged to calculate a single value per participant.</description>
