  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A life threatening disease such as cancer may lead to post traumatic stress disorder, and&#xD;
      even when reporting low levels of side-effects from cancer disease and treatment, 80% report&#xD;
      high levels of stress symptoms. The purpose of the present randomised controlled trial is to&#xD;
      examine the psychosocial effects of a stress management intervention based on cognitive&#xD;
      behaviour therapy and with focus on increased physical activity in patients with various&#xD;
      cancer diagnoses using a stepped-care approach. When using a stepped-care approach it is&#xD;
      possible to study the level and intensity of stress management intervention required to&#xD;
      achieve increased well-being. A cost-utility analysis will also be performed. 300 adult&#xD;
      patients with a recent diagnosis of breast-, colorectal- prostate, testicular cancer or&#xD;
      lymphoma and scheduled for adjuvant and/or curative oncologic treatment at Haukeland&#xD;
      University Hospital, will be consecutively included in the prospective intervention study.&#xD;
      The patients will be randomized to intervention or control. In step 1, all patients in the&#xD;
      intervention group (I-a) will receive 2 counselling sessions. Patients who report clinically&#xD;
      significant levels of stress, such as intrusive thoughts/avoidance behaviour (measured by&#xD;
      Impact of Event Scale) and/or worry and depressions (measured by Hospital and Depression&#xD;
      Scale) will be included in Step 2 (I-b) and include another 4-7 counselling sessions. There&#xD;
      will also be a focus on motivating to increase physical activity level. Both the intervention&#xD;
      (I) and control group (C) are allowed to take part in the common rehabilitation program with&#xD;
      patient education and physical training. Data will be collected with self-reported&#xD;
      standardized questionnaires. Objectively measures of physical activity level, sleep and daily&#xD;
      energy expenditure are recorded with SenseWearâ„¢ Pro3 Armband. Measure point is at inclusion&#xD;
      and than after 6 week, 4, 8, 12 and 24 month.&#xD;
