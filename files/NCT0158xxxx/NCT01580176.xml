  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be the first study in which the new central venous microdialysis-based&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitoring system (Continuous GlucoseMonitor) is used to investigate the&#xD;
      performance of this Continuous GlucoseMonitor, as the measurements will be compared with a&#xD;
      point of care reference (RAPIDLab速 1265 blood gas analyser). Further important points are&#xD;
      also much less blood samplings / blood loss for the patient and personnel costs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current standard for measuring blood glucose concentrations on ICU is to manually draw a&#xD;
      blood sample from an arterial catheter and analyse the sample using a point of care blood gas&#xD;
      analyser. This technique has several disadvantages as causes considerable blood loss and does&#xD;
      not produce a continuous blood glucose profile and it is labour intensive (multiple samples&#xD;
      over time are needed to follow the changes in blood glucose concentration). The monitoring&#xD;
      system (Continuous GlucoseMonitor) based on the microdialysis technique has the advantage&#xD;
      that not blood, but a physiological fluid such as saline is used as test medium. In brief, a&#xD;
      physiological fluid, called the perfusate is continuously perfused through the microdialysis&#xD;
      probe. At the membrane of the probe, glucose (as other low-molecular weight molecules)&#xD;
      diffuses from the surrounding sample into the perfusate, now called dialysate, and is&#xD;
      transported outside the probe for ex vivo monitoring.&#xD;
