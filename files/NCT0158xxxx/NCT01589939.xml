  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study evaluates the clinical utility of a novel real-time localization&#xD;
      system allowing for smaller volumes of normal tissue to be included in radiation field and&#xD;
      determines dosimetric parameters and adverse effect profiles of radiation therapy using this&#xD;
      technology. Subjects will have beacon transponders implanted into the prostate to more&#xD;
      precisely localize the position of the organ during radiation therapy. Hypothesis: 1.&#xD;
      Treatment with highly targeted radiation therapy can be delivered in a daily treatment time&#xD;
      consistent with routine clinical practice. 2. Highly targeted radiation therapy with reduced&#xD;
      PTV margin will result in a significant decrease in rectal and bladder volume treated.&#xD;

      This study will seek to establish the clinical feasibility of a novel real-time localization&#xD;
      and tracking system for use of reduced PTV margins during intensity modulated radiation&#xD;
      therapy (IMRT), which will allow treatment of smaller volumes of normal tissue during&#xD;
      radiation therapy. Such a reduction in the PTV margins and the exposure of healthy tissue&#xD;
      during treatment may allow for several future improvements in prostate radiotherapy&#xD;
      including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  decreased acute and chronic adverse effects with similar local tumor control&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dose escalation to achieve higher cure rates with similar adverse effects to standard&#xD;
           dose treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hypofractionation to shorten the time of, and lower the expense of, treatment without&#xD;
           increased adverse effects.&#xD;

    <measure>Radiation therapy with reduced treatment margins can be adopted as feasible for routine clinical use</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 8.5 weeks (43 fractions per pt.)</time_frame>
    <description>During each radiation treatment fraction, therapists will record set up time, treatment time, total time and number of treatment interventions (repositioning/pausing) as well as the duration of the intervention caused by organ/target motion beyond planning target volume (PTV) margin using real time localization and tracking.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Analyze dosimetric characteristics of treatment planning</measure>
    <time_frame>usually within the first 2 weeks after beacon placement (done at simulation CT)</time_frame>
    <description>Standard methods vs. reduced planning target volume expansions will be analyzed:&#xD;
Dose Volume Histogram (DVH), bladder and rectum&#xD;
Volume receiving 77.4Gy by the prescription dose (V77.4Gy), V70Gy, and V50Gy of bladder and rectum</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess incidence of acute bladder and rectal toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 25 months (assessed prior to beacons are placed and then throughout treatment and follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>toxicity is based on the RTOG/NCI CTC and EPIC quality of life survey.</description>
