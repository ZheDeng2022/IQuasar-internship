      The investigators aim to asses the effect of dieto-therapy and of nutritional counseling on&#xD;
      the nutritional status, body growth and tolerance acquisition in children with cow's milk&#xD;
      allergy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective controlled study including patients with cow's milk allergy(6-36 months of&#xD;
      age.During the first examination, the diagnosis will be assessed by pediatricians with great&#xD;
      experience in food allergy, checking that the patient had undergone a standardized procedure.&#xD;
      All cases with an unclear diagnosis of FA (i.e., lack of careful medical history, laboratory&#xD;
      studies, and oral food challenge) or on incorrect exclusion diet (i.e., assumption of at&#xD;
      least traces of the food allergen) will be excluded. Children with a positive history for&#xD;
      prematurity, systemic diseases, renal failure, neurological impairment, active tuberculosis,&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiency, chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, celiac disease,&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis, metabolic or endocrine diseases, malignancy and malformation of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal or the urinary tract will be also excluded. The history of each patient will&#xD;
      be evaluated and the results of FA screening tests (i.e., skin prick tests and atopy patch&#xD;
      tests) and of oral food challenge, together with all demographic and clinical information&#xD;
      will be registered into a specific clinical chart. At enrolment (T0), after 2 (T1),4 (T2),&#xD;
      6(T3)and 12 months (T4) weight, length or height and head circumference were measured by&#xD;
      experienced nurse unaware of the study aims using standardized procedures. The anthropometric&#xD;
      indices (z-score for weight, z-score for length/height, z-score for head circumference) will&#xD;
      be also evaluated for all study subjects. Anthropometric measurements will be compared with&#xD;
      the Euro-Growth References Charts. At the end of the first visit the parents of all children&#xD;
      taking part in the study will be asked to fill a 3-day diet record report in a form of a&#xD;
      printed chart. Written informed consent will be obtained from parents of each child enrolled&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional counseling Enrolled subjects will be evaluated by registered dieticians with a&#xD;
      wide experience in pediatric FA, blinded to the study aims, assessing the results of the&#xD;
      3-day diary dietary intake at enrollment (T0), at 6 months (T3) and 12 months (T4). All&#xD;
      diaries will be collected and analyzed using a specific software based on the Italian food&#xD;
      composition tables. The dieticians will evaluate the results of the 3-day diary and will give&#xD;
      information to the parents about issues potentially arising during dietary elimination and on&#xD;
      how to replace the allergen in the diet with alternative food items equivalent on the&#xD;
      nutritional standpoint according to specific dietary recommended intake (DRI) for Italian&#xD;
      children for age and sex .The nutritional counseling will be also focused on feeding&#xD;
      behaviors, selection pleasant food and children preferences. No nutritional support products&#xD;
      will be prescribed. This is the standard procedure in the management of FA in the centers&#xD;
      involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory measurements At the enrollment and after 6 months (T3) after nutritional&#xD;
      intervention a venous blood sample will be collected from children with FA on elimination&#xD;
      diet. The following laboratory measurements will be analyzed through standardized procedures:&#xD;
      hemoglobin, albumin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, calcium, phosphorus, and zinc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the patients rate of tolerance acquisition after 12 months of exclusion diet&#xD;
      an oral food challenge (OFC) will be performed.&#xD;
