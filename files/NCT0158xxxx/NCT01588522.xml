      This will be a dose escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the&#xD;
      overall safety and tolerability of a topical compound 31543 (Calcitriol) in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic or recurrent cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy with a taxane-based regimen. A&#xD;
      standard 3+3 dose escalation design will be employed with 3-6 patients at each dose level.&#xD;
      Eligible patients ≥18 years of age and scheduled to receive a taxane-based regimen with&#xD;
      treatment breaks as per physician's discretion, will start applying the topical solution&#xD;
      twice a day at each cohort dose level two weeks or 7 days ± 2 days prior to initiation of&#xD;
      chemotherapy and then continue twice daily for 3 months or until termination of chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment. If topical calcitriol is found to be effective in preventing and/or diminishing&#xD;
      taxane chemotherapy-induced alopecia as determined by the photographic assessments and&#xD;
      patient self-assessments, patients will be allowed to continue topical application for the&#xD;
      duration of their chemotherapy treatment, assuming no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) related&#xD;
      to the topical agent or intolerable side effects are observed. Toxicity to the topical&#xD;
      compound 31543 (calcitriol) will be assessed on a weekly basis during the first 28 days of&#xD;
      topical treatment and subsequently every four weeks by a study clinician, either a physician&#xD;
      or a nurse. For the purpose of pharmacokinetic studies (PKs), blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      on Day 1 of topical treatment at the following time points: pre-dose, at 2 hrs (±30 minutes),&#xD;
      4 hrs (±30 minutes), and 8 hrs (±1 hr post dose) after a single application on the morning of&#xD;
      Day 1. The second application of drug product will be applied 10-14 hrs after the initial&#xD;
      application and after the 8 hr PK sample. Thereafter, topical application frequency will be&#xD;
      twice daily, morning and night. Subsequently, a PK sample will be taken 12 hrs (±2 hrs) after&#xD;
      the last dose of each 28-day treatment, before the first application of Day 1 of the next&#xD;
      28-day treatment cycle. This schedule will continue for three consecutive 28-day topical&#xD;
      treatment cycles. (PKs will be drawn at Weeks 1, 5, 9, and 13. In addition, if patients are&#xD;
      still on study, a PK will also be drawn at Week 54.) As a secondary objective, potential&#xD;
      efficacy of the topical calcitriol will be evaluated by photographic assessment. Photographic&#xD;
      assessment will be performed using a Canon digital camera system to ensure standardization&#xD;
      and uniformity among all enrolled patients. The following five views will be obtained at each&#xD;
      photographic assessment: bilateral sides of head/scalp view, front of head/face view, back of&#xD;
      head/scalp view, and top of head/scalp view.Additionally, close-up photographs will be taken&#xD;
      at the same time points. They will include the mid-pattern of the scalp from a superior view&#xD;
      and a vertex view with hair parted in the center and combed away from the center part.&#xD;
      Photographs will be standardized for lighting, camera angle, and position to the&#xD;
      participant's head.These assessments will be performed at the following time points: at&#xD;
      baseline, Weeks 7, 15, 27, and 54. Photographs for patients in each cohort representing&#xD;
      baseline, and treatment Weeks 7 and 15 will be presented blind to the study PI and&#xD;
      dermatologist, Mario Lacouture, after at least 3 patients have completed 15 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment. Photographs will also be taken at Week 27 and Week 54 of the study but will be&#xD;
      included in the final photographic assessment as secondary information. In addition, all&#xD;
      patients will be asked to maintain an application log throughout treatment to ensure&#xD;
      compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally patients will maintain a medication application diary and a self-assessment&#xD;
      diary. The medication application diary will collect daily application details of the&#xD;
      medication. This will include application dates and times, chemotherapy cycle, and whether&#xD;
      the medication was applied (or reason if the medication was not applied). The self-assessment&#xD;
      diary will require assessment of hair thickness, hair fullness, hair breakage, and hair&#xD;
      cosmetic qualities (ease of styling, etc.) on an analog 10 point scale to assess&#xD;
      patient-reported efficacy. The PI clinical assessment of baseline, Weeks 7 and 15 photographs&#xD;
      will be used, together with the patient diary information, for the primary assessment of&#xD;
      alopecia. The study is expected to take place over a period of approximately 12 months,&#xD;
      including the screening period.&#xD;
