      This is an open, multicenter, prospective, randomised and cross over study, comparing in&#xD;
      patients with cystic fibrosis aged &gt; 6 years, 2 periods of 6 weeks of oxygen therapy or room&#xD;
      air, separated by a wash out period of 2 to 6 weeks.&#xD;

      Rationale Oxygen therapy may be proposed to patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) with nocturnal&#xD;
      hypoxemia but the indication and benefits of oxygen therapy have not been validated in CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study and main objective The aim of the study is to evaluate the improvement in&#xD;
      nocturnal hypoxemia by the measurement of nocturnal pulse oximetry (SpO2) after 6 weeks of&#xD;
      nocturnal oxygen therapy in stable patients with CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An improvement is defined by a nocturnal SpO2 &gt; 90% during the whole night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and secondary aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of subjective sleep quality during oxygen therapy and room air after a period&#xD;
           of 6 weeks by means of 4 validated sleep questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of quality of life during oxygen therapy and room air after a period of 6&#xD;
           weeks by means of a validated questionnaire for CF patients (CFQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detection of the appearance or increase in nocturnal hypercapnia during oxygen therapy&#xD;
           and room air after a period of 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of a possible arterial pulmonary hypertension during oxygen therapy and room&#xD;
           air after a period of 6 weeks by means of an echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is an open, multicentre, prospective, randomised and cross over study,&#xD;
      comparing in individual patient two periods of 6 weeks: one period with nocturnal oxygen&#xD;
      therapy and one period in room air, separated by a wash out period of 2 to 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children ≥ 6 years and adults ≥ 18 years with CF in a stable state&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) ≤ 50% of predicted value&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Having a pulse oximetry (SpO2) in room air ≤ 90% for ≥ 10% of the night and/or a SpO2 ≤&#xD;
           90% for ≥ 10 minutes during the night&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any patient with prior noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) but who has&#xD;
           stopped NPPV at least 15 days before the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Written approval by the patient and by the parents in case of a pediatric patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient having the French social security coverage Non-inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with a respiratory exacerbation during the last 15 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with NPPV or long term oxygen therapy prior to the start of the study and&#xD;
           unable to stop this treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impossibility of a medical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant patient or breastfeeding patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol The study is proposed to the patients during the V0 visit, corresponding to&#xD;
      the screening monitoring showing a nocturnal SpO2 in room air ≤ 90% for ≥ 10% of the night&#xD;
      and/or a SpO2 ≤ 90% for ≥ 10 minutes during the night. After a period of 2 to 30 days, the&#xD;
      written approval is obtained during a routine visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter, the patient will be randomised to receive either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. nocturnal oxygen therapy with a stable flow to obtain a nocturnal SpO2 &gt;90% (Oxygen&#xD;
           period) while continuing his routine long term treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. his routine long term treatment without nocturnal oxygen therapy (Air period) During the&#xD;
           Oxygen period, the oxygen flow will be at least 1.5 L/min. This flow may be increased up&#xD;
           to 2L/min in case of the presence of nocturnal periods with a SpO2 ≤ 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two periods Oxygen and Air will be separated by a wash out period of 2 to 6 weeks to rule&#xD;
      out any long lasting effect of nocturnal oxygen therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 2 periods of 6 weeks oxygen or air, the following investigations will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A nocturnal evaluation of gas exchange by the Sentec™ monitor (which measures SpO2 and&#xD;
           transcutaneous carbon dioxide (PCO2)) and objective sleep quality by means of actigraphy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an evaluation of subjective sleep quality by means of 4 validates sleep questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an evaluation of quality of life by a validated CF questionnaire (CFQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  spirometry with blood gases in room air&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects Only 3 studies have evaluated the benefit of oxygen therapy on nocturnal&#xD;
      gas exchange during one night and only one study has evaluated the benefit of oxygen therapy&#xD;
      after a period of 26 months. This last study is limited by the small number of patients and&#xD;
      the low compliance with oxygen therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study has evaluated the effect of oxygen therapy during a 6 weeks period. This limits the&#xD;
      calculation of the number of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the study is a cross over study, a number of 30 analysable patients is estimated to be&#xD;
      sufficient for the evaluation of the primary outcome measure and the secondary outcomes.&#xD;
      Because of the possibility of premature withdrawal, it is planned to include 50 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration of the study: maximum 22.5 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion period: 18 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of participation for one patient: maximum 4.5 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis and final report: 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participating centres: 8&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimation of the mean number of patients included per centre: 3 patients / 3 months / centre&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results The results of the present study should help to define the criteria to start&#xD;
      long term oxygen therapy and to assess the potential benefits of this treatment in stable&#xD;
      patients with CF.&#xD;
