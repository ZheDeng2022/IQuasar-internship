      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Studies have shown that changes in breast density (the amount of white area on a woman's&#xD;
      mammogram) may be related to changes in breast cancer risk. Currently, there is no ideal way&#xD;
      to measure breast density repeatedly over time. Researchers want to test whether ultrasound&#xD;
      tomography scans can show changes in breast density. To examine these changes, healthy&#xD;
      volunteers with no history of breast cancer and women who are taking tamoxifen will have&#xD;
      ultrasound tomography scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test whether ultrasound tomography scans can show changes in breast density related to&#xD;
      tamoxifen exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Women between 30 and 70 years of age who are (a) taking tamoxifen or (b) healthy volunteers&#xD;
      who have never had breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will have a screening visit. Healthy volunteers will have one&#xD;
           additional study visit; women taking tamoxifen will have three additional study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will&#xD;
           also give blood and saliva samples. This visit will also include an initial ultrasound&#xD;
           tomography breast scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the healthy volunteers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the study visit (12 months after the screening visit), participants will have a short&#xD;
           interview and be weighed. They will also have an ultrasound tomography breast scan and&#xD;
           provide a blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the women taking tamoxifen:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the second and third visits (1 to 3 months and 3 to 6 months after starting&#xD;
           tamoxifen), participants will have a short interview. They will also be weighed and have&#xD;
           an ultrasound tomography breast scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the fourth visit (12 months after starting tamoxifen), participants will have a short&#xD;
           interview, weight measurement, and the ultrasound tomography breast scan, and will also&#xD;
           provide a blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants may be followed for up to 5 years after their final study visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elevated breast density is one of the strongest risk factors for non-familial breast cancer&#xD;
      [1]. Recently, the International Breast Cancer Intervention Study-1 (IBIS-1) trial reported&#xD;
      that women whose mammographic density declined by 10% within 12-18 months of initiating&#xD;
      tamoxifen chemoprevention also had a marked reduction in cancer risk [2]; however,&#xD;
      preliminary data suggested that in 30% of patients, tamoxifen failed to lower density and did&#xD;
      not reduce cancer risk. Therefore, we hypothesize that breast density represents a biosensor&#xD;
      of tamoxifen response, reflecting bioavailability and action of active drug metabolites.&#xD;
      Distinguishing tamoxifen responders from non-responders at the earliest time point would have&#xD;
      value for making informed treatment decisions, providing a rationale for continued therapy&#xD;
      among responders while sparing non-responders exposure to ineffective treatment. We propose&#xD;
      to use a novel ultrasound tomography (UST) scanner to repeatedly assess volumetric breast&#xD;
      density among 150 women during their first year of tamoxifen use for clinical indications,&#xD;
      including a referral from a health professional based on a woman s personal risk of breast&#xD;
      cancer or a diagnosis of atypical lobular or ductal hyperplasia (ALH/ADH), ductal carcinoma&#xD;
      in situ (DCIS), lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), or invasive breast cancer, to assess&#xD;
      whether tamoxifen-related declines in mammographic density found at 12 months can be&#xD;
      identified earlier with UST. UST is ideally suited for this application because it produces&#xD;
      volumetric data and avoids artifacts secondary to breast compression and exposure to&#xD;
      potentially harmful ionizing radiation. For comparison, we will perform UST on a group of 150&#xD;
      age-, race-, and menopausal status-matched women without breast cancer in order to assess&#xD;
      changes in UST density over time without tamoxifen exposure. The specific goal of this&#xD;
      project is to utilize UST to describe the early time course of volumetric breast density&#xD;
      change. The broader objective is to assess the concept of breast density as a biosensor of&#xD;
      tamoxifen response and UST as a useful tool for making this determination.&#xD;
