  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary care physicians have emerged as the predominant mental health care providers for&#xD;
      diagnosing and treating depression. The majority of patients with mood disorders receive&#xD;
      treatment in the primary care setting, within which approximately 10-30% of all patients&#xD;
      present with a depressive disorder. Comprehensive 'Collaborative Care' models of depression&#xD;
      management significantly improve depression outcomes and health-related quality of life. Core&#xD;
      features of these programs include use of a trained depression care manager to closely&#xD;
      coordinate with primary care clinicians, support treatment recommendations, provide patient&#xD;
      education, conduct patient follow-up to ensure adequate treatment, and manage as-needed&#xD;
      access to psychiatrists for patients with more complex presentations. Evidence based&#xD;
      Collaborative Care models do not currently weave in the use of web-based or mobile&#xD;
      technologies. These technologies offer unique features that may make collaborative depression&#xD;
      care more effective. The digital health coaching program for depressive symptoms enhanced&#xD;
      during Phase I of the current project is a web-based tool featuring video, text, links and&#xD;
      graphics which provide patients with education, self-management techniques, tailored&#xD;
      feedback, and tools for tracking treatment progress. The RESPECT-D (Re-engineering Systems of&#xD;
      Primary Care Treatment of Depression) intervention is a collaborative depression management&#xD;
      model for primary care. The primary objective of this project is to compare the efficacy of&#xD;
      an enhanced Collaborative Care model for depression (RESPECT-D-E) to the standard model&#xD;
      (RESPECT-D) for patients with minor and major depression and dysthymic disorder. This study&#xD;
      will be a randomized controlled trial with 150 participants who are receiving antidepressant&#xD;
      medication treatment in the primary care setting. The primary objectives are: reduction in&#xD;
      subject reported depressive symptoms, improvement in subject reported health related quality&#xD;
      of life and improvement in subject adherence to treatment regimen as demonstrated by&#xD;
      self-report measures and clinician-administered assessment. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that compared to RESPECT-D at 12 weeks, participants randomized to RESPECT-D-E will&#xD;
      demonstrate: a greater reduction in depressive symptoms, a greater improvement in&#xD;
      health-related quality of life and a greater satisfaction with quality of depression care&#xD;
      received.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The National Comorbidity Survey suggests a lifetime prevalence of 17% and 1-year prevalence&#xD;
      of 10% for major depression. Within primary care, approximately 10-30% of patients present&#xD;
      with a depressive disorder. Over the past decade, primary care physicians have emerged as the&#xD;
      predominant mental health care providers insofar as diagnosing and treating depression, with&#xD;
      the majority of patients with mood disorders receiving treatment in a primary care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive 'Collaborative Care' models of depression management in primary care&#xD;
      significantly improve depression outcomes and health-related quality of life. Core features&#xD;
      of these programs include use of a trained depression care manager to closely coordinate with&#xD;
      primary care clinicians, provision of specific treatment recommendations/guidelines, patient&#xD;
      education, appropriate follow-up by the depression care manager to ensure adequate treatment,&#xD;
      as-needed access to psychiatrists for patients with more complex presentations, and,&#xD;
      occasionally, on-site psychotherapy. For example, the IMPACT study of primary care patients&#xD;
      with late-life depression found that a Collaborative Care program doubled the effectiveness&#xD;
      of depression treatment and improved functional outcomes at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year&#xD;
      compared to usual care. The RESPECT-D phone-based Collaborative Care program similarly had&#xD;
      increases at 3 and 6 months in depression response, remission, and satisfaction with care,&#xD;
      compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonetheless, evidence based Collaborative Care leaves room for improvement. In both IMPACT&#xD;
      and RESPECT-D, 40% to 50% of intervention participants failed to achieve a clinically&#xD;
      meaningful depression treatment effect. Evidence based Collaborative Care models do not&#xD;
      currently weave in the use of web-based or mobile technologies. These technologies offer&#xD;
      unique features that may make collaborative depression care more effective. The enhanced&#xD;
      digital health coaching program for depressive symptoms is a web-based tool featuring video,&#xD;
      text and graphics which provides patients with education, self-management techniques,&#xD;
      tailored feedback, and tools for tracking treatment progress. Incorporating a digital health&#xD;
      coaching program for depressive symptoms into the flow of collaborative depression care and&#xD;
      testing its impact is an important next step for the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RESPECT-D (Re-engineering Systems of Primary Care Treatment of Depression) intervention&#xD;
      is a systematic approach to the assessment and management of depression by the primary care&#xD;
      provider, with a centrally based care manager providing telephone support for patients. The&#xD;
      essential components of this Collaborative Care model include prepared PCPs and practices,&#xD;
      the Care Manager, and a Behavioral Health specialist all working in partnership with the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESPECT-D-E (Enhanced) intervention is Collaborative Care depression treatment in primary&#xD;
      care including care manager (the elements of RESPECT-D) plus patient access to on-line&#xD;
      coaching, education, and symptom, side effect and medication adherence tracking which is&#xD;
      automatically fed back to the Care Manager.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this project is to compare the efficacy of an enhanced Collaborative&#xD;
      Care model for depression (RESPECT-D-E) to the standard model (RESPECT-D) in primary care&#xD;
      patients with minor and major depression and dysthymic disorder .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RESEPCT-D-E trial is a randomized, 12-week prospective 2-arm, comparative clinical&#xD;
      effectiveness study. Primary care patients (N=150) with major or minor depressive disorder,&#xD;
      or dysthymia and currently taking antidepressant medication will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either Collaborative Care treatment for depression (RESPECT-D) or RESPECT-D plus a digital&#xD;
      health coaching program for depressive symptoms intervention (RESPECT-D-E). Patients will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks using self-report and clinician&#xD;
      -administered rating scales including the Hopkins Symptom Checklist and Hamilton Depression&#xD;
      Rating Scale. Intervention participants will receive access to the online depression coach as&#xD;
      well as the elements of standard Collaborative Care (RESPECT-D). The primary objectives are:&#xD;
      reduction in depressive symptoms, improvement in health related quality of life and&#xD;
      improvement in adherence to treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the RESPECT-D-E trial are to: Evaluate the program impact on&#xD;
      overall health, work productivity, and medical costs; Assess the usability of the enhanced&#xD;
      digital health coaching program for depressive symptoms tool; Assess the program's impact on&#xD;
      overall satisfaction with care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: Compared to RESPECT-D at 12 weeks, participants randomized to RESPECT-D-E will&#xD;
      demonstrate: H1.1a: a greater reduction in depressive symptoms, as measured by the clinician&#xD;
      administered Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D); H1.1b: a greater reduction in&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, as measured by the self-report Hopkins Symptom Checklist Depression&#xD;
      Scale (HSCL-20); H1.1c: a greater improvement in health related quality of life, as measured&#xD;
      by the Mental Component Summary score from the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-36);&#xD;
      H1.1d: a greater satisfaction with quality of depression care received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.2: Compared to RESPECT-D at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, participants randomized to&#xD;
      RESPECT-D-E will demonstrate: H1.2a: more frequent contact with the depression care manager&#xD;
      and primary care provider, as measured by depression care manager treatment logs and medical&#xD;
      record review; H1.2b: greater adherence to their antidepressant regimen, as measured by&#xD;
      participant self-report; H1.2c: greater exposure to depression counseling, as measured by&#xD;
      participant self-report.&#xD;
