  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study with the primary purpose to describe organ dosimetry and acute&#xD;
      toxicities using no carrier added and carrier added 124I-MIBG PET/CT in patients with&#xD;
      neuroblastoma (NB). Eligible patients are 3 years of age and older with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory neuroblastoma who are currently enrolled on a treatment protocol with 131I-MIBG.&#xD;
      After all eligibility criteria are met, patients will receive a diagnostic imaging dose of&#xD;
      124I-MIBG followed by sequential PET/CT dosimetry scans on Days 0, 1, 2 and 5. Subsequent,&#xD;
      planned therapeutic administration of 131I-MIBG will occur between Days 7 to 21, as specified&#xD;
      by the patient's therapeutic MIBG protocol. An optional single follow up 124I-MIBG PET-CT&#xD;
      scan will be done to assess tumor sites 6 weeks after the patient has their MIBG therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accurate radiation dose evaluation is important in patients with malignant tumors, and this&#xD;
      is especially critical in children with NB who will be receiving several dose of therapeutic&#xD;
      131I. The accurate quantification of the isotope-labeled analog can only be achieved by using&#xD;
      positron emission compounds, such as 124I. Unlike planar images, which were used to obtain&#xD;
      kinetic information, and SPECT reconstruction modalities that were aimed to assess the&#xD;
      spatial distribution of radioactivity, 3D PET imaging-based dosimetry is a method which&#xD;
      provides a more accurate estimation of the cumulated radioactivity distribution. Because PET&#xD;
      provides better quantitative accuracy, when compared to SPECT regarding the tissue absorbed&#xD;
      information, we hypothesize PET would better correspond with tumor response and normal organ&#xD;
      toxicity. Early studies using I-124 for dosimetry in thyroid cancer have been promising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demonstration of the feasibility and accuracy of this new imaging modality, with the&#xD;
      excellent prospect for more accurate dosimetry, will improve tumor localization and optimize&#xD;
      therapeutic dosing with 131I-MIBG. The results of our work may potentially have also&#xD;
      implications in the study of other neuroendocrine tumors. The Section of Nuclear Medicine and&#xD;
      the Laboratory of Functional Imaging at the University of California, San Francisco, are&#xD;
      equipped with state of the art instruments and is run by a highly skilled staff which will&#xD;
      guarantee the success of the proposed research.&#xD;
