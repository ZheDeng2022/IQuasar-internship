      The purpose of this research study is to perform a serial analysis of immune function using&#xD;
      blood cells and sera obtained from patients after vaccination following hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation (HSCT). The focus of this study will be to characterize several immune&#xD;
      parameters during the clinical course of HSCT and correlate these findings with the effect of&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation therapy is potentially curative for many malignant&#xD;
      and non-malignant hematopoietic disorders. Disease recurrence and infection remain major&#xD;
      causes of morbidity and mortality following HSCT. While innate immunity (myeloid and NK cell)&#xD;
      is restored relatively quickly following HSCT, a prolonged period of lymphopenia occurs in&#xD;
      all patients. This delay in lymphoid reconstitution is exacerbated with age and results in&#xD;
      severely dampened adaptive immune responses. In children who have received chemotherapy and&#xD;
      HSCT, T cell function generally recovers within 6 to twelve months. In contrast, lymphoid&#xD;
      deficiency in adults may require years, and often never recovers to pre-transplant levels.&#xD;
      Much of the delay in lymphocyte recovery is thought to be due to decreased thymic T cell&#xD;
      production and export and the resulting expansion of treatment resistant T cell clones.&#xD;
      Peripheral expansion of T cells in a lymphopenic setting leads to a narrowing of the TCR&#xD;
      repertoire and manifests as a decrease in the magnitude of response to new antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These long-lasting T cell deficiencies have been shown to play a direct role in&#xD;
      post-transplant complications. There are many studies that correlate decreased T cell number&#xD;
      and function (specifically CD4+ T cells) with an increase in post-transplant infections and&#xD;
      relapse has been shown to be inversely proportional to T cell reconstitution following both&#xD;
      autologous and allogeneic HSCT. Furthermore, this prolonged deficit in T cell function&#xD;
      decreases the effectiveness of vaccination against tumour antigens and infectious diseases as&#xD;
      well as other post-transplant immunotherapeutic strategies. Following HSCT, patients lose&#xD;
      immunological memory not only to infectious microorganisms to which they were previously&#xD;
      exposed but also bacterial and viral vaccines given prior to the HSCT , increasing the chance&#xD;
      of infection post-transplant. Primary immunization requires antigenic stimulation and&#xD;
      functionally mature T cells and therefore at least partial reconstitution of the T and B cell&#xD;
      pools is necessary before successful reimmunization can occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study presents an opportunity to analyze, at a systems level, the responses to&#xD;
      vaccination in patients who are treated with HSCT. The expected high frequency of low&#xD;
      responders to vaccination will permit comparisons of gene expression and immune cell&#xD;
      activation between high and low responders as measured by the rate of seroconversion and HAI&#xD;
      titers. The evaluation of live VZV vaccination is essential for these objective as the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that live vaccination will induce a more specific immune response&#xD;
      than dead (ie: influenza) vaccination. This study may also generate novel hypotheses about&#xD;
      the mechanistic basis for reduced responses to vaccines post HSCT.&#xD;
