  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Haemophilus influenzae is an important pathogen which can cause primary infection and&#xD;
      respiratory viral infection in infants and leaded to secondary infections. The infection of&#xD;
      haemophilus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in infants and children. At present,&#xD;
      the developed conjugant Hib vaccine is proved to be safe and effective. Because Hib vaccine&#xD;
      can prevent meningitis, pneumonia, epiglottis inflammation and other serious infection caused&#xD;
      by Hib bacteria, the WHO suggested that Hib vaccine should be included in the infant's normal&#xD;
      immune programming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the use of meningitis aureus polysaccharide vaccine, incidence of a disease in recent&#xD;
      years is declined and maintain to the level of 0.5 per 1/100 thousand. But meningitis aureus&#xD;
      polysaccharide vaccine with a relatively poor immune response in the infants under the age of&#xD;
      two, and the remaining 60% with a low antibody level and a short duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immunogenicity and safety of this vaccine has been proved in older children aged 6-23&#xD;
      months and 2-5 years. And in the phase I study which was conducted in February, 2012, the&#xD;
      safety profile of this vaccine is proved to be acceptable in infants aged 3-5 months. The&#xD;
      phase III study is aimed to further evaluate the safety and the immunization of the vaccine.&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of the group A, C polysaccharide&#xD;
      meningococcal and type b haemophilus influenzal conjugate vaccine.&#xD;
