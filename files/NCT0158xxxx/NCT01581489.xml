  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delayed clamping of the umbilical cord might prevent or slow the onset of iron deficiency by&#xD;
      increasing the infant's iron endowment at birth. Compared to early clamping, a delay in&#xD;
      clamping in clamping of around 2-3 min provides an additional 25-40 mL of blood per kg of&#xD;
      bodyweight to the newborn infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of previous intervention studies on delayed clamping are mixed, and few have&#xD;
      followed the infants beyond the perinatal period. All longer follow up studies have been&#xD;
      performed in low income countries except for the investigators earlier study, showing less&#xD;
      iron deficiency and improved iron stores after delayed cord clamping at 4 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the current study is to assess whether the time of cord clamping&#xD;
      affects neurodevelopment at 4 years of age in a large sample of full-term, Swedish infants.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that as delayed cord clamping improves iron stores at 4&#xD;
      months, this could affect the child's development positively.&#xD;

      Project description&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron deficiency is associated with neurodevelopmental delay and suboptimal cognitive&#xD;
      function. Our hypothesis is that early cord clamping is associated with an increased risk for&#xD;
      iron deficiency, and as a consequence increased risk for suboptimal infant development also&#xD;
      in a country with high standard of living.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Method&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Study cohort Four-hundred full-term infants, born to healthy mothers after normal&#xD;
                pregnancies, were randomized to early or delayed cord clamping (at a hospital which&#xD;
                practiced early cord clamping as standard practice). The infants were born during&#xD;
                the time-period April 2008 to May 2009. Pregnant women were considered eligible if&#xD;
                they met the following criteria: non-smoking, healthy mother (no haemolytic&#xD;
                disease, no treatment with any of the following drugs: anticonvulsants,&#xD;
                antidepressants, thyroid hormone, insulin, chemotherapy or cortisone), normal&#xD;
                pregnancy (no preeclampsia, no diabetes, no prolonged rupture of membranes or signs&#xD;
                of infection), single birth, term pregnancy (gestational age 37 +0 until 41 +6&#xD;
                weeks + days), expected vaginal delivery with cephalic presentation. Furthermore,&#xD;
                the mother should be able to master Swedish well enough to understand the meaning&#xD;
                of the study. Mothers were given written and oral information about the trial at&#xD;
                the maternal health care centre from 34 weeks of gestational age. Mothers&#xD;
                fulfilling the inclusion criteria at the time of admission to the delivery ward&#xD;
                were again given written and oral information about the study by the attending&#xD;
                midwife and written informed consent was obtained. Randomization was performed in&#xD;
                advance by computer in blocks of 20. When delivery was imminent, the midwife opened&#xD;
                a sealed envelope containing the treatment allocation. The intervention in the&#xD;
                early cord clamping (ECC) group consisted of double clamping of the umbilical cord&#xD;
                within 10 seconds of the infant's delivery, and arterial and venous blood sampling&#xD;
                from the clamped segment within 10 min. The intervention in the delayed cord&#xD;
                clamping (DCC) group consisted of late (≥ 180 s) clamping of the umbilical cord and&#xD;
                arterial and venous blood sampling from the unclamped cord within 30 seconds after&#xD;
                birth, while the midwife was holding the child below the level of the uterus. In&#xD;
                both randomization groups, all children were initially kept about 20 cm below the&#xD;
                level of the mother's uterus for 30 seconds and then placed on their mother's&#xD;
                chest. All other aspects of obstetric care during labour and delivery were managed&#xD;
                according to the standard practice of care at the study hospital. Oxytocin was&#xD;
                administered to all mothers immediately after cord clamping. The final&#xD;
                participating mother-infant pairs available for statistical analysis were 189 in&#xD;
                the ECC group and 193 in the DCC group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Follow up at 4 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
                Children will be asked to return for a follow up at 4 years of age for&#xD;
                neuro-developmental testing including:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Cognitive testing with WPPSI (Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of&#xD;
                     Intelligence)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Behavioral assessment with SDQ (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire), a&#xD;
                     questionnaire for behavioural screening which is filled in by the parents&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Assessment of psychomotor development with ASQ (Ages and Stages&#xD;
                     Questionnaire), a questionnaire that is filled in by the parents&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Selected items from Movement ABC (Assessment Battery for Children)&#xD;
&#xD;
                Time plan The included children were born during the time period April 2008 to May&#xD;
                2009, and they will become 4 years during 2012 and 2013. We aim to test them at the&#xD;
                age of 4 years (April 2012 to May 2013). Additional research ethics permission for&#xD;
                the follow up has been approved. Permission to translate and use the Ages and&#xD;
                Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) for scientific purposes, has been sought from the&#xD;
                publisher Brooks Publishing (as already approved for the previous versions at 4, 12&#xD;
                and 36 months of age).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Realization At approximately one month before the child's fourth birthday, the parents&#xD;
           will receive a letter containing information about the study,including time and location&#xD;
           for the testing, and the two questionnaires, SDQ and ASQ. The parents are asked to&#xD;
           answer these questionnaires before the visit to the psychologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parents has also been informed about the planned neurodevelopmental testing and&#xD;
      questionnaires at 4 years of age when they had another scheduled visit when the child was&#xD;
      three years of age. The parents have the opportunity to contact the research assistant who&#xD;
      can change the time for the visit. After the neurodevelopmental testing, the parents will&#xD;
      receive a written report, and if abnormal results are discovered, due action will be taken.&#xD;
