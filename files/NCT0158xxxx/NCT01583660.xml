  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the development of society, aged population is growing. Hip fracture is the most common&#xD;
      disease for aged people. With the life being longer than before, incidence of this disease is&#xD;
      growing. The mortality of this disease is high-- almost 10% patients will die within 1 month,&#xD;
      about 1/3 of patients will die within 12 months. About 20%-30% aged people who have hip&#xD;
      fracture will die within one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The damaged organs caused by excessive inflammatory is one of possible reasons to cause&#xD;
      higher mortality. Therefore, the investigators imagined that if they gave medicines to&#xD;
      patients in time to reduce the inflammatory level, the inflammatory might have less effects&#xD;
      on organs, and the recovery could be improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis on the basic research: the anti-inflammatory function of non&#xD;
      steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can inhibit the inflammatory level of elderly hip&#xD;
      fracture, so as to improve the recovery level and reduce the complicating disease and&#xD;
      mortality. The investigators designed a clinic study to research NSAIDS' effects on&#xD;
      inflammatory level and prognosis of elderly hip fracture.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      With the development of society, aged population is growing. The number of the aged people&#xD;
      over 60 years old now reaches to 130 million. Hip fracture is the most common disease for&#xD;
      aged people. According to Britain's statistical data of hip fracture, the average age of&#xD;
      males who have hip fracture is 84 years old, and female, 83 years old, and female patients&#xD;
      account for 74% of all the reported cases. The disease is deadly-- when attacked almost 10%&#xD;
      patients die within 1 month, about 1/3 of patients die within 12 months. When seniors are&#xD;
      attacked by hip fracture, about 20%-30% die within one year, 25% recover to normal life&#xD;
      before the attack, and 55% patients become disabled in different degrees. Senile fracture has&#xD;
      become an important issue relating to public health, brought huge burdens to average&#xD;
      families. While developing very fast, our modern society has to come up with a solution to&#xD;
      this urgent scientific problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has shown that the increasing inflammatory cytokines after senile fracture are&#xD;
      independent dangerous factors of death and complications and the systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      response after senile fracture causes organ damage and may explain why the seniors attacked&#xD;
      by hip fracture are more likely to die than their peers. Therefore, we intend to give drug&#xD;
      therapy to patients in the early stage after the attack, to reduce the inflammatory response&#xD;
      of the body, thus reducing the damage of the body by the inflammatory response, and improving&#xD;
      the prognosis of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By inhibiting cyclooxygenase COX, and in turn the arachidonic acid (AA)'s transformation into&#xD;
      prostaglandians (PGs) and thromboxane TXA, NSAIDs produces anti-inflammatory, antipyretic,&#xD;
      analgesic and anti-rheumatism actions. It has been widely applied in clinic. According to&#xD;
      study, there are two cyclooxygenase insomers in human body namely COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1,&#xD;
      which exists in normal tissues, with physiological stimulation, can stimulate arachidonic&#xD;
      acid to produce thromboxane A, prostaglandin e (PGE2) and prostacyclin I2 (PGI2). It can&#xD;
      therefore protect the gastrointestinal tract, kidney, platelets, and vascular endothelial&#xD;
      cells, and is also called structural enzyme. COX-2 is a type of COX induced by cytokines and&#xD;
      produced under inflammatory stimulation, COX-2 mediates arachidonic acid to produce PGE-2 and&#xD;
      PGI-2. As inflammatory prostaglandin, COX-2 has inflammation-causing effects and pain-causing&#xD;
      effects. Its inhibition lays the pharmacological foundation for the antipyretic, analgesic,&#xD;
      and anti-inflammatory effects of NSAIDs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some animal experiment has showed that the inhibitor of COX-2 reduces the inflammatory&#xD;
      expression of animal models after multiple severe traumas and enhances the survival rate.&#xD;
      Recent reports suggest that the inhibitor of COX-2 (parecoxib) can reduce pro inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines after traumas, chemokine level and relieve acute lung injury. Clinic study shows&#xD;
      that if applying the inhibitor of COX-2 into arthroplasty, the level of systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines can be reduced, and a better postoperative function realized. There has been no&#xD;
      report about the treatment of inflammatory response by NSAID after severe trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinic, pain treatment has been conventional in modern wards and become a symbol of modern&#xD;
      wards. In the newly published British NICE clinical guidelines of hip fracture, pain&#xD;
      treatment of patients with hip fracture is pointed out as an appropriate method. Sufficient&#xD;
      pain-treating enables patients to take part in necessary activities, and undergo medical&#xD;
      examination, nursing care and rehabilitation. N-acethy aminophenol (paracetamol) is&#xD;
      recommended. In case that the alone application of N-acethy aminophenol cannot completely&#xD;
      relieve the pain, opiate drugs should be added. The guideline does not recommend NSAIDS since&#xD;
      it may induce gastrointestinal complication. However, since it overcomes the side effect of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal reaction, NSAIDS as a fundamental drug in pain treatment, especially an&#xD;
      inhibitor of COX-2 has been widely applied in the treatment of trauma pain. But its&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effect has not been paid enough attention. Based on the above findings and&#xD;
      research foundations, we wonder that besides its analgesic effect, whether NSAIDS has a&#xD;
      equally beneficial anti-inflammatory effect on the excessive inflammatory response patient&#xD;
      with severe trauma, and senior patients with hip fracture and improve their prognosis.&#xD;
      Therefore, based on the fundamental research, we assume that the anti-inflammatory effect of&#xD;
      NSAIDs can relieve the systemic inflammatory effect of senior patients with hip fracture,&#xD;
      improve their prognosis, reduce incidence of complications and deaths. Through a prospective&#xD;
      clinical experiment, we plan to study the effect of NSAIDS on the changes of inflammatory&#xD;
      factors of senior patients with hip fracture, and their prognosis.&#xD;
