    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus may lead to cirrhosis, liver disease, and&#xD;
      cancer of the liver. There is no cure for the infection, but several drugs have been approved&#xD;
      to treat it. These drugs can keep the virus levels low. They seem to be safe for short-term&#xD;
      use. But the drugs have not yet been approved for long-term use because some of them can have&#xD;
      serious side effects. However, stopping treatment too soon can make the infection worse and&#xD;
      may lead to more serious forms of liver disease. Researchers have not been able to determine&#xD;
      a when to stop treatment. They want to study people with chronic hepatitis B infection to&#xD;
      find out the best time to stop treatment and prevent the disease from causing further liver&#xD;
      damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the safety and effectiveness of withdrawing antiviral treatment for chronic&#xD;
           hepatitis B after at least 4 years of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether stopping long-term antiviral treatment for chronic hepatitis B&#xD;
           makes the infection worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People who are at least 18 years of age; have been taking antiviral drugs to treat chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis B for at least 4 years; and are being evaluated to stop treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those in the study will be screened with a physical exam, medical history,&#xD;
           questionnaire, and blood tests. They will remain under the care of their regular doctor&#xD;
           during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will have an abdominal ultrasound to study scarring in the liver, if they have not&#xD;
           had one in the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those without detectable levels of the hepatitis B virus in their blood will stop&#xD;
           antiviral treatment. They will have monthly blood tests for the first 6 months to check&#xD;
           virus levels, and then every 3 months afterward.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those whose blood tests show an increase in virus levels will restart antiviral&#xD;
           treatment as directed by the study doctors and their personal doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All those in the study will be monitored until the end of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis B affects at least 1.5 million Americans and is a major cause of cirrhosis,&#xD;
      end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Five oral antiviral agents have been&#xD;
      licensed for use in chronic hepatitis B in the United States. These agents are effective at&#xD;
      suppressing viral replication, improving liver disease and reversing cirrhosis. The standard&#xD;
      indications for starting antiviral therapy have been developed and widely accepted. Less&#xD;
      clear is how long therapy should continue and when and under what conditions should therapy&#xD;
      be stopped. Withdrawal after one year of therapy is commonly followed by relapse that in rare&#xD;
      instances is severe and can be fatal. With longer courses of therapy, withdrawal of antiviral&#xD;
      therapy has been associated with fewer and less severe relapses, but the criteria for&#xD;
      stopping treatment are still unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we propose to withdraw therapy in up to 50 patients with both HBeAg positive&#xD;
      and negative chronic hepatitis B who have received a minimum of 4 years of oral nucleoside&#xD;
      therapy with a serum HBV DNA level less than 500 IU/ml in the 6 months prior to withdrawal.&#xD;
      After an outpatient evaluation, consenting patients will be withdrawn from therapy and&#xD;
      followed carefully for presence of symptoms, abnormal liver tests and HBV DNA levels monthly&#xD;
      for 6 months and every 3 months thereafter. Patients who relapse will be offered retreatment.&#xD;
      Patients without relapse will be followed for at least four years after stopping therapy. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint of the study will be the proportion of patients who maintain an HBV DNA &lt;&#xD;
      1,000 IU/ml, and a serum ALT or AST&lt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal one year off therapy.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will be the proportion of patients who maintain HBeAg loss and clear&#xD;
      HBsAg one year off therapy, the number of ALT or AST flares, predictors of maintained&#xD;
      virological suppression and HBeAg negativity and the proportion of subjects who require&#xD;
      re-initiation of therapy.&#xD;
