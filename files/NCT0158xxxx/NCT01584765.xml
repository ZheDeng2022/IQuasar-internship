  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug re-administration or rechallenge should be avoided after drug-induced liver injury&#xD;
      (DILI) to avoid recurrent and fatal injury. Rechallenge outcomes vary considerably by drug&#xD;
      and patient subjects. In order to better predict these outcomes, the objective of this&#xD;
      analysis is to assess clinical outcomes of positive drug rechallenge following possible&#xD;
      drug-induced liver injury. Electronic medical records from Kaiser Permanente California&#xD;
      (KPSC), a managed care organization, will be utilized to identify patients who experience&#xD;
      possible drug-induced liver injury following exposure to medications associated with&#xD;
      hepatotoxicity, and who are then rechallenged with the medication.&#xD;

        The population was defined as patients 1) 18 years or older at the start of the drug&#xD;
        exposure, 2) with 12 months or more of continuous membership plus drug benefit immediately&#xD;
        prior to the drug start date, and 3) filling at least one prescription for fourteen drugs&#xD;
        associated with hepatotoxicity (Chalasani 2008) anytime between Jan. 1, 2003 to June 30,&#xD;
        2009. Overall, 1,064,722 patients fulfill these criteria as derived from the total study&#xD;
        population of the descriptive analysis. To be included in this analysis, patients had to be&#xD;
        rechallenged with the same suspect drug and had at least one ALT measured at first exposure&#xD;
        and during the rechallenge event. Study observations started in 2002 to allow for a year of&#xD;
        pre-study observation in all exposures at risk. Applying all inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
        criteria, the total study population comprises of 846 subjects.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received at least one prescription for a suspect drug between Jan 1, 2003&#xD;
             and June 30, 2009 (drug initiation period)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who experienced incident DILI event (identified by ALT ≥3xULN or AP ≥2xULN&#xD;
             within 6 months of suspect drug administration) during the first exposure period that:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Resolved to within normal limits of ALT (for hepatocellular &amp; mixed) or AP (for&#xD;
                  cholestatic) within 180 days or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Resolved to ALT &lt; 3xULN (for hepatocellular &amp; mixed) within 90 days or AP&lt;2xULN&#xD;
                  (for cholestatic) within 180 days or&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Dropped by ≥50% of (Peak ALT - ULN) for hepatocellular or of (Peak AP - ULN) for&#xD;
                  cholestatic or mixed within 180 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who were rechallenged with the same suspect drug; rechallenge will include&#xD;
             first rechallenge event for the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who were 18 years of age or older at the time of the first drug dispensing&#xD;
             (index date) during the drug initiation period Jan 1, 2003 and June 30, 2009. Each&#xD;
             patient's first prescription for the study drugs during the drug initiation period&#xD;
             will be identified as index prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who had health insurance coverage with full medical, pharmacy and lab&#xD;
             benefits at the index date.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients meeting the definition of chronic liver injury and exhibiting persistent&#xD;
             ALT≥3xULN or AP or bilirubin ≥2xULN within 90 days after initial injury&#xD;
