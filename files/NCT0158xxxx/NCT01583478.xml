      The objective of the study is to compare the efficacy and duration of escalating doses of&#xD;
      IncobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin®) in the treatment of glabellar rhytids (frown lines between the&#xD;
      eyes). Fifteen subjects will be enrolled in the study; specifically 60 male or female&#xD;
      patients 18 years of age or older with moderate to severe glabellar rhytids at maximum&#xD;
      contracture. Each patient will be randomized to receive one of 5 doses of Xeomin®, in a&#xD;
      one-time dose to the treatment area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy endpoints will be determined by investigator and subject live assessment of the&#xD;
      glabellar rhytids at rest and maximum contraction at each visit (every other day for 6 days&#xD;
      post-injection, every month for 9 months following) using a validated 4 point photographic&#xD;
      scale (minimal wrinkles [0], mild wrinkles [1], moderate wrinkles [2], or severe wrinkles&#xD;
      [3]) used in previous studies. A written description of each photograph will be included to&#xD;
      help standardize the application of the Photographic Scale.&#xD;

      Introduction Previously FDA-approved Botulinum type A toxins have been utilized in the upper&#xD;
      face to treat glabellar rhytids for nearly two decades. Botox® Cosmetic (Allergan, Irvine,&#xD;
      CA), is the first FDA-approved Botulinum toxin type A to be approved in the United States for&#xD;
      the treatment of glabellar rhytids. Its efficacy and safety have been proven in multiple&#xD;
      studies. Approximately two years ago, Dysport® (Medicis, Scottsdale, AZ) also received FDA&#xD;
      approval for the treatment of dynamic glabellar rhytids. While both products have been on the&#xD;
      market in Europe for over two decades, they have only been used in the United States for&#xD;
      cosmetic applications for the past ten years. Xeomin® (Merz Pharmaceuticals, Frankfurt,&#xD;
      Germany), at first, obtained FDA approval for the treatment of cervical dystonia and&#xD;
      blepharospasm - two applications which the previous two botulinum type A toxins&#xD;
      (onabotulinumtoxinA and abobotulinumtoxinA) had initially received prior to cosmetic&#xD;
      approval. More recently, Xeomin® has been approved for cosmetic use. This study aims to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of varying doses of incobotulinumtoxinA in the treatment of glabellar&#xD;
      rhytids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Cosmetic procedures have been in increasing demand to reverse the appearance of&#xD;
      advancing age, particularly procedures that improve the appearance of the aging face.&#xD;
      Noninvasive procedures with little to no downtime that offer significant improvement to the&#xD;
      aging appearance of the skin and underlying musculature are often preferred procedures to&#xD;
      surgical options. Although no procedure is entirely risk free, continuing research is&#xD;
      required to provide a safe and efficacious approach to aesthetic procedures for treating the&#xD;
      aging face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are five factors that contribute to the appearance of the aging face,1 there&#xD;
      are two anatomical units that most influence the appearance of facial rhytids: the skin and&#xD;
      its underlying musculature. Many therapies have evolved to treat rhytids including&#xD;
      resurfacing, topical preparations, soft tissue injectable fillers, and lastly, botulinum&#xD;
      toxin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relaxation of facial musculature is routinely accomplished for cosmetic use by the use of&#xD;
      Clostridium botulinum type A (BoNT-A). Clostridium botulinum type A toxin reduces the&#xD;
      recruitment of specific muscle groups. Many studies have been published in peer-reviewed&#xD;
      medical journals regarding the cosmetic use of this biologic.2-11 Clostridium botulinum in&#xD;
      the form of Botox® Cosmetic (onabotulinumtoxinA) is FDA-approved for cosmetic use in the&#xD;
      treatment of rhytids in the glabellar region. Dysport® (abobotulinumtoxinA) has been used&#xD;
      similarly to treat the glabellar region received FDA approval in 2009. Xeomin®&#xD;
      (incobotulinumtoxinA) received FDA approval in October 2010 for the treatment of cervical&#xD;
      dystonia and blepharospasm, and has been used globally since 2005. Several studies have noted&#xD;
      its efficacy in these clinical applications.12-16 More recently, Xeomin®&#xD;
      (incobotulinumtoxinA) obtained FDA approval in July 2011 for cosmetic use. Its maker employs&#xD;
      a manufacturing process which has isolated the active protein and eliminated accessory&#xD;
      proteins present in other formulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have demonstrated the effect of botulinum toxin on facial rhytids produced by&#xD;
      underlying coordinated muscle groups. Those of the glabellar area, upper forehead, lower&#xD;
      forehead, periocular and perinasal area are particularly well-documented. Previous reports of&#xD;
      Dysport® and Botox® Cosmetic medications show effective relaxation of glabellar rhytids after&#xD;
      injection.12-17&#xD;
&#xD;
      Xeomin® is generally well-tolerated, although side effects may occur, such as temporary&#xD;
      paralysis of adjacent muscle groups close to those injected, which may be due to local spread&#xD;
      of toxin from the injection site and /or misplaced injections. Most side effects are mild or&#xD;
      moderate severity, and of limited duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common adverse event (AE) seen following the use of Dysport®, Botox® Cosmetic or&#xD;
      Xeomin® for the treatment of blepharospasm is ptosis. Some patients have reported diplopia or&#xD;
      symptoms resulting from the spread of effect to mid-facial muscles. Other AEs reported were&#xD;
      injection site reaction, skin rashes, influenza-like symptoms, dry eyes, tearing, bruising,&#xD;
      and eyelid swelling. Reversible ophthalmoplegia has been reported after excessive dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown safety of high doses of botulinum toxin type A for the treatment of&#xD;
      spasticity and hyperhydrosis in both children and adults with doses ranging from 400 to&#xD;
      upwards of 1200 units in a single-dose injection.18,19&#xD;
&#xD;
      No clinical studies have been conducted in North America to determine the optimal dosing of&#xD;
      Xeomin® for cosmetic use in the glabellar area. Though the manufacturers of Xeomin® purported&#xD;
      a 1:1 dosage ratio with Botox® Cosmetic, this conversion has not been demonstrated or proven&#xD;
      in facial cosmetic applications. This study intends to compare varying doses of&#xD;
      incobotulinumtoxinA in the treatment of glabellar rhytids to assess which dosage is the most&#xD;
      optimal in terms of efficacy and duration of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Agents Xeomin® is supplied as a 100 unit vial of Clostridium botulinum type A&#xD;
      exotoxin, sterilely prepared and vacuum-dried without preservatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration Eligible patients will receive Xeomin® doses of escalating-units divided among&#xD;
      5 injection points (0.25 mL total) in the glabellar region on Day 0 of the study, as&#xD;
      described in the instructions section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Study Purposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For study purposes, only one injection session will be performed at Day 0 of the study.&#xD;
      Subsequent follow-up visits will only monitor the effects of the single injection session at&#xD;
      time 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Packaging, Labeling, and Storage Commercially-available active drug (Xeomin®) vials, bearing&#xD;
      a unique lot number, will be obtained from Merz Pharmaceuticals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medications may be maintained during transit and storage within a temperature range of&#xD;
      20o to 25o C, refrigerated within a temperature range of 2o to 8o C or frozen within a&#xD;
      temperature range of -20o to -10o C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug accountability The investigator will administer study medication only to patients&#xD;
      included in this study and following the procedures set out in this study protocol. Each&#xD;
      dispensing will be documented in the CRFs and the study medication dispensing log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant Medications and Treatments Any medication the patient takes other than the study&#xD;
      medication specified in the protocol is considered a concomitant medication. This applies to&#xD;
      prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, and to herbal supplements, whether taken&#xD;
      systemically or applied topically. In addition, any treatment the patient receives other than&#xD;
      the study medication is considered a concomitant treatment. This applies to cosmetic&#xD;
      treatments of the face and neck area. All concomitant medications and concomitant treatments&#xD;
      must be recorded in the CRFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prohibited medication classes and treatments are described under &quot;Exclusion Criteria&quot;. In the&#xD;
      event that a prohibited treatment (e.g. microdermabrasion, Intense Pulse Light,&#xD;
      light-emitting diodes, or radio-frequency) is received, it must be documented on the CRFs.&#xD;
&#xD;

           (day 360). If patients are assessed and have returned to baseline at any visit prior to&#xD;
           Visit 15, then they will be seen at their next two sequential follow-up visits to allow&#xD;
           for any possible variations in assessment or adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Study Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy and duration endpoints will be determined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigator's live assessment of glabellar rhytids at maximum contraction and at&#xD;
           rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary adverse event endpoints will be determined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient's assessment of any symptoms experienced between follow-up visits as&#xD;
           recorded on the CRF.&#xD;
