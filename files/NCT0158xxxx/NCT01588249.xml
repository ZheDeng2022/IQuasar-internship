  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cough is a frequent symptom in children and infants and is one of the most common reasons&#xD;
      parents visit a healthcare provider for their child. The US Food and Drug Administration has&#xD;
      issued a warning that over-the-counter cough and cold medicines including antihistamines,&#xD;
      decongestants, anti-tussives, and expectorants should not be administered to children younger&#xD;
      than 2 years of age due not only to lack of proven efficacy, but also because of important&#xD;
      safety concerns. A product that has been used in alternative medicine for cough is maple&#xD;
      syrup. Although no studies have formally evaluated the use of maple syrup for nocturnal cough&#xD;
      associated with URI, the demulcent effect of maple syrup may provide some relief from cough&#xD;
      in children. A novel formulation of pasteurized maple cough syrup, when compared to placebo,&#xD;
      should provide superior relief on nocturnal cough and the sleep difficulty associated with&#xD;
      URI in children under 12 months and sleep difficulty of their parent/caregiver.&#xD;

             Likert scale) for a minimum of 2 of the 3 questions related to nocturnal cough&#xD;
             frequency, effect on child's sleep, and effect on parental/caregiver sleep based on&#xD;
             the previous night's symptoms (see Section 11.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Parent/legal authorized representative provides written informed consent for child to&#xD;
