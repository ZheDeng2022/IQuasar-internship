      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an approved surgery for certain movement disorders, like&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease, that do not respond well to other treatments. DBS uses a battery-powered&#xD;
      device called a neurostimulator (like a pacemaker) that is placed under the skin in the&#xD;
      chest. It is used to stimulate the areas of the brain that affect movement. Stimulating these&#xD;
      areas helps to block the nerve signals that cause abnormal movements. Researchers also want&#xD;
      to record the brain function of people with movement disorders during the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study how DBS surgery affects Parkinson s disease, dystonia, and tremor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain information on brain and nerve cell function during DBS surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People at least 18 years of age who have movement disorders, like Parkinson's disease,&#xD;
      essential tremor, and dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will screen patients with physical and neurological exams to decide whether&#xD;
           they can have the surgery. Patients will also have a medical history, blood tests,&#xD;
           imaging studies, and other tests. Before the surgery, participants will practice&#xD;
           movement and memory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During surgery, the stimulator will be placed to provide the right amount of stimulation&#xD;
           for the brain. Patients will perform the movement and memory tests that they practiced&#xD;
           earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After surgery, participants will recover in the hospital. They will have a followup&#xD;
           visit within 4 weeks to turn on and adjust the stimulator. The stimulator has to be&#xD;
           programmed and adjusted over weeks to months to find the best settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will return for followup visits at 1, 2, and 3 months after surgery.&#xD;
           Researchers will test their movement, memory, and general quality of life. Each visit&#xD;
           will last about 2 hours.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this protocol is to provide DBS surgery and to collect physiology and&#xD;
      efficacy data related to DBS therapy and motor and cognitive function in people with&#xD;
      medically refractory Parkinson s disease (PD), dystonia, and essential tremor (ET). All&#xD;
      treatment under this protocol will be based on the current standard of care for DBS surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years and older with medically refractory PD, dystonia and/or ET may participate&#xD;
      in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment that is rendered in this protocol is standard of care for PD, dystonia, and ET.&#xD;
      Patients confirmed to have medically refractory PD, dystonia or ET will be offered DBS. The&#xD;
      therapeutic goal of this procedure is to implant chronically stimulating macroelectrodes in&#xD;
      the basal ganglia or thalamic nuclei in order to alleviate the symptoms of PD, dystonia or&#xD;
      ET. Pre- and post-operative imaging will be used to precisely localize electrode locations&#xD;
      within the brain and will be correlated with measures of clinical efficacy and recorded&#xD;
      intra-operative neural activity. Intra-operative microelectrode recordings, as well as micro-&#xD;
      and macroelectrode electrical stimulation, will be used to confirm positioning of electrode&#xD;
      leads. Intra-operative electrode recordings will also be used to investigate the&#xD;
      neurophysiological mechanisms of deep brain stimulation and to explore the neural circuits&#xD;
      underlying motor and cognitive processing in the basal ganglia. Intraoperative physiology&#xD;
      will be used for clinical and research purposes. Patients will be followed for 3 months after&#xD;
      the surgical procedure to determine effectiveness of DBS treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this protocol is to determine the physiology and efficacy of DBS surgery&#xD;
      for movement disorders. Efficacy outcome measures include the change in motor symptoms, as&#xD;
      measured by the UPDRS III scale, the Burke-Fahn-Marsden (BFM) dystonia rating scale, and the&#xD;
      Tremor Rating Scale before and 3 months after treatment. Secondary measures include 1) levels&#xD;
      of effective drug therapy before and after surgery; 2) change in behavior and performance of&#xD;
      activities of daily living; 3) complications of therapy as measured by the UPDRS I, II, and&#xD;
      IV scales before and after surgery and the SF-12 score; 4) radiographic correlation of DBS&#xD;
      electrode position and clinical changes; and 5) neurophysiological mechanisms of DBS and&#xD;
      motor and cognitive function in the basal ganglia.&#xD;
