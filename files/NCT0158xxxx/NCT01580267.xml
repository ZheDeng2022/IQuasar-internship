      Anemia (decreased number of red blood cells) is common in critically ill trauma patients&#xD;
      admitted to an Intensive Care Unit and is associated with a high rate of blood transfusions.&#xD;
      This &quot;anemia of inflammation&quot; is a result of three mechanisms: impaired iron regulation,&#xD;
      shortened red blood cell life span, and reduced rate of erythropoiesis (a protein that helps&#xD;
      make new red blood cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepcidin, a protein made in the liver, regulates iron and is decreased when iron in the blood&#xD;
      is low. This can lead to anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is being conducted to learn how inflammation, hepcidin, and&#xD;
      erythropoietin interact in critically ill patients. The findings will help in determining&#xD;
      effective treatment for patients with anemia of inflammation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Anemia is common in trauma patients and is associated with a high rate of blood transfusion.&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of this anemia is &quot;anemia of inflammation&quot; and develops via 3 mechanisms:&#xD;
      impaired iron regulation, shortened red blood cell life span, and reduced rate of&#xD;
      erythropoiesis. Once iron enters cells (enterocytes and macrophages), the iron export protein&#xD;
      ferroportin controls egress. Hepcidin, a peptide made in the liver, is the key regulator of&#xD;
      iron homeostasis. Hepcidin binds to ferroportin, leading to its ultimate degradation.&#xD;
      Hepcidin reduces iron availability via 2 mechanisms: decreased absorption of iron across the&#xD;
      GI tract and decreased release of iron from the reticuloendothelial system. It therefore&#xD;
      induces a functional iron deficiency by shuttling iron into the macrophages and making it&#xD;
      unavailable for erythropoiesis. Hepcidin is decreased by iron deficiency, most anemias, and&#xD;
      tissue hypoxia. Hepcidin is upregulated by iron excess and inflammation. Hepcidin likely&#xD;
      plays an important role in the acute inflammatory response that occurs with trauma. However,&#xD;
      no studies have measured hepcidin in critically ill trauma patients. If serum hepcidin levels&#xD;
      are elevated in trauma, this will confirm that inability to use existing iron stores is part&#xD;
      of, if not key to, the anemia of trauma and critical illness. This has important implications&#xD;
      since the use of blood transfusion for anemia treatment may further induce an inflammatory&#xD;
      response with resultant suppression of native erythropoiesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that hepcidin will be increased and erythropoietin decreased&#xD;
      early after trauma and that resolution of anemia will not occur until late (28-31 days). By&#xD;
      measuring time-dependent changes in hemoglobin, hepcidin, cytokine, and erythropoietin&#xD;
      concentrations in trauma patients, the investigators can critically examine the&#xD;
      inter-relationships to target potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment and&#xD;
      amelioration of anemia in trauma and critical care.&#xD;
