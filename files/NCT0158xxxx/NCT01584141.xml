      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Lymphoma rates in Asia have been lower than in the West, but rates have been rising in&#xD;
      recent years. Most studies of lymphoma patients have been conducted in the West. Less&#xD;
      information is available about the factors that might contribute to the rise of lymphoma in&#xD;
      Asia. Researchers want to collect medical and personal histories and samples from people who&#xD;
      have recently been diagnosed with lymphoma. This information will help them study possible&#xD;
      reasons for this increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect samples and histories as part of an introductory study of lymphoma in Asia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People between 18 and 79 years of age who have entered study hospitals in Hong Kong,&#xD;
           Taiwan, and mainland China for treatment for any type of lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers between 18 and 79 who have never had lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will provide blood samples and cheek cell samples for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete a questionnaire about their personal health history. They&#xD;
           will answer questions about exposures to chemicals like pesticides. They will also be&#xD;
           asked about family medical history and work and residential history. Finally they will&#xD;
           answer questions about lifestyle factors like diet and exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will give permission for the researchers to see their medical records. Researchers&#xD;
           will also have access to any tumor samples collected as part of treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The contribution of environmental, occupational and genetic factors to lymphoma has generated&#xD;
      a series of novel findings in studies of Caucasians. However, none of the chemical&#xD;
      associations have been conclusively established and the identification of the key, functional&#xD;
      alleles in gene regions associated with risk of NHL requires further elucidation. Further,&#xD;
      the ability to follow-up, confirm, and extend these observations is limited by the low&#xD;
      prevalence and limited range of several important chemical exposures and the high to complete&#xD;
      linkage disequilibrium among key candidate genetic loci in Western populations. To optimize&#xD;
      the ability to build on and clarify these findings, it is necessary to investigate&#xD;
      populations that differ from Caucasians in both exposure patterns and underlying genetic&#xD;
      structure. A multidisciplinary case-control study of lymphoma in Asia provides an opportunity&#xD;
      to replicate and extend recent and novel observations made in studies among Caucasians in a&#xD;
      population that is distinctly different with regard to patterns of key risk factors,&#xD;
      including range of exposures, prevalence of exposures, correlations between exposures, and&#xD;
      variation in gene regions of particular interest. Thus, a hospital-based case-control study&#xD;
      of lymphoma in Eastern Asia (i.e., AsiaLymph) of 4,200 cases and 4,200 controls to be&#xD;
      enrolled over a three-year period will be conducted. In addition, 2,000 cases of myeloid&#xD;
      leukemias and an additional 2,400 cases with less common lymphoma subtypes will be enrolled&#xD;
      as well. The major postulated risk factors for evaluation in this study are chemical&#xD;
      exposures (i.e., organochlorines, trichloroethylene, and benzene) and genetic susceptibility.&#xD;
      Other factors potentially related to NHL, such as viral infections, UV exposure, medical&#xD;
      conditions, and other lifestyle factors will also be explored. A particularly noteworthy&#xD;
      aspect of AsiaLymph is central pathology review with immunophenotyping by two of the world s&#xD;
      leading lymphoma pathologists, which will enable accurate analysis of findings by molecular&#xD;
      and histologic subtypes. AsiaLymph represents the optimal next step in the DCEG lymphoma&#xD;
      portfolio. AsiaLymph should confirm and extend previous findings, and yield novel insights&#xD;
      into the causes of lymphoma and leukemia in both Asia and the West.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligible cases will be patients at a participating hospital who are between 18 and 79 years&#xD;
        of age at time of initial diagnosis and admitted or treated with incident diagnoses of any&#xD;
        lymphoid or myeloid neoplasm including all NHL and Hodgkin disease. Although it is&#xD;
        important to understand the etiology of lymphoma in children as well, this undertaking&#xD;
        would require additional hospitals, instruments, expertise, and funding that are not&#xD;
        currently available to our research team. Adults over the age of 80 are generally among the&#xD;
        sickest patients in the hospital and often have multiple comorbidities, which may preclude&#xD;
        their participation in an interview of this length. Cases will be permanent residents of&#xD;
        the general geographic region that is served by the hospital at the time of diagnosis.&#xD;
        Cases will include chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, Waldenstrom&#xD;
        macroglobulinemia, plasmacytoma, multiple myeloma, aggressive NK cell leukemia, cutaneous&#xD;
        lymphomas, myeloid neoplasms, and immunosuppression-associated cases (such as HIV, post&#xD;
        transplant, Methotrexate use).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2,400 lymphoid neoplasm cases will be enrolled with less common subtypes in Asian&#xD;
        populations including Hodgkin disease, multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and&#xD;
        NK/T, T, follicular and marginal zone lymphoma, in order to increase statistical power to&#xD;
        study risk factors for these tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cases with previous diagnosis of lymphoma, such as acute lymphoblastic lymphoma, multiple&#xD;
        myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, are ineligible.&#xD;
