    <textblock>
      Healthy Mothers on the Move (Healthy MOMs), was a prospective randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      that aimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of a healthy lifestyle intervention to reduce&#xD;
      risk factors for obesity and type 2 diabetes. This behavioral intervention was tailored to&#xD;
      the needs of pregnant and postpartum Latino women. This study was conducted between 2004 and&#xD;
      2006 in southwest Detroit.&#xD;

      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intervention group participants will have improved levels of protective behaviors&#xD;
           (improved daily dietary composition and increased level of physical activity) that&#xD;
           reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes compared to control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intervention group participants will have improved their status on clinical measures of&#xD;
           risk for type 2 diabetes (anthropometric and metabolic status) compared to the control&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess whether theory-based variables, including changes in attitudes, behavioral and&#xD;
           control beliefs, perceived social support and behavioral intention change from baseline,&#xD;
           and whether these changes influence behavioral outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To identify aspects of project planning and implementation that contributed to&#xD;
           achievement of behavioral and clinical outcomes. Measures include recruitment, retention&#xD;
           and intervention participation rates, barriers and facilitators of participation; and&#xD;
           community involvement in, and satisfaction with, intervention components and project&#xD;
           activities; and fidelity of intervention components.&#xD;
