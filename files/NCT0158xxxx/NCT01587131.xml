  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether FVH1, a DNA-based influenza vaccine, will&#xD;
      be safe and generally well tolerated in healthy elderly adult volunteers and will result in&#xD;
      greater immunogenicity when used to prime the immune response to a dose of a trivalent&#xD;
      inactivated seasonal vaccine.&#xD;

      The use of DNA plasmids containing genes that express viral antigens may be a promising way&#xD;
      to formulate a vaccine that can effectively prevent infection and disease caused by the H1N1&#xD;
      influenza virus. Plasmid vectors are simple to construct and are easy to manufacture at a&#xD;
      relatively low cost. Vaccination with plasmids that express influenza proteins should induce&#xD;
      the development of serum antibodies and might also induce significant quantities of secretory&#xD;
      IgA antibodies and/or CMI. The DNA sequences included in the vaccine could also result in the&#xD;
      proliferation of T lymphocytes that could broaden the effectiveness of the vaccine to include&#xD;
      variant strains of H1N1 with antigenically modified HA (i.e., drifted strains).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroporation (EP) is a technology in which a transmembrane electrical field is applied to&#xD;
      increase the permeability of cell membranes to create microscopic pathways (pores) and&#xD;
      thereby enhance the uptake of drugs, vaccines, or other agents into target cells. Their&#xD;
      presence allows macromolecules, ions, and water to pass from one side of the membrane to the&#xD;
      other. The presence of a constant field influences the kinetics of directional translocation&#xD;
      of the macromolecular plasmid, such that the plasmid delivery in vivo has been sufficient to&#xD;
      achieve physiological levels of secreted proteins. ID injection of a plasmid followed by EP&#xD;
      has been used very successfully to deliver therapeutic genes that encode for a variety of&#xD;
      hormones, cytokines, or enzymes in a variety of species. EP is currently being used in humans&#xD;
      to deliver cancer vaccines and therapeutics as well as in gene therapy. The expression levels&#xD;
      are increased by as much as 3 orders of magnitude over plasmid injection alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of EP via the CELLECTRA® device should increase the expression of H1N1 influenza&#xD;
      virus genes in the study vaccine.&#xD;
