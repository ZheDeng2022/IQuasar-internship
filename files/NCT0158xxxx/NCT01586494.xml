  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of single oral doses of&#xD;
      ULTRAM Extended Release (ER) at 2 dose levels in children between 7 and 11 years old,&#xD;
      inclusive (up to 11 years 364 days) with pain due to injury or nonmalignant disease, to the&#xD;
      PK in adults, with respect to the PK parameter AUC∞ (area under the curve) of racemic&#xD;
      tramadol. PK explores how the drug is absorbed in the body, distributed within the body, and&#xD;
      how it is removed from the body over time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention),&#xD;
      2-group, single dose study. Within each group of participants for Parts 1 and 2, at least 1/3&#xD;
      of the participants will be female, at least 1/3 of the participants will be male, at least&#xD;
      1/3 of the participants will be below the age of 8 years, and at least 1/3 of the&#xD;
      participants will be above the age of 10 years. Participants will be assigned to 1 group&#xD;
      only. Each group of participants will receive a single oral dose of ULTRAM ER on 1 occasion.&#xD;
      Group 1 will receive a dose of ULTRAM ER that is closest to 2 mg/kg, based on the&#xD;
      participant's body weight and adjusting the dose in 25 mg increments. Following completion of&#xD;
      all evaluations of Group 1, the pharmacokinetic data will be evaluated to target a dose for&#xD;
      Group 2 that will achieve a level of exposure similar to that seen with a single 200 mg&#xD;
      ULTRAM ER dose in adults. The maximum dose of ULTRAM ER should not exceed 6 mg/kg or 300 mg.&#xD;
      When the study physician, the investigators, and the medical monitors agree that the PK of&#xD;
      the drug is well-characterized and that the drug is well tolerated, enrollment will begin for&#xD;
      Group 2 of the study. The sponsor's responsible Medical Officer will evaluate the safety of&#xD;
      the calculated dose in Group 2 participants by evaluation of adverse drug events paying&#xD;
      particular attention to events suggestive of either opioid toxicity or serotonin toxicity.&#xD;
