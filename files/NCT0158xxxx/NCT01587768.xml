      The studies described in this protocol are all performed within the framework of PROTECT&#xD;
      (Pharmacoepidemiological Research on Outcomes of Therapeutics by a European ConsorTium)&#xD;
      Workpackage 2 (WP2) and Workgroup 1. The primary aim of these studies is to develop, test and&#xD;
      disseminate methodological standards for the design, conduct and analysis of&#xD;
      Pharmacoepidemiological (PE) studies applicable to different safety issues and using&#xD;
      different data sources. To achieve this, results from PE studies on 5 key adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs) performed in different databases will be evaluated. Therefore, emphasis will be on the&#xD;
      methodological aspects of the studies in this protocol and not on the clinical consequences&#xD;
      of the association under investigation. The standards to develop will contribute to&#xD;
      decreasing the discrepancies in results from different studies in the future and increase the&#xD;
      usefulness and reliability of these studies for benefit-risk assessment in the EU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to assess the association between antibiotics use and idiopathic acute liver&#xD;
      injury with different study designs (descriptive, cohort, nested case-control and case&#xD;
      crossover) across different primary care databases and to compare the results between&#xD;
      databases, across designs to evaluate the impact of design/database/population differences on&#xD;
      the outcome of the studied association.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims (in each database):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe characteristics, clinical features, and risk factors for acute liver injury&#xD;
           in patients exposed and unexposed to antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To estimate the overall risk of acute liver injury associated with antibiotics exposure&#xD;
           (users and non-users) in each database&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To estimate the risk of acute liver injury associated with various antibiotics classes&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To estimate the risk of acute liver injury associated with specific individual&#xD;
           antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess the effect of dose and duration of use for specific individual antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To compare the results of a case-control study with the results of a retrospective&#xD;
           cohort study and self-controlled case series study in the different databases&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed studies will be collected in populations from the following databases: The&#xD;
      General Practice Research Database [GPRD] (UK), Health Improvement Network [THIN] (UK), BIFAP&#xD;
      [Base de datos Informatizada para estudios Farmacoepidemiologicos en Atencion Primaria]&#xD;
      (Spain)- the Bavarian Claims Database (Germany), Mondriaan (Netherlands), and the National&#xD;
      Databases of Denmark.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute liver injury is one of the most important safety concerns, being the leading cause for&#xD;
      drug withdrawal from the market on safety grounds. For most suspected hepatotoxic drugs the&#xD;
      only existing information comes from spontaneous reports, lacking appropriate risk&#xD;
      quantification through formal epidemiological studies. A few population-based studies&#xD;
      examining the risk of acute and clinically relevant liver injury among users of various drugs&#xD;
      have been published, reporting an elevated risk of liver injury in users of antibiotics. As&#xD;
      acute liver injury is often idiosyncratic and because its diagnostic criteria used in&#xD;
      epidemiological studies have been variable, the reported range of incidences of acute liver&#xD;
      injury caused by antibiotics is broad. In the United Kingdom (UK), case-control studies&#xD;
      investigating the effect of antibiotics on acute liver injury have generated odds ratios&#xD;
      ranging from 94.8 for the combination of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid to 6.2 for&#xD;
      tetracyclines. Age, sex, alcohol intake, concomitant medication and comorbidities have been&#xD;
      proposed as risk factors for antibiotic induced liver injury and may have influenced the&#xD;
      quantification of risk estimates. In the present protocol, we propose to further quantify the&#xD;
      risk of acute liver injury associated with antibiotics in the general population using&#xD;
      different study designs and in different primary care databases, and to compare the results&#xD;
      to evaluate the impact of design and population differences on the outcome of the study&#xD;
      association.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute liver injury or hepatotoxicity in this study implies chemical, drug driven liver damage&#xD;
      which can be classified based on clinical presentation and laboratory features ranging from&#xD;
      asymptomatic mild biochemical abnormalities to acute liver failure. The most common&#xD;
      classification used for drug induced liver injury (DILI) is according to laboratory&#xD;
      abnormalities (hepatocellular, cholestatic or mixed) and according to mechanism of toxicity&#xD;
      (direct, immune-mediated, idiosyncratic, or mitochondrial toxicity). Being idiosyncratic in&#xD;
      most cases, reactions often cannot be reproduced experimentally in laboratory animals. The&#xD;
      relationship between the dose and the occurrence or severity of the reaction is not constant,&#xD;
      and the latent period between drug exposure and sensitivity reaction is rather variable. The&#xD;
      infrequency of DILI, though with significant impact, and complicated case ascertainment in&#xD;
      pharmacoepidemiological studies has led to wide ranges of reported incidence rates. A recent&#xD;
      study, using data from the GPRD database, reported crude incidence rates of liver injury&#xD;
      caused by any type of drug ranging from 1 to 18 per 100,000 prescriptions. The Drug-Induced&#xD;
      Liver Injury Network (DILIN), a US based collaboration between academic and health&#xD;
      institutions to study the aetiology and prevention of DILI, found antibiotics to be the&#xD;
      largest class of agents to cause drug-induced liver injury. UK based estimates of incidence&#xD;
      rates of antibiotic induced liver injury range from 2.5 to 8.6 per 100,000 users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotics are a type of antimicrobial used to treat infections and are amongst the twenty&#xD;
      most prescribed drugs in England, with approximately 38.7 million prescriptions dispensed in&#xD;
      2009. The most frequently prescribed type of antibiotics is penicillins, a group of&#xD;
      bactericidal antibiotics that interfere with bacterial cell wall synthesis. Other&#xD;
      bactericidal antibiotics include cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. Antibiotics with&#xD;
      bacteriostatic mechanisms of action, inhibiting the growth or proliferation of bacterial&#xD;
      cells, include tetracyclines, macrolides, sulphonamides and quinolones. Most types of&#xD;
      antibiotics have been associated with drug-induced liver injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver injury accounts for 10% of all adverse reactions to drugs and is the most frequent&#xD;
      reason for withdrawal of medications from the market. This study would provide a valuable&#xD;
      contribution to our current knowledge as drug induced liver injury is the most common cause&#xD;
      of acute liver failure and antibiotics are the largest drug class of agents, with the highest&#xD;
      exposure prevalence, to cause acute liver injury.&#xD;

        The primary source population will be comprised of patients of all ages with an active or&#xD;
        died registration status during the study period of January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2009.&#xD;
        Patients must have attained one year of enrolment with the general practioner (GP) and one&#xD;
        year of computerized prescription history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        From the aforementioned source population, two study cohorts will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The first cohort will include all patients who received at least one antibiotic&#xD;
        prescription during the study period. For this cohort, the date of first prescription of an&#xD;
        antibiotic after meeting the eligibility criteria (entry date) defines the start of&#xD;
        follow-up (start date), for the exposed cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The second cohort will be selected from the same source population among patients who have&#xD;
        not received an antibiotic prescription during the study period and in the year before the&#xD;
        entry date (date when the patient meet the eligibility criteria and enter in the study).&#xD;
