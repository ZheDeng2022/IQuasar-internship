  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will dose galectin 3 in plasma and water rinse of the needle aspiration&#xD;
      biopsy in patients with thyroid nodules. The investigators aim to show that preoperative&#xD;
      dosage of the galectin 3 could provide good diagnosis of malignant versus benign thyroid&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endogenous cell-surface galectins have recently gained interest as antigenic determinants of&#xD;
      varied tumor tissue. They are also used as potential targets for antitumor therapy by&#xD;
      coupling cytotoxic molecules or radioisotopes either with carbohydrate residues, or with&#xD;
      antibodies antigalectines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the plasma level dosage of galectin 3 seems possible and provides a diagnostic&#xD;
      help in thyroid lesions and in monitoring squamous cell head and neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study on thyroid tumors, the sensitivity [Se] and specificity [Sp] of the plasma level&#xD;
      was poor (just over 70%), but this study was conducted with a low and heterogeneous&#xD;
      recruitment (70 patients). The inclusion of a greater number of patients with a better&#xD;
      selection would better inform us about qualities of these diagnostic assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional argument would be the dosage of galectins in the water rinse of the needle&#xD;
      aspiration biopsy. This study has never been made so far and there is no evidence to predict&#xD;
      its sensitivity and specificity. The advantage is that galectin will not be &quot;diluted&quot; as&#xD;
      would be the case in an assay done in the blood. Moreover, it would select candidates for&#xD;
      dosage nodules, ie those whose size would impose, if it was a cancer, to resort to surgical&#xD;
      treatment more extensive than originally planned. Indeed, compared to preoperative already&#xD;
      existing metering &quot;interesting&quot; dosage would diagnose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  with a good reliability (Se and Sp &gt; 80%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a cancer requiring additional treatment (i.e. surgical revision to achieve a total&#xD;
           thyroidectomy, accompanied by lymph node dissection) resulting in a higher risk of&#xD;
           morbidity if reoperation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore believe that preoperative galectin 3 dosage in plasma or in the&#xD;
      puncture water rinse could have strong arguments pointing to a neoplastic to a full initial&#xD;
      gesture in a single surgical step, a gesture much less risky and expensive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients benefit from routine monitoring of thyroid nodules according to&#xD;
      current recommendations. For surgical patients only, the information about the intervention&#xD;
      will be collected to know the final histological diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Galectin 3 will be measured preoperatively in :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  plasma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  water rinse of FNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic characteristics of the assays, sensitivity and specificity will be established&#xD;
      relative to the reference method which is the histological analysis of the specimen (report)&#xD;
      asserting the existence of a vesicular lineage tumor, benign (adenoma) or malignant&#xD;
      (papillary or follicular).&#xD;
