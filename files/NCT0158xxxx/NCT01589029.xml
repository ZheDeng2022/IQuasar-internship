    <textblock>
      The pilot study evaluates the efficacy and safety of Canakinumab (ILARIS®) in subjects with&#xD;
      proliferative diabetic retinopathy secondary to type 1 and 2 diabetes. Ten subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled to receive 150 mg Canakinumab (ILARIS®) by subcutaneous injection. Beginning on day&#xD;
      0, each subject will receive a subcutaneous injection of study drug every 8 weeks for 16&#xD;
      weeks, a total of 3 injections. All subjects will undergo regular follow-up assessments every&#xD;
      8 weeks through 24 weeks. Fluorescein angiography (FA) is repeated every 8 weeks. In case of&#xD;
      progression of retinal neovascularization on FA panretinal laser photocoagulation is&#xD;
      administered as rescue therapy. The primary outcome is the regression of retinal&#xD;
      neovascularizations (NVE and NVD) in FA at 24 weeks. In addition to key secondary outcomes&#xD;
      including regression of diabetic macular edema, change in best-corrected visual acuity,&#xD;
      change in HbA1c levels and change in markers of systemic inflammation. Safety will be&#xD;
      assessed by measurements of vital signs, clinical laboratory assessments, and the recording&#xD;
      of adverse clinical events.&#xD;

        Evidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy with:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Active retinal neovascularization defined by fluorescein angiography as non-high risk&#xD;
             proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDRP; NVD &lt; 1/3 disc area; NVE &lt; ½ disc area) or&#xD;
