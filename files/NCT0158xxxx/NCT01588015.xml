    <textblock>
      This randomized phase I trial studies the side effects of vaccine therapy in preventing&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in patients with hematological malignancies undergoing donor&#xD;
      stem cell transplant. Vaccines made from a tetanus-CMV peptide or antigen may help the body&#xD;
      build an effective immune response and prevent or delay the recurrence of CMV infection in&#xD;
      patients undergoing donor stem cell transplant for hematological malignancies.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To discover whether two administrations of 2.5 mg tetanus (Tet)-CMV&#xD;
      peptide co-injected with 1 mg of PF-03512676 (tetanus-CMV fusion peptide vaccine), by&#xD;
      subcutaneous (SC) route on days 28 and 56 post-hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) are&#xD;
      safe and well tolerated in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) A*0201 CMV-positive recipients of&#xD;
      allogeneic HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To measure levels of CMV-specific T cells in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated HCT&#xD;
      recipients (control arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess whether vaccination of HCT recipients with Tet-CMV co-injected with PF03512676&#xD;
      reduces expression of programmed death 1 (PD-1) on CMV-specific T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive Tet-CMV + PF03512675 SC on days 28 and 56 post-HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo immune monitoring only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 70, 84, 100, 130, 160,&#xD;
      and 180.&#xD;

    <description>Compare levels of CD8+ T cells binding to CMV-specific tetramers in vaccinated and unvaccinated HCT recipients by Wilcoxon rank-sum test, using integrated CMV-specific CD8+ T cells levels over the first 100 days as a numerical outcome. PD-1 expression and levels of apoptosis markers and proliferation of CMV-specific T cells immune-parameters will be compared in both arms using the Kruskall-Wallis rank-sum test.</description>
