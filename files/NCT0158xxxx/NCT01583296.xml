  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research plan involves two aims: 1) Cultural adaptation of the Panic-Asthma Treatment and&#xD;
      2) a randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study. Participants will be primarily recruited&#xD;
      from two major, inner-city hospitals in the Bronx, NY. Diagnosis of Panic Disorder (PD) will&#xD;
      be based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Diagnosis of asthma will be based&#xD;
      on national guidelines. The first year of the project will be devoted to approximately 5&#xD;
      focus groups with Latino (primarily Puerto Rican) participants, pilot treatment and&#xD;
      participant feedback. The protocol will be adapted based on key cultural issues that are&#xD;
      systematically observed during Phase 1. During Years 2-3, 40 participants with PD and asthma&#xD;
      will be randomized into two treatment arms: Panic-Asthma Treatment and an active placebo&#xD;
      condition involving music therapy and paced breathing at resting respiration rates. Each&#xD;
      treatment will involve 8 weekly sessions. An interviewer, who will be blind to treatment&#xD;
      condition, will conduct assessments at pre-treatment, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and&#xD;
      3-month follow-up. The primary hypotheses are that participants in the Panic-Asthma treatment&#xD;
      group will have greater decreases than subjects in the placebo condition on the PD severity&#xD;
      scale and albuterol use (i.e., rescue asthma medication) from pre-test to post-test and&#xD;
      across 3-month follow-up.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma and panic disorder (PD) share strikingly similar phenomenology. Respiratory related&#xD;
      symptoms, such as dyspnea, dizziness, chest tightness, feelings of choking and sensations of&#xD;
      smothering are common in both disorders. The overlap in symptoms between asthma and panic may&#xD;
      lead an individual to mistake a panic attack as an asthma attack. In order to better&#xD;
      understand this overlap, we hypothesized that participants who received Cognitive Behavioral&#xD;
      Psychophysiological Therapy (CBPT) would display greater reductions in PD severity and&#xD;
      improvements in asthma control at post- treatment and 3-month follow-up. We predicted that&#xD;
      improvements in PD severity in the CBPT group would be mediated by reductions in the&#xD;
      perceived physical consequences of anxiety. We selected music therapy and paced breathing at&#xD;
      each participant's average respiration rate for the comparison active treatment. Randomized&#xD;
      participants will undergo either the CBPT or MRT protocol, be given the same psychological&#xD;
      assessments, and have their physiological data collected.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Severity of Panic Disorder as Measured by the Panic Disorder Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Treatment (end of week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>The Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) is a clinician-administered questionnaire used to assess the severity of panic attacks. The PDSS consists of seven items with each ranging in severity from 0 (none) - 4 (extreme); so total score ranges from 0 to 28.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Control Based on Rescue Medication Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Post-Intervention (8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Dosers (electronic devices used to monitor the usage of metered-dose inhalers) were attached to participants' asthma rescue inhalers to count the number of puffs of medication used during the treatment period. Use of rescue medication was then coded as good asthma control (less than or equal to rescue medication use twice a week) or poor control (rescue medication use greater than two days a week) in accordance with national guidelines (NHLBI, 2007).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Post-Intervention (8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI is a 2-item scale rated by clinicians to assesses for a patient's functioning prior and subsequent to the implementation of an intervention. In the current study, the CGI was used to assess panic disorder illness severity in patients as well as identify whether subjects responded to the study intervention. The CGI scale includes a question on level of improvement subsequent to intervention ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse), and a question on severity of illness ranging from 1 (normal) to 6 (among the most extremely ill of patients). To be a treatment responder, a participant had to have a score of 2 (much improved) or better and be rated as a 3 (mild) or less on their illness severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Post-Intervention (8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The ACQ is a self-report questionnaire to assess asthma control based on asthma symptoms, nighttime awakenings, and use of rescue medication for asthma. Each item is given a score from 0 to 6 with lower scores indicating better asthma control. The ACQ total scale score is an average of the item questions, with scores ranging between 0 (well controlled) and 6 (extremely poorly controlled).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication Adherence Report Scale (Adherence to Controller Medications for Asthma)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Post-Intervention (8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report measure of adherence to controller medications with 10 items ranging from 1 (always) to 5 (never). Higher mean scores indicate greater adherence and a score &gt; 4.5 is considered good adherence.</description>

        <title>Change in Severity of Panic Disorder as Measured by the Panic Disorder Severity Scale</title>
        <description>The Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) is a clinician-administered questionnaire used to assess the severity of panic attacks. The PDSS consists of seven items with each ranging in severity from 0 (none) - 4 (extreme); so total score ranges from 0 to 28.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Treatment (end of week 8)</time_frame>
        <population>While 27 participants were allocated to the CBPT intervention, 3 dropped out before the baseline session. Similarly, 26 participants were allocated to the MRT intervention but 2 dropped out before the baseline session. Accordingly, outcome measures were analyzed for the 48 participants (24 in each arm) that completed their baseline sessions.</population>

        <description>Dosers (electronic devices used to monitor the usage of metered-dose inhalers) were attached to participants' asthma rescue inhalers to count the number of puffs of medication used during the treatment period. Use of rescue medication was then coded as good asthma control (less than or equal to rescue medication use twice a week) or poor control (rescue medication use greater than two days a week) in accordance with national guidelines (NHLBI, 2007).</description>

        <description>The CGI is a 2-item scale rated by clinicians to assesses for a patient's functioning prior and subsequent to the implementation of an intervention. In the current study, the CGI was used to assess panic disorder illness severity in patients as well as identify whether subjects responded to the study intervention. The CGI scale includes a question on level of improvement subsequent to intervention ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse), and a question on severity of illness ranging from 1 (normal) to 6 (among the most extremely ill of patients). To be a treatment responder, a participant had to have a score of 2 (much improved) or better and be rated as a 3 (mild) or less on their illness severity.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The main limitations of this study were the small sample size and high drop-out rate (40%). The MARS was not applicable to 25% of participants who were not taking ICS medications. The use of %FEV1 as the sole measure of pulmonary function was limited by its snapshot measure of asthma control. Finally, the findings of this study are specific to a narrow sample of Latinos and may not generalize.</limitations_and_caveats>
