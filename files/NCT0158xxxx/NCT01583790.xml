  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the period 2006-2012 the ICBS-Israeli Center for Bariatric Surgery in Assuta Hospital has&#xD;
      performed about 1500 bariatric surgeries including Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding,&#xD;
      Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy, Laparoscopic Roux en Y Gastric Bypass, and Duodenal switch.&#xD;
      In addition, Pose and BPD procedures were performed.The ICBS team is comprised of a team of&#xD;
      expert senior professionals in the obesity field, made up of the best bariatric surgeons, an&#xD;
      expert endocrinologist who specializes in obesity and diabetes, a team of senior&#xD;
      nutritionists and a supportive psychology team. During that period patients data were&#xD;
      collected as part of the medical practice in the Center and included BMI, co-morbidities,&#xD;
      weight loss programs the patients were involved in, pervious bariatric surgery and quality of&#xD;
      life. During the entire 6 years of follow up data were collected which included weight loss,&#xD;
      resolution of co-morbidity, changes in quality of life etc combined with training for healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate the key factors for surgery success&#xD;
      that includes over 50% of original weight loss, resolution of co-morbidities. Factors that&#xD;
      could affect surgical outcome such as age, repeated surgery, early side effects such as&#xD;
      bleeding, leakage, thrombosis and lung emboli were recorded as well as later side effects&#xD;
      such as herniation of the surgical area, production of gallbladder stones, vitamine&#xD;
      deficiency and requirement of a revision surgery.&#xD;

        The study includes about 1500 patients, 70% female and 30% male. All patients that had&#xD;
        bariatric surgery and were in the follow-up group for longer than one month will take part&#xD;
        in the study. A special emphasis will be given to special population groups such as&#xD;
        adolescents, old patients, patients undergoing revision surgery, and patients that required&#xD;
        a additional type of surgery in conjunction with the bariatric surgery (e.g., gallbladder&#xD;
        removal).&#xD;
