      Extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MZBL) of the mucosa associated lymphoid tissue&#xD;
      (MALT-lymphoma) represents a distinct clinical entity and is the most common form of&#xD;
      extranodal lymphoma, with a predilection for the stomach. About 90% of gastric MALT-lymphomas&#xD;
      are associated with infection with Helicobacter pylori (HP) and eradication of the pathogen&#xD;
      leads to regression of the tumor in a high percentage of patients at early tumour stages.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, following complete remission after HP-eradication, the risk of relapse&#xD;
      justifies lifelong follow-up examinations. Supported by recent findings at the investigators&#xD;
      department, endoscopic controls should include a close examination of the small bowel, as&#xD;
      relapses can involve different gastrointestinal sites. To continue the investigators&#xD;
      diagnostic approach as well as to further improve the detection rate of MALT-lymphoma&#xD;
      relapses, the investigators plan to introduce the novel confocal laser endomicroscope (CLE)&#xD;
      into the diagnostic management of MALT-lymphoma patients. In the context of a prospective&#xD;
      clinical pilot trial the investigators aim to establish MALT-lymphoma specific CLE-markers&#xD;
      that can be used for the in vivo diagnosis of the disease. Comparing endomicroscopic&#xD;
      findings, drawn from the stomach and small bowel of 50 MALT-lymphoma patients who will&#xD;
      undergo staging or follow up endoscopies at the investigators department, to the histological&#xD;
      evaluation of biopsy samples as present gold standard, the investigators want to determine&#xD;
      whether CLE can provide reliable data for the accurate detection of MALT-lymphoma associated&#xD;
      changes. Endomicroscopic aspects of patients with chronic gastritis, gastric adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      and healthy subjects should serve as controls. In comparison to random biopsies which&#xD;
      represent the current standard, the investigators aim to prove, whether endomicroscopy will&#xD;
      find MALT-lymphoma lesions more accurately and thus help to spare patients unnecessary&#xD;
      biopsies.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MZBL) of the mucosa associated lymphoid tissue&#xD;
      (MALT-lymphoma) is the most common form of extranodal lymphoma [1, 2]. Although MALT-lymphoma&#xD;
      may involve different organs, the stomach represents the site of predilection of this&#xD;
      malignant disease. About 90% of gastric MALT-lymphomas are associated with infection with&#xD;
      Helicobacter pylori (HP) [3] and eradication of the pathogen leads to tumor regression in a&#xD;
      high percentage of patients at early tumor stages [4, 5]. Relapses after HP-eradication and&#xD;
      primary advanced tumor stages require chemotherapeutic treatment, radiation therapy and, in&#xD;
      some cases, surgery [6]. Following complete remission lifelong follow-up examinations should&#xD;
      be performed in order to detect relapses [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologically, MALT-lymphoma is characterized by an infiltration of the lamina propria by&#xD;
      lymphomatous centrocyte-like cells that spread into the surrounding mucosal layers [8]. In&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry they show CD 20 positive staining properties. When they spread to lymph&#xD;
      nodes or spleen they accumulate typically within the marginal zone (for this reason they are&#xD;
      classified as &quot;marginal zone lymphoma&quot;) [2]. Dissemination to other organs, especially to&#xD;
      other mucosal sites may occur frequently wherefore detailed diagnostics are required during&#xD;
      MALT-lymphoma staging and follow-up. Spreading within the gastrointestinal tract (GI-tract),&#xD;
      to the small bowel, for example, is rare, but can be assessed very easily with standard&#xD;
      endoscopic procedures as recently reported at our department [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      For gastric MALT-lymphoma gastroscopy with biopsy assessment is the current follow-up&#xD;
      examination of choice. Multiple biopsies should be taken randomly from all gastric sites and&#xD;
      specifically from all suspicious lesions. Recent developments for the enhancement of the&#xD;
      tissue contrast during the endoscopic examinations (chromoendoscopy or Narrow Band Imaging,&#xD;
      for example) helped to detect MALT-lymphoma lesions. Nevertheless, detection rates hardly&#xD;
      changed, since all these techniques rely on the presence of superficial features[10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      An endoscopic technique that allows an evaluation of deeper wall layers is endoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasonography. During the last years it has become an important amending tool in the&#xD;
      diagnostic management of gastric MALT-lymphoma. Although it provides essential information&#xD;
      about tumor infiltration depth and lymph node involvement in the context of staging&#xD;
      procedures, it cannot replace histological assessment during follow-up, since endosonographic&#xD;
      findings do not show a good correlation to histological results over time [11, 12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The newest development that has been introduced in the endoscopic management of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract is the so called confocal laser endomicroscope (CLE). Confocal&#xD;
      microscopy was developed by Marvin Minsky in the late 1950s. Its principle is the microscopic&#xD;
      scanning of focal points below the surface of an object. In comparison to conventional light&#xD;
      microscopy it uses a special filter system to avoid image overlapping by surrounding tissue.&#xD;
      In detail, a light source (normally a laser) is focused by a microscope objective lens to a&#xD;
      diffraction limited spot on or inside the object. Light that is scattered, or fluorescence&#xD;
      excited (achieved through fluorescein staining, for example) and emitted, at the focus in the&#xD;
      sample will partially return back through the optics along the path from which it arrived. A&#xD;
      beam-splitter placed into the path reflects the return light towards a detector. The optics&#xD;
      will focus the light from the focal point in the specimen to its conjugate focus near the&#xD;
      detector (hence the technology is termed &quot;con-focal&quot;). Here a spatial filter (&quot;pinhole&quot;) is&#xD;
      used to extinguish all light deriving from areas outside the focal point. Light reflections&#xD;
      from the focal point itself will be forwarded to the detector which is connected to a&#xD;
      computer system that digitalises the optical signal and creates the in vivo histological&#xD;
      image [13].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focusing on its clinical impact, confocal microscopy is the first technique to allow in vivo&#xD;
      evaluation of tissue structures beneath their surface. Because of many breakthroughs in&#xD;
      miniaturisation (mostly in the 1990s) this technology could be applied for intraluminal use&#xD;
      in gastroenterology, integrated into an otherwise standard endoscope. It allows the in vivo&#xD;
      histological visualisation of the upper 250 micrometers of all walls within the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract, additionally to the normal function of white light endoscopy&#xD;
      (provided by two separate screens on top of the workstation) [13].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The in vivo visualisation of different GI-pathologies led to the first publications on the&#xD;
      clinical use of CLE. Kiesslich et al., as one of the pioneers of the technique, published a&#xD;
      case on live imaging of Helicobacter pylori by CLE in the stomach [14]. At our department we&#xD;
      recently reported the endomicroscopic findings of a patient with Whipple's disease. Detecting&#xD;
      foamy macrophages within the lamina propria which were clearly distinguishable from goblet&#xD;
      cells in the surrounding CLE could provide in vivo histology at the single cell level [15].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessing GI-pathologies more systematically there have been many publications dealing with&#xD;
      the use of CLE in the context of follow-up examinations of conditions that predispose to the&#xD;
      development of malignancies. For Barrett's oesophagus, for example, Kiesslich et al. found&#xD;
      high sensitivity and specificity rates for the detection of Barrett's metaplasia as well as&#xD;
      for the prediction of Barrett's associated neoplastic changes - for both results CLE derived&#xD;
      pictures were compared to conventional histology [16]. In a first prospective, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, controlled, crossover trial Dunbar et al. proved these findings, as&#xD;
      CLE-targeted biopsies had a higher diagnostic yield for Barrett's oesophagus associated&#xD;
      neoplasia than standard endoscopy with 4-quadrant random biopsy [17]. Similar results have&#xD;
      already been published for patients with ulcerative colitis that were routinely screened for&#xD;
      colon cancer. It could be shown that CLE is a useful tool to improve the diagnostic yield. At&#xD;
      the same time, it helped to take conventional biopsies more accurately, which can spare&#xD;
      patients unnecessary biopsies [18].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combining the potential of CLE to improve the diagnostic yield during surveillance with its&#xD;
      properties of scanning the upper 250µm of the GI-wall (which equates nearly the whole depth&#xD;
      of the mucosa) makes it the ideal tool for the diagnostic management of gastric&#xD;
      MALT-lymphoma, where pathologies typically arise from the lamina propria, a deeper layer of&#xD;
      the mucosa [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical pilot study the investigators aim to examine patients with gastric&#xD;
      MALT-lymphoma by confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) in the context of staging or follow-up&#xD;
      endoscopies. To our knowledge no systematic study on the use of CLE in MALT-lymphoma patients&#xD;
      has yet been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators aim to determine whether the diagnosis of MALT-lymphoma can be&#xD;
           achieved by evaluating endomicroscopic features of suspicious lesions of both the&#xD;
           stomach and the small bowel, as these GI-parts are easily accessible by upper endoscopy.&#xD;
           Conventional biopsies from the GI-parts observed should serve as comparable gold&#xD;
           standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Including endomicroscopic results of patients with chronic gastritis, gastric&#xD;
           adenocarcinoma and healthy subjects as controls the investigators aim to establish&#xD;
           MALT-lymphoma specific markers that can be used for a &quot;biopsy-free&quot; in vivo diagnosis of&#xD;
           the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective clinical trial without randomisation or blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients referred to our department for upper endoscopy in the context of staging or&#xD;
      follow-up of gastric MALT-lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients allergic to one of the drug components (including drugs used for conscious&#xD;
           sedation like propofol or midazolam as well as fluorescein, the fluorescent dye used for&#xD;
           CLE )&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  refusal to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patient's age below 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation will be performed at the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology,&#xD;
      Department of Internal Medicine III., in close cooperation with the Division of Oncology,&#xD;
      Department of Internal Medicine I. and the Clinical Institute of Pathology at the Medical&#xD;
      University of Vienna.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this study has been planned as a pilot trial, it mainly focuses on the qualitative&#xD;
      endomicroscopic features drawn from our examinations to yield reference pathologies for&#xD;
      accurate diagnosis in the future. Nevertheless, a quantitative analysis will be performed by&#xD;
      comparing CLE-derived diagnoses with histological results to calculate sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of CLE based MALT-lymphoma diagnosis. Based on current incidence and relapse&#xD;
      rates of the disease the investigators estimated to include 50 patients in order to get a&#xD;
      meaningful patient sample for qualitative and quantitative analysis. Given the current number&#xD;
      of MALT-lymphoma patients who undergo staging or follow-up endoscopies at the investigational&#xD;
      site, this patient sample can be included within a period of two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who fulfill the listed inclusion criteria, will receive the patient information&#xD;
      form of this study together with the usual informed consent form of the respective endoscopic&#xD;
      examination they are about to undergo. Patient information will be done at least 24 hours&#xD;
      before the intervention, as practised at our unit. If the patient agrees to participate in&#xD;
      the study he will be prepared for endoscopy with our confocal laser endomicroscope (Pentax&#xD;
      EC3870K with the ISC-1000 confocal endomicroscopy processor - Pentax, Tokyo, Japan and&#xD;
      Optiscan Pty Ltd, Notting Hill, Victoria, Australia) by administration of intravenous&#xD;
      propofol and/or midazolam as routinely used for conscious sedation during endoscopic&#xD;
      procedures at our department. Additionally, 5-10 ml of a 10% solution of fluorescein sodium&#xD;
      will be administered intravenously to enhance tissue fluorescence during endomicroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All drugs will be administered by medical specialists, assistant doctors or registered&#xD;
      nurses, as routinely practiced at our institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLE picture capturing will start at the deepest point reachable in the small bowel. During&#xD;
      withdrawal of the scope CLE pictures will be taken every 10 centimetres in the small bowel,&#xD;
      then from the antrum and body of the stomach and from the esophagus. Furthermore, CLE will be&#xD;
      applied for distinct looking areas, suspicious of pathologic origin. Wherever CLE pictures&#xD;
      are obtained, a conventional biopsy will be taken from the same localisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLE pictures will be captured and stored routinely using our standard data management system.&#xD;
      They will be evaluated immediately during the endoscopic procedure together with a board&#xD;
      certified GI-pathologist, who will establish an initial diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional biopsies will be processed and evaluated according to the criteria as outlined&#xD;
      in the recent WHO-classification for MALT-lymphoma. In all patients, immunologic phenotyping&#xD;
      on paraffin sections will be done for demonstration of light chain restriction and for the&#xD;
      phenotype CD20+CD5-CD10-cyclinD1- which, in context with the microscopic appearance, is&#xD;
      consistent with MALT-lymphoma. In addition, all patients will be assessed for MALT-lymphoma&#xD;
      specific translocations, especially t(11;18)(q21;q21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endomicroscopic controls (patients with chronic gastritis, gastric adenocarcinoma and healthy&#xD;
      subjects) will be collected from present data of endomicroscopic procedures already performed&#xD;
      within routine examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study all CLE pictures and histological cuts will be evaluated separately&#xD;
      by two blinded board certified pathologists. In case of discordant diagnoses they will&#xD;
      analyse the respective cases together to reach an agreement on the final diagnosis. All cases&#xD;
      where the initial and the final diagnosis are deviating from each other will be re-evaluated&#xD;
      together by all specialists involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical implications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confocal laser endomicroscopy is a safe new technique that has already been studied in&#xD;
      clinical trials [16, 17]. Its safety is being guaranteed by the use of low intensity laser&#xD;
      light that can at worst cause local bleaching of fluorescein containing cells, which is&#xD;
      harmless, reversible and even used as diagnostic sign in experimental conditions [13].&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study protocol had been already approved by the ethics commission of the Medical&#xD;
      University of Vienna. All procedures in the context of this study will be performed in&#xD;
      accordance to the Declaration of Helsinki as well as to the guidelines for Good Scientific&#xD;
      Practice (GSP) of the Medical University of Vienna.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected impact and Outlook&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the investigators find MALT-lymphoma specific markers that can be used for a &quot;biopsy-free&quot;&#xD;
      in vivo diagnosis, this could lead to another reduction of invasive procedures for the&#xD;
      affected patients which may have an important clinical impact, as biopsy assessment is often&#xD;
      limited by the rather bad coagulation status of oncologic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case the study aims will be supported by the results of this pilot trial, a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial comparing in vivo diagnosis to conventional histological assessment in&#xD;
      matters of diagnostic yield will be performed.&#xD;
