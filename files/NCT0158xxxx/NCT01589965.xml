  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The HIV/AIDS epidemic is a major concern in many countries. The epidemic is especially acute&#xD;
      in Lesotho where roughly one quarter of the population is infected by HIV/AIDS. In Lesotho,&#xD;
      and elsewhere, new innovative approaches to induce safer sexual behavior have been&#xD;
      desperately called for, particularly in view of the limited impact that existing prevention&#xD;
      schemes have had on the trajectory of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the key questions is to understand why individuals get involved in short-term risky&#xD;
      sexual behavior when the potential long-term cost of becoming HIV infected is so high? A&#xD;
      follow-up question is what replicable and feasible interventions can affect this trade-off&#xD;
      between short and long run returns? The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether the&#xD;
      use of short-term financial incentives can affect this trade-off, thereby influencing young&#xD;
      individuals' decisions with respect to sexual and reproductive health behavior, and thus in&#xD;
      the end reduce HIV incidence rates. The investigators will study this question using a sample&#xD;
      of population attending served by New Start Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) sites that&#xD;
      a local NGO, Population Service International (PSI), has already implemented in Lesotho.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test whether adding a&#xD;
      financial incentive to remain STI-negative in the form of a lottery can promote safer sexual&#xD;
      activity. The lotteries will work as follows: if the individual is tested negative on a set&#xD;
      of curable STIs, she will get a lottery ticket with the chance to win a &quot;big&quot; prize. If she&#xD;
      is tested positive, she will receive free treatment, but no lottery ticket. If an individual&#xD;
      who tested positive is cured, she can come back in the lottery system and get a later chance&#xD;
      to win the lottery ticket if she remains STI-negative. The outcome will be to measure the&#xD;
      impact of financial incentives on HIV incidence after two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this research project will be disseminated through academic and non-academic&#xD;
      conferences, workshops, publications in academic journals, and also in policy journals with&#xD;
      the aim to reach out to policy makers outside the research community.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lesotho has the third-highest HIV prevalence in the world at 23.2%. Many HIV prevention&#xD;
      initiatives are currently going on in the country. The proposed impact evaluation responds to&#xD;
      the urgent need to find innovative approaches to promote safer sexual behaviors among youths&#xD;
      in Lesotho. In particular, the project will be implemented through the New Start Voluntary&#xD;
      Counseling and Testing (VCT) sites established by PSI in the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PSI, the implementing agency, has 5 static New Start VCT sites nationally in 5 out of the 10&#xD;
      districts in Lesotho. They are located in the main camp town of each district. Each of these&#xD;
      sites has vehicles and tents that are used for outreach services. Outreach activities aim at&#xD;
      targeting more specific groups of the population who are generally at higher risk of HIV&#xD;
      infection. For example, rural and peri-urban villages (within 60 km radius from the VCT&#xD;
      sites, working places (garment factories, phone companies, etc.)) and schools. The present&#xD;
      randomized evaluation aims at targeting youths in rural and peri-urban villages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PSI Lesotho has an extensive experience of working in the HIV prevention sector and it is&#xD;
      currently involved in various HIV prevention activities, including, in particular, provision&#xD;
      of VCT services and condom distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Research objective and Motivation The result of traditional information campaigns (like&#xD;
      ABC-Abstinence, Be Faithful and use Condom) on sexual behavioral changes is not conclusive.&#xD;
      Although, anecdotal evidence shows that it has resulted in some changes, for example,&#xD;
      interventions focusing on condoms use have resulted in increasing condoms during commercial&#xD;
      and sexual encounters, there is no rigorous evidence actually showing a significant reduction&#xD;
      in HIV prevalence in most Southern Africa countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perhaps the reason for this resides in some differences in sexual behavior in Africa (e.g. it&#xD;
      is much more common to have concurrent partnerships that can overlap for significant time)&#xD;
      and so the information campaigns are not focusing on the right messages and thus not&#xD;
      affecting behavior where it matters the most. Or maybe, as recent literature suggests people&#xD;
      tend to delay activities that are a little bit unpleasant in the present (like protecting&#xD;
      themselves) even if they have very large returns in the future. People may not be aware of&#xD;
      the long-term benefits of safe sexual behaviors. Alternatively, they give a lot of weight to&#xD;
      short-term gains, either because they discount the future heavily or have preferences that&#xD;
      might be inconsistent over time, with a strong preference for the present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What replicable and feasible interventions can affect this trade-off between short and long&#xD;
      run returns? Can the introduction of a small but &quot;short term&quot; reward promote safer sexual&#xD;
      behaviors? This intervention aims at contrasting the difference between a reward in the next&#xD;
      4 months (a lottery ticket) and a reward 10 years later (being HIV negative). The main issue&#xD;
      is the interval between the sexual activity and the lottery. To gauge the extent of&#xD;
      participation in the lottery, the correct interval time among lottery draws, and the impact&#xD;
      on behavioural changes, the investigators plan to do a short qualitative study a couple of&#xD;
      months before the beginning of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research objective is to test and rigorously evaluate whether the introduction of small&#xD;
      financial rewards in the short term can promote safer sexual behaviour in general, and reduce&#xD;
      HIV incidence in particular, in a high risk environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the evaluation are expected to be an important input in designing effective&#xD;
      HIV prevention in Lesotho. Furthermore, a credible impact evaluation is also a global public&#xD;
      good in the sense that it can offer reliable guidance to international organizations,&#xD;
      governments, donors, and nongovernmental organizations in their ongoing search for effective&#xD;
      HIV prevention programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Methods and Evaluation Design 4.1 Evaluation Design The investigators are proposing to&#xD;
      conduct a randomized controlled field trial to rigorously test whether short-term financial&#xD;
      incentives have an impact on sexual behavior and the incidence of HIV and a small set of&#xD;
      curable STIs of youth who live in villages that are served by outreach sessions of New Start&#xD;
      VCT in Lesotho.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying question for the study is why individuals get involved in short-term risky&#xD;
      sexual behavior when the potential long-term cost of becoming HIV infected is so high, which&#xD;
      clearly is the case in Lesotho. It appears like individuals, to the extent that they have not&#xD;
      been coerced into having sex (which unfortunately is also a common problem); put a lot of&#xD;
      weight on short-term gains at the expense of long run benefits. If this is the case, short&#xD;
      run financial incentives may affect individual's trade-off between short and long run&#xD;
      returns. In fact, there exists some preliminary evidence that small (financial) incentives&#xD;
      associated with activities that have very high returns in the future can result in&#xD;
      significant change in behavior. However, there is little (no) evidence that such an incentive&#xD;
      scheme will work when it comes to sexual behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the main hypothesis to be tested is that a system of rapid feedback and positive&#xD;
      reinforcement using cash as an incentive can effectively lower risky sexual activity and&#xD;
      reduce rates of HIV transmission. The primary outcomes for evaluating impact will be a&#xD;
      sub-set of sexually-transmitted infections (STIs), Syphilis and Trichomoniasis, that are&#xD;
      prevalent in the population and have been incontrovertibly linked to risky sexual activity.&#xD;
      Each of these STIs is curable. This is a critical point, since enrollees who test positive&#xD;
      for an STI can continue to participate in the study after they have been treated and cured of&#xD;
      the infection. Thus, learning is encouraged through positive reinforcement, and mistakes can&#xD;
      be corrected and overcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to test this hypothesis through the introduction of financial&#xD;
      incentives in the form of a lottery to remain/become STI-negative, which the researchers&#xD;
      believe is both replicable and relatively easy to scale-up. Lotteries are also more valued by&#xD;
      risk-takers and these individuals might also be the ones with the most risky sexual behavior,&#xD;
      thus providing additional incentives would reach the most important group. The presumption is&#xD;
      that the financial incentive will influence individuals' trade-off between short and long run&#xD;
      returns with respect to sexual behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample population will consist of youth aged 18-30 who live in villages that are served&#xD;
      by outreach activities in rural and peri-urban villages implemented by the VCT centers in&#xD;
      Lesotho The investigators aim at a study population of about 5,000 (see section 4.3 for&#xD;
      details). To the extent demand will exceed supply; the researchers will randomly choose the&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a randomized controlled field trial the sample population is randomly divided into a&#xD;
      treatment group (individuals that will have a chance to participate in the lottery) and a&#xD;
      comparison (individuals that will not take part in the lottery) group. Here, the&#xD;
      randomization will be at the individual level. 30% of the individuals will be assigned to the&#xD;
      first treatment group, 30% to the second treatment group, and 40% to the control group. The&#xD;
      two treatment groups only differ on the amount of winnings possible in the lottery. The&#xD;
      control group will be slightly larger to control for the possibility of attrition. Since&#xD;
      treatment has been randomly assigned, and provided that the sample contains a sufficiently&#xD;
      large number of individuals, units assigned to the treatment and comparison groups are&#xD;
      similar in expectations before the intervention. The causal effect of the intervention can&#xD;
      therefore be gauged by comparing mean outcomes in the treatment and comparison groups after&#xD;
      the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The random assignment to the control and treatment groups will be done in a transparent way,&#xD;
      for example by drawing from a bag which individual will be in the treatment and in the&#xD;
      control groups Not only does randomization guarantee internal validity, it is also typically&#xD;
      a fair way to allocate participants across the treatment and the comparison groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals both in the treated and in the control groups will receive free sexual health&#xD;
      discussion sessions as part of the PSI prevention and treatment program, free HIV and STI&#xD;
      testing, free STI treatment (for individuals tested positive), and free counseling before and&#xD;
      after each STI/HIV test. PSI also will provide free male and female condoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals in the treatment groups will be eligible to participate in a lottery if they are&#xD;
      tested STI negative. There will be testing and lottery draw every four months. Participants&#xD;
      will know in advance the amount of the lottery reward. The lottery will be drawn among all&#xD;
      the STI negative people in each villages. There will be 4 winners (i.e. two men and two&#xD;
      women) in each village. The exact details on the type and the size of the reward will be more&#xD;
      precisely decided during the pilot of the project. The focus on STI status as a condition for&#xD;
      participation in the lottery, rather than on HIV status, is primarily based on ethical&#xD;
      consideration. By focusing on STIs that are curable, the investigators can also study how the&#xD;
      intervention affects behavior of both HIV-positive and HIV-negative participants.&#xD;
      STI-positive individuals, who receive treatment and are cured, will be eligible to&#xD;
      participate in future lottery draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposal calls for seven follow-up surveys, one after a 4-month period. The investigators&#xD;
      aim at surveying twice the sample of around 5,000 participants. To generate more precise&#xD;
      estimates of the impact of the intervention, a baseline survey will also be implemented. The&#xD;
      information from the baseline survey will also assist in stratifying the sample and will be&#xD;
      used to study heterogeneous effects. In order to minimize attrition during the project, the&#xD;
      researchers will collect data on names, addresses and phone numbers of the participants in a&#xD;
      way to preserve confidentiality and not to decrease their willingness to participate (see&#xD;
      section 5 for details).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of this experiment avoids the usual complications of selection and reporting bias&#xD;
      because it randomized individual incentive to learn STIs status. However, there will be&#xD;
      self-selection of people who choose to decide to participate in the study, because, for&#xD;
      example, they are more motivated and aware and perhaps knowledgeable about their options (in&#xD;
      case they are HIV positive) compared to someone who has tested. Study participants will also&#xD;
      choose whether to know their HIV status or not. However, counseling will be provided to&#xD;
      assist them to make an informed decision and accept their results. Those are mainly problems&#xD;
      of external validity. The investigators are aware of these problems but in practice, they are&#xD;
      difficult to avoid, since the investigators cannot impose this study on a representative&#xD;
      sample of the population.&#xD;
