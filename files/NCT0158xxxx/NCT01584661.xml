      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the level of compliance with nutritional recommendations (dietary and&#xD;
           nutritional supplements) following discharge from hospitalization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify barriers for post-discharge adherence to professional nutritional&#xD;
           recommendations;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the impact of adherence (high vs. low) to the nutritional treatment&#xD;
           guidelines on functional and health indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      High adherence to nutritional care after hospitalization will be associated with better&#xD;
      functional and health outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The proposed study will follow patients who were hospitalized in the rehabilitation&#xD;
      departments at &quot;Bait Balev&quot;. Patients who were treated with nutritional supplements by a&#xD;
      dietitian during hospitalization and received dietary recommendations upon discharge will be&#xD;
      followed for their adherence with the treatment recommendations. The impact of the level of&#xD;
      adherence to the nutritional recommendations on health will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C2. Experimental design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This shall be a retrospective and prospective cohort study. Patients from the orthopedic and&#xD;
      neurologic rehabilitation departments, who received nutritional intervention by nutritional&#xD;
      supplements during hospitalization and were advised to receive nutritional enrichment at&#xD;
      discharge, will be enrolled to the study. The main criteria for nutritional intervention&#xD;
      during hospitalization and recommendation for supplements upon discharge include, among&#xD;
      others, withdrawal of alternative nourishment, underweight, undernutrition, non-voluntary&#xD;
      weight loss, low protein status and other criteria typical among this population during&#xD;
      hospitalization. In order to assess the level of compliance with dietitian's recommendations&#xD;
      upon discharge, only patients who were discharged to their homes will be followed. In order&#xD;
      to increase the sample size, a retrospective cohort study will be conducted, in which&#xD;
      patients from the same departments who were discharged in the last 3 months will be followed&#xD;
      both retrospectively and prospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home visits will take place 3 and 6 months after discharge, during which the dietitian shall&#xD;
      complete a questionnaire measuring the level of patient compliance to the nutritional&#xD;
      recommendations, and in addition the patient or their legal guardian shall provide anamnesis&#xD;
      in order to review the effect of compliance on health, functional, nutritional and social&#xD;
      status (it should be noted that approx. 90% of the patients in the hospital belong to the&#xD;
      Maccabi Health Care Services group, so the follow up of discharged patients in the community&#xD;
      will be conducted with Maccabi Health Care Services).&#xD;
