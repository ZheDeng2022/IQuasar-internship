    <textblock>
      For many years glycosylated hemoglobin A1C is one of the universal indicators of metabolic&#xD;
      control in patients with diabetes. The results of A1C levels reflect the average blood&#xD;
      glucose levels from the period of three months. A1C is one of the most important information&#xD;
      for diabetes team, it allows to determine the effects of treatment. In the long-term&#xD;
      analysis, it is a predictor of the complication risk. A1C value is affected by many factors:&#xD;
      the method of treatment, type of insulin, self-control, numbers of hypoglycemia etc. In the&#xD;
      case of similar methods of treatment, ability to cope with diabetes self-management, ability&#xD;
      of correct interpretation of glycemic values and adaptation of insulin doses appears to be&#xD;
      the factor, which determines A1C levels. But, there is still a lack of objective methods to&#xD;
      assess effective coping with the requirements of the illness - adherence. Currently it is&#xD;
      based primarily on a subjective feeling of diabetes team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the research is to develop a mathematical model called ADHERENCE index, and to&#xD;
      evaluate its effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the Outpatient Diabetes Clinic in the Institute of Mother&#xD;
      and Child. Patient should be treated by intensive insulinotherapy using Continuous&#xD;
      Subcutaneous Infusion Set (CSII). Number of participants: 200.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study plan - data collecting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will attend diabetes clinic as usual, with one additional visit in the middle of the&#xD;
      3-months period. During those visits, data from glucometers and insulin pumps will be&#xD;
      downloaded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Visit 1 (V0) - getting agreement to participate in the study, giving information about&#xD;
           the study, collecting patient's in initial interview. HbA1c measurement by DCA Vantage&#xD;
           Analyzer (Siemens), control the settings of time and date in insulin pumps and&#xD;
           glucometer(s), ask for using one kind of glucometer, and if it's impossible - to set&#xD;
           time and date in every glucometer, and to take them all for the next visits. Setting&#xD;
           terms of next visits (after 6 ±1 and 12 ±2 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Visit 2 (V1) - after 6 ±1 weeks after V0 - downloading data from the insulin pump and&#xD;
           glucometer(s) by Diasend and CareLink software. Collecting information about some&#xD;
           accidents: ketoacidosis, severe hypoglycemia, ketonuria, illness treated with&#xD;
           antibiotics. Reminding about the next visit (V2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Visit 3 (V2) - after 6 ±1 weeks after V1 - the last visit; downloading data from the&#xD;
           insulin pump and glucometer(s) by Diasend and CareLink software. Collecting information&#xD;
           about some accidents: ketoacidosis, severe hypoglycemia, ketonuria, illness treated with&#xD;
           antibiotics; the A1C measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After data collection they will be taken under analysis. Downloaded data will be compared to&#xD;
      A1C. After that, factors, which are crucial for A1C will be found. Last part of the research&#xD;
      is an attempt to create a mathematical model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data important for mathematical model:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Downloaded:&#xD;
&#xD;
      BG values - average, standard deviation, number of values per day, values above goal (&gt;180&#xD;
      mg/dl), values within goal (70-180 mg/dl), values below goal (&lt;70 mg/dl), percentage of&#xD;
      measurements fall within the recommended range (70-180 mg/dl); Low Blood Glucose Index (LBGI)&#xD;
      and High Blood Glucose Index (HBGI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin pumps data - average total daily dose, average daily basal, average daily bolus,&#xD;
      percentage of daily basal and bolus doses, number of boluses per day, number of extended&#xD;
      boluses per day, using of temporary basal rate, number of stoppings, number of days with one&#xD;
      infusion set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected by the interview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number and time of ketoacidosis, ketonuria, severe hypoglycemia, illness treated with&#xD;
      antibiotics. Interview during the V0 visit: sex, weight, height, age, suffering from diabetes&#xD;
      in age, A1C level, reported total daily dose, type of insulin (Humalog, Novorapid, Apidra),&#xD;
      number of places in body for infusion, reported number of days with one infusion set, place&#xD;
      of residence (village, town, city).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtaining a mathematical model - an ADHERENCE index - will allow to assess an adherence to&#xD;
      diabetes and self-management. It will be an objective indicator, which could allow to&#xD;
      identify the most impacting factor which determines A1C levels and to identify this aspects&#xD;
      of diabetes self- management, which should be improved by diabetes education or motivation.&#xD;
      Using of ADHERENCE index should allow to identify patients with poor self-management earlier,&#xD;
      than it could be symbolized by high A1C level. It could also allow to draw conclusions about&#xD;
      the most important aspects of diabetes self-management.&#xD;
