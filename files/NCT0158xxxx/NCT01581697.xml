  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death and disability in adults. However,&#xD;
      investigations suggest that the basic pathology of heart disease as more severe myocardial&#xD;
      infarction which usually reach mainly middle-aged or above, starts from childhood.&#xD;
      Hypercholesterolemia is one of the most important risk factors for atherosclerosis in adults&#xD;
      and children, is associated with early deposition of lipids in the aorta and coronary&#xD;
      arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among other recommendations for prevention and treatment of heart disease and risk factors,&#xD;
      is the recommendation to encourage the intake of soluble fiber. The oats, a major source of&#xD;
      soluble fiber, has been recognized as a potential component of the diet to lower blood&#xD;
      cholesterol levels, this effect is attributed mainly to the beta-glucan, a type of soluble&#xD;
      fiber present in large quantities in oats. In 1997 the Food and Drug Administration admitted&#xD;
      that the oat bran, oat flakes and oatmeal may have beneficial effects for health with the&#xD;
      recommendation of daily intake of 3g of beta-glucan from oats and a food that brings a claim&#xD;
      for promotion health, must provide, without enrichment, at least 1 gram of beta-glucan per&#xD;
      serving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this project will be compared by randomized clinical trial, the impact of&#xD;
      intake of oats, for 8 weeks in the lipid profile of children and adolescents with&#xD;
      dyslipidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be included in the study 120 volunteers aged between 5 and 16 years who are in&#xD;
      nutritional monitoring for at least 1 month. The subjects will be randomly divided into 2&#xD;
      groups, with a control group and another intervention will receive 3 tablespoons of soup&#xD;
      filled with oat bran, which corresponds to 3g of beta-glucan, along with breakfast, lunch and&#xD;
      dinner. Patients will be monitored with consultations on the 2nd, 4th and 8th weeks of&#xD;
      treatment. Blood sample will be performed, to obtain the lipid profile of patients, at the&#xD;
      beginning and end of the study. To compare the groups are used Student's t and squared chi.&#xD;
      The alpha of 0.05 is considered critical. The program will be used Statistical Package for&#xD;
      the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 15.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected a decrease in serum levels of total cholesterol and LDL-c. Thus, living habits&#xD;
      and healthy alternatives to prevent these risk factors should be done since childhood,&#xD;
      especially in children who already have cholesterol levels of change.&#xD;
