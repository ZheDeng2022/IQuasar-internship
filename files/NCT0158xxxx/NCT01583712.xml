      Early diagnosis of acute Gastrointestinal Graft-versus-Host disease (aGI-GvHD) has a strong&#xD;
      impact on morbidity and mortality of patients who underwent haematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (HSCT). Recent results at the investigators department showed that mucosal&#xD;
      biopsies from the small intestine have a high diagnostic yield for aGI-GvHD specific changes.&#xD;
      By performing an enteroscopic examination, aGI-GvHD suspected patients can be prevented from&#xD;
      colonoscopy and prior bowel preparation which is clinically important, considering the rather&#xD;
      bad general condition of this patient group. To further reduce invasive procedures the&#xD;
      investigators want to evaluate the in vivo histological features of aGI-GvHD in the small&#xD;
      bowel. Therefore aGI-GvHD suspected patients will undergo confocal laser endomicroscopy of&#xD;
      the upper GI-tract, including duodenum and jejunum, in the context of a prospective clinical&#xD;
      pilot trial. The histological evaluation of biopsy samples taken from these sites will be&#xD;
      used as comparable gold standard. Endomicroscopic aspects of patients with celiac disease,&#xD;
      infectious enteritis, inflammatory bowel disease and healthy subjects should serve as&#xD;
      controls. If it is possible to diagnose aGI-GvHD from endomicroscopic features of the small&#xD;
      bowel alone, this could be another important step to improve the diagnostic management of&#xD;
      post HSCT patients, especially when taking of biopsy samples is difficult because of a bad&#xD;
      coagulation status. Additionally, an accurate diagnosis in vivo could lead to immediate&#xD;
      treatment to prevent progression and site spreading of the disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) represents a major cause for morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      patients who underwent haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) [1]. In the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract as one of the main target organs of GvHD diagnosis may be difficult&#xD;
      because of many similar presenting differential diagnoses, most notable, infections by&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus [2]. Experts disagree about the best diagnostic approach for patients&#xD;
      suspected of acute gastrointestinal GvHD (aGI-GvHD). There have been many studies supporting&#xD;
      the endoscopic evaluation of either the lower [3, 4, 5], the upper [6, 7] or both parts of&#xD;
      the GI-tract [8, 9]. In either case, the histological evaluation of biopsy samples serves as&#xD;
      standard tool to establish the final diagnosis [10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the rather bad general condition of patients after HSCT as a limiting factor for&#xD;
      endoscopic and histological evaluation, some new approaches have been introduced into the&#xD;
      diagnostic manual of aGI-GvHD in order to reduce the amount of invasive examinations.&#xD;
      Conventional imaging techniques like magnetic resonance imaging [11], computer tomography&#xD;
      [12] and high-resolution ultrasonography with Doppler Imaging [13] reported bowel wall&#xD;
      thickening in GvHD patients. But as such findings are only unspecific signs of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal pathology, conventional imaging techniques cannot replace endoscopy with&#xD;
      biopsies [14]. The same holds for video capsule endoscopy which was indeed found to have a&#xD;
      high negative predictive value for the detection of aGI-GvHD, but shares the important&#xD;
      shortcoming of missing biopsy samples for histological evaluation [15, 16, 17].&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least this method shifted the focus of interest onto the small bowel. Biopsies deriving&#xD;
      from this former neglected GI part had shown a high sensitivity for GvHD-related changes in&#xD;
      previous studies [18]. As similar results were seen at the study site, the investigators&#xD;
      prospectively compared enteroscopy with biopsies to the present gold standard in the&#xD;
      diagnostic aGI-GvHD management, colonoscopy with biopsies. In the context of this&#xD;
      investigation the large intestine showed much stronger affection by aGI-GvHD than all other&#xD;
      locations, although there was no pair of examinations, in which colonoscopy revealed aGI-GvHD&#xD;
      without the presence of such findings at enteroscopy. Quite the opposite, enteroscopy even&#xD;
      revealed GvHD related pathologies in one case where the respective colonoscopy remained&#xD;
      inconspicuous. Consequently, they postulated that enteroscopic findings may replace the need&#xD;
      for colonoscopy [19], wherefore post-HSCT patients could remain without stressful bowel&#xD;
      preparation, often limited by their rather bad general condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the latest developments in the endoscopic management of the gastrointestinal tract is&#xD;
      the so called confocal laser endomicroscope (CLE). Confocal microscopy was developed by&#xD;
      Marvin Minsky in the late 1950s. Its principle is the microscopic scanning of focal points&#xD;
      below the surface of an object. In comparison to conventional light microscopy it uses a&#xD;
      special filter system to avoid image overlapping by surrounding tissue. In detail, a light&#xD;
      source (normally a laser) is focused by a microscope objective lens to a diffraction limited&#xD;
      spot on or inside the object. Light that is scattered, or fluorescence excited (achieved&#xD;
      through fluorescein staining, for example) and emitted, at the focus in the sample will&#xD;
      partially return back through the optics along the path from which it arrived. A&#xD;
      beam-splitter placed into the path reflects the return light towards a detector. The optics&#xD;
      will focus the light from the focal point in the specimen to its conjugate focus near the&#xD;
      detector (hence the technology is termed &quot;con-focal&quot;). Here a spatial filter (&quot;pinhole&quot;) is&#xD;
      used to extinguish all light deriving from areas outside the focal point. Light reflections&#xD;
      from the focal point itself will be forwarded to the detector which is connected to a&#xD;
      computer system that digitalises the optical signal and creates the in vivo histological&#xD;
      image [20].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focusing on its clinical impact, confocal microscopy is the first technique to allow in vivo&#xD;
      evaluation of tissue structures beneath their surface. Because of many breakthroughs in&#xD;
      miniaturisation (mostly in the 1990s) this technology could be applied for intraluminal use&#xD;
      in gastroenterology, integrated into a otherwise standard endoscope. It allows the in vivo&#xD;
      histological visualisation of the upper 250 micrometers of all walls within the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract, additionally to the normal function of white light endoscopy&#xD;
      (provided by two separate screens on top of the workstation) [20].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first clinical use of CLE in a prospective pilot trial including 35 patients after HSCT&#xD;
      was reported by Bojarski et al. in 2009. CLE of the colonic mucosa could predict the positive&#xD;
      diagnosis of aGI-GvHD in 14 of 19 patients, later confirmed by histological evaluation. The&#xD;
      in vivo findings of aGI-GvHD, varying from single crypt apoptosis to complete crypt loss,&#xD;
      were clearly distinguishable from pathologies of other origin like infectious colitis or&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis, both used as comparative control [21].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical investigation the investigators intend to continue the diagnostic approach&#xD;
      for acute Gastrointestinal Graft-versus-Host Disease (aGI-GvHD). Based on the recent results&#xD;
      at the study institution (explained above, [19]) that showed a remarkable diagnostic yield&#xD;
      for aGI-GvHD associated pathologies in the small intestine the investigators intend to&#xD;
      evaluate confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) of the small intestine as primary diagnostic&#xD;
      procedure in patients with suspected aGI-GvHD after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      (HSCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators aim to examine whether early diagnosis of aGI-GvHD in the duodenum and&#xD;
           jejunum can be achieved by evaluating endomicroscopic features.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In comparison with conventional biopsies from the mentioned GI-parts as gold standard&#xD;
           the investigators want to test whether the markers described by Bojarski et al. for the&#xD;
           colon also hold true for the small intestine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Including endomicroscopic results of patients with celiac disease, enteral infections,&#xD;
           inflammatory bowel disease and healthy subjects as controls the investigators aim to&#xD;
           establish aGI-GvHD specific markers that can be used for a &quot;biopsy-free&quot; in vivo&#xD;
           diagnosis of aGI-GvHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective clinical pilot trial without randomisation or blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) who are referred to the study&#xD;
      site for clarification of one of the following symptoms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anorexia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  nausea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  abdominal pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  diarrhea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  intestinal bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
      To exclude possible side effects of the conditioning therapy, GI symptoms must have occurred&#xD;
      or persisted 20 days after the respective transplantation date [22].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  infection with CMV or HSV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  bacterial infection of the GI tract&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medication related symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients allergic to one of the drug components (including drugs used for conscious&#xD;
           sedation like propofol or midazolam as well as fluorescein, the fluorescent dye used for&#xD;
           CLE )&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  refusal to participate in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patient's age below 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation will be performed at the Medical University of Vienna, Department of&#xD;
      Internal Medicine III, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology. Patient recruitment will&#xD;
      be achieved in close cooperation with the Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of&#xD;
      Oncology, Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this study has been planned as a pilot trial, it mainly focuses on the qualitative&#xD;
      endomicroscopic features of the small intestine in GvHD-patients to yield reference&#xD;
      pathologies for accurate diagnosis in the future. Nevertheless, a quantitative analysis will&#xD;
      be performed by comparing CLE-derived diagnoses with histological results to calculate&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of CLE-based aGI-GvHD diagnosis in the small intestine.&#xD;
      Considering the current diagnostic yield of 62% for the detection of aGI-GvHD in symptomatic&#xD;
      post-HSCT-patients by conventional histology [19], the investigators estimated to include 40&#xD;
      patients with suspected aGI-GvHD in order to discover a meaningful sample of patients&#xD;
      affected by aGI-GvHD for qualitative and quantitative analysis. In comparison, Bojarski et al&#xD;
      included 35 patients of whom 19 finally turned out to suffer from aGI-GvHD by conventional&#xD;
      histology. They could then calculate a sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 100% for the&#xD;
      prediction of the histological diagnosis by CLE [21]. On the basis of the current frequency&#xD;
      of post-HSCT-patients at the study site the investigators estimate to include the aimed&#xD;
      amount of 40 patients within a time period of 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who fulfill the listed inclusion criteria, will receive the patient information&#xD;
      form of this study together with the usual informed consent form of the respective endoscopic&#xD;
      examination they are about to undergo. Patient information will be done at least 24 hours&#xD;
      before the intervention, as practiced at our unit. If the patient agrees to participate in&#xD;
      the study he/she will be prepared for endoscopy by administration of intravenous propofol&#xD;
      and/or midazolam as routinely used for conscious sedation during endoscopic procedures at our&#xD;
      department. Additionally, 5-10 ml of a 10% solution of fluorescein sodium will be&#xD;
      administered intravenously to enhance tissue fluorescence during endomicroscopy. As so far no&#xD;
      specific CLE-enteroscope is available, we will use the CLE-colonoscope (Pentax EC-3870 CIFK&#xD;
      with the ISC-1000 confocal endomicroscopy processor - Pentax, Tokyo, Japan and Optiscan Pty&#xD;
      Ltd, Notting Hill, Victoria, Australia) to reach the small intestine, comparable to an&#xD;
      enteroscopic procedure (oral access).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All drugs will be administered by medical specialists, assistant doctors or registered&#xD;
      nurses, as routinely practiced at our institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLE picture capturing will start at the deepest point reachable in the jejunum. During&#xD;
      withdrawal of the scope CLE pictures will be taken every 10 centimetres in the small bowel,&#xD;
      then from the antrum and body of the stomach and from the esophagus. Furthermore, CLE will be&#xD;
      applied for distinct looking areas, suspicious of pathologic origin. Wherever CLE pictures&#xD;
      are obtained, a conventional biopsy will be taken from the same localisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLE pictures will be captured and stored routinely using our standard data management system.&#xD;
      They will be evaluated immediately after the endoscopic procedure together with a board&#xD;
      certified GI-pathologist, who will establish an initial diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional biopsies will be stained with Haematoxylin &amp; Eosin, as well as PAS stain.&#xD;
      In-situ hybridization for CMV and HSV will be performed to exclude viral infection.&#xD;
      Classification of GvHD will be done according to McDonald and Sale in 4 grades, appropriately&#xD;
      modified for the small intestine [23]:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade I: individual cell necrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade II: crypt abscess&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade III: drop out of one ore more whole crypts in a biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade IV: total denudation of epithelium&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endomicroscopic controls (patients with celiac disease, enteral infections, inflammatory&#xD;
      bowel disease and healthy subjects) will be collected from present data of endomicroscopic&#xD;
      procedures already performed within routine examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study all CLE pictures and histological cuts will be evaluated separately&#xD;
      by two blinded board certified pathologists. In case of discordant diagnoses they will&#xD;
      analyse the respective cases together to reach an agreement on the final diagnosis. All cases&#xD;
      where the initial and the final diagnosis are deviating from each other will be re-evaluated&#xD;
      together by all specialists involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk/Benefit assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      GvHD represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality after allogeneic HSCT. Approximately&#xD;
      10-40% of patients who undergo HSCT develop significant GvHD, and about half of these&#xD;
      patients die from this disease or from therapy resulting complications [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic procedures in patients with suspected aGI-GvHD are well established. Until now the&#xD;
      histological evaluation of GI deriving biopsies is the gold standard tool to set an accurate&#xD;
      aGI-GvHD diagnosis. Endoscopy of the upper GI-tract is more comfortable than the endoscopic&#xD;
      assessment of the lower GI-tract as there is no need for bowel preparation. Therefore it is&#xD;
      the primary technique to assess post HSCT patients at our department. Supported by recent&#xD;
      results at the study institution [19] these upper GI endoscopies are routinely performed as&#xD;
      enteroscopies instead of gastroscopies in order to include the small intestine in the&#xD;
      diagnostic evaluation. The safety of enteroscopy has not been studied systematically but&#xD;
      reported experience is substantial and complications have been rare [24].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confocal laser endomicroscopy is a safe new technique that has already been studied in&#xD;
      clinical trials [25, 26]. Its safety is being guaranteed by the use of low intensity laser&#xD;
      light that can at worst cause local bleaching of fluorescein containing cells, which is&#xD;
      harmless, reversible and even used as diagnostic sign in experimental conditions [20].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical implications&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study protocol was approved by the ethics commission of the Medical University of&#xD;
      Vienna.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures in the context of this study will be performed in accordance to the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki as well as to the guidelines for Good Scientific Practice (GSP) of&#xD;
      the Medical University of Vienna.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected impact and Outlook&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the investigators find aGI-GvHD specific markers that can be used for a &quot;biopsy-free&quot; in&#xD;
      vivo diagnosis of aGI-GvHD this could lead to another reduction of invasive procedures for&#xD;
      patients after HSCT. This would have a big clinical impact, as biopsy assessment is often&#xD;
      limited by the bad coagulation status of this patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case they cannot clearly determine specific markers of aGI-GvHD, CLE should at least&#xD;
      reduce the amount of conventional biopsies needed for diagnosis by taking them under CLE&#xD;
      guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite from the expected reduction of invasive procedures, aGI-GvHD diagnosis in vivo could&#xD;
      lead to immediate initiation of immunosuppressive treatment in order to reduce progression&#xD;
      and site spreading of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case the study aims will be supported by the results of this pilot trial, a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial comparing in vivo diagnosis to conventional histological assessment in&#xD;
      matters of hospitalisation and survival will be performed.&#xD;
