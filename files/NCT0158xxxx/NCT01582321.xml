  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation is a key initiating and damaging factor in many illnesses including infection,&#xD;
      arthritis and cancer but also of particular relevance to this study in diseases of the heart&#xD;
      and blood vessels (i.e. cardiovascular disease). Much evidence now exists demonstrating that&#xD;
      male sex increases ones risk of cardiovascular disease. More recent evidence demonstrates&#xD;
      that inflammatory responses in females appear to dampened in comparison to age matched males.&#xD;
      Since inflammation is thought to be a key initiating phenomenon in many cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease states the investigators will examine the differences in acute inflammatory responses&#xD;
      between the sexes in healthy volunteers and the impact this has on the function of blood&#xD;
      vessels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We now know that one of the earliest events involved in precipitating disease of the heart&#xD;
      and blood vessels is the phenomenon of inflammation and that this inflammation is a key&#xD;
      process involved in dampening the protective nature of the inner lining (the endothelium) of&#xD;
      the blood vessel wall, called endothelial dysfunction. In healthy arteries the endothelium&#xD;
      releases a number of factors that maintain the health of the blood vessel. These factors act&#xD;
      to keep the blood vessel in an open and dilated state and prevent the furring up of the&#xD;
      vessel by actively inhibiting the cell components of the blood from collecting at the&#xD;
      endothelium and blocking the flow of blood through the artery. Recent research in animals has&#xD;
      demonstrated that one of the key components of inflammation i.e. the attraction of white&#xD;
      cells, is reduced in females compared to males and that this is due to a reduced expression&#xD;
      of key proteins called 'adhesion molecules', an in particular a molecule called P-selectin,&#xD;
      on the endothelium. We now wish to determine whether similar differences in white cell&#xD;
      attraction and adhesion molecules exist between the sexes in humans and whether these&#xD;
      differences might underlie differences in endothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate this possibility we will conduct a study in two parts, using well validated&#xD;
      models of acute inflammation in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 To determine whether responses to inflammation differ between sexes in part 1 we will&#xD;
      use a cantharidin-induced model of acute inflammation. Previous published studies have shown&#xD;
      when cantharidin is applied to the skin it causes acantholysis and blister formation. It is a&#xD;
      safe, reproducible technique with no permanent scarring or ill-effects. We will study the&#xD;
      effects on inflammatory responses by measuring the levels of cells and inflammatory mediators&#xD;
      in blister fluids, urine and plasma. Participants will given two blisters that will be&#xD;
      harvested at 24 hours (acute phase) and 72 hours (resolution phase) after cantharidin&#xD;
      application. The effects of inflammation on blood vessels will also be studied through non&#xD;
      invasive blood pressure measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 To determine whether susceptibility to inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction is&#xD;
      distinct between the sexes in part 2 we will use typhoid vaccine to induce mild inflammation&#xD;
      throughout the body including the blood vessels. Previous published studies have shown that&#xD;
      vaccination induces an acute inflammation that results in a temporary (reversed within 48h)&#xD;
      dysfunction of the endothelium that can be measured using a range of non-invasive techniques&#xD;
      called ultrasound flow-mediated dilatation and pulse wave velocity. We will use these&#xD;
      techniques together with biochemical measurements to determine possible associations of&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction with specific inflammatory factors. In particular we will investigate&#xD;
      the possibility that differences in the expression of the adhesion molecule P-selectin might&#xD;
      have a role to play in differences between the sexes.&#xD;
