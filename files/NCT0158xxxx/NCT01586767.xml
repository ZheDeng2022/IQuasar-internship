  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that 1)intensity-modulated radiotherapy&#xD;
      (IMRT) or proton radiation therapy would result in improved local control rate and lowered&#xD;
      toxicity compared to conventional radiotherapy, and 2) proton radiation therapy would result&#xD;
      in equivalent or improved local control rate with similar or lower toxicity compared to IMRT,&#xD;
      in the treatment of locally advanced sinonasal malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from retrospective studies suggest that IMRT or proton radiation therapy resulted in&#xD;
      promising outcome in patients with sinonasal malignancy. To this date, no prospective study&#xD;
      has been conducted to evaluate the outcome of sinonasal cancer treated with IMRT or proton&#xD;
      radiation therapy. This Phase II trial is the first prospective study conducted to determine&#xD;
      the treatment outcome and toxicity of IMRT or proton in the treatment of sinonasal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMRT and proton radiation therapy are the two most established and most commonly employed&#xD;
      advanced radiotherapy techniques for the treatment of sinonasal cancer. It is highly&#xD;
      controversial whether one is superior to the other in terms of local control and toxicity&#xD;
      outcome. It is also not clear if a subset of patients would benefit more from one treatment&#xD;
      technology versus the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the rarity and heterogeneity of sinonasal malignancies and the fact that proton beam&#xD;
      is only available at a few centers in the United States, it is not feasible at present to do&#xD;
      a Phase III study randomizing patients between IMRT and proton radiation therapy. In this&#xD;
      study, a planned secondary analysis will be performed, comparing the treatment and toxicity&#xD;
      outcome between IMRT and proton. The data on the IMRT and proton comparison from this trial&#xD;
      will be used to design future multi-center prospective trials and to determine if randomized&#xD;
      trial is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the treatment technique employed for an individual case will not be determined&#xD;
      by the treating physician(s), but rather by the most advanced technology available at the&#xD;
      treating institution for the treatment of the sinonasal cancer. At the Massachusetts General&#xD;
      Hospital (MGH), proton beam therapy will be used for patients who meet the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria. For institutions where protons are not available or institutions where the proton&#xD;
      planning systems have not been optimized, IMRT exclusively will be used for the treatment of&#xD;
      sinonasal cancer. Patient and tumor characteristics are expected to be comparable between&#xD;
      IMRT- and proton- institutions&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive daily proton radiation treatment as outpatients at the Francis H. Burr&#xD;
      Proton Center at Massachusetts General Hospital. The subjects may also receive concurrent&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy every week during their radiation therapy. This chemotherapy is&#xD;
      considered standard treatment for their cancer and is not being done for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to daily radiation treatments, subjects will have the following tests every week:&#xD;
      review of side effects; physical exam, including weight, height, neurological exam and vital&#xD;
      signs; and blood tests, only for those subjects also receiving chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed for 5 years after the completion of study treatment. The first&#xD;
      follow-up visit will be 6-8 weeks after completion of study treatment. Additional follow-up&#xD;
      visits will be performed every 3 months during the first 2 years following completion of&#xD;
      radiation then every 6 month during years 3-5. At each follow-up visit, subjects will receive&#xD;
      a physical exam, chest CT scan (at 1st follow-up visit then at least every 6 months), a CT or&#xD;
      MRI tumor assessment (at 1st follow-up visit then at least every 6 months), quality-of-life&#xD;
      questionnaire, hearing test, neuro-ophthalmology test, and neurocognitive test.&#xD;
