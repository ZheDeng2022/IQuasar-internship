      Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of WF10 infusions in the treatment of subjects&#xD;
      with persistent allergic rhinitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single-centre&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects 50 subjects (25 per treatment group) with history of persistent allergic rhinitis&#xD;
      for at least 2 years prior to enrolment and a positive allergen skin test. Subjects will be&#xD;
      required to have a minimum mean score ≥6 for the baseline Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS)&#xD;
      (mean score of morning and evening reflective TNSS assessments for the 3 days prior to&#xD;
      randomization and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments At the first treatment visit (T1), subjects that comply with the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be randomized into one of two treatment groups: WF10, or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each individual treatment dose of study drug solution is 0.5 mL/kg body weight, diluted into&#xD;
      500 mL saline solution. Treatment will be administered once daily for 5 consecutive days&#xD;
      (Visits T1-T5) via intravenous infusion.&#xD;

             2 years prior to enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Mean score ≥6 for the baseline Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS)&#xD;
