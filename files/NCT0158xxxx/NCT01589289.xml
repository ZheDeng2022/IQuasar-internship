  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The impact of neurological disorders is enormous worldwide, and it is increased in poor&#xD;
      settings, due to lack of diagnosis and treatment facilities as well as delayed management. In&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa, the few observational studies conducted for the past 20 years show that&#xD;
      neurological disorders accounted for 7 to 24% of all admissions. Central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      infections were suspected in one third of all patients admitted with neurological symptoms,&#xD;
      with a specific microbial aetiology identified in half of these. Most CNS infections may be&#xD;
      considered as &quot;severe and treatable diseases&quot;, e.g. human African trypanosomiasis (HAT),&#xD;
      cerebral malaria, bacterial meningitis, CNS tuberculosis etc. If left untreated, death or&#xD;
      serious sequels occur (mortality rates were as high as 30% in the above mentioned studies),&#xD;
      but the outcome may be favourable with timely and appropriate management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In poor settings, such conditions should be targeted in priority in the clinical&#xD;
      decision-making process. Unfortunately, most neuro-infections present with non-specific&#xD;
      symptoms in their early stages, leading to important diagnostic delays. Moreover, they&#xD;
      require advanced diagnostic technology, which is not available in most tropical rural&#xD;
      settings: here, you have to rely on clinical judgment and first-line laboratory results,&#xD;
      whose confirming or excluding powers are limited or unknown. Several rapid diagnostic tests&#xD;
      (RDTs) have been recently developed for conditions like malaria or HIV, but their diagnostic&#xD;
      contribution has not been evaluated within a multi-disease approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, this research aims at improving the early diagnosis of severe and treatable neglected&#xD;
      and non-neglected infectious diseases which present with neurological symptoms in the&#xD;
      province of Bandundu, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), by combining classic clinical&#xD;
      predictors with a panel of simple point-of-care rapid diagnostic tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of existing algorithms and elaboration/validation of new guidelines will be&#xD;
      described in a subsequent protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The impact of neurological disorders is enormous in terms of mortality, morbidity, physical&#xD;
      disability and psychological distress, and it is increased in low-resource settings by lack&#xD;
      of diagnosis and of treatment facilities as well as delayed management. The frequency of&#xD;
      neurological disorders and the pattern of causative conditions are little documented in&#xD;
      low-resource primary care settings.In sub-Saharan Africa, the few observational studies&#xD;
      conducted for the past 20 years, show that neurological disorders accounted for 7 to 24% of&#xD;
      all admissions. Central nervous system (CNS) infections were suspected in one third of all&#xD;
      patients admitted with neurological symptoms, with a specific microbial aetiology identified&#xD;
      in half of these. Where it has been investigated, up to one third of neurological admissions&#xD;
      was related to HIV infection in some settings. Neuro-infections were also the leading&#xD;
      aetiologies of common neurological symptoms (such as headache) in African HIV-positive&#xD;
      patients, and autopsy studies have demonstrated that CNS infections accounted for 20% of the&#xD;
      causes of death in HIV-positive individuals in sub-Saharan Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most CNS infections may be considered as &quot;severe and treatable diseases&quot;, e.g. human African&#xD;
      trypanosomiasis (HAT), cerebral malaria, bacterial meningitis, CNS tuberculosis,&#xD;
      neurosyphilis, cryptococcal meningitis or toxoplasma encephalitis etc. If left untreated,&#xD;
      death or serious sequels usually occur; mortality rates of neurological admissions were as&#xD;
      high as 30% in the above mentioned studies. However, outcome may be favourable with timely&#xD;
      and appropriate management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In resource-constrained settings more than elsewhere, such &quot;severe and treatable&quot; conditions&#xD;
      should be targeted in priority in the clinical decision-making process. Unfortunately, most&#xD;
      neuro-infections present with non-specific symptoms in their early stages, leading to&#xD;
      important diagnostic delays. Moreover, neurological diagnoses frequently require advanced&#xD;
      technology, but this is far beyond reach of most tropical rural settings, where you have to&#xD;
      rely on clinical judgment and first-line laboratory results. However, the confirming or&#xD;
      excluding powers of most clinical and laboratory features are limited or have never been&#xD;
      adequately quantified, in particular in settings lacking reference diagnostic methods.&#xD;
      Several rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have been developed in the last decade for conditions&#xD;
      like malaria or HIV infection, but their diagnostic contribution has never been evaluated&#xD;
      within a multi-disease approach. Most CNS infections with worldwide distribution affect&#xD;
      disproportionally the (sub)-tropical regions, while others are restricted to the tropics.&#xD;
      Also, many infections with potential neuropathogenicity belong to the group of 17 Neglected&#xD;
      Tropical Diseases (NTDs) on which attention has been recently brought. As said above, most of&#xD;
      them may be considered as &quot;severe and treatable&quot;; however, in most tropical settings,&#xD;
      epidemiology of NTDs and other infectious diseases (IDs) is largely unknown, seriously&#xD;
      impairing the case finding and clinical decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research therefore is to improve the early diagnosis of severe and treatable&#xD;
      neglected and non-neglected infectious diseases which may present with neurological symptoms&#xD;
      in the province of Bandundu, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This will be achieved&#xD;
      through the elaboration and validation of new diagnostic guidelines based on epidemiological&#xD;
      evidence, combining classic clinical predictors with a panel of simple point-of-care rapid&#xD;
      diagnostic tests, and designed with a &quot;panoramic&quot; (not-to-miss) approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, the investigators hope to determine the pre-test probability of HAT and other&#xD;
      priority neglected tropical diseases/infectious diseases in patients presenting with&#xD;
      neurological disorders; to assess the predictive weight of clinical and first-line laboratory&#xD;
      features in the diagnosis of HAT and other priority NTDs/IDs; to assess the sensitivity,&#xD;
      specificity and predictive values of novel point-of-care RDTs for the diagnosis of HAT and&#xD;
      other priority NTDs/IDs in patients with neurological disorders; and to assess the diagnostic&#xD;
      performances of combinations of novel and existing RDTs for diagnosing HAT and other priority&#xD;
      NTDs/IDs in patients with neurological disorders. Enrolled patients will be managed according&#xD;
      the current standard of care in Bandundu, DRC and with the treatments locally available&#xD;
      through health facilities/programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives and methodology of this second step of our research (evaluation of existing&#xD;
      algorithms and elaboration/validation of new guidelines) will be described in a subsequent&#xD;
      protocol. Another similar study (described in another protocol) will be conducted in parallel&#xD;
      to explore the aetiologies of prolonged fever in the same setting.&#xD;
