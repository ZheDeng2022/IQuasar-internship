  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that consciously sedated patients suffering from ST-elevation&#xD;
      myocardial infarction can be rapidly and safely cooled to a state of therapeutic hypothermia&#xD;
      (32 to 34 degrees C) using the LRS ThermoSuit System prior to percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This clinical study will investigate the safety and feasibility of cooling heart attack&#xD;
      (STEMI) patients with the LRS (Life Recovery Systems)ThermoSuit System, a cooling device&#xD;
      which uses the principle of cold water immersion to rapidly reduce patient temperature. The&#xD;
      study will enroll a total of up to 20 patients, and will be a cooperative effort between LRS&#xD;
      and LSU Health Sciences Center - Shreveport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is being conducted under an IDE (Investigational Device Exemption) that was granted&#xD;
      to LRS by FDA (G070141). The primary goal of this trial is to demonstrate the feasibility of&#xD;
      cooling AMI patients pre-reperfusion with the ThermoSuit cooling device. The safety of this&#xD;
      treatment will be determined by review of a composite of serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consciously sedated patients will be cooled after entry into the emergency room and prior to&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention in the catheterization laboratory. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      the ThermoSuit System will enable cooling of the patient to 34ºC after a treatment of 30&#xD;
      minutes or less. Previous research has suggested that cooling of ST-elevation myocardial&#xD;
      infarction patients before coronary reperfusion could result in a significant reduction in&#xD;
      myocardial infarct size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, this study will lead to a pivotal clinical study to investigate the potential&#xD;
      for the ThermoSuit cooling treatment to reduce myocardial infarct size. The ultimate goal of&#xD;
      these studies is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the use of the ThermoSuit&#xD;
      device for the treatment of AMI patients.&#xD;
