  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TAK-559, once daily (QD),&#xD;
      taken in combination with metformin in treating subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insulin is a primary regulator of blood glucose concentrations. A subnormal response to&#xD;
      circulating insulin levels at target tissues leads to a decrease in insulin-mediated glucose&#xD;
      uptake. Insulin resistance is associated with normal to high insulin levels and is often&#xD;
      accompanied by dyslipidemia, a disruption in lipid metabolism resulting in increased&#xD;
      triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein levels as well as decreased high-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the early stages of insulin&#xD;
      resistance, a compensatory mechanism of increased insulin secretion by the pancreas maintains&#xD;
      normal to near-normal glucose levels. Once the pancreas fails to maintain the increased&#xD;
      insulin output, overt type 2 diabetes mellitus occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin also plays an important role in the metabolism of fat and proteins and exerts its&#xD;
      influence at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor level. Peroxisome&#xD;
      proliferator-activated receptor -alpha receptors are expressed predominantly in skeletal&#xD;
      muscle, adipose tissue, heart, liver, kidney, gut, macrophages, and vascular tissue, and play&#xD;
      a key role in energy storage, glucose homeostasis, and vascular biology. Thus, as insulin&#xD;
      activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha receptors, this results in the&#xD;
      cellular uptake of glucose. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor receptors are&#xD;
      ligand-activated transcription elements that regulate gene expression necessary for&#xD;
      metabolism. For this reason, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors play a pivotal role&#xD;
      in glucose homeostasis, adipocyte differentiation, and lipid storage. The genes predominantly&#xD;
      targeted by transcription activity of activated peroxisome proliferator-activated&#xD;
      receptor-alpha receptors are those that mediate fatty acid uptake, fatty acid oxidation, and&#xD;
      lipoprotein metabolism. As such, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha agonists&#xD;
      have their greatest effect on lipid metabolism and vascular biology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAK-559 is a novel oxyiminoalkanoic acid under investigation for use as an oral agent in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. TAK-559 has partial peroxisome&#xD;
      proliferator-activated receptor-alpha agonist activity, potent peroxisome&#xD;
      proliferator-activated receptor-alpha activity, and modest peroxisome proliferator-activated&#xD;
      receptor-gamma activity at high concentrations in nonclinical models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed to evaluate the safety and glycemic control of TAK-559 in patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus taking metformin for whom monotherapy with an oral&#xD;
      anti-diabetic had been insufficient.&#xD;
