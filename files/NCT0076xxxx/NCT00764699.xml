  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Crohn disease often have poor weight gain and short stature, yet the etiology&#xD;
      of the poor growth is not well defined. Studies in chronically ill patients who do not have&#xD;
      Crohn disease have suggested that inflammation causes IGF-1 deficiency due to inadequate&#xD;
      IGF-1 generation. Previous studies of GH use in Crohn patients have demonstrated improvement&#xD;
      in linear growth, weight and bone mineralization. However, GH can cause glucose intolerance&#xD;
      in chronically ill children, particularly those who require treatment with corticosteroids.&#xD;
      Recently the FDA has approved recombinant IGF-1 (rhIGF) for treatment of IGF-1 deficient&#xD;
      short stature. This medication has not been studied in Crohn disease. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to test the hypothesis that poor growth in Crohn disease is associated abnormal&#xD;
      IGF-1 generation which leads to poor linear growth, decreased weight and osteoporosis and&#xD;
      that replacement of IGF-1 with rhIGF will correct growth and improve bone density. To test&#xD;
      our hypothesis we will recruit 20 patients with Crohn disease from our pediatric&#xD;
      gastroenterology practice. Each will have been previously diagnosed with Crohn disease for a&#xD;
      minimum of one year and will be studied at baseline and six month intervals for one year&#xD;
      while on treatment with Increlex.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Subjects. We will recruit 20 established Crohn patients from our gastroenterology (GI)&#xD;
           referral practice at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. Each will have&#xD;
           previously undergone a complete diagnostic workup and classification of disease.&#xD;
           Information on disease activity, location and behavior are routinely recorded at each&#xD;
           follow up visit. Medical records will be assessed for this information. These patients&#xD;
           will be followed every three months. All of these patients will be assigned to receive&#xD;
           rhIGF therapy for 12 months and results will be compared to medical record data. We will&#xD;
           recruit 10 per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assessment of growth and IGF-1 generation. Each subject will undergo IGF-1 generation&#xD;
           testing using standard published &quot;high-dose: protocol and interpreted according to&#xD;
           guidelines of Blum. Briefly, GH will be given as a one time per day subcutaneous&#xD;
           injection in a dose of 0.05mg/kg/dy. IGF-1 will be measured at baseline and again after&#xD;
           7 days. Inadequate generation will be interpreted by an IGF-1 increase &lt; 15 ng/dl after&#xD;
           7 days of GH. We will also measure baseline random GH and IGFBP-3 levels. The IGF-1, GH&#xD;
           and IGFBP-3 levels will be measured by Esoterix laboratory (Calabasas Hills, CA). IGF-1&#xD;
           levels will also be measured every six months and with disease exacerbation. All&#xD;
           patients will have a single radiological film of the left hand and wrist to determine&#xD;
           bone age by Greulich and Pyle standards, and routine examination by the PI to determine&#xD;
           Tanner staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Anthropometric measures. Patients will be seen every three months. At every visit, we&#xD;
           will evaluate linear growth using a calibrated stadiometer and weight with a&#xD;
           standardized scale. Longitudinal data will be used to calculate height and weight&#xD;
           velocity. Height velocity will be annualized for each visit compared to baseline data.&#xD;
           All growth information, including velocity will be converted to standard deviation&#xD;
           scores (SDS, Z score) using GenenCalc (Genentech, San Francisco, CA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Nutrition. To assess for low nutritional intake as the cause for poor growth (and low&#xD;
           IGF-1 levels), each patient will complete a 3 day food journal at every visit and&#xD;
           results will be assessed by Nutrition Pro software. We will evaluate our findings in&#xD;
           both pubertal and prepubertal children. For this reason we will carefully measure Tanner&#xD;
           stage as breast in girls and testicular volume in boys. We will measure testosterone&#xD;
           levels in boys and estradiol in girls (Esoterix). Sex steroid levels will be correlated&#xD;
           with Tanner staging and tempo of pubertal progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Treatment with rhIGF (Increlex, Tercica). Patients will be followed as above for 12&#xD;
           months while on Increlex therapy. Increlex (rhIGF) will be administered per the&#xD;
           following schema: First 2 weeks: 40 mcg/kg BID; Weeks 3 and 4: 80 mcg/kg BID; Subsequent&#xD;
           weeks: 120 mcg/kg BID. Each parent and patient will be carefully trained in injection&#xD;
           technique by the same skilled personnel. Compliance will be assessed by having subjects&#xD;
           return empty vials to the study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Bone mineral content and bone turnover. All subjects will undergo DXA scan (Lunar&#xD;
           Prodigy) at baseline and every six months. Measurements will be compared to age- and&#xD;
           gender- matched normals and converted to Z scores (www.bcm.edu/bodycomplab). To&#xD;
           determine bone turnover, blood and urine will be collected at baseline and every six&#xD;
           months. These labs will be run by Esoterix according to their methods: N-Telopeptides&#xD;
           (reverse transcriptase PCR, urine), osteocalcin (double antibody RIA, blood), bone&#xD;
           specific alkaline phosphatase activity (ICMA, blood), and deoxypyridinoline (ELISA,&#xD;
           urine). Although the typical patient treated with GH demonstrates initial bone loss&#xD;
           during the first six months, our group has documented improvement in bone mineral&#xD;
           content within six months of starting GH therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Cytokines. We will measure the cytokines TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6 at the initiation of the&#xD;
           study, at 6 months and 12 months. This will better help us understand the role of&#xD;
           cytokines on disease course, activity, and the growth hormone axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Biomarkers for rhIGF-1 dosing efficacy. We will draw BL, 6 mos and 12 mos levels of&#xD;
           IGF-1, IGFBP3 and ALS levels. The baseline level will be collected prior to the 1st dose&#xD;
           of Increlex. At six months patients will be instructed to take their Increlex the&#xD;
           morning of their visit and the sample will be drawn within 2 hours of dosing which will&#xD;
           represent peak biomarker levels. The 12 month level will be obtained in the morning the&#xD;
           day after the patient completes his/her final dose and will represent a trough level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Measures of Disease Activity. At each protein turnover measure we will ask subjects to&#xD;
           bring stool samples which will be evaluated for fecal calprotectin. We will complete the&#xD;
           Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), a reliable and valid index for disease&#xD;
           activity in clinical research. Subjects will complete the IMPACT-III, a valid and&#xD;
           reliable measure of quality of life in pediatric Crohn disease.&#xD;
