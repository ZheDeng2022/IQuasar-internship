      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of the demonstrated activity of anti-angiogenesis agents in rGBM, it is reasonable&#xD;
      to postulate that adding these agents to standard RT and chemotherapy in the up-front&#xD;
      management of newly diagnosed GBM may improve the clinical benefit. This study will examine&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of adding CT-322 to the standard radiation therapy/temozolomide&#xD;
      (RT/TMZ) backbone of treatment for newly diagnosed GBM&#xD;
