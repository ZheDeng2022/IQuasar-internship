      The purpose of this research is to determine if two proteins in the blood are increased&#xD;
      during acute myocardial infarction and whether their levels are higher in those who develop&#xD;
      heart failure than those who do not. These two proteins are produced and potentially released&#xD;
      when the heart muscle is damaged. They may then be released into the blood and be detected by&#xD;
      standard method in the research laboratory. At this time, detection of an increase in these&#xD;
      proteins in the blood is not known to be associated with any disease or myocardial&#xD;
      infarction.&#xD;

      Hypotheses, Objectives and Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:Caspase-3, cleaved and activated, and dystrophin can be detected in human&#xD;
      circulation. The levels of these two markers are elevated during acute myocardial infarction.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the levels of these two proteins are greater in those who develop heart failure&#xD;
      than those who do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether cleaved caspase-3 and dystrophin can be detected in human&#xD;
           circulation after an acute myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare serum levels of these two markers in those who develop heart failure and&#xD;
           those who do not&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific Background and Significance: Apoptosis is a regulated biological process resulting&#xD;
      in cell death (4-9). Caspases, a family of cysteine acid proteases regulate the process, and&#xD;
      in fact, lead to apoptosis. Apoptotic trigger or signal results in the activation of proximal&#xD;
      or initiator caspases (such caspase-8, -9, 10). These initiator caspases then cleave and in&#xD;
      turn activate downstream effector caspases such as caspases-3, -6 and -7. These effector&#xD;
      caspases then cleave various proteins such as those present in cytoskeletons and nucleus like&#xD;
      lamin A, alpha-fodrin and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, leading to apoptosis. Caspase-3 is&#xD;
      the key executioner in this apoptotic pathway, responsible totally or critically in the&#xD;
      proteolytic cleavage of cellular and nuclear proteins. Activation of caspase-3 requires&#xD;
      proteolytic processing of its inactive zymogen into active p17 and p12 fragments. The cleaved&#xD;
      caspase-3 can be detected by antibodies specific for this cleaved enzyme (p17 fragment) in&#xD;
      cell lysates by immunoblotting or by an ELISA assay utilizing spectrophotometric&#xD;
      determination with a microplate reader at OD450 nm. Ischemia and reperfusion are known to&#xD;
      cause apoptosis. Therefore, acute MI may be associated with release of the final executioner&#xD;
      of apoptosis that is caspase-3, into the circulation.Another potential marker for acute&#xD;
      deterioration is dystrophin. Dystrophin was originally identified as the x-linked gene whose&#xD;
      mutations in its N-terminus cause cardiomyopathy. Dystrophin provides important structural&#xD;
      support for the cardiac myocyte and its sarcolemmal membrane (10-11). It links actin at its&#xD;
      N-terminus with the dystrophin-associated protein complex and sarcolemma at the C-terminus&#xD;
      and the extracellular matrix of muscle. Mutations cause loss of support and sarcolemmal&#xD;
      instability and myopathy. Myocardial dystrophin translocation and cleavage are associated&#xD;
      with the progression of heart failure and contractile dysfunction. These changes are reversed&#xD;
      following reduction of mechanical stress from ventricular assistance device (12). Since MI is&#xD;
      associated with sarcolemmal instability, dystrophin may also be released into circulation.&#xD;

        There are two arms to this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The investigators hope to enroll 350 healthy individuals, as defined by having no prior&#xD;
        diagnosis of heart disease to determine baseline levels and diurnal variations of the&#xD;
        markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants being evaluated for an acute Myocardial Infarction as determined by positive&#xD;
        CK MB/troponin levels, will be asked to enroll.&#xD;
