      The study investigates the relative efficacy of Interpersonal Psychotherapy and Brief&#xD;
      Relational Therapy for Major Depressive Disorder. The primary hypothesis is that there will&#xD;
      be no mean difference in efficacy between treatments, but that Brief Relational Therapy will&#xD;
      be more efficacious for more self-critical patients and Interpersonal Psychotherapy will be&#xD;
      more efficacious for less self-critical patients.&#xD;

      Interventions Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT; Klerman et. al., 1984) is an evidence-based,&#xD;
      time-limited treatment originally developed for treating Major Depressive Disorder, although&#xD;
      it has been extended and developed for Bulimia Nervosa and recently also for Post-Traumatic&#xD;
      Stress Disorder. The treatment is structured and focuses on relieving depressive symptoms by&#xD;
      targeting interpersonal problems in the patients' current life situation. In the first four&#xD;
      sessions an interpersonal problem area is identified that is asssumed to maintain the&#xD;
      patient's depression and this problem is agreed upon as a therapy focus. Four types of focus&#xD;
      areas are used in IPT: grief, role transitions, conflicts, and interpersonal deficits. In the&#xD;
      middle phase of therapy the agreed upon focus area is worked with in a problem-solving&#xD;
      fashion, and the patient is also encouraged to seek interpersonal support from his or her&#xD;
      environment. IPT has been established as an evidence-based treatment for Major Depression&#xD;
      (Roth &amp; Fonagy, 2005), and a recent meta-analysis concluded that it was slightly superior to&#xD;
      other established treatments for MDD including Cognitive Behavior Therapy (Cuijpers, van&#xD;
      Straaten, Andersson &amp; van Oppen, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief Relational Therapy (BRT; Safran &amp; Muran, 2000) is a relatively new version of&#xD;
      Short-Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy, based on relational psychoanalytic theory in&#xD;
      combination with research on processes of rupture and repair of the therapeutic alliance. The&#xD;
      therapeutic alliance, operationalized as the positive bond between patient and therapist in&#xD;
      combination with agreement on tasks and goals of treatment, is the single most robust&#xD;
      predictor of good outcome in psychotherapy research (Lambert &amp; Ogles, 2004). BRT was&#xD;
      developed to help patients who had previously failed in psychotherapeutic treatment(s),&#xD;
      presumably because of trouble in establishing a working therapeutic alliance with their&#xD;
      therapist(s). Therapists are trained to be highly attentive to the therapeutic relationship&#xD;
      and to signs of ruptures in the alliance, and to use self-disclosure and meta-communication&#xD;
      about ruptures in order to repair the therapy alliance and at the same time help patients to&#xD;
      develop a generalized capacity for observing self and others (mentalization). BRT has shown&#xD;
      preliminary evidence for efficacy with patients who are at risk of negative outcome in&#xD;
      psychotherapy (Safran, Muran, Samstag &amp; Winston, 2005) and with patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      DSM-IV axis II personality disorders (Muran, Safran, Samstag &amp; Winston, 2005). A specific&#xD;
      manual for BRT in Major Depressive Disorder is currently under development (Holmqvist, in&#xD;
      preparation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both treatments consist of 16 therapy sessions which are all video-taped for adherence&#xD;
      checks. The same therapists will provide both treatments, in randomized order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The objectives of the study are to compare the new treatment BRT with the&#xD;
      established treatment IPT in the alleviation of Major Depressive Disorder. The hypothesis of&#xD;
      the trial is that BRT will be superior for patients who have more difficulty establishing a&#xD;
      therapeutic alliance, while IPT will be superior for patients with less difficulty&#xD;
      establishing a therapeutic alliance. Previous research indicates that baseline self-critical&#xD;
      perfectionism negatively predicts outcome in IPT as well as several other brief&#xD;
      psychotherapeutic treatments for depression, and that this is because self-critical&#xD;
      perfectionism will cause problems in the therapeutic alliance (Luyten, Corveleyn &amp; Blatt,&#xD;
      2005). The primary hypothesis is thus that baseline self-cricial perfectionism moderates the&#xD;
      relationship between treatment and outcome. Secondary exploratory objectives are to conduct&#xD;
      in depth process research on the mechanisms of change in these treatments, as well as&#xD;
      interaction effects between treatment modality and other patient characteristics.&#xD;
