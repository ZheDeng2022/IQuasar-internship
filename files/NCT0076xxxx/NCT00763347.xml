  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of SYR-619, once daily&#xD;
      (QD), in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have not achieved glycemic control with&#xD;
      diet and exercise, or by taking metformin.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are approximately 19 million people in the United States who have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, of which 90% to 95% is type 2. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes varies&#xD;
      among racial and ethnic populations and has been shown to correlate with age, obesity, family&#xD;
      history, history of gestational diabetes, and physical inactivity. Over the next decade, a&#xD;
      marked increase in the number of adults with diabetes mellitus is expected, placing an ever&#xD;
      increasing burden on families and the health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SYR-619 is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzyme. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV is&#xD;
      thought to be primarily responsible for the in vivo degradation of 2 peptide hormones&#xD;
      released in response to nutrient ingestion, namely glucagon-like peptide-1 and&#xD;
      glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the dose-response efficacy, safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      treatment with SYR-619 in subjects with type 2 diabetes who do not previously achieve&#xD;
      adequate glycemic control with lifestyle modification (diet/exercise) or metformin or&#xD;
      sulfonylurea oral antidiabetic monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals who want to participate in this study will be required to provide written&#xD;
      informed consent. Study participation is anticipated to be about 14 Weeks. Multiple&#xD;
      procedures will occur at each visit which may include fasting, blood collection, urine&#xD;
      collection, vital signs including sitting and standing blood pressure and pulse, body height&#xD;
      and weight, physical examinations, electrocardiogram.&#xD;

                  sulfonylurea is not allowed within the 3 months prior to Screening and through&#xD;
