  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleeping medication and analgesia are standard administered during anesthesia. Sleeping&#xD;
      medication, Propofol (Diprivan, AstraZeneca), and analgesia, Remifentanil (GlaxoSmithKline),&#xD;
      are most frequently used In the University Hospital Ghent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical effect of administration of pharmaca can be measured in the changes of&#xD;
      heartbeat, blood pressure, respiration and the changes of brain activity by registering EEG.&#xD;
      These measurements are performed standard, to secure the safety of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The heartbeat and the EEG will be measured by non invasive adhesive electrodes on the skin of&#xD;
      the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood pressure will be measured by non invasive blood pressure cuff around the arm and&#xD;
      the respiration parameters will be measured by non invasive spirometry, which are all&#xD;
      standard available on a anesthesia device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the pharmaca are administered by a fixed dosage schedule based on the patient's&#xD;
      weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A more individualized administration of this pharmaca could lead to a better anesthesia&#xD;
      quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since considerable time, we know that a computer-controlled administration of these products&#xD;
      by automatic coupling between the measured effects and the &quot;spuit&quot;pump to administer the&#xD;
      product, could lead to a better administration, optimalisation of the administered dose,&#xD;
      because the patients individual effect of the administration can be taken in consideration.&#xD;
      This device is called the &quot;closed-loop system&quot;. The department of Anesthesia has already&#xD;
      proofed the utility of the device for automatic administration of Propofol and opiates in&#xD;
      small specific patient groups.&#xD;
