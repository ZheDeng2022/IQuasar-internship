      This study will compare the effectiveness of face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy versus&#xD;
      telephone-based cognitive behavioral therapy for treating African Americans who care for&#xD;
      family members with dementia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 4.5 million Americans suffer from progressive dementia, with higher rates among&#xD;
      African Americans than among European Americans. The majority of caregivers for dementia&#xD;
      patients are family members, who often deal with difficult behavior, agitation, and&#xD;
      aggressiveness in the people for whom they care. Because of the challenges they face, family&#xD;
      caregivers for dementia patients are at increased risk of mental health problems,&#xD;
      particularly depression. Promising research has shown that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      can combat distress in African-American caregivers. One way to deliver CBT is through&#xD;
      telephone-based interventions, which have been shown to lead to better psychological outcomes&#xD;
      than routine education and support. This study will create treatment manuals for CBT tailored&#xD;
      to the needs and preferences of African Americans who care for family members with dementia&#xD;
      and will develop procedures and strategies for treatment delivery to and retention of members&#xD;
      of this population. The study will then compare the effectiveness of face-to-face versus&#xD;
      telephone-based CBT in improving mental health outcomes for African Americans who care for&#xD;
      family members with dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last 3 months. Participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive either face-to-face or telephone-based CBT. Both groups will receive 12 weekly&#xD;
      sessions of therapy targeting caregiver depression and social functioning over time. Before&#xD;
      and after treatment, participants will be assessed on measures of depression and social&#xD;
      functioning through standardized questionnaires given over the telephone. Additional data&#xD;
      will be collected on social and demographic factors, stressors, caregiver appraisal of&#xD;
      resources, and use and costs of both mental and physical health care.&#xD;
