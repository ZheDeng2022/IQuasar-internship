  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to test the effectiveness of neuromuscular electrical&#xD;
      stimulation (NMES) that produces 40 % of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) in increasing&#xD;
      muscle size and improvement in muscle force output within the thigh muscle of elderly people.&#xD;

      Declines in whole skeletal muscle strength and size are features commonly associated with&#xD;
      aging. Aging reduces the number of fibers in the whole muscle, which explains the loss of&#xD;
      muscle mass. Frontera et al studied muscle strength, cross sectional area, and contractile&#xD;
      properties of skinned parts of single fibers of the quadriceps muscle. He found that the&#xD;
      strength and the whole muscle cross sectional area of knee extensors were significantly&#xD;
      higher in young men compared to old subjects, but there were no differences between old and&#xD;
      young subjects when the whole muscle strength was adjusted to the whole muscle cross&#xD;
      sectional area (specific tension). He also found that muscle fibers from young men were&#xD;
      stronger than muscle fibers from old men expressing the same myosin heavy chain isoform even&#xD;
      after adjusting for size. Therefore they concluded that abnormality in the quantity and/or&#xD;
      function of the contractile or regulatory proteins could explain the reduction in the ability&#xD;
      of muscle fibers to generate force.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with the loss of muscle fibers, atrophy of the fibers also has been attributed to the&#xD;
      aging process. This atrophy has been found to be selective to type II muscle fibers. Lexel et&#xD;
      al found in a study done on the cross sections of the whole vastus lateralis muscle from 20&#xD;
      men (19-84 years of age) that the mean Cross Sectional Area (CSA) of type II fibers from&#xD;
      muscles of older individuals was on average 35 % smaller while the mean CSA of type I was&#xD;
      approximately 6 % smaller than that of young individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aging and muscles Maintaining muscle strength and size with aging has become a significant&#xD;
      issue for elderly trying to keep up independent living and good quality of life. Several&#xD;
      studies on old men and women have proven the effectiveness of the resistance exercises in&#xD;
      reversing sarcopenia related problems . However in order to increase the size of type II&#xD;
      muscle fibers we need to apply high intensity exercises (80 % of 1 RM), or by applying low&#xD;
      resistance exercise that is very intense and is done with a large number of repetitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of electrical stimulation is well documented to improve quadriceps femoris muscle&#xD;
      torque output. Numerous experiments have been done to characterize the pattern of activation&#xD;
      of muscle fibers during electrically stimulated muscle contraction, and the results show that&#xD;
      the recruitment of motor units during electrically induced muscle contraction is non&#xD;
      selective. In other words, both type I and II fibers may have equal chance of being recruited&#xD;
      during electrically induced muscle contraction. It has been found that NMES is more likely to&#xD;
      activate type II muscle fibers at relatively low force levels compared to voluntary exercise.&#xD;
      If this is found to be true, then we may have an alternative intervention to improve muscle&#xD;
      strength and muscle hypertrophy for elderly individuals who could not perform high intensity&#xD;
      exercises to achieve these same benefits. This alternative approach might result in improved&#xD;
      overall physical function for these individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quadriceps muscle has been proposed to be treated because there is significant&#xD;
      relationship between quadriceps muscle strength and dynamic stability during chair rise and&#xD;
      gait at preferred speed in functionally limited elderly individuals&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This study is a two group, repeated measures, randomized clinical trial. Baseline&#xD;
      measurements of quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area, type II muscle fiber cross-sectional&#xD;
      area, quadriceps power output, the timed up and go test, the SPPB, stair climbing test and&#xD;
      ramp up power test will be obtained from subjects prior to the interventions. Following the&#xD;
      baseline assessments subjects will be randomly assigned to either the NMES group or the&#xD;
      comparable isometric strengthening exercise group. A set of sequentially numbered envelopes&#xD;
      will be created and a document indicating the intervention assignment will be placed in the&#xD;
      sequentially numbered envelopes. Upon completion of the baseline assessment, the study&#xD;
      coordinator will take the next envelope in the sequence and open the envelope. The study&#xD;
      coordinator will assign the subject to a group based on the randomized group assignment&#xD;
      information obtained from the sealed envelop. During the intervention period of the study&#xD;
      subjects will receive either NMES or isometric strengthening exercise 3 times a week for 12&#xD;
      weeks. Each session will last from 15-30 minutes. Post training outcome measures will be&#xD;
      taken at the end of the 12 week intervention period.&#xD;
