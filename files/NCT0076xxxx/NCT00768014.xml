      The purposes of this study is to integrate the objective tests into the subjective test,&#xD;
      visual analog score (VAS), for evaluation and further understanding of relieving labor pain&#xD;
      by TENS application on acupuncture points in the first stage of labor.&#xD;

      Our published paper &quot;Pain relief by applying transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation&#xD;
      (TENS) on acupuncture points during the first stage of labor: a randomized double-blind&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial. (Pain 2007; 127:214-20 )&quot; about the double-blind randomized&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study, sponsored by NSC 91-2314-B-182A-162-grant in 2002, showed that TENS&#xD;
      application on acupuncture points resulted in significantly better pain relief than placebo&#xD;
      by visual analogue scale (VAS) score in the first stage of labor. Two hurdles that hampered&#xD;
      physicians to evaluate the possible therapies in the management of obstetric pain. Firstly,&#xD;
      there is no objective test for pain. Secondly, lack of controlled trials for different&#xD;
      analgesic methods of pain treatment (interventional, psychological, physical therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is one of the non-pharmacological means of&#xD;
      pain relief for labor and delivery. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of TENS&#xD;
      on specific acupuncture points for reducing pain in the first stage of labor. In this&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned healthy full-term parturients in&#xD;
      active phase of first-stage labor to either TENS on 4 acupuncture points (Hegu [Li 4] and&#xD;
      Sanyinjiao [Sp 6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual analogue scale (VAS) will be used as an adjunct objective assessment of pain relief&#xD;
      efficacy by having a scale with a range from 1 to 10, where 1 represented no pain and 10 the&#xD;
      most painful. Participants will be asked by study personnel to estimate how painful during&#xD;
      the last contractions before the application of TENS, 30 minutes and 60 minutes after TENS&#xD;
      application. VAS will be recorded at each application (first, second application, and so&#xD;
      forth) as described till the end of first stage. Within 24 hours after delivery, the women&#xD;
      will be asked to fill in a questionnaire regarding the satisfaction of pain relief using TENS&#xD;
      during labor. Augmentation of labor will be administered to achieve three uterine&#xD;
      contractions in 10 minutes in the first stage according to the protocol of induction of&#xD;
      labor. Continuous external electronic fetal heart rate monitoring and tocodynamometry are&#xD;
      used for fetal surveillance. Polygraph recording of maternal heart rate, transcutaneous&#xD;
      oxygen tension, respiratory rate will be used for evaluate the changes. Details of the effect&#xD;
      of analgesia in participants switching to it, the progression of cervical dilation and the&#xD;
      length of first stage after the application of TENS are recorded. The request for epidural&#xD;
      anesthesia or other form of analgesia will be available upon request. Adverse events such as&#xD;
      discomfort of movement restriction, skin allergy, or electrical accident were recorded if&#xD;
      any. Decision of performing operative delivery was made only according to maternal and fetal&#xD;
      indications. fMRI A scan will be collected in between 30-60 minutes after the application&#xD;
      TENS. Subjects will be asked to lie supine on the scanner bed and motion artifact will be&#xD;
      excluded. MR imaging parameters: Functional scans using 3.0-Tesla Siemens Allegra MRI System&#xD;
      equipped for echo-planar imaging. Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional imaging&#xD;
      will be carried out using a gradient echo T2-weighted pulse sequence. At least 38 sagittal&#xD;
      slices, 3 mm thick with 0.6-mm gap will be performed in each scan. Image collection was&#xD;
      preceded by four dummy scans to allow for equilibration of the MRI signal. A3D MPRAGE&#xD;
      T1-weighted high-resolution structure dataset was collected before functional imaging to&#xD;
      facilitate Talairach transformation and visualization.&#xD;
