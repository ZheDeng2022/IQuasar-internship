      The influenza virus, commonly called the flu, is a common source of infection in lung&#xD;
      transplant patients and can often lead to pneumonia and possibly rejection. The annual&#xD;
      influenza vaccine is the most important strategy used to prevent infection but it is not&#xD;
      effective in all lung transplant patients. It has been thought that the response to the&#xD;
      vaccine may be improved if it is given into the skin (intradermal) rather than the muscle&#xD;
      (intramuscular). We hypothesize that a significantly greater proportion of patients will&#xD;
      respond to vaccination using the intradermal influenza vaccine compared to the intramuscular&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;

      The annual influenza vaccine is suggested for immunocompromised patients. However, the&#xD;
      immunogenic response to this vaccine is suboptimal and ranges from 15-70%. In lung transplant&#xD;
      recipients, responses to the influenza vaccine are poorest of all organ transplant groups.&#xD;
      For example, a study with 43 stable lung transplant recipients showed that protective&#xD;
      antibody developed in 19%, 30%, and 40% for the three antigens in the vaccine (only 8.6% of&#xD;
      subjects developed protective antibody levels against all three). Similarly, 43% responded&#xD;
      after a single dose of vaccine was given to 68 lung transplant recipients; response was&#xD;
      significantly lower in those on mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). We have recently published a&#xD;
      study in 60 lung transplant recipients where the standard influenza vaccine was immunogenic&#xD;
      to at least one vaccine antigen in approximately 60% of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study we propose is a prospective randomized control trial designed to assess the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the influenza vaccine given intradermally compared to the standard&#xD;
      intramuscular vaccine in lung transplant recipients. Lung transplant recipients are unique in&#xD;
      that their vaccine responses are the lowest of all organ groups and they stand to benefit&#xD;
      most from an alternate vaccine strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY Lung transplant recipients appear to have one of the&#xD;
      poorest humoral responses to influenza vaccination of all the organ transplant groups.&#xD;
      However, influenza remains an important cause of morbidity in this population in whom&#xD;
      protection is imperative. The current vaccine is suboptimal and newer strategies need to be&#xD;
      studied to increase response rates. This subject area is of critical importance to study and&#xD;
      especially in light of the threat of pandemic influenza.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE AND HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the specific humoral and cellular response after the intradermal influenza&#xD;
           vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the safety of the intradermal influenza vaccine in the lung transplant&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We hypothesize that a significantly greater proportion of patients will respond to&#xD;
           vaccination using the intradermal influenza vaccine compared to the intramuscular&#xD;
           vaccine.&#xD;
