      STUDY QUESTIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the real prevalence of platelet &quot;resistance&quot; to aspirin during the acute phase&#xD;
           of stroke and after 3 months, and 1 year, as measured using different platelet function&#xD;
           tests?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do all methods measure similar levels of resistance, or are some methods more sensitive&#xD;
           than others?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does this resistance result in a worse clinical prognosis? Is this result independent of&#xD;
           other variables?&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hospital Phase (Acute Stroke)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Determination, using various methods, of the prevalence of platelet hyperreactivity&#xD;
                in patients treated with aspirin to treat ischemic stroke (acute phase)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Comparison of different assessment methods and identification of the most accurate&#xD;
                of these&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Identification of variables that correlate with platelet hyperreactivity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Follow-up Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Correlation between platelet hyperreactivity and important clinical outcomes at 12,&#xD;
                24, and 36 months&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Correlation between platelet hyperreactivity and death or dependency at hospital&#xD;
                discharge, at 3, 12, 24, and 36 months (Modified Rankin Scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Correlation between platelet hyperreactivity and recurrent stroke of any type&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Correlation between different methods for evaluating platelet functions and&#xD;
                identification of the most accurate method&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Analysis of hyperreactivity over time&#xD;
&#xD;
      THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will include 200 consecutive patients seen in the emergency department of a&#xD;
           large, urban hospital (1500 inpatient beds) and diagnosed with stroke in the acute&#xD;
           phase; these patients will be treated with aspirin for an undetermined period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators will not include patients who require full anticoagulation treatment,&#xD;
           regardless of the cause&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Importantly, the analysis of primary and secondary outcomes will be carried out after&#xD;
           blinding the examiner to the results of the platelet aggregation tests&#xD;

      THE CONTEXT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspirin is the anti-thrombotic therapy of choice for patients in the acute or chronic phase&#xD;
      of vascular, cardiac, and neurological diseases, unless there is a specific indication for&#xD;
      sodium warfarin (for instance, cardiac thrombus, chronic atrial fibrillation, cardio-embolic&#xD;
      ischemic stroke). Recent studies, including some meta-analyses, suggest that 5-60% of&#xD;
      patients with cardiovascular disease who use aspirin show some platelet resistance to the&#xD;
      drug. However, the available studies include several methodological errors that make&#xD;
      interpretation and practical application difficult. Thus, the incidence and outcome of&#xD;
      platelet resistance remain poorly understood, especially in patients with ischemic stroke.&#xD;
      Moreover, few studies have included patients in ambulatory follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      THERAPY WITH ASPIRIN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of aspirin to be prescribed in this study will be 300 mg orally or by nasogastric&#xD;
      tube once a day (assisted therapy), with first dose tomography soon after admission if the&#xD;
      patient has no indication of thrombolytic therapy. After the acute phase, patients will&#xD;
      receive aspirin at a dose of 200 mg/day. Aspirin will be administered in a &quot;simple&quot;&#xD;
      preparation (no buffer, no extended release)&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS OF OUTCOME DURING THE HOSPITAL PHASE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes will be assessed daily during hospitalization until the patient is discharged.&#xD;
      The physician, the patient, and the researchers will not have access to the results of tests&#xD;
      for platelet function. The number of days of hospitalization will be reviewed, including the&#xD;
      number of days of hospitalization in the intensive care unit. Deaths will be analyzed, and&#xD;
      the cause of death will be described in detail in each case. Electrocardiograms will be&#xD;
      examined by an experienced cardiologist. Echocardiograms will be examined by an experienced&#xD;
      cardiologist specializing in this method. Tomography will be examined by an experienced&#xD;
      neuroradiologist, and resonance/resonance angiography will be evaluated by another&#xD;
      experienced neuroradiologist; both will be blinded to the platelet results. Outcomes will be&#xD;
      judged by a committee containing a neurologist, a hematologist, a neuroradiologist, a&#xD;
      cardiologist, and an epidemiologist, all of whom will be blinded to the results of platelet&#xD;
      function&#xD;
&#xD;
      MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT AFTER HOSPITAL DISCHARGE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be analyzed through interviews 3, 12, 24, and 36 months after the initial&#xD;
      neurological event, as well as with monthly telephone interviews. Potential adverse outcomes&#xD;
      (death, hospitalization, diagnostic tests conducted, request for treatment of any condition,&#xD;
      or new onset of symptoms) will be assessed in detail by the committee of investigators of&#xD;
      this study. During this evaluation, the doctor, the patient, and the researchers will not&#xD;
      have access to the results of the tests for platelet function. The outcomes will be judged by&#xD;
      a committee comprising a neurologist, a hematologist, a neuroradiologist, a cardiologist, and&#xD;
      an epidemiologist, all of whom will be blinded to platelet test results Adherence (daily use)&#xD;
      will be investigated in an active manner at all return visits and through monthly telephone&#xD;
      contact. This study will include interviews with patients and separate interviews with&#xD;
      families, in addition to reviews of the package of aspirin. In addition, adherence will be&#xD;
      assessed by measuring serum thromboxane B2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monthly telephone contact with the patient and his or her family will be used to&#xD;
           determine whether the patient has remained stable or has had any adverse outcome (died,&#xD;
           needed to seek medical care, or presented new symptoms). In the presence of any such&#xD;
           outcomes, we will investigate the details (death certificate, report of hospital stay,&#xD;
           and analysis of diagnostic tests performed). In addition, we will investigate the&#xD;
           records and medical reports associated with any inquiries or admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The evaluation at three and twelve months will consist of a variety of tests of platelet&#xD;
           function; in addition, a standardized questionnaire will be administered. Patients who&#xD;
           do not attend the consultation will be contacted within 30 days. If the patient still&#xD;
           cannot attend the consultation (e.g., because of difficulty in walking), the researcher&#xD;
           will go to the patient's home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SEVERE BLEEDING&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any fatal bleeding event (all causes will be described)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Life-threatening bleeding: a drop in hemoglobin of at least 50 g/L, hypotension&#xD;
           requiring inotropes (hemorrhagic shock); symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage; or&#xD;
           transfusion of at least 4 units of red blood cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major bleeding, defined as significantly disabling (with persistent sequelae);&#xD;
           intraocular bleeding leading to significant loss of vision; or transfusion of 1-3 units&#xD;
           of red blood cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEFINITION OF HYPERREACTIVITY TO ASPIRIN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For PFA-100 using a cartridge with C-EPI (collagen-epinephrine): occlusion time &lt; 150&#xD;
           seconds&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chrono-Log Model 700 Whole-Blood: above 0 Ω with 0.75 mM of arachidonic acid&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chrono-Log Model 700 Whole-Blood: with collagen at 1 mg/L and 5 mg/L, according to the&#xD;
           formula 1 - (Rate of aggregation with 1 mg / Rate of aggregation with 5 mg).&#xD;
           Hyperreactivity will be defined for values below 0.50&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  - Chrono-Log Model 700 Whole-Blood: with collagen at 1 mg/L above 10 Ω&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plateletworks: aggregation of more than 60% with arachidonic acid will be considered&#xD;
           resistant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VerifyNow Aspirin Assay (Accumetrics): ≥ 550 aspirin reaction units (ARUs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impact-R (Diamed) &gt; 3.2% platelet aggregates on the surface of the plate after&#xD;
           incubation with arachidonic acid&#xD;
&#xD;
      COLLECTION OF BLOOD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected on arrival at the ED (before the first dose of aspirin), on&#xD;
      the fifth day of hospitalization, after three months, and again after 12 months. Samples will&#xD;
      be collected between 9 and 12 AM after fasting overnight, except for the sample taken on&#xD;
      arrival at the ED. The blood will be collected from the antecubital vein, or another vein if&#xD;
      necessary, into bottles of citrate (3.2%; Vacuette, Greiner Bio-One) or directly into the&#xD;
      Plateletworks bottle kit. Samples will total approximately 20 ml. The tourniquet will not be&#xD;
      applied for more than 30 seconds and movement will not be allowed before or during&#xD;
      collection. In order to prevent platelet activation induced by collection, even with the&#xD;
      above precautions, the first 5 ml sample will be discarded. The bottles will be filled to the&#xD;
      top and gently inverted five times to obtain the correct mixture of blood with anticoagulant.&#xD;
      In the Plateletworks test, assays will conducted within 10 minutes of collection; the&#xD;
      remaining assays will be conducted within 30 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
      AGGREGOMETRY BY MEASURING THE IMPEDANCE OF WHOLE BLOOD USING CHRONOLOG MODEL 700 AND SOFTWARE&#xD;
      (AGGRO/LINK-8, PA, USA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      After collecting citrated whole blood, the sample will be processed in under 30 minutes.&#xD;
      Whole blood will be diluted 1:1 with sterile saline (0.9%) and stimulated with one of several&#xD;
      reagents (Chrono-Log, 0.5 mM arachidonic acid, 1 g/L collagen, or 5 g/L collagen). The&#xD;
      maximum impedance will be measured using two electrodes immersed in the sample for 6 minutes&#xD;
      and expressed as Ω.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PFA-100 (PLATELET FUNCTION ANALYZE-100, SIEMENS, USA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood specimens for PFA-100® assays will be tested according to the manufacturer's&#xD;
      instructions. For all samples, the PFA-100® self-test procedure will be run before analysis.&#xD;
      Testing will be performed using citrated whole blood with collagen-epinephrine cartridges.&#xD;
      Whole blood will be aspirated under conditions of high shear stress through a 150-µm aperture&#xD;
      covered with a membrane impregnated with collagen and epinephrine. The time taken to occlude&#xD;
      the aperture by a platelet plug will be recorded as the closure time (measured in seconds).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DETERMINATION OF SERUM THROMBOXANE B2 - ELISA&#xD;
&#xD;
      After collection, blood will be immediately centrifuged (+4 °C), and the plasma immediately&#xD;
      frozen in liquid nitrogen (-190 °C) and then transferred to a -80 °C freezer. Serum&#xD;
      thromboxane B2 will be measured by ELISA in duplicate according to the manufacturer's&#xD;
      instructions, and expressed as ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLATELETWORKS (HELENA CORPORATION, USA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Briefly, after collection of blood in kits containing arachidonic acid, collagen, ADP and&#xD;
      EDTA, platelet counts will be made by impedance measurement (Horiba ABX, Montpellier,&#xD;
      France), in accordance with the standard protocol of Helena Laboratories (Helena Point of&#xD;
      Care ®, Texas, USA). The percentage of platelet aggregation will be calculated using the&#xD;
      following formula: % of aggregation = [platelets in EDTA - platelets with agonist]/ platelets&#xD;
      in EDTA x 100&#xD;
&#xD;
      VERIFYNOW ASPIRIN, ACCUMETRICS, USA&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VerifyNow Aspirin point-of-care system (Accumetrics, San Diego, CA, USA) is based on&#xD;
      turbidimetric optical detection of platelet aggregation in whole blood. Whole blood will be&#xD;
      transferred into standard cartridges containing a lyophilized preparation of human&#xD;
      fibrinogen-coated beads and arachidonic acid. As aggregation occurs, the system will convert&#xD;
      luminosity transmittance results into aspirin reaction units (ARUs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPACT-R, DIAMED, USA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Citrated blood (130 μL) will be placed in the test kit (wells) according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer's protocol, and subjected to shear flow using a rotating cone for 2 minutes&#xD;
      (1800 s-1). The wells will then be washed and stained with May Grünwald. The adhesion of&#xD;
      platelets to the surface will be evaluated using an image analysis system connected to the&#xD;
      Impact-R, and the results will be expressed as the percentage of stained area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all calculations, will be used the software IBM SPSS 21.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago,&#xD;
      IL, USA). The database will be created by SPSS Data Entry Builder 4.0 using the double entry&#xD;
      input system.&#xD;
