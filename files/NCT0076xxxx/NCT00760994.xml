    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an experiential acceptance therapy&#xD;
      intervention is effective in the treatment of alcohol dependency and post-traumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder (PTSD) symptoms in individuals who suffer from PTSD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol dependence (AD) afflicts nearly 14% of the population (Kessler et al., 1994; Kessler&#xD;
      et al., 1997; Regier et al., 1990), and has a chronic and relapsing course (Brownell,&#xD;
      Marlatt, Litchenstein, &amp; Wilson, 1986). Negative emotional states have consistently been&#xD;
      found to maintain alcohol use disorders (AUDs; Cooney, Litt, Morse, Bauer, &amp; Gaupp, 1997;&#xD;
      Litt, Cooney, Kadden, &amp; Gaupp, 1990; Rubonis et al., 1994) and increase the risk of relapse&#xD;
      following AUD treatment (Cooney et al., 1997). This relationship is particularly robust among&#xD;
      individuals with co-morbid psychiatric disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder&#xD;
      (PTSD; Coffey et al., 2002; Sharkansy, Brief, Peirce, Meehan, &amp; Mannix, 1999; Tate, Brown,&#xD;
      Unrod, &amp; Ramo, 2004; Waldrop, Back, Verduin, &amp; Brady, in press). Likewise, alcohol use may be&#xD;
      maintained by a desire to facilitate or prolong positive emotional states (Cooper, Frone,&#xD;
      Russell, &amp; Mudar, 1992; Simpson, 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many psychological interventions for AUDs, most notably the majority of cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      treatment (CBT) packages, have thus focused on the development of coping skills to prevent&#xD;
      relapse in response to such triggers, and have been demonstrated to be at least moderately&#xD;
      effective in promoting abstinence (Miller &amp; Wilbourne, 2002). However, attempts to specify&#xD;
      the active ingredients of CBT for AD have been disappointing and most studies examining&#xD;
      potential mechanisms of change have failed to find the expected relationships (Longabaugh et&#xD;
      al., 2005; Morgenstern &amp; Longabaugh, 2000). The lack of empirical evidence substantiating&#xD;
      coping skills as a mechanism of change for CBT (Morgenstern &amp; Longabaugh, 2000) may be due,&#xD;
      in part, to the lack of specificity in coping skill interventions. Broadly speaking, two&#xD;
      primary foci of coping skill interventions for AUD are 1) increasing cognitive techniques&#xD;
      focused on challenging and changing thought patterns, or 2) increasing experiential&#xD;
      acceptance by fostering an accepting stance towards internal states, such as through &quot;urge&#xD;
      surfing&quot; (Kadden et al., 1992). These two coping skill approaches (cognitive restructuring&#xD;
      and experiential acceptance) likely lead to reduced alcohol use through different pathways.&#xD;
      Theoretically, experiential acceptance approaches suggest that the mechanism of change in&#xD;
      decreasing alcohol use is increased willingness toward internal experience (e.g., emotions,&#xD;
      thoughts, sensations), whereas cognitive restructuring approaches suggest that decreased&#xD;
      alcohol use results from decreases in negative appraisals brought about by challenging and&#xD;
      changing thought patterns. However, this has yet to be systematically evaluated.&#xD;

    <description>After the treatment had been started and for five weeks following the treatment, participants reported their alcohol use on the previous day using the IVR technology. Each participant's data were added and averaged to get the average drinks per day of each treatment group (EA and CR) and control group. The higher the number, the more drinks were consumed per day. Possible minimum value: 0. Possible maximum value: unlimited.</description>

    <measure>Average Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Scores Per Day Assessed Using Daily Interactive Voice Response (IVR)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PTSD scores were collected via the IVR technology after the treatment has been started and for the next five weeks. Participants completed an abbreviated version of PCL-C (PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version) daily. Three re-experiencing symptoms, 2 avoidance symptoms, 3 emotional numbing symptoms, &amp; 4 four hyperarousal symptoms were included. Participants rated each symptom from 0 (not at all) to 8 (all the time). The higher the score, the more intense their PTSD symptoms. The minimum &amp; maximum possible scores were 0 &amp; 96, respectively. Each participant's data were added and averaged to get the average PTSD scores per day of each treatment group (EA and CR) and control group.</description>

          <title>Average Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Scores Per Day Assessed Using Daily Interactive Voice Response (IVR)</title>
          <description>PTSD scores were collected via the IVR technology after the treatment has been started and for the next five weeks. Participants completed an abbreviated version of PCL-C (PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version) daily. Three re-experiencing symptoms, 2 avoidance symptoms, 3 emotional numbing symptoms, &amp; 4 four hyperarousal symptoms were included. Participants rated each symptom from 0 (not at all) to 8 (all the time). The higher the score, the more intense their PTSD symptoms. The minimum &amp; maximum possible scores were 0 &amp; 96, respectively. Each participant's data were added and averaged to get the average PTSD scores per day of each treatment group (EA and CR) and control group.</description>
