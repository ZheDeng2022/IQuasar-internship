    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out what effects radioactive particles,&#xD;
      SIR-spheres, have when injected into the liver, followed by systemic chemotherapy with a&#xD;
      combination of cetuximab and irinotecan compared to those who have systemic therapy alone, in&#xD;
      patients with colon cancer that has metastasized to the liver. The safety of this treatment&#xD;
      and how well it controls the disease will also be studied.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Yttrium microspheres are designed to treat cancer that has metastasized to the liver by&#xD;
      giving radiation directly to the tumor. SIR-spheres are designed to deliver radiation&#xD;
      directly to the tumor. This radiation kills the tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetuximab is a drug that blocks epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR may be involved&#xD;
      in certain types of cancer, including non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). When EGFR is&#xD;
      stimulated, a series of chemical reactions start that result in a tumor being &quot;told&quot; to grow.&#xD;
      Cetuximab tries to stop these reactions by blocking EGFR. This may stop tumors from growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irinotecan is designed to block cell growth by blocking an enzyme that repairs DNA, the&#xD;
      building blocks of cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a&#xD;
      coin) to 1of 2 groups. Participants in one group will receive the SIR-spheres with Cetuximab&#xD;
      and Irinotecan therapy. Participants in the other group will just have the Cetuximab and&#xD;
      Irinotecan therapy without the SIR-spheres. There is an equal chance of being assigned to&#xD;
      either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will have a blood vessel&#xD;
      study (given with x-ray dye) performed. This will help researchers look at the arteries&#xD;
      leading to your liver and the surrounding areas. You will receive Versed and Fentanyl,&#xD;
      sedative drugs to put you to sleep, intravenously (IV--through a needle in a vein) in your&#xD;
      arm. A catheter will be placed through your groin artery into the artery leading to your&#xD;
      liver. A catheter is a sterile flexible tube that will be placed into a large artery while&#xD;
      you are under local anesthesia and IV sedation. Your physician will explain this procedure to&#xD;
      you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form for this&#xD;
      procedure. X-ray dye will be injected through the catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If randomly selected to receive the SIR-Spheres with Cetuximab and Irinotecan therapy, a&#xD;
      small amount of radioactive albumin injection (a part of a scan test used to measure the&#xD;
      supply of blood through the lungs) will be given to your liver. Images will then be taken to&#xD;
      learn if too much of this material (radioactive particles) shows up in your lungs and if your&#xD;
      liver anatomy is normal. If everything appears normal, the yttrium microspheres will be given&#xD;
      slowly through the catheter in 1 dose. If your liver anatomy is abnormal, the yttrium&#xD;
      microspheres will be given slowly through the catheter in 2 doses. After you are given the&#xD;
      yttrium microspheres, the catheter will be removed, and pressure will be applied to your&#xD;
      groin to stop any bleeding. You will then be monitored for 6 hours to check on your well&#xD;
      being. You will be given pain medication, if needed (the same sedative drugs used before).&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given standard doses of Zantac (ranitidine) to help to protect the stomach during&#xD;
      treatment. Chemotherapy with cetuximab and irinotecan will be given on an outpatient basis. A&#xD;
      catheter (PICC line, port-a-cath) may be inserted through a vein in your arm or chest to&#xD;
      ensure that the chemotherapy is given without interruption. Irinotecan will be given by IV&#xD;
      over 90 minutes, once every 3 weeks. Cetuximab will be given once a week. On Day 1 of&#xD;
      treatment, you will be given a test dose of cetuximab, to check for any allergic reactions.&#xD;
      After that, cetuximab will be given by IV over 2 hours. Before every dose of cetuximab, you&#xD;
      will be given a dose of diphenhydramine by IV, to keep from having any allergic reactions.&#xD;
      You will also receive medication to prevent nausea, vomiting, or an allergic reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) scan within 1 week&#xD;
      after your treatment. A SPECT scan lets your doctor study the function of your internal&#xD;
      organs. You will have blood (about 2 tablespoons) drawn every week for the first 2 months and&#xD;
      then once a month on an outpatient basis. This is so researchers can check the function of&#xD;
      your kidneys and liver. You will also have a routine physical exam and a computerized&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scan performed once a month to check the growth of your tumor. Researchers&#xD;
      will check to see if your tumor is responding to the study treatment by looking at the&#xD;
      imaging on CT scans every 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may be taken off this study if your disease gets worse, if you experience intolerable&#xD;
      side effects, or if there is not enough of the study drug supply to continue treating your&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be followed-up by telephone for as long as you have cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Yttrium microspheres are FDA approved for hepatic arterial&#xD;
      therapy and treatment of liver metastases. Sir-Sphere therapy has been approved for treating&#xD;
      colorectal cancer with liver metastases. The combination of cetuximab and irinotecan is FDA&#xD;
      approved for metastatic colorectal cancer. Up to 60 patients will take part in this study.&#xD;
      All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
