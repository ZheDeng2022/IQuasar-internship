  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to collect data to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      the OptiMesh 1500S to contain and reinforce bone graft materials in patients with&#xD;
      Degenerative Disc Disease (DDD) whose condition requires an interbody spinal fusion procedure&#xD;
      combined with posterior fixation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seventy-six thousand posterior interbody fusions are performed annually in the U.S., and it&#xD;
      has been estimated that at least 50% of those cases include supplemental posterior&#xD;
      instrumentation. For interbody fusion with posterior fixation, spine surgeons currently place&#xD;
      structural intervertebral spacers into the interbody space. These spacers may be pre-shaped&#xD;
      devices constructed of allograft (cortical bone dowels or femoral rings) or non-metallic,&#xD;
      radiolucent materials, or metallic cage devices. Autogenous bone graft and blood components&#xD;
      (marrow, blood) are often added.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of morselized bone graft in orthopedic procedures is desirable because it is more rapidly&#xD;
      incorporated during the course of bone healing. If the morselized graft pack can be&#xD;
      effectively contained in the interbody space, the graft material can function as a structural&#xD;
      spacer to provide anterior column support. Contained graft material can be tightly packed&#xD;
      within the mesh to increase the graft's compressive strength. Unlike pre-shaped cortical&#xD;
      grafts, the morselized pack conforms intimately to the host bone at the surgical site,&#xD;
      ensuring good vascularization potential and reducing the osteoblast jumping distance for&#xD;
      osteogenesis. In addition, the solidly packed graft retains intra-pack porosity, ensuring an&#xD;
      osteoconductive scaffold to facilitate vascular and bony ingrowth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It would be desirable to minimize autograft use because of associated post-op pain, to&#xD;
      optimize contact between allograft and host bone, and to permit the surgeon to place or&#xD;
      construct an effective structural intervertebral spacer with only minimal neural retraction&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OptiMesh 1500S is intended to be used to contain the bone graft placed by spine surgeons into&#xD;
      the interbody space to achieve spinal intervertebral body fusion. OptiMesh 1500S enables the&#xD;
      use of morselized bone graft materials in spine fusion procedures instead of solid allograft&#xD;
      materials, such as cortical bone dowels or femoral rings, or rigid synthetic materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the OptiMesh instrument system allows the surgeon to perform an interbody fusion&#xD;
      through a small portal and to complete the entire fusion procedure from a posterior approach&#xD;
      instead of a 360 degree anterior/ posterior procedure, which is often the case with the use&#xD;
      of cages. The minimal access portal utilized for OptiMesh filling allows the device to be&#xD;
      placed via a unilateral transforaminal or translaminar approach, versus the often-used&#xD;
      bilateral approach required for many cages and cortical spacers. This flexibility permits the&#xD;
      surgeon to adapt the surgical approach to the local anatomy of the patient.&#xD;

    <measure>Mean Change in Low Back Pain Score at 24-months Compared to Pre-op</measure>
    <time_frame>24 month</time_frame>
    <description>A Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score was used to evaluate a subject's level of pain. The VAS is a 10 cm pain scale where a score of &quot;0&quot; represents &quot;No Pain&quot; and a score of &quot;10&quot; represents the &quot;Worst Possible&quot; pain. The magnitude of change in the 24-month score compared to the baseline score is calculated. A clinically meaningful change is defined as a 2 unit (cm) reduction at 24-months when compared to pre-op.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in Back Function Score at 24-months Compared to Pre-op</measure>
    <time_frame>24 month</time_frame>
    <description>A subject's back function was assessed by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). The ODI is a 10 question survey that evaluates the degree of functional impairment. Completion of the survey yields a score from &quot;0&quot; to &quot;100&quot; points. A score of &quot;0&quot; represents &quot;No disability&quot; and &quot;100&quot; represents &quot;Total disability&quot;. The magnitude of change between the two timepoints is reported. A clinically meaningful improvement is defined as a 15 point reduction at 24-months compared to the pre-op score.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Low Back Pain Score at 24-months Compared to Pre-op</title>
        <description>A Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score was used to evaluate a subject's level of pain. The VAS is a 10 cm pain scale where a score of &quot;0&quot; represents &quot;No Pain&quot; and a score of &quot;10&quot; represents the &quot;Worst Possible&quot; pain. The magnitude of change in the 24-month score compared to the baseline score is calculated. A clinically meaningful change is defined as a 2 unit (cm) reduction at 24-months when compared to pre-op.</description>

        <description>A subject's back function was assessed by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). The ODI is a 10 question survey that evaluates the degree of functional impairment. Completion of the survey yields a score from &quot;0&quot; to &quot;100&quot; points. A score of &quot;0&quot; represents &quot;No disability&quot; and &quot;100&quot; represents &quot;Total disability&quot;. The magnitude of change between the two timepoints is reported. A clinically meaningful improvement is defined as a 15 point reduction at 24-months compared to the pre-op score.</description>
