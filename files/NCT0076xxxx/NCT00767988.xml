  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Girls with spina bifida also have bladder problems. This is because they need temporary&#xD;
      placement of a tube into the bladder to remove urine. This thin flexible tube is called a&#xD;
      catheter. It can increase the risk of having bacteria in the urine. This in turn can lead to&#xD;
      urinary tract infection (UTI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some girls with spina bifida are given antibiotics. These are medicines used to treat&#xD;
      infections caused by bacteria. The medicine is used to prevent UTI. However, long-term&#xD;
      treatment with these medicines can have side effects. For example, the bacteria may become&#xD;
      resistant to the antibiotics. Also, bacteria in the urine can persist. UTI can still occur in&#xD;
      patients on antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UTI in girls occurs because bacteria migrate from the rectum to the vagina area. This gives&#xD;
      the bacteria access to the bladder. Also, in girls with spina bifida, the access to the&#xD;
      bladder is easier because of the catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotics are friendly bacteria. They are available as dietary supplements and as food. They&#xD;
      contain helpful bacteria. Yogurt is an example of a food that contains probiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out, if probiotics taken for 6 months can prevent UTI in&#xD;
      girls with spina bifida. We will also try to find out whether changes in urine bacteria are&#xD;
      associated with the taking of the probiotics. A vaginal and rectal swab will also be done to&#xD;
      find out if taking probiotics has any benefits on preventing bacteria.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In children with spina bifida and neurogenic bladder dysfunction, the need for intermittent&#xD;
      bladder catheterization increases the risk of bacteriuria. In many patients, this leads to a&#xD;
      clinically significant urinary tract infection (UTI). Many of these children are placed on&#xD;
      long term, low dose antibiotic suppression to prevent recurrent urinary infection.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, bacteriuria often persists despite daily antibiotic therapy, and breakthrough&#xD;
      UTIs are common. Furthermore, this approach carries the potential for deleterious side&#xD;
      effects, and may promote the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UTI in girls occur when virulent bacteria migrate from the rectum and colonize the vagina and&#xD;
      peri-urethral mucosa, thus gaining access to the bladder. In girls with spina bifida, access&#xD;
      to the bladder is greatly facilitated by catheter passage. Antibiotic prophylaxis relies on&#xD;
      maintaining a low dose of antibiotic in the urinary stream, which decreases peri-urethral&#xD;
      colonization, and prevents proliferation of bacteria after they gain access to the bladder.&#xD;
      An alternative approach to daily antibiotic prophylaxis is to decrease the risk of urinary&#xD;
      colonization with virulent bacteria by supplementing the normal bacteria flora with&#xD;
      non-infection causing strains of bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotics are dietary supplements containing potentially beneficial bacterial strains such&#xD;
      as Lactobacillus. The safety of oral administration of probiotics has been demonstrated in&#xD;
      several studies over the last 30 years. Studies using Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, a probiotic&#xD;
      introduced in the late 1980s to alleviate diarrhea, have shown promising results when used&#xD;
      for UTI prevention. In one study, researchers found that the subjects consuming GG drinks had&#xD;
      fewer episodes of UTI compared to those women not receiving probiotics. A placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study in premature infants also used GG in an attempt to prevent UTI. The number of urinary&#xD;
      infections was reduced but statistically the difference was not significant. Finally, a&#xD;
      recent randomized clinical trial demonstrated that the rate of UTI in children taking&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotics was similar to that of patients taking Lactobacillus acidophilus&#xD;
      alone. The efficacy of probiotic usage in the spina bifida population has not been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trials have suggested that oral ingestion of the probiotic strains Lactobacillus&#xD;
      reuteri RC-14 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 results in vaginal colonization and prevention&#xD;
      of adult UTI, potentially by inhibiting uropathogen ascension from the vagina to the urinary&#xD;
      tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 patients will be enrolled for this pilot study, half of whom will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive probiotics and the reminder of which will receive placebo [1:1 ratio; 50% chance&#xD;
      of being in each group (A and B)]. Treatment assignment will be double blinded and will last&#xD;
      6 months.&#xD;
