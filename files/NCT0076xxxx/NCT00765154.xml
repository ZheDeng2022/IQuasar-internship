      The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of switching from antiretroviral&#xD;
      combinations that includes efavirenz (Sustiva®), lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra®) or&#xD;
      atazanavir/ritonavir (Reyataz®/Norvir®) in individuals experiencing side effects from one of&#xD;
      these agents, and replacing these with a new HIV medication called Darunavir also given with&#xD;
      ritonavir (Norvir®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will primarily investigate the effect of change in medication on the subjects viral&#xD;
      load (the levels of the HIV virus in the blood), on immunological parameters (CD4 count) and&#xD;
      on other safety parameters (such as cholesterol) and also quality of life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has revolutionised the treatment&#xD;
      of HIV disease, with both patients and physicians enjoying the marked reductions in HIV&#xD;
      related morbidity and mortality. However, as long term therapeutic success has become a&#xD;
      realistic goal of treatment, there are increasing reports of toxicities associated with&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed since the advent of HAART the major reason for change in therapy has not been a lack&#xD;
      of efficacy associated with drug regimens but the toxicity associated with individual agents.&#xD;
      Although the potential adverse events associated with antiretrovirals are manifold there are&#xD;
      signature treatment-limiting toxicities associated with particular agents such as EFV and&#xD;
      CNS/neuropsychiatric adverse events, LPV/r and gastrointestinal toxicity and ATV/r and&#xD;
      jaundice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study performed at the Chelsea and Westminster hospital showed that 61% of regimen&#xD;
      switches were due to toxicity and the majority of these occurred after 12 weeks of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Darunavir is a recently licensed protease inhibitor which requires ritonavir&#xD;
      boosting.Currently DRV/r is licensed for use in treatment-experienced individuals. In&#xD;
      triple-class experienced patients ritonavir boosted darunavir has been associated with&#xD;
      greater viral load reductions when combined with optimized background (OB) than OB alone. A&#xD;
      study of PI experienced patients randomized to receive Kaletra or ritonavir boosted darunavir&#xD;
      with optimised background therapy showed significantly higher rates of virological&#xD;
      suppression in the DRV/r arm; rates of toxicities were similar overall but less diarrhoea in&#xD;
      the DRV/r than the Kaletra arm. Darunavir is licensed twice daily and has a high barrier to&#xD;
      the development of resistance. DRV/r dosed at 800/100mg once daily has been compared with&#xD;
      LPV/r in treatment-naïve subjects. DRV/r was non-inferior to LPV/r overall and performed&#xD;
      significantly better than LPV once daily and in subjects with a high baseline viral load.&#xD;
      DRV/r and LPV/r have also been compared head to head in 'early'treatment-experienced patients&#xD;
      (failing first or second line therapy but LPV-naive). Overall DRV/r exhibited superiority to&#xD;
      LPV/r with 77% and 67% achieving viral suppression to less than 50 copies/ml by&#xD;
      intent-to-treat analysis respectively (95% confidence interval for the difference 2-17%; p&#xD;
      &lt;0.0001). Animal studies have shown a low risk of teratogenesis associated with DRV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate whether substitution of NNRTI/PI with ritonavir boosted&#xD;
      darunavir leads to resolution of toxicity associated with these drugs, continued virological&#xD;
      suppression and immunological reconstitution and whether this is associated with an&#xD;
      improvement in quality of life.&#xD;
