    <textblock>
      Patients will convert from current opioid to Oxymorphone ER and undergo titration. During the&#xD;
      Titration Period, subjects will receive daily oxymorphone Extended Release tablets(s) every&#xD;
      12 hours. Dosing adjustments will be based on the review of the subject's pain scores.&#xD;
      Oxymorphone IR 5 mg will be provided to be used as supplemental &quot;breakthrough&quot; pain&#xD;
      medication (as needed). Titration Period will end when the fixed dose of study medication is&#xD;
      tolerated and the subject achieves adequate analgesia. Subjects will then proceed to the&#xD;
      open-label 3-month maintenance period on the fixed dose of study medication established&#xD;
      during the Titration Period.&#xD;
