      Childhood cancer predisposes to health risks that may not become apparent until many years&#xD;
      after completion of therapy. The SJLIFE protocol is designed to establish a lifetime cohort&#xD;
      of childhood cancer survivors treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital to facilitate&#xD;
      evaluation of health outcomes in aging adults surviving pediatric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study focuses on the following Primary and secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish a lifetime cohort of childhood cancer survivors treated at St. Jude&#xD;
           Children's Research Hospital to facilitate evaluation of health outcomes in aging&#xD;
           children and adults surviving pediatric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the prevalence, cumulative incidence, and latency of selected late treatment&#xD;
           complications following predisposing therapeutic exposures in children and adults&#xD;
           surviving pediatric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify treatment, genetic, demographic, and psychosocial / behavioral related&#xD;
           predictors of adverse health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop risk profiles for adverse health outcomes across the age spectrum to guide&#xD;
           development of clinical screening guidelines and risk-reducing interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify factors that may be protective against the development of specific late&#xD;
           treatment complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To generate data for a series of future hypothesis-driven trials&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To serve as a source for the collection of samples from child and adult volunteers for&#xD;
           future SJLIFE research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect health outcomes data on a community control population for comparison&#xD;
           purposes.&#xD;

      SJLIFE will be implemented in progressive stages with specific objectives to permit knowledge&#xD;
      gained in each phase to inform content/format/study design of subsequent stages. The planned&#xD;
      stages of the study include 1) Pre-Recruitment Study, 2) Barriers to Participation Survey, 3)&#xD;
      Pilot Study of Recruitment Strategies, 4) Pilot Studies of High-Risk Survivor Cohorts, 5)&#xD;
      Cross-Sectional Study of 10-year survivors, and 6) Prospective Lifetime Cohort Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage I entailed telephone interviews with a random sampling of potentially eligible&#xD;
      survivors to obtain subjective feedback regarding barriers and facilitators to SJLIFE&#xD;
      recruitment and participation. The random sample included thirty alumnus survivors&#xD;
      representing a broad representation of race, gender, attained age, years from diagnosis and&#xD;
      primary diagnostic groups. The interview content comprised assessment of interest,&#xD;
      decision-making factors, and barriers to participation, current&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage 2, the Barriers to Participation Survey will be distributed to a random sampling of&#xD;
      500 patients representative of the potentially eligible cohort by age, race, sex, geographic&#xD;
      distribution, primary diagnosis and time from diagnosis; 200 patients will be randomly&#xD;
      selected up front to receive follow-up communication by telephone if they fail to return&#xD;
      completed surveys. Information obtained from responses to the questionnaire will inform a&#xD;
      subsequent randomized recruitment trial and provide insight regarding retention procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage 3, a pilot study will be undertaken to assess feasibility and potential pitfalls in&#xD;
      recruitment for the Lifetime Cohort. Introductory letters will be sent to 300 alumni&#xD;
      survivors, with a broad representation across targeted diagnostic groups, to invite their&#xD;
      participation in the Lifetime Cohort. Recruitment approaches will be informed by the findings&#xD;
      of the Barriers to Participation Survey. Parameters that will be assessed related to&#xD;
      feasibility include 1) accuracy of contact information in hospital system (need for tracing&#xD;
      of potentially eligible research participants); 2) number of eligible participants actively&#xD;
      or passively declining study participation; and 3) reasons for declining participation. The&#xD;
      pilot study will provide insight regarding the need for implementing procedures to track&#xD;
      potential study participants who are &quot;lost to follow-up&quot; or incentives to recruit and retain&#xD;
      study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage 4, a pilot study will be undertaken in groups of survivors identified by SJLIFE&#xD;
      investigators to be at high risk for cancer-related morbidity based on specific demographic,&#xD;
      diagnostic, therapeutic, or genetic/familiar factors. In addition to utilizing data collected&#xD;
      from the risk-based evaluations performed in the Cross-Sectional study these individuals will&#xD;
      undergo more extensive assessment beyond the screening recommendations outlined in the COG&#xD;
      Guidelines to determine the frequency and more thoroughly characterize the extent specific&#xD;
      treatment complications, as well as define the need for further study. Knowledge gained in&#xD;
      this pilot study will provide important preliminary results that will be used to develop&#xD;
      proposals for extramural funding for further study of the identified vulnerable populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage 5, a cross-sectional study of the cohort of 10 or more year alumnus survivors will&#xD;
      be undertaken using a risk-based assessment as recommended by the COG Guidelines. The first&#xD;
      year of the study will target accrual of survivors with a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic&#xD;
      leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and acute myeloid leukemia who are 30 years or older. The second&#xD;
      year will target enrollment of survivors of central nervous system tumors, Wilms' tumor and&#xD;
      other bone/soft tissue sarcomas. The third year will target accrual of the remaining&#xD;
      diagnostic subtypes. The prevalence of late treatment complications detected by risk-based&#xD;
      screening will provide important information regarding the appropriateness of the COG&#xD;
      Guidelines recommendations in at risk survivor populations after specific therapeutic&#xD;
      exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage 6, information gained from the evaluations of 10-year survivors enrolled in the&#xD;
      cohort provided compelling support for the potential benefits and knowledge to be gained by&#xD;
      prospective and systematic evaluations of all cohort members. In addition, evaluation of&#xD;
      participants earlier in survivorship (i.e., before 10 years from diagnosis) was perceived to&#xD;
      enhance opportunities to characterize the pathophysiology of emerging late onset&#xD;
      treatment-related toxicities. Therefore, the cohort will be expanded by changing the&#xD;
      eligibility from +10 years of survival and +18 years of age to 5+ years from cancer diagnosis&#xD;
      regardless of age. As part of the expansion of the SJLIFE study, participants will now&#xD;
      undergo systematic organ function evaluations (e.g., echocardiography, pulmonary function&#xD;
      testing, audiological testing, ophthalmologic evaluation, bone mineral density testing). In&#xD;
      addition, all participants will undergo a comprehensive psychosocial assessment by a licensed&#xD;
      social worker and receive, as needed, assistance with referrals to community providers and&#xD;
      resources for ongoing care. In general, most survivors will have evaluations scheduled to&#xD;
      occur within a 4 to 5 year interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several activities are planned to optimize communication with participating survivors about&#xD;
      research activities involving the Lifetime Cohort. A newsletter will be distributed on a&#xD;
      semi-annual basis for the purpose of 1) maintaining contact through periodic mailings (which&#xD;
      include an address correction request from the post-office that can identify individuals who&#xD;
      have moved from their last known address and may require additional tracing to re-establish&#xD;
      contact); 2) providing an update on the status of the project; and 3) maintaining and&#xD;
      enhancing the relationship with participants and 4) educating survivors about selected topics&#xD;
      of health-related importance. In addition, a website will be developed that will serve as a&#xD;
      resource that updates the progress of Lifetime Cohort activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults who are non-first degree relatives or friends of St. Jude patients or former St. Jude&#xD;
      patients will be invited to participate as a control in this study during the time of the&#xD;
      child's St. Jude clinic visit. Employees who request to be in the study may volunteer if they&#xD;
      are not a SJLIFE study team member or not supervised by a SJLIFE study team member.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of SJLIFE initiative a group of study subjects who are not survivors of childhood&#xD;
      cancer (community controls) will be recruited. These controls will serve as a comparative&#xD;
      group to the aging survivors in SJLIFE cohort for assessing health-related, psychosocial, and&#xD;
      quality of life outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control enrollment to this protocol is expected to average 200-300 participants in the first&#xD;
      year; with an estimated targeted accrual of 1200.&#xD;
