      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, predictability and safety of the&#xD;
      Advanced CustomVue™ iLASIK procedure (WaveScan WaveFront® System, STAR S4 IR™ Excimer Laser&#xD;
      System and IntraLase™ FS System).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery has been performed worldwide since 1990. More&#xD;
      recently, customized corneal ablation utilizing wavefront-sensing technology to determine the&#xD;
      optical aberration of a patient's cornea has optimized LASIK surgery results. Prior to the&#xD;
      introduction of wavefront-guided laser vision correction, the variables used for correcting&#xD;
      refractive errors were limited to sphere and cylinder. With the introduction of wavefront&#xD;
      laser vision correction surgeons are now able to provide individualized laser-induced corneal&#xD;
      tissue resection based not only on sphere and cylinder measurements, but also on an attempt&#xD;
      to treat 3rd through 6th higher-order aberrations (HOAs) utilizing Zernike polynomial&#xD;
      wavefront reconstructions and Fourier transformation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. (AMO) has recently introduced the Advanced CustomVue™ iLASIK&#xD;
      procedure which utilizes the WaveScan WaveFront® System, a STAR S4 IR™ Excimer Laser System&#xD;
      and IntraLase™ FS System technology to provide the broadest range of wavefront-guided FDA&#xD;
      approved usages and an unprecedented level of precision and accuracy for patients undergoing&#xD;
      LASIK surgery. The procedure leverages Iris Registration, Fourier algorithms, VSS™ and VRR™&#xD;
      technologies and 3D ActiveTrak™ to ensure precise corneal ablation.1, 2&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:Subjects MUST fulfill the following conditions to qualify for enrollment&#xD;
        into the trial Both eyes must have a manifest refractive error from -0.50 D to -6.00 D, a&#xD;
        cylinder component up to -3.00 D, and a maximum manifest spherical equivalent of -6.00 D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        21 years of age or older at the time of the pre-operative examination. Both eyes must have&#xD;
        a BSCVA of 20/20 or better; Both eyes must have a minimum pupil size of at least 6.0mm in&#xD;
        dim illumination on wavescan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Both eyes must demonstrate refractive stability confirmed by clinical records or previous&#xD;
        glasses. Refractive stability shall be documented by a change of less than or equal to 0.50&#xD;
        diopter (sphere and cylinder) at an exam at least 12 months prior to the baseline&#xD;
        examination. The astigmatic axis must also be within 15 degrees for eyes with cylinder&#xD;
        greater than 0.50 D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits and other study procedures.&#xD;

        including but not limited to: antimetabolites, isotretinoin (Accutane®) within 6 months of&#xD;
        treatment, and amiodarone hydrochloride (Cordarone®) within 12 months of treatment. Also,&#xD;
        the use of topical or systemic corticosteroids, whether chronic or acute Subjects with a&#xD;

        extraction), active ophthalmic disease or abnormality (including, but not limited to,&#xD;
