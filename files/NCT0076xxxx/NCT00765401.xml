      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal autosomal recessive disease among Caucasians.&#xD;
      While the pulmonary disease in CF receives most of the attention, gastrointestinal diseases&#xD;
      occur in &gt;95% of CF individuals and can contribute to significant morbidity, mortality and a&#xD;
      decreased quality of life. The abdominal pain in CF is usual chronic in nature, and the&#xD;
      etiology is not usually found, despite medical testing for standard causes of abdominal pain.&#xD;
      Helicobacter pylori (Hp) is increasingly being recognized as the etiology of peptic ulcer&#xD;
      disease and other upper and lower gastrointestinal tract diseases.1 The role that Hp plays in&#xD;
      CF abdominal pain has not been elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our long-term goal is to understand relationship between chronic HP infection and abdominal&#xD;
      pain in pediatric CF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objective of this proposal is to utilize current state-of-the-art testing for HP&#xD;
      to determine the prevalence of Hp in our CF patients age 5 and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis is that Cystic fibrosis subjects with significant abdominal pain will&#xD;
      have an increased incidence of Helicobacter pylori as determined by the urea breath test and&#xD;
      stool antigen test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for the proposed research is that once we elucidate a causal relationship&#xD;
      between CF patients with abdominal pain and Hp, we can begin treatment of this infection to&#xD;
      improve quality of life.&#xD;

      Abdominal pain and Cystic Fibrosis Cystic fibrosis is the most common lethal autosomal&#xD;
      recessive disease among Caucasians. CF is caused by a single gene mutation on chromosome 7,&#xD;
      which encodes for a membrane protein, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator&#xD;
      (CFTR). CFTR channel dysfunction results in progressive pulmonary disease, which is the&#xD;
      primary cause of the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Therapies directed&#xD;
      to slow the progression of the lung disease have increased the USA median survival to 32.2&#xD;
      years.2 Abdominal complaints are very common among CF patients. Littlewood et al. reported&#xD;
      that 31% of children had regular complaints of abdominal pain.3 Ravilly et al. performed a&#xD;
      retrospective chart review on CF patients referred for treatment to the pain service and&#xD;
      those that expired.4 They determined that pain was very common in CF and that 19% of the&#xD;
      population had chronic complaints of abdominal pain, which was third behind chest pain and&#xD;
      headaches.4 This study likely underestimated the prevalence of abdominal pain in CF, as it&#xD;
      was evaluating an end stage lung disease group of patients that were frequently not eating&#xD;
      and had severe pain from other disease processes (i.e. headaches from hypercarbia and/or&#xD;
      hypoxia, and chest pain from rib fractures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Known causes of CF related abdominal pain are: 1) malabsorption due to pancreatic&#xD;
      steatorrhea, 2) gastroesophageal reflux, 3) esophagitis, 4) gastritis, 5) peptic ulcer&#xD;
      disease, 6) pancreatitis, 7) Crohn's disease, 8) distal intestinal obstructive syndrome&#xD;
      (DIOS), 9) biliary duct disease including cholocystitis and cholangitis, 10) intussception,&#xD;
      11) acute or chronic gastrointestinal infection, 12) acute appendicitis, and 13)&#xD;
      constipation. Given this long list of potential causes, CF patients frequently undergo&#xD;
      intensive examinations to determine the etiology of the abdominal pain.4 The testing&#xD;
      unfortunately does not always reveal the etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Helicobacter pylori World-wide, Helicobacter pylori (Hp) is increasingly being recognized as&#xD;
      the etiology of peptic ulcer disease and other upper and lower gastrointestinal tract&#xD;
      diseases.1 With the CF population, The role that Hp plays in abdominal pain has not been&#xD;
      elucidated. Two studies have attempted to look at the epidemiology of Hp in CF; however, the&#xD;
      approach utilized in those studies was determined to be inadequate. Johansen et al. and&#xD;
      Israel et al. both attempted to utilize Hp serology to determine the prevalence in a CF&#xD;
      population and determined that there was significant cross-reactivity between Hp and&#xD;
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa antigens.10, 11. They concluded that different modes of testing are&#xD;
      required if Hp is being evaluated in the CF population. To our knowledge, there have been no&#xD;
      further evaluations of Hp in CF using the newer diagnostic tests available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing for Helicobacter pylori Since the isolation of spiral urease-producing Helicobacter&#xD;
      pylori bacteria (H. pylori) in 1983 by Drs. Marshall and Warren5, a significant body of&#xD;
      evidence has accumulated indicating that the bacteria is an important pathogen in upper GI&#xD;
      tract of humans 6,7. The causal relation ship between H.pylori and chronic active gastritis,&#xD;
      duodenal ulcer, and gastric ulcer is well documented 8, 9. Methods available for detecting&#xD;
      current infection of human stomach by Hp are generally divided into two general types:&#xD;
      Invasive and Non-invasive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invasive methods include esophageogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with collection of gastric&#xD;
      biopsies. These biopsies are then examined by one or more detection methods: histological&#xD;
      examination of stained tissue, microbiological culture of the organism, or direct detection&#xD;
      of urease activity in the tissue (for example, the CLO test). Biopsy based methods are&#xD;
      expensive, entail greater patient risk and discomfort than non-invasive tests, and may give&#xD;
      false negative results due to sampling errors when colonization of the gastric mucosa is&#xD;
      patchy 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non-invasive tests include several serological tests that detect serum antibodies to Hp.&#xD;
      A positive result with these tests can not distinguish between current infection and past&#xD;
      exposure to HP and, therefore, is not a conclusive indicator of current gastrointestinal&#xD;
      colonization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The urea breath test is based on the principal that the urease enzyme is not present in human&#xD;
      tissue. Urease presence is indicative of a urease producing organism in the stomach, which is&#xD;
      most likely HP. The test has a sensitivity and specificity of 90% and a negative predictive&#xD;
      value greater that 95% and a positive predictive value of 90%.12 A third non-invasive test is&#xD;
      the Hp stool antigen test also has a sensitivity and specificity of about 90%, and high&#xD;
      positive and negative predictive values (&gt;95%).13 Major confounding issues with HP testing&#xD;
      are systemic antibiotic exposure, which can lead to false negative tests and partial&#xD;
      treatment.14 This is especially problematic in the CF population, who are frequently on&#xD;
      systemic antibiotics for chronic suppurative bronchitis. Thus, as part of the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, we will only include subjects who have been off antibiotics for at least 14 days&#xD;
      prior to enrollment. The CF patients will be allowed to continue nebulized antibiotics and&#xD;
      prophylactic dose of Azythromycin, and analysis will be performed to determine if this&#xD;
      results in false negatives by comparing the results to the stool antigen test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical measures of abdominal pain This study is also designed to determine whether the&#xD;
      prevalence of Hp is related to a decreased quality of life, which if documented suggests a&#xD;
      pathological role of Hp in CF. Our objective is to use two validated quality of life&#xD;
      instruments in this study: The PedsQL (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory) and the&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS).15 The PedsQL is a modular instrument for&#xD;
      measuring health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children and adolescents ages 2 to 18.&#xD;
      The PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales are multidimensional child self-report and parent&#xD;
      proxy-report scales developed as the generic core measure to be integrated with the PedsQL&#xD;
      Disease-Specific Modules. The PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales consist of 23 items applicable&#xD;
      for healthy school and community populations, as well as pediatric populations with acute and&#xD;
      chronic health conditions. The GSRS questionnaire involves 15 items using the Likert scale&#xD;
      focusing on gastroesophageal reflux, abdominal pain, constipation, indigestion and diarrhea.&#xD;
      It uses a scale from1 to 4.&#xD;
