      Rheumatoid arthritis affects approximately 1% of the adult population. It is a chronic,&#xD;
      progressive disease characterized by synovial inflammation. The resulting inflammation leads&#xD;
      to destruction of the synovium and surrounding joint tissues, which can result in cartilage&#xD;
      destruction, bone erosion and resultant loss of joint function. It is an autoimmune disorder&#xD;
      of unknown etiology and typically affects the joints of the hand, wrist, knee, and foot,&#xD;
      usually in a bilateral pattern. Symptoms experienced early in the disease process include&#xD;
      pain, swelling, and tenderness of affected joints. As the disease progresses, many patients&#xD;
      experience joint stiffness, weakness, fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss, and ultimately&#xD;
      tissue damage and joint destruction. The severity of symptoms varies widely, ranging from&#xD;
      annoyance to debilitation. Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease that primarily afflicts adults,&#xD;
      with women being affected more often than men. Because rheumatoid arthritis is both chronic&#xD;
      and destructive, it requires early diagnosis and aggressive treatment to minimize the&#xD;
      morbidity associated with its progression, which can lead to deterioration in physical&#xD;
      function and psychological and social well-being. The objectives of rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
      therapy are to reduce inflammation and to decrease the progression of articular damage.&#xD;
      Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs are used to accomplish these objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the past several years, rheumatologists have become increasingly aggressive in&#xD;
      initiating treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs early in the course of&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis in an attempt to prevent joint destruction. The gold standard of therapy&#xD;
      has been methotrexate, which has been shown to be efficacious and safe, and appears to remain&#xD;
      effective, even after many years of treatment. However, not all patients respond to&#xD;
      methotrexate, and even patients who do respond most frequently have only a partial response&#xD;
      (reduced signs and symptoms, but still active disease). As a result, many patients are&#xD;
      treated with 2 or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, biologics (biotechnology drugs) have been introduced in the armamentarium&#xD;
      against rheumatoid arthritis, based on an improved understanding of the role of the&#xD;
      proinflammatory mediators, TNF-alpha, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6 in rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis. Etanercept (Enbrel®), a soluble TNF-alpha type II receptor-human immunoglobulin&#xD;
      fusion protein administered subcutaneously twice a week, infliximab (Remicade®), a chimeric&#xD;
      human mouse monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha, administered intravenously every 4 to 8&#xD;
      weeks along with weekly methotrexate, and adalimumab (Humira®), a human-derived recombinant&#xD;
      immunoglobulin monoclonal antibody, administered subcutaneously every other week, are&#xD;
      currently available for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. They have demonstrated rapid and&#xD;
      substantial improvement in rheumatoid arthritis, presumably by preventing the actions of&#xD;
      TNF-alpha in the joint, thereby reducing the inflammatory and destructive consequences of&#xD;
      TNF-alpha. Etanercept and infliximab have been granted Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      approved indications for reducing signs and symptoms, inhibiting the progression of&#xD;
      structural damage and improving physical function of patients with moderately to severely&#xD;
      active rheumatoid arthritis. Adalimumab has been granted FDA approved indications for&#xD;
      reducing signs and symptoms and inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and Anakinra&#xD;
      (Kineret®), an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist administered subcutaneously daily, received&#xD;
      FDA approval for reducing signs and symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAK-783 is being developed as an orally administered compound for the treatment of rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis. Total participation time for this study is 16 to 40 weeks. All subjects will&#xD;
      remain on a stable dose of methotrexate throughout the trial.&#xD;
