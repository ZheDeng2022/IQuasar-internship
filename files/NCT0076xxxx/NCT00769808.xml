  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Eyes With Manifest Subjective Refraction (MRSE) Within ± 1.00 Diopter (D) and 0.50 D of Emmetropia</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Manifest refractions (eyeglass prescriptions) have three components: sphere, cylinder, and axis. Sphere and cylinder are both expressed in diopters, which is a continuous measure of the focusing power needed to make the image sharp on the retina. Manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) is equal to sphere + ½ x cylinder. It is expressed in diopters (D).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Preservation of Manifest Best Corrected High Contrast Distance Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change in best-corrected high contrast distance visual acuity. Corrected means spectacle corrected. Visual acuity (VA) was reported as letters read correctly, and the letters read were converted to logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) acuity. The participant read rows of letters on a standard LogMAR chart until the participant misses 3 letters on a row with 5 letters. The total number of correct letters were recorded. A decrease in the number of correct letters indicates a decrease in visual acuity. Acuity was averaged across visits.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Eyes With &gt; 2.00 Diopter of Induced Postoperative Refractive Cylinder</measure>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Eyes That Had High Contrast Best Spectacle Corrected Visual Acuity (HCBSCVA) of 20/20 or Better at Baseline Had a Visual Outcome Worse Than 20/40 at 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Corrected means spectacle corrected. Visual acuity (VA) was reported as letters read correctly, and the letters read were converted to logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) acuity. The participant read rows of letters on a standard LogMAR chart until the participant misses 3 letters on a row with 5 letters. The total number of correct letters were recorded. A decrease in the number of correct letters indicates a decrease in visual acuity. Acuity was averaged across visits.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage Change From Baseline in Higher Order Aberrations.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The aberrations in the eye's optical system were measured over the entire pupil by the Bausch &amp; Lomb Zywave II WaveFront Aberrometer, a Hartmann-Shack type device. The pupil should have been at least 6 mm in diameter using 2.5% phenylephrine as a dilating agent to maximize the pupil diameter and hence the amount of wavefront information collected by the Zywave II. The wavefront data was then fitted with Zernike polynomials representing the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order Zernike terms. These terms represent the wavefront aberration of the eye.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who were of legal age (at least 18) and had full legal capacity to volunteer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing to have both eyes treated with the laser.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have up to -12.00D of absolute spherical myopia (not spherical&#xD;
             equivalent) with up to -6.00D of refractive astigmatism, with a spherical equivalent&#xD;
             up to -15.00D as measured by manifest subjective refraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who had less than 0.75 D of difference in the preoperative manifest spherical&#xD;
             equivalent and cycloplegic spherical equivalent subjective refractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        (Manifest subjective refractions adjusted for optical infinity were used.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  High contrast, manifest best spectacle-corrected distance logMAR visual acuity&#xD;
             correctable to at least 0.3 in both eyes, and must not differ between eyes by more&#xD;
             than 1 line (5 letters).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contact lens wearers must have 2 Orbscan measurements and 2 manifest subjective&#xD;
             refractions taken preoperatively at least 1 week apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contact lens wearers must have gas permeable lenses discontinued for at least 3 weeks&#xD;
             and soft lenses discontinued for at least 2 weeks prior to the preoperative&#xD;
             evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion&#xD;

             the outcomes of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with uncontrolled glaucoma or glaucoma who were under treatment in the study&#xD;
             eye or with ocular hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who demonstrated evidence of retinal vascular disease.&#xD;

             as deemed necessary by the study Investigator.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects who were taking systemic medications likely to affect wound healing such as&#xD;
             corticosteroids or anti-metabolites or any other medications that may increase the&#xD;
             risk to the subject or confound the outcomes of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;

             planned operative parameters for the LASIK procedure could have resulted in less than&#xD;
             250 microns of remaining posterior corneal thickness below the flap postoperatively.&#xD;

Visual acuity (VA) was reported as letters read correctly, and the letters read were converted to logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) acuity. The participant read rows of letters on a standard LogMAR chart until the participant misses 3 letters on a row with 5 letters. The total number of correct letters were recorded. A decrease in the number of correct letters indicates a decrease in visual acuity. Acuity was averaged across visits.</description>

        <description>The aberrations in the eye's optical system were measured over the entire pupil by the Bausch &amp; Lomb Zywave II WaveFront Aberrometer, a Hartmann-Shack type device. The pupil should have been at least 6 mm in diameter using 2.5% phenylephrine as a dilating agent to maximize the pupil diameter and hence the amount of wavefront information collected by the Zywave II. The wavefront data was then fitted with Zernike polynomials representing the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order Zernike terms. These terms represent the wavefront aberration of the eye.</description>
