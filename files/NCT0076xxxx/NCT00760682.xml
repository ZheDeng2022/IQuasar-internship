    <textblock>
      There is currently not sufficient evidence that hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) benefits the surgical&#xD;
      removal of necrotic bone in osteoradionecrosis patients. This study aims at testing the&#xD;
      hypothesis that HBO does improve healing after surgical removal of necrotic bone in&#xD;
      irradiated previous head and neck cancer patients compared to not receiving HBO.&#xD;

      1. Study objective&#xD;
&#xD;
           The objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) on&#xD;
           mandibular osteoradionecrosis as an adjunctive to surgical treatment in patients&#xD;
           previously irradiated for head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis: Osteoradionecrosis lesions heal more frequently when administering HBO as an&#xD;
           adjunct to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Introduction and rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each year, 300 danish patients are diagnosed with oral cancer. The majority of these&#xD;
           cancers are planocellular carcinomas. The established treatments are surgery and&#xD;
           radiation therapy. Depending on multiple factors such as total radiation dose,&#xD;
           fractionation, localization and use of brachytherapy, mandibular osteradionecrosis&#xD;
           occurs in 5-15% of previously head and neck irradiated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Osteradionecrosis is defined by National Cancer Institute (NCI) as radiation-induced&#xD;
           cell death in components of bone (e.g., the marrow fat and mineralized tissue). It&#xD;
           represents the final common pathway of several disease entities, which result in&#xD;
           impaired blood supply to the bone tissue causing bone necrosis. Often,&#xD;
           osteoradionecrosis is clinically expressed in relation to surgery or a similar tissue&#xD;
           trauma, but may also arise spontaneously several years after radiation treatment. Oral&#xD;
           rehabilitation is difficult in these patients as denture wear is painful. Furthermore,&#xD;
           radiation-induced hyposalivation complicates retention of dentures, which are normally&#xD;
           retained by a thin saliva film. As denture wear appears difficult, insertion of implants&#xD;
           seems obvious in these patients. However, the survival rate of dental implants are&#xD;
           reduced when inserted in irradiated bone. Thus, osteoradionecrosis patients has great&#xD;
           requirements regarding pain therapy as well as oral functional and social&#xD;
           rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           HBO is currently offered to osteoradionecrosis patients as a standard treatment in&#xD;
           combination with surgical removal of the necrotic bone (sequestrectomy). 30 preoperative&#xD;
           and 10 postoperative treatment sessions are given daily (on weekdays) during eight&#xD;
           weeks. The duration of each treatment session is 90 minutes and involves inhalation of&#xD;
           100% oxygen during decompression to 15 meters (2.5 ATA). The decompression leads to an&#xD;
           increased oxygen tension in the tissues. HBO stimulates monocyte and fibroblast&#xD;
           proliferation as well as collagen synthesis in irradiated tissue. Also, angiogenesis is&#xD;
           stimulated, resulting in an increased vascularity. Moreover, recent research shows that&#xD;
           HBO induces bone marrow derived progenitor cells in previously irradiated humans and&#xD;
           animals.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At this point, there is not sufficient scientific evidence for a clinical effect of HBO&#xD;
           on osteoradionecrosis. The majority of relevant studies are casuistic reports and&#xD;
           case-control studies with few participants. Few randomized clinical trials (RCT) have&#xD;
           been conducted. Two of these studies document an effect of HBO, but one of the studies&#xD;
           only include twelve participants, which is not associated with sufficient power. The&#xD;
           other study document a prophylactic effect of HBO on osteoradionecrosis, and does&#xD;
           therefore not conclude on any treatment effects. The authors of the third study&#xD;
           conclude, that there is no effect of HBO treatment. However, in this study, the protocol&#xD;
           was closed before full inclusion (68 vs. 222), and therefore, the power may not be&#xD;
           sufficient. Furthermore, the study protocol lacks accordance with the standard HBO&#xD;
           protocol and sufficient description of the surgical interventions. Moreover, there is an&#xD;
           unrealistically high recovery rate in the control group with following risk of drawing&#xD;
           the wrong conclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A Cochrane review states that there is not sufficient amounts of data to perform a&#xD;
           meta-analysis. Thus, more randomized clinical studies are needed in order to document&#xD;
           whether there is an effect of HBO on osteoradionecrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1. Primary endpoint The primary endpoint recovery from osteoradionecrosis as defined&#xD;
           by the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria of Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 3.0. Recovery is defined&#xD;
           as no signs of osteoradionecrosis according to these criteria or grade 1 on this scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Grade 1: Asymptomatic, radiographic findings only. Grade 2: Symptomatic and interfering&#xD;
           with function, but not interfering with ADL (Activities of Daily Living , , , ). Minimal&#xD;
           bone removal indicated i.e. minor sequestrectomy)..&#xD;
&#xD;
           Grade 3: Symptomatic, interfering with ADL. Operative intervention or hyperbaric oxygen&#xD;
           indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Grade 4: Disabling Grade 5: Death&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2. Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Life quality (EORTC schemes QLQ-C30, QLQ-H&amp;N35)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Body Mass Index&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pain intensity (VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Analgetics consumption&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Antibiotics consumption&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Trismus&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Xerostomia&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Dysphagia&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Dental status&#xD;
&#xD;
           CTCAE v. 3.0 is based on clinical as well as ADL related criteria. The primary endpoint&#xD;
           value is obtained by filling out 21-05 and 21-06. The ORN stadium is the highest&#xD;
           obtained score. In patients not wearing dentures, the denture-related question can be&#xD;
           omitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Investigational plan&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1. Inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients eligible for the study will be asked for informed consent by the protocol&#xD;
           responsible person. If the patient does not wish to participate in the study, standard&#xD;
           treatment will be given (HBO and surgery). Verbal and written information about the&#xD;
           study will be given during the preliminary investigation. Randomization will occur&#xD;
           approximately one week prior to participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1. Study plan&#xD;
&#xD;
           After confirmation of study eligibility, the participant is randomized to either group I&#xD;
           (HBO and surgery) or group II (surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Drug registration is performed at home until 3 months postsurgically. After this point,&#xD;
           information is obtained from a central register.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study is not blinded, as we consider it unrealistic to blind the investigator&#xD;
           because of risk of 1) the participant unintentionally mentions details from the HBO&#xD;
           treatment or that the investigator runs into the patient at the hyperbaric facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The trials is ended when 114 participants are included. Participants withdrawn from the&#xD;
           study will be replaced until 114 have completed participation. A drop-out rate of 20-30%&#xD;
           is considered likely, which means that in total, 150 potential participants will be&#xD;
           asked to participate in order to obtain 114 observations. The drop-out The drop-out rate&#xD;
           will be evaluated throughout the study. All patients eligible for the study will be&#xD;
           asked for informed consent by the protocol responsible person. If the patient does not&#xD;
           wish to participate in the study, standard treatment will be given (HBO and surgery).&#xD;
           Verbal and written information about the study will be given during the preliminary&#xD;
           investigation. Randomization will occur approximately one week prior to participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Prior to participation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to inclusion, the participants is examined by a hyperbaric physician and a head and&#xD;
      neck surgeon to ensure that the following criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Osteoradionecrosis grade 2, 3 or 4 (CTCAE v 3.0.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Localization: Mandibula&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Age &gt; 18 No contraindications for hyperbaric oxygen treatment, e.g. emphysema,&#xD;
           uncontrolled asthma, epilepsy, previous optic neuritis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria solely applies for HBO treatment. Should any criteria arise after the HBO&#xD;
      treatment, it is unnecessary to withdraw the patient from participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Malignancy/residual cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Previous HBO treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pregnancy or lactation (fertile female participants are required to use safe&#xD;
           anticonception)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Unmanageable claustrophobia&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Undrained pneumothorax&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Uncontrollable hypertension or blood pressure &gt;220/110&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Explosion of titanium reconstruction device&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.2. Clinical evaluation prior to treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
           Examination at baseline is carried out using the existing HBO examination programme and&#xD;
           includes following anamnestic registrations:&#xD;
&#xD;
           § Epilepsy&#xD;
&#xD;
           § Lung disease&#xD;
&#xD;
           § Heart disease&#xD;
&#xD;
           § Diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Psychologic or psychiatric disorders (to evaluate the need for medication during&#xD;
                HBO)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Drug list&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Use of eyeglasses&#xD;
&#xD;
           Objective examination&#xD;
&#xD;
           § Ability to equalize the pressure in the ears and sinuses (otherwise drained)&#xD;
&#xD;
           § Heart and lung stetoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Weight&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pain assessment (VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.3. Inclusion, randomization and stratification. For all eligible patients with&#xD;
           informed consent, a DAHANCA 21-inclusion form, which is a checklist for inclusion- and&#xD;
           exclusion criteria is filled out and faxed to the DAHANCA office: Fax +45 86 19 71 09.&#xD;
           The fax is returned with randomization number and treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Included patients will be stratified according to&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Gender&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ORN stadium&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed closely during their treatment. The investigator will perform&#xD;
      the evaluations blinded. Since HBO treatment is time-consuming (8 weeks) and expensive (2000&#xD;
      DKK per session), it is not possible, nor ethically acceptable, to include a placebo group in&#xD;
      order to conduct the study blinded to the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be decompressed according to a standard profile used in the clinic. During&#xD;
      the first five minutes, the patient is decompressed to 14,5 +/- 0,5 m (2,45 +/- 0,05 ATA) and&#xD;
      stays here for the next 90 minutes. Decompression to the surface (0 m) will hereafter take&#xD;
      place during five minutes. The patient will breathe 100% oxygen during the full 100-minute&#xD;
      procedure inside a hood (Amron Systems, California, USA) or mask (Divex Hyperlite II (Divex&#xD;
      Industries, Aberdeen, Scotland). Each patient receives 30 preoperative treatment and 10&#xD;
      postoperative treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2. Surgical treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with ORN grade &gt;1 will be surgically treated according to standardized&#xD;
      guidelines. The interventions implies either&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Resection of necrotic bone (sequestrectomy) with preservation of mandibular continuity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Resection of necrotic bone (sequestrectomy) with loss of mandibular continuity. The&#xD;
           least mutilating intervention will be performed. Resection with loss of continuity will&#xD;
           only be performed in case of potential or stated fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3. Termination of participation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol treatment will be terminated in case:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient wish to terminate participation. New indication for surgery arises because of&#xD;
      osteoradionecrosis at another localization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other unintentional events occurs that may impede participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Clinical evaluation and follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.1. One week after sequestrectomy The first evaluation occurs one week after surgery in&#xD;
      order to evaluate wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2. One month after sequestrectomy (+/- two weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.3. Three months after sequestrectomy (+/- three weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.4. One year after sequestrectomy (+/- one month).&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.5. After relapse/progression In case of relapse or progression patients are treated&#xD;
      according to local guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.6 Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are followed once a year for at least 5 years after completion of participation.&#xD;
      Additionally, patients are instructed to contact the department in case of relapse.&#xD;
