    <textblock>
      Preterm newborns typically must be thermally regulated. In the United States, isolettes&#xD;
      (incubators) are used to help them maintain their temperature. Traditionally, the temperature&#xD;
      support (i.e. the temperature of the incubator) is decreased slowly according to NICU&#xD;
      protocol until the baby is able to maintain its temperature in an open crib, without regard&#xD;
      to the status of its feedings. This study will attempt to determine if there is a difference&#xD;
      in length of stay, weight gain, and calories needed to gain appropriate weight between a&#xD;
      group of newborns whose isolette temperatures are decreased in an aggressive strategy&#xD;
      (isolette temperatures are decreased based only on baby's body temperature), and a group of&#xD;
      newborns whose isolette temperatures are decreased in a conservative strategy (isolette&#xD;
      temperatures are decreased to a minimum temperature and then kept steady until their feeds&#xD;
      are at caloric goal and they are taking at least half of their feeds by mouth).&#xD;

      General Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three key milestones premature infants must meet prior to discharge from the NICU:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The ability to maintain their temperature in an open crib&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The ability to consume enough calories for adequate growth by oral feeds&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A demonstrated weight gain consuming these feeds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well understood that infants must increase their resting metabolic rate when weaned&#xD;
      from the isolette to an open crib (1, 6). Preterm neonates have less metabolic reserve (brown&#xD;
      fat) to allow them to mount an appropriate thermogenic response to cold stress (4). The&#xD;
      reserve they do have is often depleted at delivery, leaving them with little or no reserve&#xD;
      (4). When a neonate is challenged to maintain its body temperature, it must increase heat&#xD;
      production which may affect weight gain (3). Some institutions wean without regard to&#xD;
      neonate's weight or feeding status, while others only begin the weaning process at a&#xD;
      predetermined weight. Currently neonates are weaned from their isolettes based largely on the&#xD;
      traditions and experiences of clinicians, without regard to their feeding status. However,&#xD;
      there is currently very little evidence in the literature to inform practice on the ideal&#xD;
      conditions for weaning a neonate from their isolette. An extensive literature review has&#xD;
      revealed no published data regarding the relationship of feed status to success at isolette&#xD;
      weaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transfer to open crib is important; if the neonate is not able to maintain his/her&#xD;
      temperature, the length of stay could be lengthened and weight gain adversely affected (3).&#xD;
      Cold stress can also cause adverse clinical effects including lethargy, hypotonia, poor&#xD;
      feeding, abdominal distention, vomiting, pallor, tachypnea, and respiratory distress (2).&#xD;
      These adverse clinical effects may also lengthen cost and length of stay, as well as&#xD;
      adversely affect feeding. Furthermore, a return to the isolette can be quite stressful to&#xD;
      parents and family members (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 110 subjects will be recruited. The subjects for this study will be live born&#xD;
      preterm infants between 26 and 0/7 weeks gestation and 34 and 6/7 weeks gestation. Informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained from the parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonates will be randomly assigned to either the control group (with standard&#xD;
      thermoregulatory weaning protocol) vs. experimental group (with conservative thermoregulatory&#xD;
      weaning protocol). After an infant is enrolled in the study, an envelope indicating random&#xD;
      assignment to either the aggressive or conservative group will be drawn and the infant will&#xD;
      be assigned to the indicated study group. The envelopes will be provided by the statistician&#xD;
      and will be delivered in groups of 10 to ensure relatively equal numbers of babies in both&#xD;
      study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All infants will be advanced to goal caloric feeds of 120 Kcal/kg. Weight gain will be&#xD;
      measured biweekly, and if adequate weight gain (average 20 grams/kg/day) is not reached,&#xD;
      feeds will be advanced by 10 Kcal/kg/day biweekly until adequate weight gain is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All infants will be kept on skin control mode until they weigh 1500 grams. Babies on skin&#xD;
      control mode will be unclothed except for a diaper. Once infants reach 1500 grams, they will&#xD;
      be placed on air control mode. Babies on air control mode will be dressed in one&#xD;
      medium-weight sleeper with feet (or with socks if sleeper is footless), one hat, and no&#xD;
      blankets or other clothing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group: Aggressive Wean&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weaning Process:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If baby's temperature is greater than or equal to 36.7°C on 2 consecutive measurements 3&#xD;
           hours apart, the isolette set temperature will be lowered by 0.2°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If baby's temperature is less than 36.3°C on 1 measurement, the isolette set temperature&#xD;
           will be increased by 0.2°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the baby's temperature is stable at greater than 36.7°C for 3 consecutive&#xD;
           measurements 3 hours apart on an isolette set temp of 28.0°C, the baby will be&#xD;
           transferred to an open crib. At this time, the baby will be dressed in one medium-weight&#xD;
           sleeper with feet (or with socks if sleeper is footless), one hat, and a sleep sack. NO&#xD;
           heavy blankets (such as bath blankets) or extra blankets are to be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the baby's temperature is less than 36.3°C on 1 measurement, they will be transferred&#xD;
           back to the isolette and the weaning process will begin again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Group: Conservative Wean&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weaning Process:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If baby's temperature is greater than or equal to 37.2°C on 2 consecutive measurements 3&#xD;
           hours apart, the isolette set temperature will be lowered by 0.2°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If baby's temperature is less than 36.3°C on 1 measurement, the isolette set temperature&#xD;
           will be increased by 0.2°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the baby's temperature is stable at greater than 37.2°C for 3 consecutive&#xD;
           measurements 3 hours apart on an isolette set temp of 28.0°C, AND the baby is taking&#xD;
           full caloric need feeds (at least 120 Kcal/kg/day), AND the baby is taking half of its&#xD;
           feeds by mouth the baby will be transferred to an open crib. At this time, the baby will&#xD;
           be dressed in one medium-weight sleeper with feet (or with socks if sleeper is&#xD;
           footless), one hat, and a sleep sack. NO heavy blankets (such as bath blankets) or extra&#xD;
           blankets are to be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the baby's temperature is stable at greater than 37.2°C for 4 consecutive&#xD;
           measurements 3 hours apart on an isolette set temp of 28.0°C, or if the baby's&#xD;
           temperature is greater than 37.9°C on an isolette set temp of 28.0°C, the baby will be&#xD;
           transferred to an open crib regardless of feeding status. At this time, the baby will be&#xD;
           dressed in one medium-weight sleeper with feet (or with socks if sleeper is footless),&#xD;
           one hat, and a sleep sack. NO heavy blankets (such as bath blankets) or extra blankets&#xD;
           are to be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the baby's temperature is less than 36.3 degrees Celsius on 1 measurement, they will&#xD;
           be transferred back to the isolette and the weaning process will begin again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Significance and Future Research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide data regarding the weaning of thermoregulatory support in preterm&#xD;
      infants, and could have significant economic impact for the university if there is a&#xD;
      significant difference in length of stay between the study groups. Future research will focus&#xD;
      on long-term effects on outcomes such as nutritional status in infancy and BMI in childhood&#xD;
      if neonates do require greater caloric intake if they are weaned from thermoregulatory&#xD;
      support faster.&#xD;
