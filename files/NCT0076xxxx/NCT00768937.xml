      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as the third most common cause of cancer-related death has a&#xD;
      very poor prognosis. Aim of this open label single arm non randomized pilot trial is the&#xD;
      evaluation of the efficacy and safety of sorafenib in combination with TACE in patients with&#xD;
      unresectable HCC. Efficacy ad safety will be compared with a historical TACE-only group of a&#xD;
      placebo controlled TACE-trial.&#xD;

      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as the third most common cause of cancer-related death has a&#xD;
      very poor prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Efficacy of Sorafenib in combination with TACE TACE is an established therapy for&#xD;
      patients with unresectable HCC and has been shown to significantly improve survival in these&#xD;
      patients compared to no treatment. Quite often after cutting off the blood supply through the&#xD;
      hepatic artery, the tumor induces active angiogenesis to promote collateral blood vessel&#xD;
      growth from liver capsule arteries or collaterals from the gastroduodenal artery leading to&#xD;
      tumor recovery and proliferation. Inhibition of this neoangiogenetic and proliferation&#xD;
      activity after TACE by the multikinase inhibitor Sorafenib, already approved for HCC, could&#xD;
      lead to significantly improvement in tumor control and survival in patients with advanced&#xD;
      stage HCC.Safety will be compared with a historical TACE-only group of a placebo controlled&#xD;
      TACE-trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Safety of Sorafenib in combination with TACE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far there are no reports about the safety of Sorafenib in combination with TACE. Here we&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of this combination until 12 weeks after the last TACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: PPG-Measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of portal hypertension in cirrhosis occurs due to two main pathophysiologic&#xD;
      mechanisms: the increase in resistance to portal blood flow resulting from increased&#xD;
      intrahepatic resistance and the decreased arteriolar vascular tone in the splanchnic vascular&#xD;
      bed leading to increased splanchnic inflow of blood. Very recently, it has been shown that&#xD;
      increased splanchnic inflow does not only result from arteriolar vasodilation due to excess&#xD;
      NO-production in the splanchnic vascular bed but also from an increase in neoangiogenesis in&#xD;
      the splanchnic circulation. Increased neovessel formation occurred within a few days of onset&#xD;
      of portal hypertension both in a cirrhotic and an extrahepatic murine model of portal&#xD;
      hypertension. Neoangiogenesis was effectively inhibited by either an antibody against VEGF-R2&#xD;
      or an inhibitor of VEGF-R2 autophosphorylation, resulting in a reduction of splanchnic blood&#xD;
      flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most recently, a combination of a VEGF and a PDGF blocker further decreased portal pressure&#xD;
      in an experimental preclinical model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As Sorafenib is a VEGF and PDGF blocker, we aim to analyze the influence of Sorafenib on&#xD;
      portal hypertension and systemic and hepatic hemodynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Biomarkers for treatment response:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, we aim to analyze methylated tumor DNA in serum of patients with HCC undergoing&#xD;
      Sorafenib treatment and TACE as possible marker of treatment response.&#xD;
