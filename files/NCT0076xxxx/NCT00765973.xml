  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-center, open-label, two-arm, dose-escalation study to establish the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, MTD, and schedule of TLI administered intravenously as a 30 minute infusion in&#xD;
      adult subjects with advanced solid tumors that have relapsed, are refractory to standard&#xD;
      therapy, or for whom there is no standard therapy available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two dosing regimens to be evaluated are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: TLI dose on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day treatment cycle (Starting dose: 1 mg/m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: TLI dose on Day 1 of a 21-day treatment cycle (Starting dose: 2 mg/m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      When one of the two arms reaches MTD, all future subjects will then be enrolled in the&#xD;
      remaining study arm until MTD of that arm is reached.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will utilize an accelerated design with small initial cohort sizes that allow fewer&#xD;
      subjects to be enrolled at sub-therapeutic doses such as the very low starting doses in both&#xD;
      arms of the study. Initial cohorts will include only one subject and dose escalations will be&#xD;
      in 100% increments until a single Grade 2 toxicity related to study drug or DLT occurs in&#xD;
      Cycle 1. Dose escalation will proceed until the MTD is exceeded. MTD is defined as average of&#xD;
      the highest dose level for which 2 out of 6 subjects experience a DLT and the previous dose&#xD;
      level, provided no additional DLTs occur. Subjects who discontinue TLI treatment before&#xD;
      completion of Cycle 1 for reasons other than toxicity will not be evaluable for the&#xD;
      determination of MTD and will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a screening period, treatment period, and a post-treatment period.&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed for 30 days after their last TLI dose. Safety and tolerability&#xD;
      parameters include clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, physical examinations, and&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs).&#xD;
