  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study in 160 patients in first line treatment&#xD;
      and 114 in second line treatment with advanced or metastatic NSCLC (Stage IIIB/IV).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase II clinical trial will address the issues of bevacizumab treatment duration and&#xD;
      treatment safety as first-line therapy for patients with non-squamous NSCLC. Following&#xD;
      disease progression or treatment failure, the potential benefit of continued bevacizumab&#xD;
      therapy will be tested by randomizing patients to two treatment arms, including second-line&#xD;
      chemotherapy with or without further bevacizumab. It is hypothesized that continuation of&#xD;
      bevacizumab with pemetrexed as second-line treatment following progression will result in&#xD;
      improved clinical outcomes for patients with NSCLC.&#xD;
