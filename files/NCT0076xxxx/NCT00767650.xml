      This study will use neuropsychological tests to look at nervous system side effects of&#xD;
      Cyclosporine (CsA) in patients with aplastic anemia. CsA is used as part of an&#xD;
      immunosuppressive regimen in treating severe aplastic anemia. The drug can produce nervous&#xD;
      system side effects, such as tremor and, less commonly, insomnia, anxiety, headache,&#xD;
      confusion or seizures. This study will look at effects of CsA on intellectual ability,&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, attention, concentration, memory, perception, coordination, and thought&#xD;
      processing in patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 15 years of age or older who have severe aplastic anemia may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  are co-enrolled in a Clinical Center protocol in which they will receive CsA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have not taken CsA for 6 months before enrolling in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo neuropsychological testing. In addition, they provide blood samples and&#xD;
      their clinical data are reviewed for things that may influence the interpretation of findings&#xD;
      from the testing, such as results of blood tests, types of medications taken, number of&#xD;
      transfusions required, etc. The procedures are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before first dose of cyclosporine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are asked about prior problems with their nervous system, prior treatment for&#xD;
           their aplastic anemia (including transfusions), prior infections, and current&#xD;
           medications. They then complete the following sets of tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Battery 1: A set of three tests that measure intellectual ability, level of depression&#xD;
           (if any) and level of anxiety (if any).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Battery 2: A set of seven tests that measure changes in the central nervous system and&#xD;
           how these changes affect attention, concentration, memory, perception, coordination, and&#xD;
           thought processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients provide a half teaspoon of blood for this study at the same time blood is&#xD;
           collected for their primary treatment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6 months and 12 months after starting cyclosporine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are asked about treatment for their aplastic anemia (including transfusions),&#xD;
           infections, and changes in medications that have occurred since they started taking&#xD;
           cyclosporine. They then repeat the set of tests in Battery 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients provide a half teaspoon of blood for this study at the same time blood is&#xD;
           collected for their primary treatment protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cyclosporine (CsA) is widely used in the treatment of aplastic anemia as well as to provide&#xD;
      immunosuppression after transplantation. CsA has a spectrum of neurologic and more subtle,&#xD;
      poorly investigated neuropsychological functional effects. In the NHLBI, a unique opportunity&#xD;
      exists to evaluate changes in neuropsychological function following CsA in a large cohort of&#xD;
      aplastic anemia patients accrued to NHLBI treatment protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With increased success in treating blood diseases with immunosuppressive therapy or stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation that utilize CsA in the treatment regimen, patients are enjoying prolonged&#xD;
      survival during which quality of life becomes an increasingly relevant concern. We therefore&#xD;
      propose this natural history protocol designed to evaluate neuropsychological functioning&#xD;
      before, during, and after CsA administration in severe aplastic anemia patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate changes in attention, language, memory, spatial/motor&#xD;
      and executive function domains following CsA therapy using well established&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests including the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB) Screening&#xD;
      Module, Revised Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, Revised Brief Visual-spatial Memory Test,&#xD;
      Judgment of Line Orientation test, Grooved Pegboard, Trail Making Test and the two&#xD;
      performance subsets in Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III. IQ test by Wechsler Abbreviated&#xD;
      Scale of Intelligence and depression/anxiety level will be screened once prior to formal&#xD;
      testing. Measures will also be correlated with clinical status, standard CsA side effects,&#xD;
      CsA drug levels and relevant biochemical lab values at each time point to control the testing&#xD;
      accuracy and explore potential correlation.&#xD;
