    <textblock>
      Pain prior to surgery is of particular concern in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty&#xD;
      (THA) since it is the most important predictor of pain and poor function 2-3 years after&#xD;
      surgery. Previous studies have investigated various treatments for managing pain during and&#xD;
      after surgery. However, no study has investigated the short and long term effects of&#xD;
      pregabalin in terms of functional rehabilitation, pain outcome and anxiety following total&#xD;
      hip arthroplasty. Therefore, the aim of the present study is determine if the following: (1)&#xD;
      if perioperative pregabalin administration positively influence early rehabilitation and&#xD;
      recovery of physical function and to determine if these effects maintained at 6 weeks and 3&#xD;
      months post surgery. (2) To determine if perioperative pregabalin administration reduce&#xD;
      postoperative movement evoked pain associated with rehabilitation and if these effects also&#xD;
      maintained at 6 weeks and 3 months post surgery.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION. Participants are being asked to consider taking part in this research study if&#xD;
      they are scheduled for total hip surgery. In this study we will compare the effect of a pain&#xD;
      medication known as Pregabalin compared to placebo on rehabilitation and recovery of physical&#xD;
      function and pain associated with rehabilitation. We will monitor patient progress in&#xD;
      hospital and follow-up participants at 6 weeks and 3 months post surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Holland Orthopedic and Arthritic Centre we use different methods to control&#xD;
      postoperative pain. Postoperative pain relief is usually controlled with morphine using a&#xD;
      pump that participants can control themselves, sometimes called &quot;PCA&quot; (Patient Controlled&#xD;
      Analgesia). Participants also receive a combination of tablets like an anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      (Celecoxib), and opioids (strong pain killers), to get the best pain relief possible with the&#xD;
      fewest side effects. Anti-Inflammatories are a type of pain medicine that reduces swelling&#xD;
      (inflammation). We would like to see compare the recovery profile of participants who receive&#xD;
      in their pain management plan, the addition of Pregabalin with those who receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE? Pregabalin has recently been shown to reduce the amount of&#xD;
      morphine participants use after surgery and enhance rehabilitation in some orthopedic&#xD;
      participants. This study will examine whether Pregabalin added to a patient's pain management&#xD;
      plan will help them rehabilitate more effectively and with less pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part of this research will involve the collection of information from study participants that&#xD;
      describes any pain or discomfort that they experience before and after surgery. After&#xD;
      surgery, participants will be asked about how much pain they have by the nursing staff. In&#xD;
      order to address these issues, they are asked to provide the following information at various&#xD;
      intervals during their hospital stay:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pain intensity - using a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) where 0=no pain and 10=Terrible Pain&#xD;
           will be recorded three times daily during your hospital stay. Participants will also be&#xD;
           asked to rate their pain after several rehabilitation measures on Postoperative days 1&#xD;
           to 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants will also be asked if they are feeling nauseated, feel like vomiting, or&#xD;
           feel drowsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Total Hip Arthroplasty, it is important that all patients receive a standardized&#xD;
      rehabilitation protocol. At the Holland Orthopedic and Arthritic Centre, the Primary Hip&#xD;
      Replacement Care Pathway is accompanied by a standardized rehabilitation treatment protocol.&#xD;
      While patients are in hospital, they will meet a physiotherapist who will put them through a&#xD;
      series of hip exercises. The physiotherapist will record how much movement they can perform&#xD;
      with their hip every day that they are in hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On postoperative day 2 and day 4 study participants will, in addition to their daily hip&#xD;
      exercises, be asked to perform a walking test to the best of ability. Participants will be&#xD;
      timed, the physiotherapist will ask the participant to stand from a chair and walk 3 meters&#xD;
      at a comfortable safe pace. Participants will then turn and walk back to the chair, and then&#xD;
      sit down. In order that participants are familiar with that test we will perform that&#xD;
      exercise before their operation so that we can obtain a baseline score. At the completion of&#xD;
      the walking test, participants will also be asked to provide a final pain assessment of how&#xD;
      painful the walking test was. On postoperative day 4, and at 6 weeks and at 3 months&#xD;
      participants will be asked to perform some other rehabilitation measures. One will be a timed&#xD;
      six minute walk test (only at 6 weeks and 3 months), that means we will measure how far they&#xD;
      can walk in 6 minutes. The other measure will be one requiring participants to walk up&#xD;
      stairs, they will have a good understanding of the above tests because they will have&#xD;
      performed these tests prior to surgery.&#xD;
