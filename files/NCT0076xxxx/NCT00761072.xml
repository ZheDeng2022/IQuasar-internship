  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total intravenous anesthesia(TIVA) is a commonly used anesthetic technique. Although TIVA can&#xD;
      be accomplished with a variety of drug combinations, infusions of Propofol and Remifentanil&#xD;
      are often used with dosage adjusted manually by the anesthesia provider.The pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of these drugs are well understood, and that knowledge has led to the development of computer&#xD;
      controlled infusion pumps that can administer the drugs based upon pharmacokinetic models.&#xD;
      Computer controlled infusion schemes automatically adjust the drug administration based upon&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic models which typically dictate a tapering infusion scheme. When one considers&#xD;
      the dosage of a computer controlled infusion it is obvious that manually imitating a similar&#xD;
      scheme may be difficult.This study will evaluate manually controlled infusion schemes using&#xD;
      the models built into the Applied Medical Visualizations (Medvis) display and compare the&#xD;
      manual dosage schemes to the predicted effect site concentrations and pharmacodynamic effect.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), the anesthetic propofol and the opioid&#xD;
      remifentanil are often used together. Previous studies have demonstrated the synergy between&#xD;
      these combinations of medications. From these data, drug interaction models have been&#xD;
      developed to pair drug effect-site concentrations with event markers of interest to the&#xD;
      clinical anesthesiologist. For example, the amount of remifentanil and propofol typically&#xD;
      required during the induction of anesthesia to cause loss of responsiveness to verbal or&#xD;
      moderate stimuli has been studied. Likewise, the blood concentration levels present during&#xD;
      emergence from anesthesia have been explored describing levels typically present for patients&#xD;
      to return to consciousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to retrospectively analyze the infusion doses of both&#xD;
      remifentanil and propofol for pediatric patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery at CHOP.&#xD;
      These data will be applied to the pharmacokinetic models to determine the predicted effect&#xD;
      site concentration, and the relationship of that concentration to the 50% and 95% doses as&#xD;
      predicted by the model.&#xD;
