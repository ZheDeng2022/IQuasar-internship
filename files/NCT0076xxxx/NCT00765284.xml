      This will be a single center, open-label, randomized, mechanism of action study consisting of&#xD;
      8 weeks of active treatment preceded by a screening phase from one to 8 weeks and a baseline&#xD;
      measurement of parameters of reverse cholesterol transport for 10 days. The population for&#xD;
      this trial is 15 non-diabetic men aged 18-70 years. Ten subjects will be low HDL-C male&#xD;
      volunteers who will receive aspirin and Niaspan and five subjects will be low HDL-C male&#xD;
      volunteers who will receive only aspirin.&#xD;
