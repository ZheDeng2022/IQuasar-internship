  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of TAK-559, once daily&#xD;
      (QD), in treating subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insulin is a primary regulator of blood glucose concentrations. A subnormal response to&#xD;
      circulating insulin levels at target tissues leads to a decrease in insulin-mediated glucose&#xD;
      uptake. Insulin resistance is associated with normal to high insulin levels and is often&#xD;
      accompanied by dyslipidemia, a disruption in lipid metabolism resulting in increased&#xD;
      triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein levels as well as decreased high-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the early stages of insulin&#xD;
      resistance, a compensatory mechanism of increased insulin secretion by the pancreas maintains&#xD;
      normal to near-normal glucose levels. Once the pancreas fails to maintain the increased&#xD;
      insulin output, overt type 2 diabetes mellitus occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAK-559 is a novel oxyiminoalkanoic acid under investigation for use as an oral agent in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. TAK-559 has partial peroxisome&#xD;
      proliferator-activated receptor-alpha agonist activity, potent peroxisome&#xD;
      proliferator-activated receptor-alpha activity, and modest peroxisome proliferator-activated&#xD;
      receptor-gamma activity at high concentrations in nonclinical models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed to evaluate the safety and glycemic control of TAK-559 in patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose symptoms were managed by diet and exercise.&#xD;
