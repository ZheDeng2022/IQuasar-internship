    <textblock>
      Because the increasing fall problem, mainly due to an impaired gait and balance ability and&#xD;
      partly caused by trips, this study will investigate fall risk by detecting fall related&#xD;
      movement characteristics and by detecting stumbles inclusive the compensation mechanism to&#xD;
      recover from the trip. Based on the promising results using accelerometry for accurate and&#xD;
      objective gait analysis, fall risk will be measured in younger and older (&gt;60y) subjects&#xD;
      using a triaxial accelerometer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To investigate fall risk objectively, fall related movement characteristics (based on gait&#xD;
      and balance) and the ability to compensate for near falls are analyzed in younger and older&#xD;
      (&gt;60y) subjects under standardized laboratory conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four tests will be performed to link specific movement parameters, balance performance and&#xD;
      the ability to recover from a trip with fall risk:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fall risk will be assessed using the Tinetti Scale, the gold standard for fall risk&#xD;
           assessment . This scale consist of a gait and balance score. Based on this scale,&#xD;
           subjects are classified as being at risk/ not at risk for falling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A gait test will be performed to analyze movement parameters. Subjects have to walk 6&#xD;
           times a 20 meter distance at preferred speed while a small (56mmx61mmx15mm), light&#xD;
           weight (5g) and ambulant accelerometer is attached on the sacrum with an elastic belt.&#xD;
           The accelerometer measures accelerations of the body in three directions&#xD;
           (anterior-posterior, media-lateral and cranial-caudal) with a sample frequency of 100Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The balance ability will be tested by performing 4 balance tasks while the same&#xD;
           accelerometer measures the movements of the body. Subjects have to stand with feet&#xD;
           closed on a normal or foam surface while having the eyes open and closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Finally a stumble experiment is done to assess the ability to compensate for a trip.&#xD;
           Subjects are asked to walk at their preferred speed on a treadmill, while wearing the&#xD;
           accelerometer attached at the sacrum. After 2 minutes of normal walking, stumbles are&#xD;
           simulated unexpectedly using an extending tripping leash attached to both legs. The&#xD;
           subjects are able to move freely due to unwinding and winding of the cord on a spill on&#xD;
           a fixed frame behind the treadmill. This spill has a blocking device capable of blocking&#xD;
           the leash very shortly. During the mid or initial swing of one of the legs, the examiner&#xD;
           blocks the leash causing the subject to trip. Falling, however, is not possible due to a&#xD;
           safety harness attached to the ceiling. When this harness starts bearing weight an&#xD;
           emergency switch is engaged stopping the treadmill immediately. After a perturbation,&#xD;
           subjects get several seconds to recover until a new perturbation is applied. This&#xD;
           measurement is repeated while walking at a slow (40% Fr preferred speed) and fast (20%&#xD;
           Fr preferred speed) speed. The whole experiment will be recorded on video to validate&#xD;
           the acceleration based stumble detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the underlying mechanism of age related mobility changes, two other tests are&#xD;
      incorporated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cognition of the subjects will be tested using a reaction time test. Subjects sit&#xD;
           behind the computer with their middle and forefinger on two keys of the typewriter. Four&#xD;
           squares will appear at the computer screen. Or all squares are red and one of them will&#xD;
           change in green (=uncued condition) or two red squares appear at the left (right) side&#xD;
           while one square at the right (left) side will turn green. Subjects have to push the&#xD;
           corresponding key on the typewriter as fast but also as accurate as possible. With this&#xD;
           test the ability to change an automatic response (in stead of responding left when&#xD;
           stimulus appears left) can be investigated using reaction times. First the subjects get&#xD;
           an instruction, than they get the possibility to try and exercise 10 times, while&#xD;
           afterwards the real test will start. 120 attempts are performed in which the cued and&#xD;
           uncued stimuli appear with different time intervals (100ms, 250ms, 500ms, 750ms and&#xD;
           12000 ms).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle strength of the right lower leg is tested using the Cybex. Subjects have to&#xD;
           produce maximal force during an extension and flexion test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All acceleration data will be analyzed using specific algorithms programmed in Matlab(c).&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed in SPSS using pearson correlation to investigate&#xD;
      correlations between gait parameters, balance characteristics and the ability to recover from&#xD;
      a trip. Moreover Pearson correlations and regression analysis will be done to investigate the&#xD;
      relation of cognition and muscle strength with fall risk (gait, stumble recovery and&#xD;
      balance). Pearson correlation will also be used to validate the objective gait and balance&#xD;
      test with the Berg Balance Scale. Differences in muscle strength, cognition gait, balance and&#xD;
      compensation ability between younger and older subjects will be investigated using ANOVA (p&lt;&#xD;
      0.005).&#xD;
