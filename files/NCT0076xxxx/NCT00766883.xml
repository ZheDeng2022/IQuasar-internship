  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effectiveness of problem-solving education for patients who are&#xD;
      undergoing a stem cell transplant and their caregivers. The emotional stress of transplant&#xD;
      extends beyond patients to their caregivers; this study will identify the type of education&#xD;
      that will be most helpful to transplant caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients undergoing stem cell transplant at the NIH s Clinical Center and their adult&#xD;
      caregivers are eligible for this study. The caregiver must be caring for the patient from&#xD;
      before hospital admission for the procedure until 6 weeks following the transplant. Both&#xD;
      patient and caregiver must be able to read and speak English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and caregivers have three education sessions (in addition to the routine transplant&#xD;
      education provided at the Clinical Center) and complete three study questionnaires as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires: The questionnaires vary somewhat for patient and caregiver, but include&#xD;
           information on demographics (e.g., sex, race, marital status, education level),&#xD;
           distress, lifestyle, relationship with the caregiver/patient, confidence level,&#xD;
           symptoms, pain, fatigue and sleep quality. Questionnaires are completed before the&#xD;
           patient undergoes the transplant (and before attending any education sessions), before&#xD;
           the patient is discharged from the hospital and 6 weeks after hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Education sessions: The 60-minute sessions are designed to teach problem-solving&#xD;
           strategies by looking at problems in a new way and learning effective communication&#xD;
           skills. The sessions are conducted before the patient is discharged from the hospital, 1&#xD;
           week after discharge and 3 weeks after discharge.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) generates multiple symptoms and&#xD;
      problems that can vary in complexity. Although it seems evident that patients and caregivers&#xD;
      experience clinically significant levels of psychological distress, few intervention studies&#xD;
      have been explored to address this concern in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem-solving is an essential skill for individuals to successfully cope. Increased&#xD;
      problem-solving skill has been shown to decrease psychological distress and may improve&#xD;
      symptom distress and health related quality of life (QOL). The COPE (Creativity, Optimism,&#xD;
      Planning, and Expert Information) problem-solving education (PSE) intervention has&#xD;
      demonstrated benefit and has been reported as a positive therapy by cancer patients and their&#xD;
      families. Only one study has reported the application of this intervention in the acute care&#xD;
      setting and our previous pilot study has been the only one done with patients and caregivers&#xD;
      undergoing allogeneic HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the findings from our pilot study and recent published reports, this study is&#xD;
      designed to determine preliminary efficacy of problem solving education by increasing&#xD;
      self-efficacy in caregivers during allogeneic HSCT. In addition, this study will explore&#xD;
      factors associated with change in caregiver self-efficacy and distress such as demographics,&#xD;
      clinical variables, mutuality, caregiver reaction, sleep quality, fatigue and health&#xD;
      behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase two clinical trial applying a prospective repeated measure design. Subjects&#xD;
      will be accrued to this protocol if they agree to participation in an allogeneic HSCT at the&#xD;
      Clinical Center, NIH, are greater than 18 years old, able to read English and able to&#xD;
      comprehend the investigational nature of the study. Patient volunteers must have at least one&#xD;
      caregiver throughout the study period. A sample of at least 71 caregivers is needed to&#xD;
      adequately evaluate the effectiveness of the PSE intervention. In order to achieve a sample&#xD;
      of 71 caregivers 50 transplant patients will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each caregiver (and patient) will be scheduled for three individualized PSE intervention&#xD;
      sessions (study intervention) in addition to the usual care group education. Three surveys&#xD;
      will be administered to all study participants. The baseline questionnaires will be&#xD;
      administered twice; once prior to allogeneic HSCT and again directly before the first PSE, at&#xD;
      the time of initial discharge from the hospital. The post-intervention questionnaires will be&#xD;
      administered 6 weeks post discharge. There will be no long term follow-up after the&#xD;
      intervention period. Questionnaires include: Distress Thermometer, Family Caregiving&#xD;
      Inventory Mutuality Scale, Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II, Cancer Self-Efficacy scale,&#xD;
      Brief Symptom Inventory, Caregiver Reaction Assessment, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and&#xD;
      the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form. In addition, the subjects will&#xD;
      participate in a semi-structured interview at the end of the study and the interventionist&#xD;
      will complete a log that tracks subject attendance, session length, and discrepancy between&#xD;
      planned and actual session date and time. Quantitative and qualitative analysis techniques&#xD;
      will be used in this study.&#xD;
