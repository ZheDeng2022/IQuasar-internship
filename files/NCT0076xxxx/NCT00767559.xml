    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to find a better way to prevent the post operative&#xD;
      development of clots in the deep veins of the legs (also called Deep Vein Thrombosis or DVT).&#xD;
      DVT causes redness, swelling, and pain in the involved leg(s). Long-term complications may&#xD;
      include permanent swelling and pain of the leg(s), and even skin ulcers around the ankle. If&#xD;
      clots form in a leg after surgery, and break off, they can move to the lungs and block the&#xD;
      pulmonary artery (also called Pulmonary Emboli or PE). With PE there can be chest pain, chest&#xD;
      tightness, shortness of breath, coughing up blood, heart failure, and occasionally death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doctors have studied ways to reduce these complications. These studies led to the development&#xD;
      of drugs which interfere with your body's clotting processes. However, it is still unclear&#xD;
      which drug and which drug schedule is best. This study will evaluate two of the standard FDA&#xD;
      approved drugs using different dosing schedules.&#xD;

      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Planned for elective primary arthroplasty for knee and hip disease at New England&#xD;
           Baptist Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Over 20 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Normal baseline platelet count, prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Signed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Surgery for acute fracture (&lt; 4 weeks), septic joint, or extraction arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with personal history of TED, or documented hypercoagulation disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Increased risk of hemorrhage, as from active gastric ulcer, or bleeding diathesis; or&#xD;
           persistent intestinal or urinary tract bleed within the last year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, randomized study seeks to determine if there is an advantage for fixed, low&#xD;
      dose of warfarin Thromboembolic Disease (TED) prophylaxis among patients undergoing elective&#xD;
      lower extremity joint arthroplasty, as compared to variable dose warfarin and a low molecular&#xD;
      weight heparin (LMWH). If confirmed as effective fixed, low dose warfarin would be an almost&#xD;
      ideal prophylaxis against Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolus (PE): inexpensive,&#xD;
      easy to administer, with minimal hemorrhagic potential, needing minimal laboratory support .&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A progression of studies has been performed to examine the efficacy of low dose warfarin.&#xD;
      These studies demonstrated that low dose warfarin has antithrombotic activity, with little&#xD;
      anticoagulant effect. Critical to this approach that the warfarin therapy be initiated prior&#xD;
      to surgery. A summary of other studies offering supportive or conflicting data is available.&#xD;
      (1-9)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Low dose warfarin (2mg) dampens activated coagulation. (1-3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Two-step low dose warfarin begun 10-14 days pre-op is effective prophylaxis. (4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Low dose warfarin (1mg) prevents DVT's surrounding central venous catheters when started&#xD;
           3 days before catheter insertion among patients at very high risk for subclavian DVT.&#xD;
           (5,6)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Low dose warfarin (1mg) started 7 days prior to surgery is equal to variable dose&#xD;
           warfarin for TED prophylaxis following hip arthroplasty. (7)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Low dose warfarin (1mg) started 7 days prior to surgery is effective TED prophylaxis for&#xD;
           patients having hip replacement arthroplasties in retrospective study of 1003 patients.&#xD;
           (8)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sentinel study used a fixed low dose warfarin regimen given to patients at extreme risk&#xD;
      for DVT. Patients requiring central venous catheters for chemotherapy for metastatic cancer&#xD;
      participated in a randomized study of 0.0 mg vs.1.0 mg daily warfarin starting 3 days prior&#xD;
      to catheter placement. Subclavian vein venograms were performed at the time of symptoms of&#xD;
      subclavian vein DVT or after 90 days. When using this low dose warfarin schedule there was a&#xD;
      reduction in the incidence of thrombosis from 37.5% to 9.5%. (p&lt;0.05) Four patients acquired&#xD;
      vitamin K-responsive prolongation of the PT due to concomitant advanced liver disease and/or&#xD;
      malnutrition. Concentrations of factors II, VII, IX, X, and protein C showed no difference&#xD;
      between treated and untreated patients. (5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two orthopedic surgery studies from NEBH on this question have been published. (7,8) The&#xD;
      first was a pilot study of 100 patients demonstrated no difference between the effectiveness&#xD;
      of low fixed dose and variable dose warfarin in a population of patients at high risk for TED&#xD;
      (7) Patients studied were planning total hip replacement arthroplasty were randomized between&#xD;
      the standard regimens using warfarin of 5 mg the night prior to surgery followed by variable&#xD;
      dose (target PT 1.3 - 1.5 times normal) for 30-45 days, or the experimental regimen using 1&#xD;
      mg beginning 7 days prior to surgery and continued until follow up at 30-45 days. Ultrasounds&#xD;
      of the deep veins of the legs were performed at baseline, at discharge following surgery, and&#xD;
      at 30-45 day follow-up. There was no difference between the groups for incidence of venous&#xD;
      thrombosis. The second study was a retrospective study of patients undergoing primary (833)&#xD;
      or revision (170) hip replacement arthroplasty receiving 1 mg warfarin for 7 days before&#xD;
      surgery, variable dose while in hospital, (INR target 1.5 - 2.0) followed by 1 mg daily until&#xD;
      follow-up at 30-45 days. (8) Each patient used pneumatic followed by elastic compression&#xD;
      stockings. Of these 1003 patients, with 9 lost to follow-up. Three patients had TED,&#xD;
      including 1 PE and 2 DVT.&#xD;
