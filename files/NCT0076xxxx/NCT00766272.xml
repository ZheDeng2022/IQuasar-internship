  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis is a degenerative disease that affects more than 400,000 people in the US&#xD;
      alone. MS is in fact the most common disabling neurological disorder in young adults.&#xD;
      Symptoms of the disease can include problems with balance, walking, fatigue, weakness and&#xD;
      vision. Over 85% of people with Multiple Sclerosis have problems walking. This can cause them&#xD;
      to fall or have a constant fear of falling. To prevent falling, MS patients rely on&#xD;
      equipment, such as walkers and canes. These costs can cause financial difficulties for MS&#xD;
      patients and families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant problem that is only recently being studied is the relationship between falling&#xD;
      and MS. Recent studies have shown that MS patients fall more often than those without MS, and&#xD;
      also fall more than the elderly population. The consequent fear of falling is also an&#xD;
      important problem, as those worried about falling will probably change their daily habits to&#xD;
      lower their risk. This can mean keeping from certain physical and social activities or even&#xD;
      staying indoors. Thus, falls and fear of falling can have negative medical, physical,&#xD;
      psychological, and social consequences for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving patients' walking may help reduce falls and the fear of falling. Treadmill training&#xD;
      has been shown to improve walking in patients with MS and to lower their risk of falling. One&#xD;
      way to train patients on a treadmill is with the use of robots that can help move their limbs&#xD;
      in a more normal way. This kind of robot-assisted treadmill training may provide even greater&#xD;
      benefits than treadmill training alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is expected to last 6-7.5 months. One group of participants will receive weekly&#xD;
      telephone calls and will be asked questions on other physical activities, falls, and activity&#xD;
      limitations the patient had during the week. Participants assigned to robot-assisted&#xD;
      treadmill training will receive twice weekly training session for 8 weeks, for a total of 16&#xD;
      sessions. Each session will last about 65 to 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to see if robot-assisted treadmill training will reduce falls and&#xD;
      fear of falling in patients with MS. Robot-assisted treadmill training has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective in reducing falls and fear of falling in Parkinson's disease patients. This type of&#xD;
      training has not been tested in patients with Multiple Sclerosis. The proposed study will&#xD;
      help to address this gap and also provide additional data on other possible improvements due&#xD;
      to robot-assisted treadmill training including ambulation, social participation, fatigue, and&#xD;
      balance.&#xD;

    <description>Body-weight will be supported using a harness, which suspends the subject above a motorized treadmill (Lokomat, Hocoma, Zurich, Switzerland). The system also incorporates a robot-driven gait orthotic, called the Lokomat, which will be secured to the subject's lower extremity and pelvis using adjustable cuffs and pads. The Lokomat uses computer-controlled motors to drive the hips and knees toward more normative kinematic patterns for gait.</description>
