      This study will measure nasopharyngeal pressure in neonates using a miniature high resolution&#xD;
      catheter-tip pressure transducer. Any neonatal intensive care patient being treated with&#xD;
      nasal respiratory support (e.g., nasal continuous positive airway pressure, nasal cannula&#xD;
      flow either high (&gt;1 LPM) or low (&lt;1 LPM), and nasal prong ventilation either intermittent&#xD;
      mandatory or high-frequency) will be eligible for study. The catheter-tip transducer will be&#xD;
      placed within a standard gavage feeding tube catheter and introduced through the mouth into&#xD;
      the posterior nasopharynx where continuous measurements will be made over 15 minutes. The 15&#xD;
      minute recording will be divided into 5 three minute segments, including a baseline recording&#xD;
      at the ordered settings of pressure or flow, a recording at 1 level above baseline, a&#xD;
      recording back at baseline, a recording 1 level below baseline, and a final segment back at&#xD;
      baseline. The order of increase-decrease or decrease-increase from baseline will be by random&#xD;
      sequence. Measurements may be repeated with any change in nasal gas flow or pressure ordered&#xD;
      for patient care. These measurements will be used to correlate the ordered nasal respiratory&#xD;
      support therapy with the actual upper airway pressure created by the therapy.&#xD;

      Non-invasive respiratory treatments are being used more frequently during neonatal intensive&#xD;
      care. High-flow nasal cannula,1-2 nasal continuous positive airway pressure,3 nasal&#xD;
      intermittent mandatory or synchronized ventilation,4 and high-frequency nasal continuous&#xD;
      airway pressure5-6 are some of these modalities. These non-invasive therapies attempt to&#xD;
      provide adequate oxygen delivery, positive end-expiratory pressure to maintain lung&#xD;
      recruitment, and ventilation assistance without the need for endotracheal intubation. The&#xD;
      benefits may be substantial, including decreased frequency of nosocomial infection, decreased&#xD;
      risk for lung injury, and prevention of arrest in pulmonary development for those very&#xD;
      preterm infants with immature lungs. However, there are very few reports of actual&#xD;
      measurement of nasopharyngeal pressure during use of these non-invasive therapies.1,7&#xD;
      Combined, only 27 patients are included in two studies. Only one modality, high-flow nasal&#xD;
      cannula, was evaluated. One study in 11 patients suggests a 2-3 cmH2O pressure drop exists&#xD;
      between applied and delivered airway pressure.7 In order to better understand the&#xD;
      relationship between applied and delivered airway pressures with all types of non-invasive&#xD;
      therapy, we propose to measure nasopharyngeal pressure in neonates being treated with these&#xD;
      modes of respiratory support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If non-invasive respiratory support is initiated as part of routine pulmonary therapy for a&#xD;
      neonate admitted to neonatal intensive care, the infant will be considered eligible for study&#xD;
      if no exclusion criteria are met. Informed consent/parental permission will be requested and&#xD;
      if obtained, the infant will be included for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study procedure will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Care information will be documented, to include the infant's post-menstrual and&#xD;
           post-delivery age, current weight, current level of supplemental oxygen administration,&#xD;
           current pulse oximeter saturation level, applied flow and pressure settings, and if&#xD;
           non-invasive ventilation is being used, the ventilator parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A high resolution fiber optic pressure tip transducer catheter will be inserted into a&#xD;
           5F or similar size fenestrated tube (such as an Anderson catheter) and introduced&#xD;
           through the mouth towards the posterior pharynx. The pressure transducer/catheter&#xD;
           combination will only be inserted the minimum distance to obtain a stable pressure&#xD;
           signal reading and not produce choking or gagging in the infant. If the infant&#xD;
           demonstrates choking or gagging, the tube will be withdrawn to a position that does not&#xD;
           produce choking or gagging in the infant. If the pressure signal suggests that the&#xD;
           catheter openings may be occluded with mucous, 5mL of air may be injected into the&#xD;
           catheter to clear the mucous and obtain a satisfactory recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 1 to 5 minute recording will be made from the pressure transducer onto a notebook&#xD;
           computer at the current non-invasive therapy settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two more 1 to 5 minute recordings will be made, either 0.5-1.0 cmH2O or 0.5-1.0 liter&#xD;
           per minute flow (depending on the non-invasive modality) above and below the current&#xD;
           settings. The order of the increase or decrease will be by random sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A final fourth 1 to 5 minute recording will be made when the settings have been returned&#xD;
           to the current baseline settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulse oximeter saturation will be recorded both before and after each recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A study infant will undergo a baseline study procedure, and re-studied whenever the&#xD;
           non-invasive therapy settings are changed based on clinical management.&#xD;
