    <textblock>
      Background to ghrelin Ghrelin is a naturally occurring hormone found in the blood which&#xD;
      stimulates appetite. In healthy individuals, levels of ghrelin are high before a meal and&#xD;
      falls afterwards. Previous studies have shown that giving ghrelin (by injection) to thin&#xD;
      patients with renal failure and cancer increases their food intake. Furthermore, addition of&#xD;
      ghrelin may also reduce inflammation within the body. Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic&#xD;
      disease which frequently results in recurrent lung infections (leading to progressive&#xD;
      inflammatory lung damage) and low body weight. Low body weight in CF is associated with&#xD;
      increased lung infections, rapidly worsening lung function and a shortened life expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers postulate that administration of extra ghrelin to CF patients with low body&#xD;
      weight may increase food intake and reduce lung inflammation. If successful, this study might&#xD;
      identify ghrelin as a potential therapy for CF patients to improve nutrition, decrease lung&#xD;
      inflammation and thereby improve survival.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of a naturally occuring hormone called&#xD;
      ghrelin on appetite, energy expenditure and immune function in patients with cystic fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theoretical framework:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite advances in the molecular understanding of the disease, life-expectancy in Cystic&#xD;
      Fibrosis (CF) remains severely limited. Reduced body-weight is associated with increased&#xD;
      inflammatory lung damage and is a major predictor of mortality in CF patients. Malnutrition&#xD;
      is highly prevalent in the CF population and results from both poor food intake and excessive&#xD;
      energy expenditure. A therapy which improves nutrition may therefore have a significant&#xD;
      effect on the prognosis of this disease. Ghrelin is the only physiological circulating factor&#xD;
      that is known to increase food intake. Administration of acylated ghrelin to humans increases&#xD;
      both hunger and food intake and has been found to increase appetite in chronic disease states&#xD;
      associated with anorexia and weight loss (such as cancer and chronic renal disease). From&#xD;
      multiple animal and in vitro human studies, ghrelin also appears to have anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties which would potentially benefit CF patients in whom a chronic inflammatory state&#xD;
      promotes lung destruction, malnutrition and increases mortality. Ghrelin replacement may&#xD;
      therefore improve nutrition and decrease the inflammatory burden in CF patients, leading to&#xD;
      an improvement in life-expectancy. If ghrelin is identified as having an important&#xD;
      pathophysiological role in CF it may lead to a future study of its efficacy as a therapeutic&#xD;
      agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Methodology: The study has three sections:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a cross sectional study of the levels of blood metabolic signals in participants with&#xD;
           cystic fibrosis and healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a laboratory study of the effect of ghrelin on immune cells extracted from the blood of&#xD;
           participants with cystic fibrosis and healthy controls&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. a cross-over interventional study of repeated ghrelin administration in malnourished&#xD;
           cystic fibrosis patients&#xD;
