    <textblock>
      This is a nonrandomized, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination&#xD;
      treatment of Nilotinib and RAD001 in the treatment of c-kit + AML. Patients refractory to&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy or not eligible to standard chemotherapy can be included. Patients will&#xD;
      be treated with 400 mg Nilotinib bid (total daily dose 800 mg). RAD001 will be added after a&#xD;
      treatment duration of 1 week in a dosage of 2,5 mg/day. Treatment duration will be 25 weeks.&#xD;
