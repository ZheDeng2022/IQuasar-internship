  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to prove that the Imp™SFB7+ (L-Dex U400) is equivalent to the&#xD;
      Imp™ XCA device in assessing Lymphoedema. The Imp™ XCA device is a simple device capable of&#xD;
      assessing Lymphoedema of a single arm. The Imp™SFB7+ (L-Dex U400) is a more complex device&#xD;
      capable of assessing Lymphoedema in a larger population of Lymphoedema sufferers. The&#xD;
      Imp™SFB7+ (L-Dex U400) will be developed to assess patients with Lymphoedema in their arms or&#xD;
      their legs. The Imp™ XCA and Imp™ SFB7 are both TGA approved devices. The Imp™ SFB7+ (L-Dex&#xD;
      U400) is similar to the Imp™ SFB7 the changes are to the software and user interface.&#xD;

      When Lymphoedema is present, lymph and other fluids build up in the interstitial spaces of&#xD;
      the tissues. This results in an overall increase in the total amount of extracellular fluid&#xD;
      (ECF) in the limb, causing swelling. This can be documented by measuring the impedance&#xD;
      (opposition) to a low frequency current that has been passed into the limb. Low frequency&#xD;
      current travels predominantly through the ECF, where the Lymphoedema manifests. As the fluid&#xD;
      builds up in the limb, the impedance to the current decreases and it is in this way that low&#xD;
      frequency bioimpedance is able to assess Lymphoedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-frequency bio-impedance analysis otherwise known as Bioimpedance Spectroscopy (BIS) has&#xD;
      been reported to be effective for the measurement of ECF and sub clinical changes in ECF to&#xD;
      predict the onset of Lymphoedema in the arms in studies conducted by Cornish et al. It has&#xD;
      been reported by Warren et al that BIS can be used as a reliable and accurate tool for&#xD;
      documenting presence of lymphoedema in patients with wither upper- or lower-extremity&#xD;
      swelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Imp™ XCA device uses an &quot;impedance ratio&quot; methodology to assess unilateral Lymphoedema of&#xD;
      the arm. By this method the unaffected arm acts as an internal and subject specific control.&#xD;
      The Imp SFB7+ (L-Dex U400) uses the same principles but at a lower frequency. This study is&#xD;
      designed to show the equivalence of the 2 devices in assessing unilateral Lymphoedema of the&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
