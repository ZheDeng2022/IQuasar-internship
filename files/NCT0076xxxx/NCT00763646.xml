  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to determine the impact of chemotherapy on the ability of&#xD;
      your surgeon to completely remove the cancer as well as the impact on your survival.&#xD;
      Furthermore the investigators will be assessing the side effects of this chemotherapy&#xD;
      strategy. Finally the investigators will determine the ability of specialized imaging&#xD;
      technology (PET scan) to document and predict the response of the tumor to this chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard therapy for patients with your condition usually consists of surgery (removal of the&#xD;
      tumor) followed by combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy. More recently, standard options&#xD;
      available to patients with cancer of the stomach or lower esophagus have been expanded to&#xD;
      include chemotherapy without radiotherapy prior to and following surgery. While it is&#xD;
      believed that chemotherapy prior to surgery is a good option for patients with stomach, it is&#xD;
      not known what is the optimal chemotherapy regimen to offer patients prior to surgery to&#xD;
      improve the likelihood of cure while limiting side-effects to patients.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the stomach, gastroesophageal junction&#xD;
             (GEJ), or lower third of the esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The tumour must be deemed by the team to be potentially resectable. This includes&#xD;
             imaging studies (detailed below) to clinically stage the tumour and rule-out the&#xD;
             presence of metastatic disease, and includes a preoperative laparoscopic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stage IB (T1N1 only), II, IIIA, IIIB, and IV (T4N1 only)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy greater than 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 1 or better (i.e. restricted in physically strenuous&#xD;
             activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature,&#xD;
             e.g., light house work, office work).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate hematologic reserve: Platelet count 100,000/L, WBC 2000/Î¼L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine clearance 60 ml/min, AST &amp; ALT 2 ULN, Alkaline phosphatase 2.5 ULN,&#xD;
             bilirubin ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior systemic therapy for gastric cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior docetaxel-containing chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-existing medical conditions precluding treatment, including any contraindication&#xD;
             for major surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or lactating mothers. Women of childbearing age must use contraception&#xD;
             during and for 3 months following treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that are not able to maintain nutrition by oral consumption of food alone&#xD;
             must have additional enteral feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with macroscopic disease noted at laparoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 2 or higher&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant hearing impairment, as judged by the need for or use of a hearing aid. If&#xD;
             there is any uncertainty regarding the degree of hearing impairment, an audiogram will&#xD;
             be done. If the audiogram is grossly normal or shows only minor hearing impairment&#xD;
             (i.e. not requiring hearing aid), the patient may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwillingness to undergo investigations and/or treatment as outlined on the study&#xD;
