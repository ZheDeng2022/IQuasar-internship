  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion&#xD;
      tensor imaging (DTI) to assess for traumatic brain injury and determine if there is any&#xD;
      correlation of these findings to clinical outcome. MR spectroscopy using 2D-CSI (a multi&#xD;
      voxel technique) of the corpus callosum, basal ganglia, lobar white matter and brainstem may&#xD;
      reveal areas of injury and quantification of the metabolites from these areas may be used to&#xD;
      correlate with imaging findings and clinical evaluation. White matter disruption in these&#xD;
      areas is commonly seen after TBI, caused by diffuse axonal injury. It has been implicated in&#xD;
      the long term outcomes in these patients, but has been difficult to assess by standard&#xD;
      radiologic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By the use of DTI it may be possible to demonstrate damaged white matter tracts which could&#xD;
      be helpful in the evaluation of traumatic brain injury. Most TBI subjects have injuries that&#xD;
      involved torque to the brain. This results in a shearing injury to the long white matter&#xD;
      tracts, which has been hypothesized to be related to cognitive outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, to demonstrate that MRS and DTI prove valuable in predicting outcome in patients of&#xD;
      moderate brain trauma by conducting progressive studies acutely (within 24 hours) and long&#xD;
      term (4-6 weeks). Most patients will most likely be followed clinically for over a year, and,&#xD;
      if clinical indicated, farther scanning can be done at a later date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By comparing fraction anisotropy, ADC values, and metabolic ratios by the use of DTI and MRS&#xD;
      in the adult and pediatric populations, may help to assess differences in recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, a comparison between the two groups in changes in brain metabolism and/or white&#xD;
      matter tract disruption/re-connection after TBI with and/or without links to outcome can be&#xD;
      done.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to determine if MRI imaging can accurately detect the clinical&#xD;
      outcome (extent of recovery) of patients who have moderate to severe brain injury. This study&#xD;
      may show that MRI can provide a clearer picture on the extent of the brain injury and help&#xD;
      medical physicians decide how to best treat these patients with a more accurate idea of the&#xD;
      brain function of the recovering patient.&#xD;
