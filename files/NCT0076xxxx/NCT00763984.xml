  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this project is to determine the efficacy of an antenatal Bladder Health&#xD;
      class to prevent UI in a diverse sample of African American, Caucasian, and Hispanic&#xD;
      childbearing women. The determination of efficacy will be made at 12-months post index birth,&#xD;
      a time point that is a traditional benchmark of recovery from childbirth, using UI&#xD;
      incidence/severity as the primary outcome.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is significant because UI prevalence is 34% overall among US women, nearly half of&#xD;
      whom consider their incontinence to be moderately to extremely bothersome. UI is 2.0 to 2.6&#xD;
      fold greater in women after pregnancy and childbirth as compared to their never pregnant&#xD;
      counterparts, with the incidence increasing after each child. UI impact increases as women&#xD;
      age extending into middle and later life. The financial cost of UI in the United States&#xD;
      exceeds $19 billion per year . Other costs are identified in the Healthy People 2010 report&#xD;
      22 and include: 1) decreased activity/ fitness, which can be seriously affected because women&#xD;
      who are concerned about accidental leakage markedly curtail physical activity and 2)&#xD;
      increased depression, which has been linked to UI in women. Women are at least twice as&#xD;
      likely as men to have UI; pregnancy and childbirth are major explanatory factors. In&#xD;
      perimenopausal women, prevalence of any UI was 57% and of moderate to severe UI was 25%;&#xD;
      after controlling for age, race/ethnicity, menopausal status and body mass index, parity&#xD;
      persisted as a significant predictor of UI with an OR of 1.62 (CI 1.31, 2.01).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noninvasive interventions during the period of childbearing are of particular interest for UI&#xD;
      prevention in women. Two self-management practices recommended for the initial treatment of&#xD;
      UI are: Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), defined by the International Continence Society&#xD;
      as repetitive selective voluntary contraction and relaxation of specific pelvic floor&#xD;
      muscles, and bladder training (BT), defined as a program of scheduled voiding with gradually&#xD;
      progressive voiding intervals. The Knack Maneuver (a preemptive pelvic floor muscle&#xD;
      contraction to decrease stress UI and/or suppress urge UI) has demonstrated efficacy in older&#xD;
      women diagnosed with UI. In childbearing women, only PFMT has been tested with a rigorous RCT&#xD;
      design. We taught PFMT, the Knack, and BT as a combined strategy to older women and found a&#xD;
      two-fold prevention effect. The proposed project is innovative because it will be the first&#xD;
      to our knowledge to test the preventive capacity of an intervention in childbearing women&#xD;
      that combines PFMT, the Knack, and BT. This project is also innovative because it will be&#xD;
      conducted with a diverse sample of primiparous/multiparous women, using a 3-year follow-up&#xD;
      period. Because PFMT is the only self-management strategy that is currently recommended&#xD;
      practice for maternity patients, we will use PFMT adherence in comparisons between the&#xD;
      treatment and control conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Informed Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fliers specifying eligibility criteria and benefits of research participation will be&#xD;
      prominently displayed in the waiting areas and in the women's bathrooms of the respective&#xD;
      clinical sites. Potential participants will be invited to speak with a designated site-based&#xD;
      contact re: what participation in the study would entail. This individual will answer initial&#xD;
      questions, review written material that describes study participation, conduct verbal&#xD;
      screening, and obtain informed consent from eligible individuals. Eligible participants will&#xD;
      be scheduled for a clinic visit at the respective site for a clinic visit to obtain clinical&#xD;
      verification of no objective incontinence (negative standing stress test) and evidence of&#xD;
      ability to contract the pelvic floor correctly (digital measure). Following determination of&#xD;
      eligibility, participants will be randomized into control (routine care) or treatment&#xD;
      (scheduled for Bladder Health class) condition.&#xD;
