    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR) of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with best OR of confirmed CR or PR according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) relative to total number of evaluable participants for response. CR defined as disappearance of all target/non-target lesions. PR defined as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of the longest dimensions of target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions. Confirmed responses (CR and PR) were those that persisted on a follow-up imaging assessment greater than or equal to (≥)4 weeks after the initial objective documentation of response.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time in weeks from the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to progression or death due to progressive disease (PD). DR was calculated as (the date of the first documentation of PD or death due to PD minus the date of the first CR or PR that was subsequently confirmed plus 1). DR was calculated for the subgroup of participants with a confirmed objective tumor response (CR or PR).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Stable Disease (SD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time in weeks from start of treatment to date of objective disease progression (based on RECIST criteria). SD defined as neither sufficient shrinkage for PR nor sufficient increase for PD, taking as a reference the smallest sum of the longest dimensions since treatment start. Participants last known to be alive, not to have started new anticancer treatment, to be progression free, and who had a baseline and at least 1 on-study disease assessment were censored at date of last objective disease assessment that verified lack of PD. Participants who died not due to PD censored on death date.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time in weeks from date of enrollment to first documentation of PD, death due to any cause, symptomatic deterioration, or start of secondary anticancer therapy, whichever occurred first. PFS calculated as (first event date minus enrollment date plus 1). Documentation of progression determined from objective disease assessment based on RECIST criteria. PD defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the smallest sum of the longest dimensions recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) at 6 Months and at 1 Year</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Probability of being event-free (event defined as PD, death due to any cause, symptomatic deterioration, or start of secondary anticancer therapy) at 26 weeks and 52 weeks after the first dose of study treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time in weeks from the start date of enrollment to date of death due to any cause. OS was calculated as (the death date minus the enrollment date plus 1). Participants without death dates, last known to be alive were censored at last contact.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival at 6 Months and 1 Year</measure>

        <description>Percentage of participants with best OR of confirmed CR or PR according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) relative to total number of evaluable participants for response. CR defined as disappearance of all target/non-target lesions. PR defined as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of the longest dimensions of target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions. Confirmed responses (CR and PR) were those that persisted on a follow-up imaging assessment greater than or equal to (≥)4 weeks after the initial objective documentation of response.</description>

Participants who discontinued early before on-study tumor assessment due to PD were evaluable, but not if discontinued early due to reasons such as participant request, lack of compliance, or early toxicity.</population>

            <description>Participants with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) received dacomitinib 45 milligram (mg) tablets, orally, once daily (QD) continuously until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, withdrawal of consent, or death. There were no planned treatment breaks, each cycle was defined as 21 days for the purposes of scheduling. Dose reductions (in 15 mg increments) to a minimum of 15 mg QD were allowed; dose re-escalations were not allowed.</description>

          <description>Participants with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) received dacomitinib 45 milligram (mg) tablets, orally, once daily (QD) continuously until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, withdrawal of consent, or death. There were no planned treatment breaks, each cycle was defined as 21 days for the purposes of scheduling. Dose reductions (in 15 mg increments) to a minimum of 15 mg QD were allowed; dose re-escalations were not allowed.</description>
