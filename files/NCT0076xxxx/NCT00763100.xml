  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are three main objectives, centering on those patients targeted for surveillance&#xD;
      imaging. The first objective is to compare image quality and specificity of breast&#xD;
      tomosynthesis and conventional 2D mammography in a BIRADS 3 diagnostic population. The second&#xD;
      objective is to compare image quality and ability to determine post-surgical and&#xD;
      post-radiation changes from recurrence in a post-cancer subset of a BIRADS 3 population&#xD;
      having undergone conservation therapy (lumpectomy with or without radiation. The final&#xD;
      objective is to compare image quality and the ability to determine chemoresponsiveness in a&#xD;
      post-cancer subset of a BIRADS 3 population, who are undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;

        Three groups of patients will be enrolled:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group 1 will enroll patients that have been categorized as a BIRADS 3 on the basis of&#xD;
        screening and diagnostic conventional imaging work-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group II will enroll patients that have been categorized as a BIRADS 3 for surveillance&#xD;
        imaging because they have undergone breast conservation therapy for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group III will enroll patients that have been categorized as a BIRADS 3 for surveillance&#xD;
        imaging because they are currently undergoing primary systemic therapy.&#xD;
