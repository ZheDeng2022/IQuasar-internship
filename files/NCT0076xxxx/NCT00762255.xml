  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the this study is to see if an investigations cancer treatment called&#xD;
      vorinostat can be combined with the irinotecan/bevacizumab regimen safely.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Drug Administration: (A cycle is 28 days) Irinotecan and bevacizumab are given IV on days 1&#xD;
      and 15 of each cycle. Vorinostat is given orally on days 1-7 and 15-21 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vorinostat (provided in 100mg capsules) begins at a dose of 200mg/day, escalating to&#xD;
      300mg/day and then to a maximum of 400mg/day. Vorinostat will be taken prior to irinotecan&#xD;
      and bevacizumab on days 1 and 15. The drug should be administered at the same time every day&#xD;
      for days 2-7 and 16-21. Patients will be treated prophylactically with compazine 30 minutes&#xD;
      prior to vorinostat which, in turn, should be taken 30 minutes prior to a meal whenever&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irinotecan is given at a dose of 125mg/m². Bevacizumab is given at a dose of 10mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be defined by toxicities occurring during the first 4 weeks&#xD;
      of therapy. Three patients will be treated at dose level one and can be enrolled&#xD;
      simultaneously. They must be observed for dose limiting toxicities (DLT) for at least 4 weeks&#xD;
      from treatment day 1. Page 15 of the protocol outlines the dose escalation parameters. At&#xD;
      least 9 patients will be treated at the MTD. If DLT is not achieved in any cohort of up to a&#xD;
      dose level of 400mg/day of vorinostat, further dose escalations will not be made. This dose&#xD;
      will then become the recommended dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients demonstrating evidence of benefit may be treated up to a maximum of 24 cycles, at&#xD;
      the investigator's discretion.&#xD;
