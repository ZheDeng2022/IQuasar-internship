    <textblock>
      This is an open label, Phase II, multi-center study designed to evaluate the effect of AVR118&#xD;
      when administered to patients with systemic symptoms related to recurrent or metastatic&#xD;
      cancers who may or may not be undergoing anti-cancer treatment. During the initial, induction&#xD;
      treatment phase of the study, AVR118, 4.0 mL, will be given subcutaneously each day for 28&#xD;
      days. Patients who respond to the trial period dosing will be eligible to continue on AVR118&#xD;
      if they and their physicians believe it would be beneficial, and if no safety concerns are&#xD;
      raised.&#xD;
