  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SMOKN5 is aimed at studying ways to reduce environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) for children who&#xD;
      are being treated for cancer. The study includes St. Jude parents whose child lives with at&#xD;
      least one adult smoker who exposes the child to ETS, also called &quot;secondhand smoke.&quot; We are&#xD;
      comparing two groups of parents to see which group results in lower ETS exposure levels for&#xD;
      the child being treated with cancer. The first group will receive the standard information&#xD;
      and advice usually given to parents about secondhand smoke. The second group will take part&#xD;
      in a new program designed to reduce ETS. The primary objective of the study is to determine&#xD;
      the efficacy of an environmental tobacco smoke intervention compared to the standard care&#xD;
      control condition, as measured by parent report. Parents in each group answer questions about&#xD;
      ETS exposure. We also collect urine samples from the child at specific time points throughout&#xD;
      the study. The urine is tested to measure the amount of cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine.&#xD;
      Measuring cotinine tells us how much nicotine from tobacco smoke the child has been exposed&#xD;
      to. Children who are at least 10 years of age or older will also be asked to complete a set&#xD;
      of questions pertaining to their tobacco use history and ETS exposure from others. This will&#xD;
      occur at the same five time points in which the parent completes his/her portion. The study&#xD;
      will last about 12 months for each participating family. Parents who take part in the study&#xD;
      may learn how to lower their child's exposure to ETS, and this may, in turn, lower the&#xD;
      child's chances of having ETS-related health problems.&#xD;

      160 St. Jude families with a cancer patient who meets eligibility criteria will be enrolled&#xD;
      on the study. Eligible St. Jude patients must be 17 years of age or younger at the time of&#xD;
      enrollment. They must also be at least one month from initial diagnosis and in active&#xD;
      treatment. The patient cannot currently be using tobacco, and he/she must live with at least&#xD;
      one cigarette smoking adult who smokes in his/her presence. Both smoking and non-smoking&#xD;
      parents are eligible to participate. The inclusion of non-smoking parents reflects the&#xD;
      primary objective of the proposed study to reduce ETS exposure in the child's environment. We&#xD;
      will evaluate the efficacy of an ETS intervention by using a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      design that incorporates an experimental intervention group (ETS) and a standard care control&#xD;
      group (SCC). Parents in the SCC group will receive the standard advice with no additional&#xD;
      intervention. The experimental group will participate in a three month, multi-component&#xD;
      behavioral program focused on the reduction of the cancer patient's ETS exposure. The program&#xD;
      will consist of three bi-weekly face-to-face coaching sessions followed by three bi-weekly&#xD;
      telephone coaching sessions that will occur within the first three months following&#xD;
      enrollment onto the study. Although telephone counseling sessions will be offered for parents&#xD;
      who are not available in person, the face-to-face sessions are encouraged as much as&#xD;
      possible. Parents in this group will receive physician feedback letters acknowledging their&#xD;
      participation and progress at the start and end of the coaching phase, as well as, a&#xD;
      follow-up telephone contact at five months. Self-report and biological measures will be&#xD;
      obtained from all families during clinic visits at baseline and at three, six, nine, and&#xD;
      twelve months. Reported ETS exposure and the child's urine cotinine levels will serve as the&#xD;
      primary dependent variables. Other psychosocial and health outcomes will also be assessed.&#xD;
      Children 10 years of age and older will complete a brief ETS exposure questionnaire that asks&#xD;
      them to report on exposure in their environment. Parents in each group will be paid $10 for&#xD;
      each set of study forms they answer. The total amount that a parent in the control group may&#xD;
      receive is $50. Parents in the ETS intervention program will also receive $12.50 for each&#xD;
      face-to-face and telephone coaching session in which they take part. The telephone follow-up&#xD;
      call occurring at five months will not be compensated. The total amount that a parent in the&#xD;
      ETS intervention group may receive is $125. Patients will receive a $10 hospital gift voucher&#xD;
      for each urine sample they provide. The total amount that a patient may receive is $50 to&#xD;
      $60. At the end of the study, parents who were assigned to the standard advice control group&#xD;
      may receive the ETS intervention program without charge, if they so choose. Also, parents in&#xD;
      both groups may choose to receive feedback about their child's urine cotinine results at the&#xD;
      completion of the study.&#xD;
