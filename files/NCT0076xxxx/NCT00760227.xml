  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the proposed project is to evaluate the impact of a health promotion&#xD;
      intervention for children undergoing bone marrow or stem cell transplant (BMT). The&#xD;
      intervention is complementary in nature, designed to increase the experience of positive&#xD;
      affect and reduce somatic distress and mood disturbance, that is, to improve overall child&#xD;
      well-being. The study will utilize a positive psychology model, exploring the hypothesis that&#xD;
      improved outcomes will be mediated by the increased experience of positive affect states&#xD;
      brought about by the intervention. The primary focus is on a child-targeted intervention that&#xD;
      includes massage therapy and humor therapy. The study will also assess whether the addition&#xD;
      of a similar parent-targeted intervention involving massage therapy and relaxation training&#xD;
      will provide significant benefits beyond those provided by the child-targeted intervention&#xD;
      alone. The study will utilize a 3-group design, with participants randomized to receive:1) a&#xD;
      child-targeted intervention (HPI-C); 2) a child targeted intervention plus a parent-targeted&#xD;
      intervention (HPI-CP); 3) standard care (SC). Primary outcomes include child positive affect,&#xD;
      somatic distress and mood disturbance, as well as measures of parental positive affect and&#xD;
      distress. Additional objectives of the study include examining the impact of the intervention&#xD;
      on short-term medical outcomes, as well as measures of child health-related quality of life&#xD;
      and parent and child post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) at 6 months post-BMT. Analyses&#xD;
      will explore hypotheses specific to the positive psychology model, testing the role of&#xD;
      positive affect and dispositional optimism as mediators and moderators of the intervention on&#xD;
      child and parent well-being. We will also obtain pilot data examining the effect of the&#xD;
      interventions on neuroendocrine and neuroimmune markers of stress.&#xD;

      Treatment Plan: Interventions involve 3 components, Massage Therapy, Humor Therapy, and&#xD;
      Relaxation Therapy, as described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Massage Therapy Patient and parents will meet with a licensed massage therapist at the time&#xD;
      of admission. During the session, the therapist will introduce them to the rationale of the&#xD;
      massage intervention before moving on to provide the initial massage session. Each session&#xD;
      will last approximately 1/2 hour. Massage sessions will be scheduled 3x/week from admission&#xD;
      through week +3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Humor Therapy For this component will utilize a humor cart, stocked with humorous video&#xD;
      shorts, books, gags, props and games.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relaxation Therapy In the initial session held near the time of admission, parents will meet&#xD;
      with the RA therapist, who will describe relaxation response and the benefits of a regular&#xD;
      practice of relaxation techniques. They will be led through a modified progressive muscle&#xD;
      relaxation induction, using breath awareness and muscle release, followed by guided imagery.&#xD;
