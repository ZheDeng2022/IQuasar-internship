  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous cross-sectional studies have demonstrated that blood pressure (BP) measurements at&#xD;
      home (HBP) in the morning offer stronger predictive power for micro- and macrovascular&#xD;
      complications in patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes than casual/clinic blood pressure&#xD;
      measurements (CBP). The present study examined which of HBP or CBP provides the stronger&#xD;
      predictive power for outcomes by comparing cumulative events between hypertensive and&#xD;
      normotensive patients over 6 years in a prospective, longitudinal study of patients with type&#xD;
      2 diabetes.&#xD;

      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      １.Subjects. After a detailed baseline examination, 400 Japanese subjects were followed up for&#xD;
      all-cause mortality and morbidity. All participants visited our clinic regularly. Mean survey&#xD;
      duration of all patients was 42.1±20.0 months (range, 3-72 months).Type 2 diabetes was&#xD;
      diagnosed according to World Health Organization criteria.At the beginning of the study, 329&#xD;
      patients(82%)were receiving treatment with oral hypoglycemic drugs and/or insulin regimens&#xD;
      for diabetes mellitus and 196 patients (49%) were receiving treatment with various&#xD;
      anti-hypertensive drugs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor&#xD;
      blockers, calcium channel blocker and others) for hypertension. Mean disease duration was&#xD;
      13±8 years (range, 0-40 years). Mean values for other baseline measurements were as follows:&#xD;
      BMI,23.7±3.4 kg/m2;HbA1c,6.7±1.1%; triglycerides,150±112 mg/dl;total cholesterol,198±32&#xD;
      mg/dl; LDL,110±29 mg/dl; and HDL,60±19 mg/dl.All patients were fully informed about the&#xD;
      purposes and procedures for the study and provided oral consent at enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Baseline and follow-up assessment. Participants were examined using the same methods&#xD;
      reported previously (1,2). Briefly, all chemical laboratory data were obtained at each visit&#xD;
      without fasting in the morning. BP was measured in the clinic and at home on waking in the&#xD;
      morning. Clinic hypertension (CH) and morning hypertension (MH) were defined as systolic BP&#xD;
      (SBP)&gt;=130 mmHg and/or diastolic BP (DBP)&gt;=85 mmHg, while clinic normotension (CN) and&#xD;
      morning normotension (MN) were defined as SBP &lt;130 mmHg and DBP &lt;86 mmHg, respectively.&#xD;
      Microalbuminuria and clinical albuminuria were defined as urinary albumin excretion rate &gt;=30&#xD;
      mg/g creatinine and &gt;=300 mg/g creatinine, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microvascular complications were checked for at baseline and every 3 to 6 months throughout&#xD;
      the study. Severity of nephropathy was determined using 4 categories: normal;&#xD;
      microalbuminuria; clinical albuminuria; and dialysis. Severity of retinopathy was categorized&#xD;
      as: normal; non-proliferative retinopathy; pre-proliferative retinopathy; and proliferative&#xD;
      retinopathy. Development of changing microvascular events defined according to a change of at&#xD;
      least 1 step from baseline (3,4). Macrovascular complications were coronary heart disease&#xD;
      (CHD) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD). These events were confirmed by medical history,&#xD;
      including contents of treatment. New or worsened (recurrent) events were defined based on&#xD;
      clinical manifestations and treatment throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, HT or NTs were determined on the basis of HBP and CBP measurements. Based on&#xD;
      HBP, subjects were divided into MH and MN patients, and each endpoint was determined within&#xD;
      the survey duration, as defined by the patient displaying sustenance of the same BP status.&#xD;
      That is, survey duration varied between individual patients and was defined as the period of&#xD;
      time until an MH patient at baseline displayed a change to MN, or until an MN patient at&#xD;
      baseline displayed a change to MH. Mean survey duration until endpoints was 29.5±21.1&#xD;
      months(range, 3-72 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, based on CBP, subjects were divided into CH and CN patients. These patients were&#xD;
      followed using the same methods used for MH and MN. Mean survey duration until endpoints was&#xD;
      34.9±22.3 months (range,3-72 months), which was significantly longer than that based on HBP&#xD;
      (P&lt;0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For ethical reasons, patients were treated with various anti-hypertensive, anti-diabetic,&#xD;
      anti-dyslipidemia and/or anti-hypercoagulation agents during the course of the study by the&#xD;
      patients'own doctors as a part of continuing standard medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Study endpoints and outcome measures. The primary endpoint was death from any cause.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints were new, worsened or improved microvascular events and new or worsened&#xD;
      macrovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline. Mean values were compared using Student's paired or unpaired t test. To&#xD;
           compare the prevalence of micro- and macrovascular complications or medical treatment in&#xD;
           patients with and without hypertension on the basis of HBP or CBP, Fischer's exact test&#xD;
           with two-tailed P values was used, and then odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI)&#xD;
           were calculated. If prevalence of an event was zero, 0.5 was added to all values before&#xD;
           calculating the odds ratio and 95% CI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Endpoints and outcome measures. Differences in outcomes for each endpoint of death and&#xD;
           new or worsened micro- and macrovascular complications between sustained hypertensive&#xD;
           and normotensive patients on the basis of HBP or CBP were assessed using survival curves&#xD;
           calculated according to Kaplan-Meier methods, then compared by hazard ratio using the&#xD;
           log-rank test. Within the survey time defined above, a time until censoring or death (or&#xD;
           occurrence of the event) was calculated for each endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Risk factor assessment for outcomes. Risk factors related to outcomes determined&#xD;
           statistically by log-rank test were assessed using hazard ratios by Cox proportional&#xD;
           hazards model. For outcomes of microvascular complications, risk factors were determined&#xD;
           in new, worsened or improved events. Omnibus tests were used to determine the&#xD;
           appropriateness of Cox proportional hazards modeling. Confounding factors used in this&#xD;
           analysis were variables with MH or CH at baseline and additional therapy for each&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis was performed using Prism version 5.01 software (GraphPad Software, CA, USA) and the&#xD;
      Dr. SPSSII for Windows (SPSS Japan, Tokyo, Japan). Two-tailed values of P&lt;0.05 were defined&#xD;
      as statistically significant.&#xD;
