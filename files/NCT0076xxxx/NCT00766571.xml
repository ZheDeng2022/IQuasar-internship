      This study will explore the medical problems in patients with VACTERL association and&#xD;
      identify gene changes that might be responsible for them. VACTERL association can affect many&#xD;
      parts of the body, including the bones of the spine, the heart, the lower intestinal tract,&#xD;
      the connection between the trachea and esophagus, the kidneys and the arms. Information from&#xD;
      this study may lead to a better understanding of the disease and improved treatment and&#xD;
      genetic counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with VACTERL association and their parents and siblings may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for evaluation over 3 to 4 days that may&#xD;
      include the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination, medical history, electrocardiogram (EKG), blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging studies (echocardiogram, x-rays and ultrasound tests)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other specialized tests or consultations as indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional medical photographs of the face and other body parts that may be involved in&#xD;
           VACTERL association for publication in scientific texts or for teaching purposes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional return visit after 2 years for repeat testing and to look for changes over time&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents of patients have the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination, medical history, blood tests and x-rays, if needed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specialty consultations as indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional medical photographs of the face and other body parts that may be involved in&#xD;
           VACTERL association for publication in scientific texts or for teaching purposes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires about their child s medical history, growth, behavior and development,&#xD;
           therapy and medication&#xD;
&#xD;
      Siblings of patients have the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination, medical history and blood tests&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The combination of vertebral defects, anal atresia, cardiac anomalies, tracheo-esophageal&#xD;
      fistula, radial dysplasia and limb anomalies, and renal anomalies, termed VACTERL&#xD;
      association, has been used as a clinical descriptor for a specific group of phenotypic&#xD;
      manifestations that have been observed to occur together. Depending upon the diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria used, the prevalence may be as high as 1 in 6000 live births. VACTERL association is&#xD;
      felt to be due to defects in early embryogenesis, and is likely to be genetically&#xD;
      heterogeneous. The purpose of the present study is to increase the understanding of the&#xD;
      clinical manifestations and genetic causes of VACTERL association through detailed physical,&#xD;
      laboratory, and radiological studies. We also plan to examine the spectrum of clinical&#xD;
      characteristics in VACTERL association to facilitate early diagnosis and clinical management,&#xD;
      including genetic counseling. To accomplish this, we plan to enroll approximately&#xD;
      25-50affected individuals along with their family members for a total of 75-150 total&#xD;
      individuals each year, with an enrollment ceiling of 500 affected individuals. Patients and&#xD;
      their families will be seen at the NIH clinical center.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        (A) For affected individuals, determination of clinical criteria for inclusion will be&#xD;
        determined by prior medical record review before participation. Inclusion criteria may be&#xD;
        met in 1 of 3 ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. At least 3 features of VACTERL association in an index case OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Two features of VACTERL association in an index case plus at least 1 feature of&#xD;
             VACTERL association in a relative OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. At least 2 features of VACTERL association in an index case plus at least 1 other&#xD;
             anomaly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        (B) First degree relatives (parents and/or siblings of affected individuals) of patients&#xD;
        with VACTERL association are also eligible to participate in portions of the protocol even&#xD;
        if they have no features of VACTERL association.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Anyone unwilling to provide informed consent (for themselves as adults, or on behalf&#xD;
             of their children as minors, or on behalf of an adult who is unable to provide consent&#xD;
             for themselves) or assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Cases that are clearly not in the spectrum of VACTERL association or related to our&#xD;
             direct research interests (e.g. referred VACTERL cases that are felt to be related to&#xD;
             other syndromes, such as Feingold syndrome, Townes-Brocks syndrome, or Pallister-Hall&#xD;
             syndrome, would not be included). In such instances, we would attempt to make&#xD;
             referrals to a more appropriate investigator.&#xD;
