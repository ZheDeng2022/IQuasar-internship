  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To characterize the pharmacokinetics of diphenhydramine in two pediatric populations:&#xD;
      children, ages 2 to &lt; 12 years, and adolescents, ages 12 to &lt; 18 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has an open-label, single-dose classical pharmacokinetic design with no comparator&#xD;
      treatment or group. Twenty-four (24) children, ages 2 to &lt; 12 years, and 12 adolescents, ages&#xD;
      12 to &lt; 18 years, with symptoms due to hay fever or other upper respiratory allergies will&#xD;
      complete the study. To ensure that younger children are represented, at least 35% (8) of the&#xD;
      children enrolled will range from 2 to &lt; 6 years of age.&#xD;
