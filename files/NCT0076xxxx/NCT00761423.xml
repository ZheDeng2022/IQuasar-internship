      Introduction- Overuse injury of the Achilles tendon is a common entity in athletes and older&#xD;
      athletes are at an increased risk. When the exact origin of tendon pain is unclear, the term&#xD;
      tendinopathy is preferred. Most accepted treatment at this moment is an eccentric exercise&#xD;
      programme, according to the Dutch guidelines. However, a recent systematic review on the&#xD;
      effectiveness of eccentric exercises to treat lower extremity tendinoses concluded that it is&#xD;
      unclear whether eccentric exercises are more effective than other forms of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies described new treatment strategies in tendinopathies, such as the use of&#xD;
      platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Platelets can participate actively in tissue repair processes and&#xD;
      stimulate the release of several growth factors. Recently, it was found that platelet-rich&#xD;
      plasma clot releasate stimulates cell proliferation, collagen deposition, and enhances the&#xD;
      gene expression of matrix degrading enzymes and endogenous growth factors by human tendon&#xD;
      cells in vitro. The only published clinical cohort study in tendon research reported 93%&#xD;
      reduction of pain for PRP-treated patients with chronic elbow tendinosis. Also on short term&#xD;
      follow-up, the PRP injection was more beneficial than injection with an anaesthetic agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim- To monitor the potential clinical improvement of chronic midportion Achilles&#xD;
      tendinopathy after injection with PRP and to evaluate the recovery process in time using a&#xD;
      new Ultrasonographic method (Ultrasonographic Tissue Characterisation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The average VISA-A score is higher in the patient group treated with eccentric&#xD;
      exercise therapy in combination with a PRP injection in comparison with the group treated&#xD;
      with a saline injection in combination with eccentric exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population- In total, 54 patients with symptomatic Achilles tendinopathy will be&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design- The study will be a double-blind randomised single-centre clinical trial&#xD;
      comparing 2 treatment groups. The researcher, the sports medicine physician and the patients&#xD;
      will be blinded to the received therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy- All patients will perform a heavy load eccentric exercise programme, consisting of&#xD;
      180 repetitions daily. The patients will be randomised into 2 treatment groups: ultrasound&#xD;
      guided intratendinous saline injection with eccentric exercises and ultrasound guided&#xD;
      intratendinous PRP injection with eccentric exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up- Follow-up (clinically and ultrasonographically) will be at 6, 12, 24 and 52 weeks.&#xD;
      At 24 weeks, the researcher will be unblinded after the analysis of the preliminary data. The&#xD;
      patients will remain blinded to the therapy until 52 weeks follow-up. At 52 weeks follow-up a&#xD;
      second, blinded researcher will evaluate the patients using the primary and secondary outcome&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurements- Primary outcome measurement: VISA-A score, a validated instrument to&#xD;
      detect the severity of symptoms in patients with Achilles tendinopathy. As secondary outcome&#xD;
      measurements subjective patient satisfaction and return to sports will be rated. For the&#xD;
      evaluation of tendon repair, Ultrasonographic Tissue Characterization (UTC) and Power Doppler&#xD;
      ultrasound (PDU) will be performed. UTC was previously developed in horse tendons and&#xD;
      provides quantitative information on tendon fiber alignment and the related ultra-structural&#xD;
      integrity of the tendon tissue through a non-invasive approach.&#xD;
