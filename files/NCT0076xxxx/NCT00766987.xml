      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a non-invasive, unique nuclear imaging technique that&#xD;
      allows the evaluation of blood flow in the heart and provides information about the cell&#xD;
      activity of specific organs such as the heart and brain. It also provides useful information&#xD;
      for the management of patients with poor pumping function of the heart, heart failure, and&#xD;
      coronary artery disease. A cardiac viability imaging looks at how the heart uses glucose&#xD;
      (sugar) The imaging process determines areas of the heart that are alive (viable - using&#xD;
      sugar) versus areas of the heart that are scar tissue (non-viable). F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose&#xD;
      (FDG) is the radioactive substance used to determine myocardial viability. This nuclear&#xD;
      imaging technique has been shown to be useful in directing management for patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ministry of Health recognizes the clinical utility of FDG PET imaging for myocardial&#xD;
      viability assessment and other cancer indications. Optimizing the potential advantages of FDG&#xD;
      PET in Ontario, will require characterization of the patient population, referral patterns,&#xD;
      upstream and downstream resource utilization and patient outcomes. Therefore, registry&#xD;
      studies are being undertaken to provide specific information about the utility of PET in&#xD;
      these clinical situations in Ontario. The proposed registry will facilitate monitoring of the&#xD;
      implementation of this limited technology and allow continued evaluation of practice patterns&#xD;
      and outcomes. The University of Ottawa Heart Institute is the coordinating centre for this&#xD;
      project with PET centres in London, Hamilton and Toronto also participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of FDG PET viability imaging in the&#xD;
      decision making process for patients with poor left ventricular function who may be&#xD;
      candidates for revascularization and to study the downstream effect of the clinical&#xD;
      management decisions. Patients meeting specific inclusion criteria will be eligible for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure from reduced left ventricular function is associated with significant morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality and although there have been multiple trials involving medical and devices&#xD;
      therapies that have shown improved survival, the overall mortality remains high. Therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention studies involving transplantation and revascularization concluded that patients&#xD;
      with viable myocardium can be revascularized but this approach is often not adopted because&#xD;
      of high peri-operative morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to these factors there is a need for a better approach to define and select patients with&#xD;
      severe ventricular dysfunction. FDG PET studies to date have consistently shown that patients&#xD;
      with viable myocardium on FDG PET are at high risk for other cardiac events and death if they&#xD;
      do not undergo timely revascularization. FDG PET viability data has had an impact on decision&#xD;
      making in patients with severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and the benefits of early&#xD;
      revascularization have been seen in patients with ischemic viable myocardium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accuracy of FDG PET to predict regional and global LV function recovery, its utility in&#xD;
      decision making and ability to identify high risk patients have all been demonstrated. These&#xD;
      findings all support a clinical role for FDG PET in assessing select patients with CAD and&#xD;
      severe LV function. The Cardiac FDG PET Registry (CADRE) will provide specific information&#xD;
      about the utility of PET in clinical situations. To our knowledge this is the largest&#xD;
      multi-centre FDG PET myocardial viability registry. The registry will facilitate monitoring&#xD;
      of and evaluation of practise patterns, upstream and downstream resource utilization&#xD;
      (diagnostic imaging and revascularization) and outcomes as they relate to the severity of the&#xD;
      abnormalities detected. The impact of FDG PET parameters on outcome measures will be compared&#xD;
      to other clinical parameters. These findings will optimize the implementation of this&#xD;
      technology in clinical practise in Ontario and further identify parameters that with FDG PET&#xD;
      predict adverse outcomes for specific patient populations. The results of this registry will&#xD;
      impact clinical practise and health care for patients in Ontario and internationally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Research Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop a registry of patients undergoing FDG PET for the assessment of myocardial&#xD;
           viability&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the upstream and downstream resource utilization (diagnostic imaging and&#xD;
           revascularization) in patients undergoing FDG PET&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the outcome of patients undergoing PET imaging and relate this outcome to&#xD;
           the severity of the abnormalities detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the impact of FDG PET parameters on outcome measures compared to other&#xD;
           clinical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Consent will be obtained from all eligible subjects. Data will be collected in a&#xD;
      prospective manner to evaluate patients, who meet inclusion criteria, undergoing cardiac PET&#xD;
      imaging. Physicians in Ontario will be notified via the Ontario Medical association (OMA)and&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Care Network that FDG PET viability imaging is clinically available for&#xD;
      appropriate patients through the provincial registry. The participating registry sites as&#xD;
      well as indications for FDG PET viability imaging will be circulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health Canada requires that all patients undergoing imaging with positron emitting&#xD;
      radiopharmaceuticals (PERs) must partake in a research protocol, therefore for those patients&#xD;
      who do not wish to participate in the CADRE study, a second consent is provided for the&#xD;
      collection of baseline safety data only, ie imaging parameters, tracer dose and adverse&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
