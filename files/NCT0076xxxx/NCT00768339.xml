    <textblock>
      AEG35156 has shown early evidence of activity in patients with advanced indolent B-cell&#xD;
      lymphomas in Phase 1 trials and merits further evaluation in this disease. This trial is&#xD;
      designed to determine the recommended dose of AEG35156 in patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and indolent B-cell lymphomas.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Apoptotic induction in cancer cells is a sought after therapeutic goal. Most successful&#xD;
      anticancer agents activate apoptosis pathways in the cancers they treat. Apoptotic pathways&#xD;
      in cells appear to converge on a single family of enzymes, the caspases, which are proteases&#xD;
      that dismantle the cell in an orderly, non-inflammatory fashion, resulting in cell death. The&#xD;
      X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis (XIAP) is the only known cellular inhibitor of caspases, its&#xD;
      over expression thereby blocking the principal means of apoptosis. A wide range of evidence&#xD;
      indicates that cellular overexpression of members of the IAP family is a fundamental means by&#xD;
      which many cancer cells evade death, even in the presence of strong extrinsic (death&#xD;
      receptor-mediated) and intrinsic (mitochondria-mediated) apoptotic cues. The inhibition of&#xD;
      cellular XIAP activity, specifically in cancer cells under stress and primed for apoptosis by&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agents, is viewed as a powerful means of tipping the balance towards cell&#xD;
      death. In particular, XIAP has been shown to be overexpressed in lymphoma. AEG35156 is a&#xD;
      second generation antisense which targets XIAP mRNA to lower XIAP levels and the apoptotic&#xD;
      threshold of cancer cells, enhancing their sensitivity to intrinsic death and chemotherapy.&#xD;
      AEG35156 has shown early evidence of activity in patients with advanced indolent B-cell&#xD;
      lymphomas in Phase 1 trials and merits further evaluation in this disease.&#xD;
