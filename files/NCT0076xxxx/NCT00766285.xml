  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza is a common infection of the upper airways and lungs, and is caused by viruses.&#xD;
      Cancer patients may need a stronger influenza vaccine than the general population to protect&#xD;
      against influenza. The experimental vaccine is designed to be 9 times stronger than the&#xD;
      standard vaccine, which may cause a stronger immune response against influenza in patients&#xD;
      with a weakened immune system. The goal of this study is to compare the effects of a new&#xD;
      experimental influenza vaccine to the effects of the standard influenza vaccine. One hundred&#xD;
      bone marrow recipients, adult volunteers from the MD Anderson Cancer Center, 18 years of age&#xD;
      or older, will participate in this study. They will be randomly (by chance) assigned to&#xD;
      receive 2 doses of either the standard licensed influenza vaccine or the experimental&#xD;
      influenza vaccine. Participants will be asked to complete 5 study visits and 3 telephone&#xD;
      contacts. Study procedures include blood draws. The duration of participation is about 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

      Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) patients are immunocompromised to a varying degree&#xD;
      depending upon genetic relationship between donor and recipient with compromising therapy&#xD;
      required for allogeneic transplants. Responses to influenza vaccine in this population have&#xD;
      been poor and yet influenza virus infection can lead to serious disease. There is a need for&#xD;
      prophylaxis against influenza in this population. One approach to improving immune responses&#xD;
      to influenza vaccines in BMT patients could be to increase dosage and number of doses of&#xD;
      vaccine. This approach has increased responses in a variety of populations. Moreover, using&#xD;
      purified hemagglutinin (HA) vaccines in the form of rDNA-expressed HA protein in a&#xD;
      baculovirus expression system has increased immune responses without an increase in&#xD;
      reactogenicity. Researchers hypothesize that an increased dosage and 2 doses of a purified&#xD;
      influenza vaccine will increase serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neutralizing&#xD;
      antibody responses significantly over those following 2 doses of conventional vaccine in BMT&#xD;
      patients. The primary objective of this study is to determine if 2 doses of a&#xD;
      baculovirus-expressed recombinant trivalent influenza vaccine containing approximately 135&#xD;
      mcg per HA results in a significantly higher proportion of subjects achieving a Day 28 and&#xD;
      Day 56 post vaccination increase in serum HAI and neutralizing antibody titer than seen after&#xD;
      immunization with standard dose licensed trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine in&#xD;
      immunosuppressed allogeneic HSCT (hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) recipients. The&#xD;
      secondary objective is determination of the safety and tolerability of a two-dose regimen of&#xD;
      recombinant, baculovirus-expressed HA containing approximately 135 mcg per HA administered by&#xD;
      intramuscular injection to patients following allogeneic HSCT, and comparison of the&#xD;
      geometric mean titers (GMT) of serum HAI and neutralizing antibody against all 3 virus&#xD;
      strains contained in the vaccine. The study will enroll 100 adult (greater than or equal to&#xD;
      18 years of age) allogeneic HSCT recipients between 6 and 12 months following bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation, with no or stable chronic graft-versus-host disease, who are evaluated at&#xD;
      the outpatient BMT clinic at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either licensed trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or&#xD;
      baculovirus-expressed recombinant trivalent hemagglutinin vaccine (rHA0). All injections will&#xD;
      be administered into the deltoid muscle. Subjects will be randomized (50 per group) to&#xD;
      receive a vaccination on Day 0 and a second dose 4 weeks later. Subjects will be observed in&#xD;
      the clinic for at least 20 minutes after inoculation, and subjects will maintain a memory aid&#xD;
      to record oral temperature and solicited systemic and local adverse events (AE)s for 8 days&#xD;
      (Day 0 through Day 7) after each immunization. Subjects will be seen on Day 2 and Day 30 (1-5&#xD;
      days after each vaccination) for an arm check, vital signs, assessment of possible AEs,&#xD;
      concomitant medication assessment, and a targeted physical examination if indicated. Subjects&#xD;
      will be contacted by phone on Day 8 and Day 36 (7-10 days after each vaccination) to review&#xD;
      the memory aid and to assess for possible AEs or serious (S) AEs. Subjects will return to the&#xD;
      clinic on Day 28 for AE and concomitant medication assessment, a targeted physical&#xD;
      examination if indicated, and a review of the memory aid prior to receiving the second dose&#xD;
      of vaccine. Serum for vaccine immunogenicity evaluations will be collected prior to&#xD;
      vaccination at Days 0 and 28, and 56 days after the first vaccine dose. Participants will be&#xD;
      involved in study related procedures for 6 months.&#xD;
