    <textblock>
      The study is for Korean women who are postmenopausal and also suffer from osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will test if women who are given 20 mg of arzoxifene once a day for six months have&#xD;
      a less severe level of osteoporosis than those women who do not take arzoxifene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive 500 mg of elemental calcium and 400 to 600 IU Vitamin D daily&#xD;
      starting 4 weeks prior to study drug administration continuing through the 6 months of&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Present with osteoporosis based on total hip, femoral neck or lumbar spine BMD T-score&#xD;
             of less than or equal to -2.5 but must never have had any osteoporotic fragility&#xD;
             fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are ambulatory and are 60 to 85 years of age, inclusive. Aside from diagnosed&#xD;
             osteoporosis (Inclusion Criterion [1]), all women must be free of severe or&#xD;
             chronically disabling conditions, have a life expectancy of at least 5 years in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, be expected to remain ambulatory throughout the entire&#xD;
             study, and be expected to return for follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had their last natural menstrual period at least 2 years before beginning the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are able to comprehend the requirements and procedures for the study and to provide&#xD;
             informed consent before entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have at least two lumbar vertebrae (L1 to L4) that are evaluable via dual energy X-ray&#xD;
             absorptiometry (DXA) and lateral thoracic and lumbar spine x-ray films that can be&#xD;
             adequately evaluated for existing vertebral fractures at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have centrally read total hip, femoral neck or lumbar spine T-score less than or equal&#xD;
             to -2.5&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have known current metabolic bone disorders other than low bone mass, such as&#xD;
             hyperparathyroidism, renal osteodystrophy, or osteomalacia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have known, suspected, or history of carcinoma of the breast or estrogen-dependent&#xD;
             neoplasia (e.g., endometrial or uterine carcinoma), except for hysterectomized&#xD;
             patients with a history of carcinoma in situ of the uterus. For other cancers, be&#xD;
             disease free and in remission from all other cancers for 5 or more years, except for&#xD;
             excised superficial lesions, such as basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
             of the skin.&#xD;

             estrogen-replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a history of or suggestion on ultrasound or pelvic examination of a pre-existing&#xD;
             gynecologic abnormality that would require further gynecologic treatment (e.g.,&#xD;

             thickness of &gt;5 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have Papanicolaou's tests showing malignant or premalignant findings.&#xD;

             any time in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have acute or chronic liver disease defined as alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) &gt;100&#xD;

             transaminase elevations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have impaired kidney function (serum creatinine &gt;177 micromol/L or &gt;2.0 mg/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have vitamin D deficiency prior to enrollment (Visit 2; 25-hydroxyvitamin D less&#xD;
             than10 ng/mL or less than 24.9 nmol/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any known, severe, or untreated malabsorption syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have endocrine disorders requiring pharmacologic therapy except for type II diabetes&#xD;

             opinion of the investigator may enroll in the trial.&#xD;
