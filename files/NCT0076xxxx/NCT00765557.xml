      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is MiraLAX an effective treatment of pediatric urinary urge syndrome?&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is common first-line therapy for urinary symptoms despite minimal&#xD;
      evidence-based support. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of&#xD;
      PEG for initial treatment of urinary urge symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUMMARY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients of investigators and sub-investigators will be recruited for this study.&#xD;
      Children with urinary incontinence, urinary frequency, diurnal incontinence, Urinary Tract&#xD;
      Infection (UTI) and/or reflux validated by bladder/bowel symptom questionnaire to have Urge&#xD;
      Syndrome (US) are eligible for this study. A standardized questionnaire of bowel/bladder&#xD;
      activity will be administered and a KUB obtained as standard of care at entry to the study. A&#xD;
      standard 1-day voiding diary will be completed at home before beginning therapy. To exclude&#xD;
      patients potentially still in the process of toilet training, only subjects 4 years of age&#xD;
      and older will be studied. Other exclusion criteria will include known neurological&#xD;
      disorders, a diagnosis of attention deficit disorder, bladder symptoms less than 6 months in&#xD;
      duration at presentation, other bladder dysfunctions besides US, a history of anorectal&#xD;
      malformation and pregnancy. Based upon prior experience that patients with encopresis were&#xD;
      not likely to achieve improved stooling with only a few weeks of laxative therapy, they will&#xD;
      also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those accepted into the study will be randomized to receive either laxative or placebo once&#xD;
      daily for one month. Preparation of the laxative and placebo and patient randomization will&#xD;
      be performed by the Children's Medical Center Investigational Drug Pharmacist. Premixed study&#xD;
      medications will be available at the Urology clinic ready to be dispensed to the patient by&#xD;
      the study coordinator after being screened and randomized. Dosage includes children age 4-6&#xD;
      years (8.5 gms) and children 7-10 years (17gms). The medication will be divided into daily&#xD;
      doses by the Investigational Pharmacist. Written and verbal instructions, both in English and&#xD;
      Spanish, will be provided to the parents/guardian of the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigational Drug Pharmacist will be blinded to all patient data, and physicians and&#xD;
      nurses evaluating patients will be blinded to randomization of these patients to laxative&#xD;
      versus placebo arms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urge Syndrome (US) is the most common non-neurogenic voiding dysfunction in children beyond&#xD;
      the usual age for toilet training, and is characterized by urinary frequency and urgency,&#xD;
      holding maneuvers, and diurnal incontinence. Urodynamics testing has determined these&#xD;
      symptoms result from uninhibited bladder contractions, and so anticholinergic drugs that&#xD;
      control these contractions are the mainstay of therapy typically given in six monthintervals&#xD;
      until the condition resolves. Beyond the embarrassment that may accompany urinary&#xD;
      incontinence, US has been linked to urinary tract infection (UTI) and vesicoureteral reflux.&#xD;
      Specifically, among females with UTI, at least 40% also have US, and US has been identified&#xD;
      as a cause for reflux and a factor that delays its otherwise expected spontaneous resolution.&#xD;
      Consequently, identification and treatment of US are important to the management of children&#xD;
      with UTI, reflux and/or incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Constipation also has been associated with UTI, vesicoureteral reflux, and urinary&#xD;
      incontinence in children. Although these observations date at least to the 1950s, relatively&#xD;
      few studies have attempted either to establish the incidence of constipation found with these&#xD;
      various pediatric urologic conditions, or to document the impact of bowel therapy upon their&#xD;
      management. Of these, Yazbeck et al studied 47 children with recurrent UTI and noted all were&#xD;
      constipated and had uninhibited bladder contractions during urodynamics testing. Therapy&#xD;
      directed toward relief of constipation resolved bladder symptoms in 25%. Loening-Baucke&#xD;
      reported 46% of 234 children attending a university-based encopresis clinic also experienced&#xD;
      urinary incontinence, which diminished with laxative therapy. A recent evaluation of 582&#xD;
      children with US estimated that 16% were also constipated based upon a history of bowel&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have been concerned about the apparent association between US and constipation, especially&#xD;
      since anticholinergic drugs commonly prescribed for uninhibited bladder contractions could&#xD;
      exacerbate underlying stool retention and thereby prolong bladder dysfunction. It is also our&#xD;
      experience that parents are not very familiar with bowel activity of their children after the&#xD;
      usual age of toilet training, making history potentially unreliable for diagnosing&#xD;
      constipation. Therefore, we started recommending a brief course of laxatives for all patients&#xD;
      presenting with US, reserving anticholinergics for those whose bladder symptoms persisted. In&#xD;
      a retrospective review of 110 children, we found 34% had relief of bladder symptoms with&#xD;
      laxatives alone, so that anticholinergic medications were not then required, and the history&#xD;
      of whether the child was constipated or not did not predict response. However, this study has&#xD;
      been criticized for not being placebo-controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the potential impact of this observation for the management of children with not only&#xD;
      urinary incontinence but also UTI and reflux who have US, we now propose a prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of the impact of laxative therapy upon&#xD;
      children with US.&#xD;
