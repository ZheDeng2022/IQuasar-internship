  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder and treatment&#xD;
      response to pharmacological interventions has been modest for these patients. Chronic&#xD;
      elevated anxiety and associated psychophysiological parameters including increased heart rate&#xD;
      and alterations in skin conductance are key symptoms of chronic PTSD. Antidepressants,&#xD;
      including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) or norepinephrine-serotonin&#xD;
      re-uptake inhibitors are considered treatment of first choice for these patients, however a&#xD;
      substantial portion of patients do not respond sufficiently (Zhang and Davidson 2007).&#xD;
      Therefore, there is a need to establish novel and effective add-on treatment strategies for&#xD;
      these patients. Recently, atypical neuroleptics have received considerable attention since it&#xD;
      was shown in multiple controlled and naturalistic trials that these medications are an&#xD;
      effective treatment option for patients with PTSD (Davis et al 2006). In chronic PTSD, the&#xD;
      psychophysiological responses at baseline and in response to treatment have yet been&#xD;
      inadequately studied and may provide novel insight into antidepressant and anxiolytic&#xD;
      mechanisms of medications used in the treatment of PTSD. Therefore, in addition to evaluating&#xD;
      the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of paliperidone, a novel atypical neuroleptic, in&#xD;
      the treatment of PTSD, we also aim to compare neurophysiological responses at baseline with&#xD;
      post-treatment effects in antidepressant-refractory PTSD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 1: Evaluate the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of paliperidone in patients&#xD;
      with PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 2: Evaluate the effects of paliperidone on fear conditioned psychophysiological&#xD;
      responses (including startle eyeblink, skin conductance, and cardiovascular inter-beat&#xD;
      interval) at baseline and after 6 weeks of naturalistic treatment in chronic PTSD patients.&#xD;

    <description>Paliperidone will be gradually increased to a final dose between 3 - 6 mg/day according to the following schedule:&#xD;
Weeks 1 - 3: 3 mg daily, Weeks 4 - 5: flexible dosing according clinical situation, dose range between 3 mg - 6 mg daily*, Week 6: fixed dose,&#xD;
*Criteria to increase the dose from 3 mg to 6 mg daily are 1] absence of any side effects, 2] patients not showing a sufficient response to 3 mg paliperidone can be increased to 6 mg daily. Response is defined as change in depression and anxiety ratings of at least 30% compared to baseline.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  willingness to participate in a naturalistic treatment study using paliperidone and in&#xD;
             two fear conditioning tests, one at baseline and one at the end of the 6 weeks&#xD;
             treatment study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We will include PTSD subjects on medications (possible medications include&#xD;
             antidepressants, benzodiazepines) who have no or only partial treatment response.&#xD;
             Paliperidone will be added to the existing treatment regime which will remain&#xD;
             unchanged during the study period. PTSD subjects will have a minimum score of 50 on&#xD;
             the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS; Blake et al, 1995).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a comorbid diagnosis of bipolar illness, schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders,&#xD;
             acute or chronic suicidality, acute or chronic unstable medical conditions (including&#xD;
             severely impaired hepatic function as indicated with abnormal PT and PTT, abnormal&#xD;
             CBC, and liver enzymes more than 50% above the upper normal range, not well controlled&#xD;
             blood pressure)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  current diagnosis of substance abuse or dependence&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  unsuccessful treatment history with paliperidone&#xD;

          -  known hypersensitivity to paliperidone or any of its inactive ingredients&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  intake of Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamid) or Class III (e.g., amiodaronme,&#xD;
             sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications, antipsychotics, antibiotics (e.g., gatifloxacin,&#xD;
             moxifloxacin) (up to 90 days before entry into the study or during the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects with a positive screen for drugs of abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  no startle or skin conductance response, or excessively high startle response to the&#xD;
