      RATIONALE: Soy protein may help prevent prostate cancer recurrence in patients who have&#xD;
      undergone surgery for prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II/III trial is studying how well soy protein works and&#xD;
      compares it to a placebo in preventing recurrent cancer in patients who have undergone&#xD;
      surgery for stage II prostate cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether soy protein isolate reduces the PSA failure rate and time to PSA&#xD;
           failure within 2 years following radical prostatectomy in patients who are at high risk&#xD;
           for prostate cancer recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effects of soy protein isolate on intermediate biomarkers of steroid&#xD;
           hormone axis (testosterone, estradiol, and SHBG) and thyroid activity (T3 and T4).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effects of soy protein isolate on intermediate biomarkers of apoptosis&#xD;
           (soluble Fas and Fas-ligand), angiogenesis (VEGF and bFGF), antioxidant activity&#xD;
           (8-isoprostanes), and IGF axis (IGF-1 and IGFBP-3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare patients who are equol producers to those who are non-producers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to hospital/clinic&#xD;
      site (NYU vs UIC or Jesse Brown VA Medical Center vs other sites), number of high-risk&#xD;
      characteristics (1 vs &gt; 1), and race (African American vs non-African American [i.e.,&#xD;
      non-Hispanic White, Hispanic, Asian, and other]). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients receive an oral soy protein isolate beverage once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients receive an oral casein placebo beverage once daily. Treatment in both&#xD;
           arms continues for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
           toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected periodically for biomarker laboratory studies. Samples are&#xD;
      analyzed to measure PSA levels by Tosoh PSA assay; cholesterol levels; isoflavone and equol&#xD;
      concentrations by HPLC and ESA; and indicators of steroid hormone axis (testosterone,&#xD;
      estradiol, and SHBG), indicators of thyroid activity (T3 and T4), indicators of apoptosis&#xD;
      (soluble Fas and Fas-ligand), indicators of angiogenesis (VEGF and bFGF), indicators of&#xD;
      oxidative stress (8-isoprostanes), and indicators of IGF axis (IGF-1 and IGFBP-3) by ELISA.&#xD;
