    <textblock>
      To study the safety and tolerability of a hyperimmune goat serum product (AIMSPRO) in the&#xD;
      treatment of systemic sclerosis (SSc) through a period of 26 weeks of study participation.&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of AIMSPRO as a therapeutic&#xD;
      agent for SSc using inter alia the SSc-HAQ questionnaire and the modified Rodnan skin score.&#xD;

      Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma, SSc) is a multisystemic disease clinically characterized by&#xD;
      fibrosis of the skin, joints, muscles and internal organs. Systemic sclerosis is a rare&#xD;
      disease, with an estimated incidence of 19 individuals per million population per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of SSc remains incompletely understood although it seems likely that there&#xD;
      is an interplay between inflammatory, vascular and fibroblast dysfunction, leading ultimately&#xD;
      to the sustained activation of a population of fibroblasts that deposit increased amounts of&#xD;
      extracellular matrix in lesional tissues, including the skin and internal organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impairment of the immune system is currently thought to play an important role. This is based&#xD;
      on the observation that in the early phases of SSc, mononuclear cells migrate to the dermis&#xD;
      and accumulate around small blood vessels, nerves and skin appendages. Furthermore, there is&#xD;
      a direct relation between the extent of cutaneous inflammation and the extent and progression&#xD;
      of fibrosis of the skin. Stimulated T-lymphocytes of patients with SSc produce more tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor-Î±, interleukin-1 and -2 compared with healthy controls and the serum&#xD;
      concentrations of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-8 and soluble IL-2 receptors are elevated. The&#xD;
      occurrence of autoantibodies, predominantly antitopoisomerase-1 (ATA) and anticentromere&#xD;
      antibodies (ACA), in approximately 90% of the patients, points to an alteration of the&#xD;
      humoral immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic sclerosis can be subdivided into diffuse and limited forms. Diffuse cutaneous SSc&#xD;
      (dcSSc) is characterised by skin involvement proximal to the elbows and knees, limited&#xD;
      cutaneous SSc (lcSSc) by skin involvement distal to these joints. In approximately 50% of&#xD;
      patients with dcSSc, ATA can be detected, and in approximately 50% of patients with lcSSc&#xD;
      ACAs are present. Other hallmark autoantibodies have also been identified in smaller&#xD;
      proportions of SSc patients including anti-RNA polymerase I/III and anti-fibrillarin&#xD;
      antibodies (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The course of SSc is variable. In some patients the disease remains confined to sclerodactyly&#xD;
      and Raynaud's phenomenon. In other patients there is a relentless progression of internal&#xD;
      organ fibrosis, ultimately leading to death. A recent study showed a cumulative 5-year&#xD;
      survival rate of 63%. There are efforts to try to identify clinical and investigational&#xD;
      predictors of outcome in SSc. One study has identified three clinical variables: raised ESR,&#xD;
      proteinuria and impaired lung function indices which are associated with poor outcome. In&#xD;
      addition, the various hallmark autoantibodies occurring in SSc are mutually exclusive and&#xD;
      several studies in Europe and North America have demonstrated that individuals carrying each&#xD;
      of these autoantibodies are associated with different frequencies of internal organ&#xD;
      complications. This also allows patients who are at increased risk of pulmonary, cardiac or&#xD;
      renal complications to be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, no treatment has been definitely shown to be effective in SSc. Because of its&#xD;
      presumed immunologic pathogenesis, modulation of the immune system has been the major goal in&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions in SSc. Several studies have reported effectiveness of immune&#xD;
      modulating drugs in the treatment of this disease, although these have mostly been in open,&#xD;
      uncontrolled trials. These drugs include azathioprine, cyclosporin, methotrexate and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide. Amongst these, methotrexate and cyclophosphamide are currently the most&#xD;
      widely used. New, more specific immunological treatment modalities have been harnessed in&#xD;
      order to improve the treatment and prognosis of scleroderma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2005, a patient with systemic sclerosis was treated with AIMSPRO on a compassionate basis&#xD;
      with a sustained improvement in mobility and, in particular, there was an improvement in&#xD;
      proximal muscle power and skin characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, twenty patients will receive either AIMSPRO or placebo, 1.0ml subcutaneously,&#xD;
      twice weekly for 26 weeks. Standard outcome measures and novel biomarkers will be used to&#xD;
      investigate safety, efficacy and response to treatment.&#xD;
