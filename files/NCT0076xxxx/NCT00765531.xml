      The hypothesis of this study proposal is that pediatric urinary stone formers have genetic&#xD;
      risk factors which predispose their urinary stone production. 50-60% of pediatric stone&#xD;
      patients have a positive family history of urinary stone disease. Several genetic mutations&#xD;
      have been identified which predispose patients to various types of urinary stones. These&#xD;
      genetic mutations can also lead to other significant sequela besides stones, including&#xD;
      osteopenia/osteoporosis (bone loss). Furthermore, metabolic abnormalities can be identified&#xD;
      in more than 50% of pediatric stone formers, some of which can be improved and/or alleviated&#xD;
      with medical intervention to help decrease rate of stone formation and the need for&#xD;
      hospitalization and surgical intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although more frequent in adults, urolithiasis (urinary stones) is not rare in children,&#xD;
      accounting for an estimated 1 in 7,600 hospital admissions. Recent reports have demonstrated&#xD;
      a rising incidence of urinary stones in children. The hypothesis of this study proposal is&#xD;
      that pediatric urinary stone formers have genetic risk factors which predispose their urinary&#xD;
      stone production. 50-60% of pediatric stone patients have a positive family history of&#xD;
      urinary stone disease. Several genetic mutations have been identified which predispose&#xD;
      patients to various types of urinary stones. These genetic mutations can also lead to other&#xD;
      significant sequela besides stones, including osteopenia/osteoporosis (bone loss).&#xD;
      Furthermore, metabolic abnormalities can be identified in more than 50% of pediatric stone&#xD;
      formers, some of which can be improved and/or alleviated with medical intervention to help&#xD;
      decrease rate of stone formation and the need for hospitalization and surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent of age, calcium is the main crystalline constituent of kidney stones in up to 80%&#xD;
      of cases and calcium oxalate stones are the most common stone type. At all ages,&#xD;
      hypercalciuria (urinary calcium excretion &gt;4 mg/kg/d or urinary calcium / urinary creatinine&#xD;
      &gt; 0.2) is the most common metabolic cause of urolithiasis. Hypercalciuria is a common&#xD;
      metabolic abnormality among patients who form calcium oxalate stones. Hypercalciuria can be&#xD;
      primary (absorptive or renal) or secondary (resorptive). Primary absorptive hypercalciuria is&#xD;
      the result of an increase in intestinal calcium absorption while primary renal hypercalciuria&#xD;
      occurs when the kidneys leak calcium. Laboratory tests, including a serum parathyroid hormone&#xD;
      level and urinary calcium excretion before and after dietary calcium restriction or load, are&#xD;
      required to define which type of hypercalciuria is occurring. Secondary hypercalciuria may be&#xD;
      the result of excessive sodium intake or induced by certain drugs. More commonly, secondary&#xD;
      hypercalciuria is associated with other diseases (such as hypercalcemia, distal renal tubular&#xD;
      acidosis, hyperparathyroidism, hypocitraturia, hypophosphatasia, Bartter's syndrome or&#xD;
      prolonged immobilization). Whatever the cause, proper diagnosis and management of&#xD;
      hypercalciuria in children is important since 50% may develop nephrocalcinosis and&#xD;
      urolithiasis. In addition, vertebral bone loss has been reported in 30% of hypercalciuric&#xD;
      children. In our patients who have undergone metabolic testing to date, approximately 50%&#xD;
      have evidence of hypercalciuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypercalciuria resulting from increased absorption of calcium from the gut, termed absorptive&#xD;
      hypercalciuria (AH), accounts for 45% of all reported cases of stone formation. AH has long&#xD;
      been suspected to be genetic. More than 40% of first degree relatives of patients with&#xD;
      hypercalciuria also have a history of urolithiasis. Over the last 10 years, investigators&#xD;
      have sought to understand the molecular basis of this presumed genetic observation. The&#xD;
      genotypes of individuals with hypercalciuria have been studied trying to associate&#xD;
      polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor gene with nephrolithiasis, but it seems vitamin D&#xD;
      genotype has no clear influence on this phenotype. However, recently, a new candidate-gene&#xD;
      was identified by Gitomer, et al which was linked to AH in Caucasian adults; it was mapped to&#xD;
      chromosome 1q24. This gene has been putatively identified as a gut-specific soluble isoform&#xD;
      of an adenylate cyclase which when mutated causes absorptive hypercalciuria. Four&#xD;
      polymorphisms and two mutations have thus far been described; the presence of any of these 4&#xD;
      individual base substitutions yielded a 2.2 to 3.5-fold increase in estimated risk for&#xD;
      absorptive hypercalciuria. These base changes were also associated with decreased spinal bone&#xD;
      density and the occurrence of osteoporosis in the AH population. The incidence of gene&#xD;
      mutations in this newly described AH gene has not been reported in children with either&#xD;
      hypercalciuria, calcium oxalate stones or a positive family history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, novel candidate genes causing urolithiasis may be discovered during the duration&#xD;
      of this study which would become subjects of investigation. Similarly, pedigrees from&#xD;
      stone-forming probands affected in childhood have not been studied for medical outcomes,&#xD;
      stone recurrence risks, or for novel gene searches. Unique pediatric stone cases that have&#xD;
      been seen at Children's Medical Center include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Xanthinuria (n=1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Primary Hyperoxaluria, type 1 (n=1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cystinuria (n=3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Hypocitraturia&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Hyperoxaluria&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Novel contiguous gene deletion syndrome with calcium nephrolithiasis (n=1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Uric acid nephrolithiasis with metabolic syndrome (n=1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, although smaller numbers of affected patients are identified, the investigation of&#xD;
      rare cases with a severe phenotype, which often first manifests in the pediatric population,&#xD;
      may lead to a major disease discovery, as has been shown in many genetic diseases. Thus, we&#xD;
      now broaden the scope of this research to include all pediatric stone-formers of all races&#xD;
      and underlying metabolic and/or genetic abnormalities.&#xD;
