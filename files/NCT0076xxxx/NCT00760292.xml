  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Genetic risk-markers associated with T2DM are thoroughly studied. So far, only a&#xD;
      few genetic variants, also termed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's), have been&#xD;
      replicated in several studies and each of them gives only limited explanation for the growing&#xD;
      incidence of T2DM. The hypothesis of the present study is that determination of combinations&#xD;
      of genetic variants by SNP-chip technology may improve the prediction of T2DM, complications&#xD;
      and efficacy of treatment compared to the methods previously used including genome wide&#xD;
      association (GWA) studies. The SNP-chip/ DNA microarray makes it possible to study several&#xD;
      SNP's association with T2DM, one by one but also in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To study whether specific genetic variants, and combinations of these, 1) are present&#xD;
      with higher prevalence in patients with T2DM than in the normal population, 2) are associated&#xD;
      with specific diabetes-related complications and 3) the effect of the anti-diabetic&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: During the next three years 1000 patients with T2DM and 1000 healthy, non-diabetic&#xD;
      persons will be included in the study, and examined by blood samples, a questionnaire and&#xD;
      clinical evaluation, all in one visit. Initially, we will perform DNA analyses on blood&#xD;
      samples from 372 patients included in another clinical study from our department. Description&#xD;
      of genetics will be done by a DNA-chip with approximately 70 SNP's, which have previously&#xD;
      been reported to be associated with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results and conclusions: It is expected that the result of this project can help us&#xD;
      predicting T2DM, diabetes-related complications and individualizing treatment to the&#xD;
      individual patient with T2DM.&#xD;
