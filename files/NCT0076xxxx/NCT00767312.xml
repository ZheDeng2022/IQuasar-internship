    <textblock>
      This study will determine if the level of virus in HIV-infected patients taking&#xD;
      antiretroviral medications for prolonged periods decreases or persists at a stable level. It&#xD;
      will also examine whether new gene changes (mutations) occur during drug suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients who are 18 years of age or older, have been enrolled in another NIH&#xD;
      protocol, have been suppressed on antiretroviral therapy and have very low levels of virus in&#xD;
      their blood may be eligible for this 5-year (or more) study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants come to the NIH Clinical Center about every 6 months for a physical examination,&#xD;
      routine and research blood tests and leukapheresis to collect white blood cells for T cell&#xD;
      analysis. For leukapheresis, blood is collected through a vein much like donating whole&#xD;
      blood, but the blood is directed through a machine that separates and extracts the white&#xD;
      cells and returns the rest of the blood components to the patient. Patients may also have an&#xD;
      optional third clinic visit each year for another blood draw.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Combination antiretroviral therapy for human immunodeficiency virus serotype 1 (HIV-1)&#xD;
      infection has resulted in profound reductions in viremia and is associated with marked&#xD;
      improvements in morbidity and mortality. Therapy is not curative, however, and prolonged&#xD;
      therapy is complicated by drug toxicity and the emergence of drug resistance. How drug&#xD;
      resistance emerges during suppressive antiretroviral therapy remains poorly understood.&#xD;
      Investigating the characteristics of HIV-1 replication during suppressive antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy will yield important insights in understanding the emergence resistance, and requires&#xD;
      patients who have suppressed viral RNA levels. Prior National Institutes of Health (NIH)&#xD;
      protocols have made important observations regarding the kinetics of HIV-1 decline in&#xD;
      response to therapy, the levels of HIV-1 viremia during suppressive therapy, and the nature&#xD;
      of HIV-1 genetic diversity prior to and following initiation of antiretroviral therapy. In&#xD;
      the process, these studies have generated a useful cohort of patients with suppressed viral&#xD;
      RNA levels, who have been extensively characterized from a virologic and immunologic&#xD;
      standpoint. Similarly, patients from other NIH protocols have been followed for prolonged&#xD;
      periods before and after therapy has been initiated, and they also have stored sample sets&#xD;
      that would be useful in new studies of HIV replication. The HIV Drug Resistance Program (DRP)&#xD;
      has studied samples from protocols 00-I-0110 and 97-I-0082 to develop a number of new,&#xD;
      sensitive laboratory techniques to measure and quantitate genetic variation and to&#xD;
      investigate immune response parameters. To further advance understanding of HIV-1 replication&#xD;
      during suppressive antiretroviral therapy and the emergence of drug resistance, we propose a&#xD;
      new protocol to study these 2 patient cohorts (from the above cited protocols) and selected&#xD;
      patients in other protocols with a new series of studies. The primary objective of this&#xD;
      protocol is to investigate the virologic and immunologic characteristics of HIV-infected&#xD;
      individuals undergoing antiretroviral therapy. Upon implementation, this new protocol will&#xD;
      provide human subjects protection for samples collected under the two prior protocols,&#xD;
      whether patients enroll in the new study or not.&#xD;
