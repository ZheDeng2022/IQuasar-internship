    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a chronic disease with multiple metabolic defects that result in hyperglycemia&#xD;
      arising from inadequate insulin activity. Type 2 diabetes has a genetic predisposition, but&#xD;
      lifestyle, body constitution and age play important roles in determining its time of onset&#xD;
      and severity. Type 2 diabetes is usually the result of a progression from reduced sensitivity&#xD;
      of hepatic and peripheral-tissue cells to circulating insulin (i.e., insulin resistance) to a&#xD;
      progressive inability of the body to produce adequate insulin to overcome insulin resistance&#xD;
      (i.e., insulin deficiency due to beta cell insufficiency) resulting in impaired glucose&#xD;
      tolerance and ultimately overt diabetes. In the United States, an estimated 15.7 million&#xD;
      people have diabetes, with type 2 diabetes occurring in approximately 90-95% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic agents have been developed to address each of the major functional metabolic&#xD;
      defects associated with type 2 diabetes: decreased beta-cell function, elevated hepatic&#xD;
      glucose output, and insulin resistance. The oral therapeutic agents used in the treatment of&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes can be separated into the following four categories based on their mechanisms&#xD;
      of action: insulin secretagogues, inhibitors of hepatic glucose output, inhibitors of complex&#xD;
      carbohydrate breakdown in the intestine and insulin sensitizers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thiazolidinediones reduce insulin resistance by enhancing insulin sensitivity in muscle&#xD;
      cells, adipose tissue, and hepatic cells (inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis) with no direct&#xD;
      impact on insulin secretion. Thus thiazolidinediones improve glycemic control and result in&#xD;
      reduced levels of circulating insulin. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors are found&#xD;
      in tissues important for insulin action, such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and the&#xD;
      liver. The greatest concentration of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors -gamma&#xD;
      receptors is in adipose tissue. Pioglitazone HCl (ACTOS®) is a thiazolidinedione developed by&#xD;
      Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research suggests that Angiotensin II receptor blockers are involved in endothelial and&#xD;
      cardiovascular function, and in insulin sensitization and obesity. TAK-536 (azilsartan) is an&#xD;
      angiotensin II receptor antagonist with affinity for and selective antagonistic activity at&#xD;
      the angiotensin II type 1 receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of pioglitazone in&#xD;
      combination with azilsartan in subjects with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participation is anticipated to be approximately 6 months.&#xD;
