      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn the highest safe doses of the&#xD;
      combination of Doxil (liposomal doxorubicin), Avastin (bevacizumab), and Torisel&#xD;
      (Temsirolimus) that can be given to patients with advanced cancer that has spread or is&#xD;
      unable to be surgically removed. The safety and effectiveness of this combination of drugs&#xD;
      will also be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liposomal doxorubicin is designed to cause cancer cells to be fragile, which may cause the&#xD;
      cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is designed to block or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking the&#xD;
      growth of blood vessels that supply nutrients for tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temsirolimus is designed to block the growth of cancer cells, which may eventually cause the&#xD;
      cancer cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everolimus is designed to block a protein called mammilian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inside&#xD;
      the cancer cells, which is involved in cancer cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a fixed&#xD;
      dose level of a combination of liposomal doxorubicin, bevacizumab, and either temsirolimus or&#xD;
      everolimus, based on when you joined this study. Up to 9 dose levels of the study drug&#xD;
      combination will be tested. Three (3) participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The&#xD;
      first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a&#xD;
      higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will&#xD;
      continue until the highest tolerable dose of the study drug combination is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liposomal doxorubicin, bevacizumab, and either temsirolimus or everolimus will be given in&#xD;
      &quot;cycles.&quot; Cycles will be about 21 days (or longer, depending on any side effects you may&#xD;
      experience).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liposomal doxorubicin is given by vein on Day 1 of each cycle. On Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will&#xD;
      receive it over 3 hours. If you tolerate it well in Cycle 1, you will receive it over 60&#xD;
      minutes in Cycle 2. If you tolerate it well in Cycle 2, you will receive it over 60 minutes&#xD;
      for all further cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is given by vein on Day 1 of each cycle. On Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will receive it&#xD;
      over 90 minutes. If you tolerate it well in Cycle 1, you will receive it over 60 minutes in&#xD;
      Cycle 2. If you tolerate it well in Cycle 2, you will receive it over 30 minutes in Cycle 3.&#xD;
      It will continue to be given over 30 minutes in Cycle 4 and further cycles, as long as you&#xD;
      still tolerate it well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temsirolimus is given by vein on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle. During Day 1 of Cycle 1,&#xD;
      you will receive it over 60 minutes. If you tolerate it well on Day 1 of Cycle 1, it will be&#xD;
      given over 30 minutes on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 and over 30 minutes in further cycles, as&#xD;
      long you still tolerate it well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everolimus works the same way and has been shown to be as effective as temsirolimus.&#xD;
      Everolimus can also be given by mouth, so it can be substituted for temsirolimus. Everolimus&#xD;
      will be taken every day, starting with Day 1 of Cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of a nationwide shortage of liposomal doxorubicin, you may only receive temsirolimus&#xD;
      and bevacizumab until liposomal doxorubicin becomes available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you experience certain side effects, your dose level may be lowered. In some cases, your&#xD;
      dose may be stopped for 1 week, until the side effect gets better. Your doctor can explain&#xD;
      this to you in more detail, if it happens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Cycle 1, you will have a physical exam once and blood will be drawn weekly (about 1&#xD;
      tablespoon) for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Cycle 2 and further cycles, you will have a physical exam and blood drawn (about 1&#xD;
      tablespoon) for routine tests once every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The status of the disease will be checked by a CT or MRI scan after every 2 cycles, for&#xD;
      Cycles 2-6, then every 2-3 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Procedures for Some Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are in the group that receives the highest safe dose of the study drugs, you will have&#xD;
      the following additional procedures performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a biopsy performed at the end of Cycle 1. The biopsy will be used for&#xD;
           research to see how the study drug combination acts in the body and to learn how it may&#xD;
           affect cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a DCE-MRI scan at 24-48 hours after your first study drug infusion (Cycle&#xD;
           1), and at the end of Cycle 1. These DCE-MRI scans will be used for research to see how&#xD;
           the study drug combination is affecting blood vessels that supply nutrients and oxygen&#xD;
           to tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue to receive additional cycles of the study drugs, unless the cancer goes away&#xD;
      completely, gets worse, or if intolerable side effects occur. In that case, you will be taken&#xD;
      off study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After your last dose of the study drug, you will receive up to 3 phone calls from the study&#xD;
      staff. The calls will be 1 month apart, and you will be asked how you are doing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Liposomal doxorubicin, bevacizumab, and temsirolimus are&#xD;
      commercially available. Liposomal doxorubicin is FDA approved for the treatment of multiple&#xD;
      myeloma, ovarian cancer that has returned, and Kaposi's sarcoma. Bevacizumab is FDA approved&#xD;
      for the treatment of colorectal cancer and a type of lung cancer. Temsirolimus is FDA&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of kidney cancer that has spread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of liposomal doxorubicin, bevacizumab, and temsirolimus is not FDA approved.&#xD;
      At this time, it is only being used in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 206 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
