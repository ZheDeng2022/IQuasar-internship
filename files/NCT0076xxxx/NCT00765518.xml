      This study is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of Cardiac Repair Cells (CRCs)&#xD;
      compared to standard-of-care in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure remains a major public health problem, affecting 5 million patients in the US&#xD;
      with 550,000 new diagnoses made each year. Heart failure is the leading cause of&#xD;
      hospitalization in persons over 65 years of age with cost exceeding $29 billion annually.&#xD;
      Prognosis is very poor once a patient has been hospitalized with heart failure. The mortality&#xD;
      risk after heart failure hospitalization is 11.3% at 30 days, 33.1% at 1 year and well over&#xD;
      50% within 5 years (Hunt SA; et al., 2005). These numbers emphasize the need to develop and&#xD;
      implement more effective treatments to manage heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is targeting a subset of heart failure patient population, namely those diagnosed&#xD;
      with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The World Health Organization (WHO) defines dilated&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy as a cardiac condition wherein a ventricular chamber exhibits increased&#xD;
      diastolic and systolic volume and a low (&lt;40%) ejection fraction. DCM is reported to affect&#xD;
      108,000 to 150,000 patients in the U.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, stratified, randomized, open-label, controlled, multi-center&#xD;
      study to assess the safety profile and efficacy of CRCs in treating patients with DCM. It&#xD;
      will enroll a total of 40 patients at 5 sites in the U.S.&#xD;
