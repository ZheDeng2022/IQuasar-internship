  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) refers to a set of symptoms that include exhaustion, muscle pain,&#xD;
      and tender points, where slight pressure can cause pain. Doctors do not know what causes FMS&#xD;
      or how to cure it, but some treatments have helped relieve its symptoms. Progressive&#xD;
      exercise, in which exercise is started at low levels and then increased, is one of the most&#xD;
      reliable treatments, but people with FMS often avoid exercise or stop after completing&#xD;
      exercise programs. This research will focus on the idea that people with FMS do not exercise&#xD;
      because they are afraid of injury or have had a negative experience exercising. Participants&#xD;
      will undergo one or a combination of several different treatments that aim to reduce fear of&#xD;
      exercising. The different treatments will then be evaluated on their effectiveness in&#xD;
      reducing disability among people with FMS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a condition without a known cause or cure. Differing theories&#xD;
      place the blame on abnormal sensitivity to pain receptors in the brain, changes in metabolism&#xD;
      and hormones, abnormalities in the autonomic nervous system, sleep disturbances, infection,&#xD;
      or injury. A diagnosis of FMS, therefore, is based on a set of symptoms. These include pain&#xD;
      in muscles, ligaments, and tendons; fatigue; and multiple tender points on the body, where&#xD;
      even slight pressure causes pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is no cure, FMS can be treated to reduce the severity or presence of symptoms.&#xD;
      One of the most reliable ways to do this is through progressive exercise, which involves&#xD;
      starting at low levels of exercise and building up to longer and more strenuous levels.&#xD;
      Despite the benefit of exercise, FSM sufferers often drop out of supervised exercise programs&#xD;
      or discontinue exercise once they are no longer supervised. Some FMS patients may have a&#xD;
      fear-based avoidance of exercise, believing it will provoke pain or deterioration of their&#xD;
      condition and experiencing significant negative emotional arousal when they exercise. This&#xD;
      may be due to a prior painful or uncomfortable experience while exercising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will employ multiple treatments that are usually used for treatment of phobias and&#xD;
      will aim to reduce fear, increase exercising, and improve FMS symptoms. Under the purview of&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are multiple types of treatments. Cognitive restructuring&#xD;
      (CR) and coping skills training (ST) paired together address maladaptive beliefs and&#xD;
      facilitate the development of more effective coping strategies. Exposure therapy (ET) reduces&#xD;
      the level of emotional arousal when patients are exposed to the feared stimulus, in this case&#xD;
      exercising. Attention control (AC) treatment, not a type of CBT, provides patients with&#xD;
      support and controls for nonspecific factors related to exposure to their feared stimulus. AC&#xD;
      will be used as the control treatment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last 4 months. After recruitment and an initial evaluation,&#xD;
      participants will be placed on a waiting list for 8 weeks to determine whether their symptoms&#xD;
      improve or change naturally. They will then be reassessed and randomly assigned to one of the&#xD;
      following groups for 8 weeks of treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CR+ST: This group will help participants develop adaptive ways of thinking and acting to&#xD;
           alter maladaptive beliefs in general and beliefs about certain exercises in specific.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ET: This group will help participants to decrease their fear response during specific&#xD;
           exercises through progressive, controlled exposure to the feared stimulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. COMB: This group will combine CR+ST and ET treatment plans so that adaptive thoughts and&#xD;
           behaviors will be emphasized in the first 4 weeks, and exposure to feared stimuli will&#xD;
           be emphasized in the second 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. AC: This group will offer participants non-directive, supportive counseling. Each&#xD;
           treatment group will meet in weekly 90-minute group sessions for the first 4 weeks and&#xD;
           in weekly 60-minute individual sessions for the second 4 weeks. Participants will have&#xD;
           60-minute physical therapy sessions accompanying every treatment session. Participants&#xD;
           will also be given weekly homework assignments specific to their treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a series of assessments that include self-report measures, medical&#xD;
      and psychological evaluations, and a physical capability evaluation by a physical trainer.&#xD;
      These assessments will be performed at recruitment, after the 8-week waiting period, after&#xD;
      treatment, at 1- and 3-month mail and telephone follow-ups, and at a 6-month follow-up in the&#xD;
      treatment clinic. They will assess fear, health, physical ability, and psychological health.&#xD;
