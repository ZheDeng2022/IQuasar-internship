  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder and treatment&#xD;
      response to pharmacological interventions has been modest for these patients. Chronic&#xD;
      elevated anxiety and associated psychophysiological parameters including increased heart rate&#xD;
      and alterations in skin conductance are key symptoms of chronic PTSD. Selective serotonin&#xD;
      reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are considered treatment of first choice for these patients,&#xD;
      however a substantial portion of patients treated with SRIs do not respond sufficiently.&#xD;
      Therefore, there is a need to establish novel and effective treatment strategies for these&#xD;
      patients. Recently, duloxetine has received considerable attention since it was shown in&#xD;
      multiple controlled trials to be an effective treatment for people with major depressive&#xD;
      disorder (MDD), a condition which is often co-morbid with PTSD. In chronic PTSD, the&#xD;
      psychophysiological responses at baseline and in response to treatment with duloxetine have&#xD;
      been inadequately studied and may provide novel insight into antidepressant and anxiolytic&#xD;
      mechanisms of this compound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 1: Evaluate the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of duloxetine in patients&#xD;
      with chronic PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 2: Evaluate the effects of duloxetine on fear conditioned psychophysiological&#xD;
      responses (including startle eyeblink, skin conductance, and cardiovascular inter-beat&#xD;
      interval) at baseline and after 8 weeks of naturalistic treatment in chronic PTSD patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with PTSD (age range 18-65 years) as determined by the Structured Clinical&#xD;
             Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth&#xD;
             Edition, non-patient version (First et al., 1996)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to participate in a naturalistic treatment study using duloxetine and in&#xD;
             two fear conditioning tests, one at baseline and one at the end of the 8 weeks&#xD;
             treatment study. We will include PTSD subjects on medications (possible medications&#xD;
             include antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and neuroleptics) who have no or only&#xD;
             partial treatment response or PTSD patients who are untreated. Treatment will be&#xD;
             switched to duloxetine and the previous antidepressant medication will be&#xD;
             discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PTSD subjects will have a minimum score of 50 on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale&#xD;
             (CAPS; Blake et al, 1995).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be enrolled until the number of 20 subjects who complete the study&#xD;
             is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects are required to be in a medically stable condition as determined by a&#xD;
             thorough physical examination, including ECG, blood work and urine analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No vulnerable subjects will be recruited for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  comorbid diagnosis of bipolar illness, schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders or&#xD;
             presence of psychotic symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  acute or chronic suicidality&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  acute or chronic unstable medical conditions (including severely impaired hepatic&#xD;
             function as indicated with abnormal PT and PTT, abnormal CBC, and liver enzymes more&#xD;
             than 50% above the upper normal range, not well controlled blood pressure)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  current diagnosis of substance abuse or dependence&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  unsuccessful treatment history with duloxetine, known hypersensitivity to duloxetine&#xD;
             or any of its inactive ingredients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  administration of any investigational drug up to 90 days before entry into the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  intake of monoamino oxides inhibitors up to 90 days before entry into the study or&#xD;
             during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  subjects with a positive screen for drugs of abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  no startle or skin conductance response, or excessively high startle response to the&#xD;
             startle probe (100 dB acoustic stimuli) during the pretest&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant as indicated by urine pregnancy test or unwillingness to prevent conception&#xD;
             during the course of the study.&#xD;
