  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who have depression often have symptoms besides sad mood. Cognitive symptoms, such as&#xD;
      poor memory, concentration, and decision making, are associated with disability in many&#xD;
      spheres of life, and these symptoms often persist even when antidepressant treatment improves&#xD;
      other symptoms (mood, energy, sleep, anxiety). Antidepressants alone fail to produce full&#xD;
      remission for many patients, so it is important to study adjunctive treatments which can be&#xD;
      added onto medication treatment and help restore cognitive function. The method of&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown by others to improve working&#xD;
      memory and cognitive functions, and also to help with other symptoms of depression. tDCS&#xD;
      involves passing a small, constant current between saline-moistened pads placed on the scalp.&#xD;
      In this proposed study, 20 individuals with major depression who have cognitive difficulties&#xD;
      despite taking antidepressants will participate. Over the course of a two-week period, each&#xD;
      person will receive 5 sessions of either active tDCS or inactive treatments, in addition to&#xD;
      their medication. Each session lasts for 20 minutes, and will be administered on alternating&#xD;
      days (M-W-F). Assessments of depressive symptoms, cognitive function, and brain activity will&#xD;
      be made prior to any sessions, after the first one, and after the fifth (final) session;&#xD;
      brain function will be assessed by measuring the brain's electrical activity (&quot;brain waves&quot;).&#xD;

      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), also sometimes termed &quot;DC polarization&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;brain polarization,&quot; is a non-invasive procedure that has been used successfully as a&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention in a number of patient populations. tDCS involves the passing of&#xD;
      very weak currents through an area of interest of the brain, by placing electrodes on the&#xD;
      scalp at the appropriate locations. DC polarization has been shown to alter the amplitude of&#xD;
      evoked potentials in the visual cortex (Antal et al., 2004), and cortical processing in the&#xD;
      parietal lobe also can be modulated by tDCS (Rogalewski et al., 2004). From a more&#xD;
      physiologically-relevant perspective, tDCS of the motor cortex has been shown to improve&#xD;
      motor function in patients following stroke (Hummel and Cohen, 2005; Hummel et al., 2006;&#xD;
      Boggio et al., 2006b) when applied to the prefrontal cortex. tDCS has been shown to improve&#xD;
      working memory in healthy individuals (Fregni et al., 2005b), and in individuals with major&#xD;
      depressive episode. In MDD it has more recently been shown to improve depression rating&#xD;
      self-report scores (Fregni et al., 2006a) and cognitive performance (Fregni et al., 2006b).&#xD;
      Performance on a executive function task (go/no-go) was also shown to be enhanced with tDCS&#xD;
      in adults with MDD (Boggio et al., 2006a). tDCS has been evaluated in subjects with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease and found to have therapeutics benefit (compared with inactive treatment)&#xD;
      on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and neuropsychological measures (reaction&#xD;
      time, pegboard task) as well as motor evoked potentials (Fregni et al., 2006c).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several recent studies have affirmed the safety of tDCS. Iyer and colleagues (2005) showed&#xD;
      that, in a sample of 103 subjects, no one asked for the tDCS procedure to be stopped due to&#xD;
      discomfort. Gandiga and colleagues (2006) compared sham to active tDCS and showed no&#xD;
      differences in self-report ratings of discomfort. Nitsche and colleagues (2004) performed&#xD;
      structural MRI scans on healthy individuals who underwent 1 hour exposures to tDCS; they&#xD;
      found no evidence of structural change in the brain or alterations in blood-brain barrier&#xD;
      permeability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to persistent challenges in the management of MDD, individuals with depression&#xD;
      have shown cognitive deficits, particularly in working memory and other frontal lobe&#xD;
      functions (Dunkin et al., 2000; Sweeney et al., 2000 Jaeger et al., 2006; Rose and Ebmeier&#xD;
      2006; Rose et al., 2006) and declarative memory (e.g., Beaden et al., 2006). By improving&#xD;
      cognitive function in subjects with cognitive complaints that persist despite&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy, it may be possible to improve the completeness of recovery from depression&#xD;
      and reduce any functional disability (Jaeger et al., 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no published reports yet of the effects of tDCS on brain function in subjects with&#xD;
      MDD. Cordance is a quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) measure which allows for&#xD;
      non-invasive measurement of regional brain function (Leuchter et al., 1994a, 1994b, 1999;&#xD;
      Cook et al., 1998). It is sensitive to changes in brain function in subjects who are&#xD;
      responding to treatment for MDD (Cook and Leuchter 2001; Cook et al., 2002, 2005; Leuchter et&#xD;
      al., 2002) and is being evaluated for use a a biomarker which predicts treatment outcome in&#xD;
      MDD (NIMH Project R01MH069217, Cook PI). It is well suited to evaluating brain function in&#xD;
      subjects with MDD during a clinical trial experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypotheses are&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects who are randomized to receive active tDCS treatments will show greater&#xD;
           improvement in cognitive task performance than subjects who receive inactive treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects who are randomized to receive active tDCS treatments will show greater&#xD;
           improvement in depression symptom severity scores than subjects who receive inactive&#xD;
           treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subjects who are randomized to receive active tDCS treatments will show greater changes&#xD;
           in prefrontal brain function, as assessed with quantitative EEG cordance, than subjects&#xD;
           who receive inactive treatments.&#xD;
