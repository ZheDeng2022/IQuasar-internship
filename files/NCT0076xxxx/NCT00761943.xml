      Disease Prevalence:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orthopaedic surgeons are frequently asked to evaluate patients with stiff and painful&#xD;
      shoulders. Among the most common causes for such clinical condition is adhesive capsulitis&#xD;
      (or frozen shoulder), which is thought to affect approximately 2-5% of the general&#xD;
      population. The incidence in patients with diabetes is much higher, up to 29% in some&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Summary of Adhesive Capsulitis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adhesive Capsulitis may be summarized briefly as the clinical syndrome of shoulder pain and&#xD;
      progressive loss of motion and eventual improvement of symptoms. The cause is classified as&#xD;
      either primary (idiopathic) or secondary, if due to a known precipitating condition. Risk&#xD;
      factors associated with developing adhesive capsulitis include diabetes, female sex, middle&#xD;
      to older age, and thyroid disease. Secondary causes of adhesive capsulitis include trauma,&#xD;
      shoulder surgery, degenerative arthritis, rotator cuff tears, or prolonged immobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The condition is characterized functionally by loss of both active and passive range of&#xD;
      motion and anatomically by thickening and contracture of the joint capsule. The term&#xD;
      &quot;Adhesive Capsulitis&quot; was coined by Neviaser when he noted the contracted capsule peeled from&#xD;
      the humeral head like &quot;adhesive plaster from skin&quot;. A broader term &quot;Frozen Shoulder&quot; was used&#xD;
      by Codman in 1934 to describe this and related conditions. There is a commonly accepted&#xD;
      progression of three clinical phases: painful freezing, stiff/frozen phase, and eventually&#xD;
      thawing with slow return of motion. Many patients will have some residual loss of motion for&#xD;
      several years. For people with diabetes, residual, permanent loss of motion can be as much as&#xD;
      50%. The natural history of the disease has been shown to be more dismal than once thought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathology of the Disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histopathologic changes that occur in the joint capsule and synovial lining are cellular&#xD;
      changes of chronic inflammation, fibrosis, perivascular infiltration in the subsynovial layer&#xD;
      and increased vascularity. There is some debate as to whether the disease is primarily&#xD;
      inflammatory or fibrotic in nature and there is support for both, depending on the stage of&#xD;
      disease. Some have shown that arthroscopy reveals a highly vascular, red, inflamed synovium.&#xD;
      Neviaser defined four stages of arthroscopic adhesive capsulitis ranging from acute synovitis&#xD;
      to chronic adhesions. The pathology is not clearly understood and this makes optimal&#xD;
      treatment more difficult to determine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations of Current Imaging Studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging modalities commonly used to evaluate the shoulder such as x-ray (to rule out&#xD;
      arthritic changes or fractures) are unremarkable in primary adhesive capsulitis. Traditional&#xD;
      arthrograms or contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging may show decreased capsular volume and&#xD;
      edema but are invasive and expensive tests. Magnetic Resonance Arthrogram shows thickening of&#xD;
      the coracohumeral ligament and the joint capsule in the area of the rotator interval.&#xD;
      Although MRI can demonstrate edema and inflammatory changes, its cost seems prohibitive to&#xD;
      follow clinical disease on a serial basis, perhaps monthly as the disease progresses.&#xD;
      Ultrasound is a much more likely candidate for serial examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful Use of Ultrasound in Rheumatoid Wrist Studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent reports in the literature have shown color doppler ultrasound (CDUS) to be a promising&#xD;
      tool for estimation of synovial inflammatory activity in rheumatoid arthritis. Researchers&#xD;
      used specific quantitative criteria to measure the resistivity index of small blood vessels&#xD;
      in the synovium and color pixel fraction. Both measures attempt to quantify vascularity as a&#xD;
      surrogate indicator of inflammation in the joint capsule. In a subsequent study they injected&#xD;
      the wrists with corticosteroid and then obtained ultrasound images one month later which&#xD;
      showed changes in the resistivity index and color pixel fraction that correlated with the&#xD;
      improved clinical evaluation and functional improvements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound in Adhesive Capsulitis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound study of the shoulder has many benefits over MRI/MRA including: no&#xD;
      contraindications or risk to patients, non-invasive, and relatively low cos. Ultrasound is&#xD;
      comparable to MRI in studying the synovium with much less downside. Despite is theoretical&#xD;
      advantages; there are limited studies in the literature reporting on color doppler ultrasound&#xD;
      to evaluate adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder. In one study, researchers correlated&#xD;
      ultrasound findings with arthroscopic findings and concluded that ultrasound can provide an&#xD;
      early, accurate diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis. Their criteria, however, were qualitative&#xD;
      using echotexture and increased doppler flow to indicate increased vascularity. No&#xD;
      quantitative measurements were made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Importance of Proposed Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the objective in treating patients with adhesive capsulitis is clear (to restore&#xD;
      full, pain-free motion and unrestricted shoulder function) the optimal treatment remains&#xD;
      unclear. This is due in part because there is no clear consensus on diagnosis, poor&#xD;
      understanding of the pathology, and difficulty comparing the effectiveness of treatment&#xD;
      regimens. As in many poorly defined medical conditions, multiple, different empiric&#xD;
      treatments are employed with varying success. If we could more clearly identify diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria and reproducibly stage the disease we could then more reliably and scientifically&#xD;
      compare treatment approaches and thus provide a real benefit to many patients with this&#xD;
      common condition. Our proposed study is an important step in this process.&#xD;
