      AutoloGel™ Post-Market Surveillance Program&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:Evaluate the incidence of hematologic and immunologic adverse events, including&#xD;
      coagulopathies in patients with wounds to which AutoloGel™ was applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:Prospective, open label, patient registry. Investigator Sites: 3 Enrollment Size: 300&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Population: Patients with exuding wounds, such as leg ulcers, pressure ulcers, and&#xD;
      diabetic ulcers and for the management of mechanically or surgically-debrided wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective Safety: Assess the incidence of hematologic (coagulopathies), immunologic&#xD;
      (including anaphylaxis) and other adverse events associated with the application of AutoloGel&#xD;
      on exuding wounds, such as leg ulcers, pressure ulcers and diabetic ulcers and during the&#xD;
      management of mechanically or surgically-debrided wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Safety Endpoint: Absence of coagulopathies caused by inhibitors to coagulation Factor&#xD;
      V as determined by a significant prolongation of the prothrombin (PT) time and confirmed by&#xD;
      severe depletion of Factor V activity with a positive Bethesda Assay for anti-Factor V&#xD;
      functional inhibitors.&#xD;

      Device Name.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device subject to the Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) Program is the AutoloGel™ System&#xD;
      which has been cleared for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the&#xD;
      application BK060007.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AutoloGel™ System includes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AutoloGel™ Centrifuge II AutoloGel™ System Wound Dressing and Reagent Kits including&#xD;
      single-use, disposable components for performing a patient phlebotomy, centrifuging blood to&#xD;
      derive PRP and activating and applying the AutoloGel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Instructions for Use include a detailed description and procedures for making AutoloGel&#xD;
      and a list of the Kit components which is provided at the end of the Instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indications for Use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AutoloGel™ System is intended to be used at point-of-care for the safe and rapid&#xD;
      preparation of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel from a small sample of a patient's own blood.&#xD;
      Under the supervision of a healthcare professional, the PRP gel produced by the AutoloGel™&#xD;
      System is suitable for exuding wounds, such as leg ulcers, pressure ulcers, and diabetic&#xD;
      ulcers and for the management of mechanically or surgically-debrided wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AutoloGel™ System may be used for chronic or surgically-debrided wounds up to twice a&#xD;
      week for eight (8) weeks. The treating health care practitioner may elect to continue the&#xD;
      treatment up to twelve (12) weeks. The AutoloGel™ System should be used in conjunction with&#xD;
      standard of care procedures for comprehensive wound management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Removal of necrotic or infected tissue Off-loading Compression therapy for venous stasis&#xD;
      ulcers Establishment of adequate blood circulation Maintenance of a moist wound environment&#xD;
      Management of wound infection Wound cleansing Nutritional support, including blood glucose&#xD;
      control for subjects with diabetic ulcers Bowel and bladder care for subjects with pressure&#xD;
      ulcers at risk for contamination Management of underlying disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precautions and Warnings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caution. Federal Law (U.S.A.) restricts this device to sale by or on the order of a&#xD;
      Physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precautions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the processing procedure and application of AutoloGel™, use universal precautions&#xD;
      as defined by the facility policy and procedure manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All parts of the procedure shall be performed in such a manner to minimize splashing,&#xD;
      spraying, spattering, and generation of potential droplets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Warnings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AutoloGelTM is produced with the use of bovine thrombin. The use of topical bovine thrombin&#xD;
      preparations has occasionally been associated with abnormalities of hemostasis ranging from&#xD;
      asymptomatic alterations in laboratory determinations, such as prothrombin time (PT) and&#xD;
      partial thromboplastin time (PTT), to severe bleeding or thrombosis which have rarely been&#xD;
      fatal. These hemostatic effects appear to be related to the formation of antibodies against&#xD;
      bovine thrombin and / or factor V which in some cases may cross react with human factor V,&#xD;
      potentially resulting in factor V deficiency. Repeated clinical applications of topical&#xD;
      bovine thrombin increase the likelihood that antibodies against thrombin and / or factor V&#xD;
      may be formed. Consultation with an expert in coagulation disorders is recommended if a&#xD;
      patient exhibits abnormal coagulation laboratory values, abnormal bleeding or abnormal&#xD;
      thrombosis following the use of topical thrombin. Any interventions should consider the&#xD;
      immunologic basis of this condition. Patients with antibodies to bovine thrombin preparations&#xD;
      should not be re-exposed to these products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergic reactions may be encountered in persons known to be sensitive to bovine materials.&#xD;
      Because of thrombin's action in the clotting mechanism, AutoloGel must not be injected or&#xD;
      otherwise allowed to enter large blood vessels. Extensive intravascular clotting and even&#xD;
      death may result.&#xD;
