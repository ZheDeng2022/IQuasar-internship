    <description>The primary aim of the study is to assess CX002, with respect to safety and efficacy during the six months following treatment, in two subject cohorts:&#xD;
When applied as an intradermal implant for the correction of facial nasolabial folds (Nasolabial Fold Cohort). Nasolabial folds were chosen as the fold/wrinkle for treatment as they are often the most severe facial wrinkles, representing a &quot;worst-case&quot; scenario&#xD;
When applied as an intradermal implant for lip augmentation (Lip Augmentation Cohort)</description>
