  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of lipid-based nutrients (LNS), such as Nutributter or fortified spread (FS), have&#xD;
      been associated with improved growth and development outcomes among infants in Ghana and&#xD;
      Malawi. Modified versions of such supplements have been developed to improve their nutrient&#xD;
      density and quality and to lower their costs. Such modified products have proven acceptable&#xD;
      to pregnant women in Malawi and Ghana. In the present trial, the investigators aim to test&#xD;
      the effect of LNS on pregnancy and child outcomes, when given during pregnant and lactating&#xD;
      women and their infants from 6 to 18 months of age. In control groups, participants will&#xD;
      receive either iron+folate tables during pregnancy only or multiple micronutrient tablets&#xD;
      during pregnancy and first six months of lactations. The main hypothesis to be tested&#xD;
      suggests that the mean length-for-age Z-score (LAZ) of 18-month-old infants who received LNS&#xD;
      between 6 and 18 months of age and whose mothers were provided with LNS during pregnancy and&#xD;
      the first 6 months of lactation is higher than the mean LAZ score of same age infants who&#xD;
      received no dietary supplements and whose mothers received iron-folate supplementation during&#xD;
      pregnancy only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To detect the long-term effect of the LNS supplementation, we now propose to conduct a&#xD;
      follow-up study when the children are 9 years old, to see if the intervention had effect on&#xD;
      children's growth, cardiometabolic and respiratory status and neurocognitive development.&#xD;

      Pregnant women will be identified from the antenatal clinics of 4 governmental and 2 other&#xD;
      health centres. A total of 1400 women meeting set criteria will be randomised into receiving&#xD;
      one of the following interventions: 1) Iron and folic acid supplementation to the mother&#xD;
      during pregnancy only (IFA group), 2). Multiple micronutrient supplementation to the mother&#xD;
      during pregnancy and six months thereafter (MMN group), 3) Lipid-based nutrient supplements&#xD;
      to the mother during pregnancy and six months thereafter and to the child from 6 to 18 months&#xD;
      of age (LNS group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mothers will receive LNS or the multiple micronutrients at 2-weekly intervals at their&#xD;
      homes during pregnancy and weekly during first six months of lactation. Children in the LNS&#xD;
      group will receive LNS weekly, starting at 6 months. Mothers will be medically examined and&#xD;
      tested for defined laboratory parameters at enrolment, at 36 gestation weeks, at birth or&#xD;
      soon thereafter, and at 6 months after delivery. Child size will be assessed at birth or soon&#xD;
      thereafter and at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months of age. The mothers will undergo a morbidity&#xD;
      evaluation fortnightly and the children weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      864 mother-infant pairs will undergo the complete intervention and follow-up, as described&#xD;
      above. The remaining 536 participants will undergo a simplified intervention and follow-up,&#xD;
      in which there are no interventions after birth and the child follow-up consists only of 4 3&#xD;
      health centre and one home visits; first at 1 week, then at six weeks (at home) and at 6 and&#xD;
      18 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sub-study on the the development of intestinal microbiome was added in August 2011. This&#xD;
      entails the collection of stool samples from the mother at 1 month after delivery, breast&#xD;
      milk samples from the mothers at 1, 3, and 6 months after delivery and stool and urine&#xD;
      samples from the children repeated during the a8 months of intervention. The aim of this&#xD;
      subproject is to study the development of the infants' intestinal microbiota, its predictors&#xD;
      and its association to child growth and other health outcomes. At the same time point, the&#xD;
      sample size was reduced from 2400 to 1400 participants (due to constraints in funding).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A one year post-intervention follow-up for participants in the complete follow-up was added&#xD;
      to the study protocol in August 2013. The intervention will be stopped when the participants&#xD;
      are 18 months old. Thereafter, there will be an anthropometrirc assessment and blood and&#xD;
      urine draw at the study clinic at 24 and 30 months of age. Stool samples will be collected&#xD;
      from the participants at the age of 21, 24, 27 and 30 months, to study the development of&#xD;
      intestinal microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a follow-up study, when the children are 10 years old, we will assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. child growth using standard anthropometric measures,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. cardiometabolic health by measuring body composition, blood pressure and plasma lipids,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. neurodevelopment by measuring neural function, cognitive skills and education attainment&#xD;
           using EE and EGMA and Raven's questionnaires,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. lung function with spirometry and allergy symptoms and asthma using ISAAC questionnaire.&#xD;
