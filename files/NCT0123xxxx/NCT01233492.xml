      RATIONALE: Giving boron phenylalanine in different ways and measuring it in tissue in&#xD;
      patients with glioblastoma multiforme may help in planning better radiation therapy, such as&#xD;
      boron neutron capture therapy, for patients in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects, best dose boron phenylalanine, and&#xD;
      best way of giving it with or without mannitol in treating patients with glioblastoma&#xD;
      multiforme.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the optimal way to deliver boron phenylalanine (BPA) with or without&#xD;
           mannitol in terms of route (intravenous vs intraarterial), blood-brain barrier&#xD;
           disruption, and dose for use in subsequent therapeutic trials of boron neutron capture&#xD;
           therapy (BNCT) in patients with high-grade glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the toxicity profile of BPA administered intravenously or intra-arterially.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic behavior of BPA using samples of blood, urine, tumor&#xD;
           tissue, normal brain tissue, extracellular fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To produce indicative treatment plans using BPA administered either intravenously or&#xD;
           intra-arterially with or without mannitol to support the design of combination studies&#xD;
           using BPA and thermal neutrons for BNCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the micro-distribution of boron resulting from the different routes of&#xD;
           administration using secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To store surplus tissues removed during the trial for possible future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 1 (Route and Blood Brain Barrier Disruption [BBBD]): Patients receive one dose of&#xD;
           boron phenylalanine intravenously (IV) or intra-arterially (IA) over 2 hours. Some&#xD;
           patients may receive mannitol IA over 30 seconds before receiving boron phenylalanine.&#xD;
           Patients then undergo planned biopsy of the tumor. Some patients may then undergo&#xD;
           immediate surgical debulking of the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Boron distribution data is analyzed to determine the optimal administration schedule.&#xD;
      Patients in stage 2 receives boron phenylalanine via the optimal route established in stage&#xD;
      1. If addition of mannitol is found to be beneficial, then mannitol is used in stage 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 2 (Dose-escalation): Patients receive 1 or 2 doses of boron phenylalanine IV or IA&#xD;
           (as determined in stage 1) over 2 hours on day 1. Patients may also receive mannitol IA&#xD;
           as in stage 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor tissue, normal brain tissue, and cerebrospinal fluid are collected during biopsy and/or&#xD;
      surgery. Some patients undergo blood, urine, extracellular fluid sample collection&#xD;
      periodically for pharmacokinetic studies. Tumor tissue will be stored for future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 7 days and then once a month.&#xD;
