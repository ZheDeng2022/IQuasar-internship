      A total of 90 patients suffering from end stage-IV Fontaine /CLI and diabetic foot with an&#xD;
      ulcerated limb in whom all previous therapeutic strategies failed (e.g. surgical&#xD;
      revascularization) will be selected and undergo local transplantation of ABMSCs. The&#xD;
      efficacy/safety of this therapy will be assessed by using several endpoints such as (a)&#xD;
      prevention of amputation, (b) wound healing and (c) degree of angiogenesis. In order to&#xD;
      assess the limb ischemia and hypoxia the several tests and measurements will be performed&#xD;
      pre- and post transplantation at a variety of time intervals. The measurements include:&#xD;
      TP-toe pressure measurements (by Periflux 5000 Laser Doppler and Oxymetry system), SPP-skin&#xD;
      perfusion pressure, ABI-ankle brachial index, LDP-laser Doppler baseline and heat perfusion&#xD;
      assessment, TcpO2 without and with O2 provocation inhalation test. In addition, a battery of&#xD;
      biochemical and hematological tests of peripheral venous blood sample will be performed.The&#xD;
      quality form &quot;EQ-50&quot; will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.1 Primary objective: To evaluate an efficacy-safety profile of autologous bone marrow stem&#xD;
      cells (ABMSCs) transplantated into chronically and critically ischemic limb (CLI) and into&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The local method of autologous bone marrow stem cells transplantation consists of&#xD;
           harvesting bone marrow from the iliac crest, its separation using cell separator to&#xD;
           generate ABMSCs (CD 34 positive) and their subsequent multiple injections into a limb&#xD;
           suffering from chronic and critical ischemia. The aim of this therapy is to induce&#xD;
           angiogenesis and vasculogenesis which would correct ischemia and hypoxia, improve tissue&#xD;
           perfusion and metabolism and thus prevent limb amputation. Due to correction of hypoxia&#xD;
           and ischemia by improvement of blood supply regeneration of damaged tissues is&#xD;
           initiated. Improved tissue perfusion is achieved by a large number of mediators&#xD;
           including growth and angiogenic factors which in turn stimulate growth of primitive&#xD;
           vessel wall within the ischemic tissue, a part of healing process. In general, such&#xD;
           reparative process could be divided into the initial phase characterized by the release&#xD;
           of inflammatory mediators and neurotransmitters followed by phase of formation of&#xD;
           primitive vascular tubes composed of the endothelial cell precursors which are later on&#xD;
           adhered to and stabilized by pericyte cells. Process of angiogenesis (by sprouting as&#xD;
           well as nonsprouting) takes usually between 4-6 weeks depending on degree of the initial&#xD;
           tissue ischemia and hypoxia. Development of new collateral blood flow in the&#xD;
           ischemic/hypoxic tissue can be monitored by the Laser Doppler - Flowmetry, level of&#xD;
           Transcutaneous TcpO2 and TcpCO2, Toe Pressure and Skin Perfusion Pressure measurements,&#xD;
           the Index Ankle-Arm ABI using Duplex Doppler Ultrasound, angiography, MRI or&#xD;
           alternatively by common methods used in nuclear medicine. Analysis and interpretation of&#xD;
           all these measurements should define degree of efficacy and safety of this therapeutic&#xD;
           modality and may suggest future directions in optimization of this therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PROJECT OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To evaluate an efficacy-safety profile of autologous bone marrow stem&#xD;
      cells (ABMSCs) transplantated into chronically and critically ischemic limb (CLI) and into&#xD;
      diabetic foot in stage IV Fontaine classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: To assess effect of ABMSCs on tissue perfusion of ischemic limb after&#xD;
      transplantation by transcutaneous oximetry and the laser Doppler flowmetry using Periflux&#xD;
      5000 system under normal and provocation test conditions. In addition, wound healing of&#xD;
      ulcers will be evaluated using a planimetry method from photographs of affected skin taken&#xD;
      pre- and post-transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relationship between CD 34 progenitor counts separated on gradient-density separation&#xD;
      centrifuge from Harvest Technologies and overall effectiveness and safety to treat ischemic&#xD;
      limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Priorities: Beside assessment of effectiveness and safety of ABMSCs transplantation ultimate&#xD;
      emphasis will be put on avoiding limb amputation. This has significant socioeconomic impact.&#xD;
      Therefore this project belongs to the priority programs of clinical research in&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY AND PATIENT RECRUITMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 90 patients (45 patients per year) will be recruited over the period of 2 years&#xD;
      for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Separation of ABMSCs and their application:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concentrate of autologous stem cells (CD 34 positive) will be separated from the bone marrow&#xD;
      aspirate using the cell separator from Harvest Technologies. Bone marrow is collected from&#xD;
      both iliac bone shovels according to standard Yamshidi puncture aspiration methodology.&#xD;
      During this procedure the patient is under analgosedation using propophol iv bolus and&#xD;
      physiological signs including blood pressure (BP), pulse, ECG, pO2 saturation are&#xD;
      continuously monitored and adjusted according to needs. In brief, 240 ml of the bone marrow&#xD;
      is aspirated into an aspiration set pre filed with ACD-A anticoagulant (30 ml) by&#xD;
      hematologist and processed using the cell separator from Harvest Technologies. This equipment&#xD;
      is easy to operate and has several advantages compared to other cell separators on the&#xD;
      market. The methodology is (a) simple, easy, fast, and safe using gradient density&#xD;
      centrifugation to separate all blood elements including white cells, platelets, red cells&#xD;
      from collected bone marrow in centrifuge containers into a sample with 5 % hematocrit&#xD;
      (containing ABMSCs and platelets) within 15 minutes. Thereafter 40 ml of sample is aspirated&#xD;
      into a syringe and immediately applied by multiple injections in the ischemic limb. Whole&#xD;
      procedure should take less than one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of quality and clinical effects of ABMSCs transplantation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow will be examined before and after separation of ABMSCs to assess number of CD 34&#xD;
      positive progenitors as well as number of other cellular components including platelets.&#xD;
      Prior- (0 days-baseline) and post transplantation (1, 7, 14, 30, 60, and 120 days) all&#xD;
      patients will undergo following examinations: Laser Doppler Flowmetry - assessment of blood&#xD;
      flow; measurements of transcutaneous oxygen (TcpO2) and CO2 (TcpCO2) levels with and without&#xD;
      provocation test (with O2 inhalation). Complete battery of tests such as CBC and&#xD;
      differential, fibrinogen and CPR will also be established. In addition, ABI-Ankle-Brachial&#xD;
      Index, TP-Toe Pressure, SPP-Skin Perfusion Pressure, Rutherford and Fontaine Cathegory,&#xD;
      analgetics consumption (requirements), claudication interval in non-amputated patients will&#xD;
      also be monitored. These values will be collected and then correlated with the degree of&#xD;
      initial ischemia/hypoxia as well as with changes in ischemia/hypoxia developed within 120&#xD;
      postoperative days (6 intervals).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 / EXPECTED RESULTS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACT Our preliminary pilot data&#xD;
      suggest that in 60% of patients suffering from chronic critical limb ischemia which failed to&#xD;
      common therapy, limb amputations were prevented. In this patients leg wound healed very well&#xD;
      within the 120 days following ABMSCs transplantation. This is a remarkable success when&#xD;
      compared to historical controls with 100% amputations, particularly in ischemic leg at the&#xD;
      end-stages with failed therapy (Rutherford 4-6 and Fontaine IV classification) of CLI and&#xD;
      diabetic foot with wounds. We expect to confirm these results and set a new standard for the&#xD;
      treatment of this condition with ABMSCs transplantation in Faculty Hospital Ostrava and the&#xD;
      Czech Republic as well. We feel that our new treatment will have significant positive&#xD;
      socioeconomic impact on our patients and entire Czech society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5 / MATERIALS AND HUMAN RESOURCES 5.1 Patients included in the project will be examined in&#xD;
      the interventional angiology FN Ostrava laboratory were inclusion end exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be considered. They will be included to the study after completing standard revascularisation&#xD;
      (Bypass or PTA-stent of the leg arteries) treatment, meeting the criteria of end-stage&#xD;
      Fontaine - IV and Rutherford 4-6 classification of the CLI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Entrance examinations - will be carried out by the duplex doppler legs examination,&#xD;
      measuring of ankle pressure, ankle-brachial index and toe pressure, measurement of SPP- skin&#xD;
      perfusion pressure with laser doppler and measurement of transcutaneous TcpO2 and TcpCO2. The&#xD;
      patient will have initial angiographic examination by DSA, CTA or MRA to assess depleted&#xD;
      basic revascularisation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3 Personnel cooperation: The candidate -Vaclav Prochazka, MD, PhD, MSc will coordinate&#xD;
      patients recruitment, entry examinations carry out and will be involved in data collection&#xD;
      and data management. Jaromir Gumulec, MD will participate in the bone marrow collection and&#xD;
      separation and data-processing, blood samples laboratory tests and data management. Prof..&#xD;
      Peter Klement, MVDr, Ph.D. will contribute to ensure the logistics and processing of&#xD;
      statistical datas and ensure the publications and presentations in the foreign journals.&#xD;
      Frantisek Jaluvka, MD will contribute patients hospitalisation to the surgical clinic,&#xD;
      subsequent podology ambulatory care for these patients and will participate in the BMSC&#xD;
      transplantatation procedure to ensure desinfection and sterility of operating environment.&#xD;
      Jana Chmelova, MD. will participate on the transplantation programe procedures, data&#xD;
      processing and ensuring the creation of publications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 / TIME WORK PLAN During the first and second year 45 patients each will be enrolled (in&#xD;
      total 90). All patients will be treated with autologous BMSC Tx and monitoring of clinical&#xD;
      state with endpoints of limb amputation or wound healing will be donne. Hematology datas of&#xD;
      separated bone marrow samples will be analysed and examination of peripheral venous blood&#xD;
      samples laboratory datas at day 0,1,3,7,14,30 will be carried out. Entire datas of tissue&#xD;
      perfusion with laser doppler flow (LDP), including provocation tests and measurements of&#xD;
      TcpO2 and TcpCO2 including inhalation tests for appreciation of the tissue perfusion state&#xD;
      will be evaluated. Ankle pressures with the ABI- index, SPP- skin perfusion pressure and TP-&#xD;
      toe pressure will be examined. Simultaneously dynamic legs scintigraphy before and 6 months&#xD;
      after the procedure will be carried out. In the non-amputated patients claudication interval&#xD;
      will be tested and Rutherford plus Fontaine stage classification will be counted. In the last&#xD;
      3rd year of the project, patients follow-up will continue with data files and statistical&#xD;
      evaluation managements. In the 1st. and 2nd year, interim period report with the economic&#xD;
      data assessment will be taken out and in the 3rd year final report will be completed.&#xD;
