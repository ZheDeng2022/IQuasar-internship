  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This primary aim is to investigate the effect of paracetamol in reducing body temperature in&#xD;
      patients who have sustained traumatic brain injury. This study is also investigating the&#xD;
      safety of paracetamol in this patient population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic head injury is a bruising of areas of the brain that occurs commonly as a result of&#xD;
      a fall or a motor vehicle accident. Unfortunately, this is a common global occurrence and it&#xD;
      occurs both in developing and developed countries. It causes death in nearly 1 in 3 of those&#xD;
      who are most severely affected and a large proportion of those that survive have long-term&#xD;
      physical or mental disability. Hence, traumatic head injury is a major global problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present there are very few therapies that are known to be effective after a traumatic head&#xD;
      injury. In particular the investigators are uncertain about whether modifying body&#xD;
      temperature has any effect (good or bad) on the outcomes of patients. Although, this is&#xD;
      practiced by some intensive care units around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have searched extensively to look for any evidence that altering body&#xD;
      temperature after traumatic head injury improves the outcome of patients (by reducing the&#xD;
      amount of death or disability) and were unable to find any evidence at all. Some preliminary&#xD;
      research in both animal experiments and clinical studies suggest that a raised temperature&#xD;
      after forms of brain injury may in fact be harmful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, at present the investigators believe that we do not really know what effect&#xD;
      changing body temperature after head injury has on the outcome of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are proposing to conduct a clinical study of patients who have had a severe&#xD;
      head injury. The patients will be randomly allocated to 2 groups who will get either regular&#xD;
      Paracetamol (dissolved in fluid) or a bottle of fluid without any Paracetamol. The 2&#xD;
      treatments will look identical and neither the patients nor the health care workers will know&#xD;
      what treatment they are getting. Doing the study in this way will allow us to work out&#xD;
      whether giving Paracetamol reduces the temperature of the body and whether there are any side&#xD;
      effects that occur. If the study shows that Paracetamol can reduce body temperature safely in&#xD;
      this setting then the investigators will work towards doing a larger study of treatments that&#xD;
      reduce body temperature. The purpose of this larger study would be to see if the&#xD;
      investigators can, not only reduce body temperature but also reduce amount of disability&#xD;
      (physical and mental) as well as the death rate in traumatically brain injured patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed study the investigators will be using a higher dose of Paracetamol that is&#xD;
      usually prescribed. Other research has shown that the dose that the investigators are&#xD;
      proposing to use is safe and also that smaller doses in fact do not reduce body temperature.&#xD;
