  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint of this study is to determine what percentage of patients receiving&#xD;
      high-dose Cyclophosphamide may experience a halt in the worsening of their disease or&#xD;
      experience improvement of their disease and for how long the benefit may last.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a common and under-recognized&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy that is thought to be immune-mediated. Randomized, placebo controlled&#xD;
      clinical trials in CIDP demonstrate benefit from treatment with corticosteroids,&#xD;
      plasmapheresis, and IV Ig. However, not all patients respond to these therapies. IV&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, interferons, total lymphoid irradiation, and mycophenolate&#xD;
      mofetil have been proposed as appropriate therapies for refractory patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CIDP often respond to immune-modulating treatment. However, the high rate of&#xD;
      relapse and treatment-related side effects result in poor long-term outcomes for many&#xD;
      patients. CIDP is assumed to be an autoimmune disease, but the pathogenesis is poorly&#xD;
      understood. T cell infiltrates are predominantly CD8, suggesting a T cell mediated process.&#xD;
      There is not, however, restricted T cell receptor Vbeta utilization seen in sural nerve&#xD;
      biopsies. Immunoglobulin and complement deposits noted on the myelin sheaths support an&#xD;
      antibody-mediated process. Antibodies to the P0 myelin protein are seen in a minority of&#xD;
      patients. High-dose cyclophosphamide is believed to eradicate both B and T lymphocytes. This&#xD;
      therapy does not damage hematopoietic stem cells, which allows for rapid white cell recovery&#xD;
      without stem cell rescue.&#xD;
