    <textblock>
      A new working method, i.e. a questionnaire completed at home followed by a patient-centred&#xD;
      preventive health consultation with follow-up, can be used by all general practitioners (GPs)&#xD;
      as a preventive offer to their patients with multiple problems in lifestyle, well-being or&#xD;
      health behaviour, if this project is shown to be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators use a broad preventive offer in a structured way to young adults with&#xD;
      multiple psychosocial problems (a certain risk profile) found by a screening questionnaire&#xD;
      when arriving to the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis of the project is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using the questionnaire and subsequent patient-centred health consultation the GP is able&#xD;
      to support the participants to improve their resources, their well-being and self-estimated&#xD;
      health. Subsequently, relevant changes in health habits and life situation might be initiated&#xD;
      in order to prevent or reduce future problems or illness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main hypothesis of the project is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using the questionnaire and subsequent patient-centred health consultation the GP is able&#xD;
      to contribute to improve the resources of the participants, their well-being and&#xD;
      self-estimated health. Subsequently, relevant changes in health habits and life situation&#xD;
      might be initiated in order to prevent or reduce future problems or illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to test this hypothesis by describing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the participating patients' situation at baseline (resources and problems), and after&#xD;
           one year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the content of the health interview (goals, resources and barriers for change)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  measure change of lifestyle and living conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the economic costs of the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluation of positive and negative effect of the health consultations for the patient&#xD;
           and the GP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partial hypothesis 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large part of the target group experience many strains and have difficulties in fulfilling&#xD;
      their personal expectations to a normal everyday life. Some might have risk behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The object of the project is to answer the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. How is the baseline status of the participants (seven or more risk points) regarding&#xD;
      self-estimated health, resources, family situation and risk score compared with the&#xD;
      non-participants? (Paper 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Does the health consultation and follow-up consultation have effect within a year?&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Initiate request for a change in behaviour within lifestyle and living conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Support a possible request for change by choosing one or two goals, as to somatic,&#xD;
           mental and social issues&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Contribute to an actual change in lifestyle and living conditions, in particular as&#xD;
           regards to work, tobacco, alcohol, diet/weight and exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Contribute to a better self-estimated health&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Contribute to improving resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partial hypothesis 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GP will in the project use a new working method that enables general impression and&#xD;
      support of the individual's resources, which is very unlike the daily consultation, where the&#xD;
      main focus is on risk thinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does the registration by the GP and the patient reflect focus on improving resources?&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Registration of resources and barriers to obtain the goals&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Registration of time aspect to obtain these&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Registration of need for further intervention (by GP or by others)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partial hypothesis 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has an effect to teach the GPs patient-centred preventive health consultation at short&#xD;
      seminars/courses with focus on behavioural psychology, psychosocial medicine, and lifestyle&#xD;
      issues such as tobacco, alcohol, drug abuse, diet / weight and exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Have the GPs changed their view on preventive health consultations during the project&#xD;
           period?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Have the GPs changed their view of changing potentials of their patients because of&#xD;
           their participation in the study?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The practice secretary invites the patients to participate in the research project by asking&#xD;
      all patients between 20-44 years coming to the clinic on a specific day or two in each month&#xD;
      to complete a preliminary questionnaire (Screening questionnaire, SQ) asking 33 questions&#xD;
      about lifestyle, resources, social situation and child problems. The quartile with most&#xD;
      problems is invited to participate in the randomized trial. When five patients are included,&#xD;
      no more patients are screened that day. The included patients receive a questionnaire&#xD;
      (baseline questionnaire, BQ) of 23 pages they have to complete at home and return to the&#xD;
      clinic as basis for the evaluation, the health consultation, and as a priming tool for the&#xD;
      patient before the preventive health consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design The study is a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) with intervention (questionnaires&#xD;
      and patient-centred preventive health consultations) compared with controls (questionnaires&#xD;
      without health consultation). The intervention consisting of two consultations: the first of&#xD;
      60 minutes duration and follow-up of 20 minutes after three months. Both groups had postal&#xD;
      follow-up questionnaires after one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Content of consultations is chosen by the patients, based on their completed questionnaires&#xD;
      and own ideas of main problems, wishes and ability to improve their living conditions, health&#xD;
      and quality of life guided and supported by the GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up after 3, 5 and 10 years is possible. Max 50 GPs can participate in the project&#xD;
      with each max 20 health interviews (including a follow-up within three months) per year. That&#xD;
      means approximately two interviews every month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion period is expected to be about 1½ year from February 1998 to September 1999. A&#xD;
      maximum of 1000 persons in the intervention group and 1000 in the control group can be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation When the BQ is returned to the clinic, the secretary makes a telephone block&#xD;
      randomisation by phoning the project secretary, where every GP has a randomisation scheme&#xD;
      with 40 computer-generated random numbers: 20 even numbers and 20 odd numbers to tick off in&#xD;
      order when used. Patients hitting an even number will be offered a health interview, whereas&#xD;
      patients with odd numbers will have to settle for the inspiration of the questionnaire and&#xD;
      the regular visits to the GP. Both groups will be included in the follow-up schedule after a&#xD;
      year, and possibly after 3, 5 and 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for GPs All 325 GPs in the county will be invited to a weekend course and&#xD;
      offered the possibility to attend the project. If more than 50 GPs have registered for the&#xD;
      project, the county is able to close for more registrations. The project team will organize&#xD;
      and implement relevant courses. Firstly, all the county's GPs are invited to a course on 16&#xD;
      -17 January 1998 or 27-28/3-98 where senior school psychologist Per Kjeldsen, Aalborg, and&#xD;
      clinical psychologist Annette Winter, Aarhus will teach and provide assignments based on&#xD;
      different theories and behavioural problems. The project will be presented. Jens&#xD;
      Tølbøll-Mortensen will teach about occupational medicine. Some meetings on factual knowledge&#xD;
      about alcohol abuse, tobacco, the dietary importance, and cardiovascular diseases will be&#xD;
      held. Furthermore, there will be follow-up courses during the project period about&#xD;
      psychosocial preventive aspects on health and illness behaviour and the &quot;health fraction&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation With a minimal relevant difference in Quality of life (SF12) of 3 (for&#xD;
      example 47 and 50, and SD=10) and a type 1 error (alfa) of 0.05 and a type two error (1-beta)&#xD;
      of 0.80, meaning that the investigators need 178 persons in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material A. The Screening questionnaire, SQ, consists of 33 problem questions within three&#xD;
      main fields: family/social situation, resources and lifestyle. Most of the questions used are&#xD;
      taken from different questionnaires used in other national and international studies, and&#xD;
      some are constructed by KSF in accordance with psychosocial literature and 25 years&#xD;
      experience as a GP. The number of problems is decisive for whether the patient will be&#xD;
      included in the project or not. The quartile with most problems could be included. Some of&#xD;
      the questions were binary and some had a five-graded answer category, where the three worst&#xD;
      categories were defined as having a problem. After pilot-testing in four clinics the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria were seven or more problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Baseline questionnaire, BQ consists of about 80 questions about family situation,&#xD;
      resources, work, education, quality of life, health, disease and health behaviour,&#xD;
      consumption of food, medicine, tobacco, alcohol and drugs. The BQ was based on the Danish&#xD;
      population health and illness statistics every five years (Danish Institute of Clinical&#xD;
      Epidemiology, DIKE), international studies, and a former study on preventive health&#xD;
      consultations in Region North, Denmark. The 23-page questionnaire is to be completed by the&#xD;
      patient at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. In the last part of the health consultation the patient and the GP have to complete the&#xD;
      dialogue chart (DC1), together, evaluating the health consultation's objectives, the&#xD;
      patient's goals, and patient's resources, barriers and time needed to obtain these goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. After the 3-month follow-up a similar DC2 was completed. E. A GP's evaluation form&#xD;
      completed by the GP before and after the study. F. An intermediate telephone interview of the&#xD;
      participating GPs by KSF. G. A one-year follow-up questionnaire, OQ is almost identical to&#xD;
      the BQ questionnaire, but added a few final questions. The OQ questionnaire was mailed to&#xD;
      both groups and completed at home, and returned to the project secretary by post.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention elements&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Courses for the GPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Questionnaires to the patients (interventions and controls). 2a. Screening questionnaire&#xD;
           (SQ). 2b. Baseline questionnaire (BQ). 2c. One year questionnaire (OQ).&#xD;
