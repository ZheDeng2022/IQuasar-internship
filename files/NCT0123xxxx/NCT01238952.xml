  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase II dose of&#xD;
      the combination regimen of NK012 and carboplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NK012 will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion, followed by a 30 minute carboplatin IV&#xD;
      infusion. Both drugs will be administered once every 28 days. Treatment is expected to&#xD;
      continue for 6 cycles, unless disease progression or the development of unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
      requires discontinuation of the drug. At the discretion of the investigator, patients who&#xD;
      show signs of benefit may continue beyond 6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a MTD/RD has been determined, a dose expansion cohort of patients with metastatic triple&#xD;
      negative breast cancer will be treated at the determined MTD.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced solid tumor for which&#xD;
             no efficacious therapy exists, or for which a camptothecin-based regimen would be&#xD;
             appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. For the dose expansion at the MTD/RD only:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients must have triple-negative breast cancer with locally advanced disease&#xD;
                  for which there is no surgical option, or stage IV disease. Triple-negative&#xD;
                  breast cancer is defined as HER2-negative, ER-negative, and PR-negative as&#xD;
                  follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  For HER2- negative (must meet one of the following 3):&#xD;
&#xD;
                  ( i) FISH negative (ratio &lt;2.2); or ( ii) IHC 0 or 1+; or (iii) IHC 2+ or 3+ and&#xD;
                  FISH negative (ratio &lt;2.2) For ER negative and PR negative: ≤ 10% tumor staining&#xD;
                  by IHC&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. No less than one and no more than two prior chemotherapy regimens for advanced or&#xD;
                  metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Patients must have measurable disease by RECIST (version 1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have recovered from all acute adverse effects of prior therapies,&#xD;
             excluding alopecia.&#xD;

          4. For patients enrolled in the dose escalation phase, no more than 4 prior cytotoxic&#xD;

&#xD;
             * Cockcroft-Gault formula for creatinine clearance (CrCl): Males: CrCl (ml/min) = (140&#xD;
             - age) x wt (kg) / (serum creatinine x 72) Females: Multiply the above result by 0.85&#xD;
&#xD;
