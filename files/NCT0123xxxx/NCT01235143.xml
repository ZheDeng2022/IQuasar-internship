  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sevoflurane is the volatile anesthetic agent of choice in pediatric surgery. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      sevoflurane anesthesia had the high incidence of emergence delirium compared to halothane and&#xD;
      isoflurane.Bortone L et al.reported isoflurane for maintenance decreased incidence of&#xD;
      emergence agitation compared to sevoflurane in unpremedicated preschool children under&#xD;
      elective subumbilical surgery (32% versus 52% respectively). Desflurane is the new volatile&#xD;
      anesthetic agent which provides faster recovery compared to sevoflurane.Valley et al.reported&#xD;
      no significant differences between sevoflurane or desflurane anesthesia in children in term&#xD;
      of the serious airway complication such as laryngospasm or desaturation excepted the number&#xD;
      of coughing episodes were more frequent in the desflurane compared to sevoflurane (36 versus&#xD;
      18).Mayer J et al. reported sevoflurane had severity of Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence&#xD;
      Delirium (PAED) scale higher than desflurane in ear, nose, throat inpatient surgery in&#xD;
      children (12(2-20) versus 6(0-15) respectively) with no reported of incidence of emergence&#xD;
      agitation between those two. Therefore, the investigators would like to compare the incidence&#xD;
      of emergence agitation, recovery profile and respiratory events between desflurane and&#xD;
      sevoflurane anesthesia in pediatric ambulatory urologic surgery under general anesthesia and&#xD;
      combined with regional anesthesia.&#xD;

      After institutional review board (Prince of Songkla University, Songkhla, Thailand) approval&#xD;
      and written informed consent from parents, 136 children aged 1-9 years, with American Society&#xD;
      of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I or II ,scheduled to undergoing elective&#xD;
      ambulatory urologic surgery under general anesthesia combined with regional block , were&#xD;
      prospectively enrolled in the study. Children were randomized by a computer-generated program&#xD;
      to either sevoflurane group (group s, n =68) or desflurane group (group d, n =68) for&#xD;
      maintenance of anesthesia . Exclusion criterion included emergency procedures, medical&#xD;
      contraindication to placement of a caudal block, mental retardation, developmental delay,&#xD;
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, psychiatric illness, a history of paradoxical&#xD;
      excitation with sedatives. Children did not receive any premedication. Parents were allowed&#xD;
      to be present for induction. Children's behavior was assessed at the time of separation from&#xD;
      parents by using a separation scale 1-4 (1= excellent [separates easily] , 2= good [not&#xD;
      clinging, whimpers ,calm with reassurance] , 3 = fair [not clinging , cried , will not calm&#xD;
      or quiet] , 4 = poor [crying , clinging to parent]11 . A separation score of 1 or 2 was&#xD;
      considered satisfactory , whereas a score of 3 or 4 was considered unsatisfactory. An&#xD;
      induction scale 1-4 was used to assess acceptance of the anesthetic mask ( 1 = excellent&#xD;
      [unafraid, co-operate, accepts mask readily], 2 = good [slight fear of mask , easily calmed]&#xD;
      , 3 = fair[ moderated fear , not calmed with reassurance] ,4 = poor [terrified , crying&#xD;
      ,agitated]11. An induction score of 1 or 2 was considered satisfactory , whereas a score of 3&#xD;
      or 4 was considered unsatisfactory. Then , children received a mask induction with either&#xD;
      incremental sevoflurane 2-8% or single breath sevoflurane 8% in a 70 % nitrous oxide and 30%&#xD;
      oxygen mixture with a 10 L/min fresh gas flow. After inhalation anesthetic induction , an&#xD;
      intravenous cannula were place. Ventilation was controlled by laryngeal mask airway (LMA).&#xD;
      After established the airway, children were assigned to receive either sevoflurane or&#xD;
      desflurane by adjusting end-tidal concentration to deliver a minimum alveolar anesthetic&#xD;
      concentration(MAC) of 1. The nitrous oxide in oxygen concentration was reduced to 66% and&#xD;
      total gas flow rate was reduced to 5 LMP . All regional block; penile block, ilioinguinal&#xD;
      nerve block and caudal block , were performed by discretion of attending anesthesiologist&#xD;
      based on routine practice and type of operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative analgesics or other sedative drug were not given unless the child's heart rate&#xD;
      increase &gt; 20% of baseline after incision or during operation and then fentanyl 0.5-1 mcg/kg&#xD;
      intravenously was given to supplement analgesia throughout the operation. At the start of&#xD;
      surgical closure, the inhaled anesthetic was discontinued. When the wound closure was&#xD;
      completed , the nitrous oxide was discontinued with the oxygen flow rate was increase to 10&#xD;
      LMP. The awake LMA removal was followed by extubation criteria. The children were then&#xD;
      transported to the post-anesthetic care unit (PACU). The awakening time defined by the time&#xD;
      after discontinued inhaled agent until LMA was removed. Duration of surgery and anesthesia&#xD;
      were also recorded. The emergence agitation score was assessed by 3 experienced PACU nurse,&#xD;
      blinded to the inhaled anesthetic agents. The emergence agitation score 1-4 and duration of&#xD;
      agitation were measured in the PACU (1= awake and calm , cooperative ; 2 = crying, requires&#xD;
      consoling ; 3 = irritable/restless , screaming , inconsolable ; 4 = combative ,disoriented,&#xD;
      thrashing)11. Children with an agitation score of 3 or 4 were classified agitated. Parent&#xD;
      were reunited with their children in the PACU after an initial admission and stabilization&#xD;
      phase. The pain score 1-10 using the FLACC under the age of 5 and the Face Pain Scale or the&#xD;
      Numeric Rating Scale in older children was assessed by the same PACU nurse. If the children&#xD;
      had severely agitated by agitation score &gt; 3 for 5 minutes or pain score ≥ 4, the fentanyl&#xD;
      0.5 mcg/kg was administered intravenously every 10-15 min for treatment of agitation or&#xD;
      rescue analgesia. Maximum agitation score and maximum pain score were recorded in the PACU.&#xD;
      Duration in PACU stay defined by the time arrived in the PACU until discharge from PACU were&#xD;
      also recorded. Intraoperative respiratory adverse events and PACU adverse events were&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective was to compare the incidence of emergence agitation between sevoflurane&#xD;
      anesthesia and desflurane anesthesia in pediatric ambulatory urologic surgery. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives were to compare the recovery profile such as awakening time. Duration of PACU&#xD;
      stay, and also intraoperative and PACU respiratory adverse events between sevoflurane&#xD;
      anesthesia and desflurane anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistic analysis The sample size calculation by program R 2.8.1 was based on the&#xD;
      incidence of sevoflurane induced emergence agitation 52% by Bortone, et al 4 . the&#xD;
      investigators calculated a sample size of 62 subjects per treatment arm wound have at least&#xD;
      an 80% power to detect desflurane reduced of 50% compared to sevoflurane in the incidence of&#xD;
      emergency agitation. The calculation was included the 10% dropout of the study, so 136&#xD;
      children were enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Date were reported as mean±SD , median (range). Continuous data such as age, weight. duration&#xD;
      of surgery, duration of anesthesia, awakening time, onset of agitation , duration of&#xD;
      agitation, duration of PACU stay and PACU pain score were analyzed by unpaired Student's&#xD;
      test. Categorical data such as gender , ASA physical status, a separation scale, an induction&#xD;
      scale, type of operation, type of operation, an emergence agitation scale, intraoperative and&#xD;
      PACU adverse events were compared using the Pearson's chi-square test. Incidence of emergence&#xD;
      agitation and other adverse events were reported as number and percent (n, %). A P value of&#xD;
      0.05 was considered for statistical significance.&#xD;
