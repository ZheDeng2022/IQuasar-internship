    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), especially atherosclerotic coronary heart disease and stroke,&#xD;
      are the leading causes of death globally. Important risk factors for CVDs include elevated&#xD;
      serum levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein(LDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides,&#xD;
      and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. Elevated &quot;oxidized&quot; LDL, a&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory villain, has also emerged as an important risk factor for the development of&#xD;
      CVDs. There is a growing need to identify safe and effective nutritional interventions that&#xD;
      offer a clinical benefit aimed at reducing one more of the risk factors for CVDs. Data from&#xD;
      many studies in humans have shown various health benefits provided by dietary fiber intake,&#xD;
      including an inverse association with the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The&#xD;
      primary purpose of this study is to determine whether daily consumption for 6 weeks of&#xD;
      chitin-glucan, a fiber purified from a microorganism, is effective at reducing the amount of&#xD;
      oxidized LDL in humans with borderline-to-high LDL-cholesterol. The effects of chitin-glucan&#xD;
      on other cardiovascular risk factors will also be evaluated.&#xD;

      Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), especially atherosclerotic coronary heart disease and stroke,&#xD;
      are the leading causes of death globally. Important risk factors for CVDs include elevated&#xD;
      serum levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides,&#xD;
      and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels. Oxidized LDL has also been&#xD;
      identified as a risk factor for CVDs. There is a growing need to identify safe and effective&#xD;
      interventions that offer a clinical benefit aimed at reducing one more of the risk factors&#xD;
      for CVDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidized LDL is a unique plaque-specific protein produced in the arterial wall by the&#xD;
      oxidative modification of the apoB-100 moiety of native LDL mediated by reactive oxygen&#xD;
      species. Oxidized LDL is a powerful atherogenic protein, which is directly involved in the&#xD;
      initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, the main cause of coronary artery disease&#xD;
      (CAD). It is now widely believed that for native LDL to be atherogenic, it must be converted&#xD;
      to oxidized LDL. Oxidized LDL is found in atherosclerotic lesions and in the circulation, but&#xD;
      not in normal arteries. Oxidized LDL is both a biomarker of accelerated atherosclerosis and a&#xD;
      mediator of the atherosclerotic disease process. In 1998, Holvoet et al demonstrated for the&#xD;
      first time that elevated circulating levels of oxidized LDL were found in most untreated&#xD;
      patients with both stable CAD and acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina; acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction). In this landmark study, oxidized LDL levels were measured in plasma with an&#xD;
      ELISA procedure using the oxidized LDL-specific, murine monoclonal antibody, 4E6. Mercodia's&#xD;
      commercially available oxidized LDL ELISA kits use Holvoet's monoclonal antibody, 4E6, which&#xD;
      is specific for oxidatively modified LDL. The 4E6 antibody is directed against a&#xD;
      conformational epitope in the apoprotein(apo)B-100 moiety of LDL that is generated as a&#xD;
      consequence of aldehyde substitution of the lysine residues of apoB-100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from epidemiological studies have shown various health benefits provided by dietary&#xD;
      fiber intake, including an inverse association with the risk of CVDs. As shown in several&#xD;
      well-controlled clinical trials, various water-soluble dietary fibers reduced total&#xD;
      cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol while HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides were not&#xD;
      significantly influenced. Recently, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) authorized a&#xD;
      health claim related to the maintenance of normal blood cholesterol concentrations for&#xD;
      soluble cereal fibres, particularly beta-glucans from oat and barley. The beta-glucans in&#xD;
      these cereals are non-starch polysaccharides consisting of (1→3,1→4)-beta-D-linked glucose&#xD;
      units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have addressed potential favorable effects of beta-glucans from micro-organisms&#xD;
      on CVD risk factors. One clinical study examined the effects of yeast-derived beta-glucan, a&#xD;
      glucose polymer with beta-(1→3,1→6) linkages, on serum lipids in 15 hypercholesterolemic&#xD;
      obese men. At the end of the 8-week treatment period (15 g fiber/day in addition to the&#xD;
      normal diet), total cholesterol levels were decreased whereas HDL-cholesterol,&#xD;
      LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides did not differ significantly from the baseline values. A&#xD;
      number of animal studies showed that consumption of fungi or fungal extract can lower blood&#xD;
      cholesterol or reduce aortic atherosclerotic lesions in rabbits fed a high-cholesterol diet&#xD;
      or in atherosclerosis-susceptible apolipoprotein E-deficient mice fed a normal. It should be&#xD;
      noted that the fungal component(s) causing these effects have not been identified or&#xD;
      characterized (whole mushrooms or an impure extract were tested).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chitin-glucan is a natural component of the cell wall of microscopic fungi. Chitin-glucan can&#xD;
      be regarded as an insoluble dietary fiber. In hamsters fed an atherogenic diet, chitin-glucan&#xD;
      mixed with food lowered plasma triglycerides and markedly reduced the diet-induced formation&#xD;
      of aortic fatty streak lesions. It also reduced aortic cholesterol, cardiac superoxide anion&#xD;
      production and hepatic malondialdehyde, and increased hepatic antioxidant enzyme activities&#xD;
      (glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase). Although oxidized LDL was not measured in&#xD;
      this study, data from an early clinical trial indicated that consumption of chitin-glucan for&#xD;
      28 days decreased circulating oxidized LDL by approximately 26% in healthy,&#xD;
      normo-cholesterolemic young males.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To confirm these results in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study using males&#xD;
      and females with broader inclusion criteria, chitin-glucan will be evaluated alone (at 1.5&#xD;
      and 4.5 grams per day), and in combination with olive extract (chitin-glucan at 1.5 gram per&#xD;
      day + olive extract at 135 mg per day). There is a large body of evidence that indicates that&#xD;
      olive oil recapitulates many of the beneficial effects on human health, including a reduced&#xD;
      risk for developing CVDs, that are reported for intake of the Mediterranean Diet. Numerous&#xD;
      studies performed in vitro and in vivo have concluded that polyphenolic compounds present in&#xD;
      extra virgin olive oil play an important role in the prevention of atherosclerotic damage&#xD;
      through their inhibition of LDL oxidation. Tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol show dose-dependent&#xD;
      activity in this regard and are considered potent antioxidants, demonstrating activity in the&#xD;
      micromolar range. Thus, there is a solid scientific and clinical rationale to evaluate both&#xD;
      chitin-glucan alone and in combination with olive extract for their ability to reduce&#xD;
      oxidized LDL.&#xD;
