  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-centre, assessor-blind, randomised controlled phase III trial in&#xD;
      patients with with complete or incomplete spinal cord injury between C6 and T12. A total of&#xD;
      188 participants will be randomised into two groups, the experimental group and the control&#xD;
      group. The control group participants will receive an upper body strength and fitness&#xD;
      program, conducted for 2-3 hours, three times per week for 12 weeks, while the experimental&#xD;
      group participants will receive a comprehensive full body exercise program, conducted for 2-3&#xD;
      hours, three times per week for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to determine if the experimental exercise program is more&#xD;
      effective than the upper body strength and fitness program in promoting neurological&#xD;
      improvement in participants with spinal cord injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total study duration is 3.5 years, including a 24 month recruitment period, a 12-week&#xD;
      treatment period followed by 6 month and 12 month (from baseline) follow up assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed by a blinded assessor (the assessor will not know which group&#xD;
      the participants are in) using standard physiotherapy, neurophysiological, fitness and&#xD;
      functional tests, psychological and quality of life questionnaires, as well as tests of&#xD;
      immune function and bone structure.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in Group A will receive a triad of interventions comprising body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) using the Therastride Treadmill System, functional electrical stimulation (FES)-assisted cycling, and trunk and upper and lower limb exercise. These interventions will be provided at the spinal unit.</description>

    <description>Participants in Group B will receive an upper body strength and fitness program. This program may be provided at the spinal unit, or an appropriately equipped gymnasium as approved by the SCIPA Full-On Project Committee. It will be based on the Burn Rubber Burn (BRB) exercise program already established in Sydney. BRB is a circuit-based exercise program incorporating resistance and cardiovascular training. For this protocol, the circuit will comprise several stations using different pieces of equipment.</description>
