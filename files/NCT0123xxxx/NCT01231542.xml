      This study will be a phase I, open label, two arm, fixed sequence crossover study to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of rifampin and rifabutin on the steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      GSK1349572 and the safety and tolerability of GSK1349572 and rifamycin co-administration.&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled in Arm 1 will receive GSK1349572 50 mg once daily for 7 days, GSK1348572 50&#xD;
      mg twice daily for 7 days, and GSK1349572 50 mg twice daily in combination with rifampin 600&#xD;
      mg once daily for 14 days. Subjects in Arm 2 will receive GSK1349572 50 mg once daily for 7&#xD;
      days and GSK1349572 50 mg once daily in combination with rifabutin 300 mg once daily for 14&#xD;
      days. Serial PK sampling will be completed following the last dose of each treatment. Safety&#xD;
      and tolerability will be assessed throughout the study through assessment of adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs), and clinical laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted at one center in the US with healthy adult male and female&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
