  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is common among Native Hawaiians and Pacific Peoples. Diabetes related&#xD;
      complications decrease quality of life and can result in early morbidity. The purpose of the&#xD;
      Partners in Care diabetes self-management educational intervention is to teach participants&#xD;
      how to manage their diabetes to avoid or delay diabetes-related complications and how to&#xD;
      better work with their health care team.&#xD;

      This is a feasibility study using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design in which 100&#xD;
      Native Hawaiians (NHs) and other Pacific Islanders (PPs) will be randomized to either a&#xD;
      3-month diabetes self-management group (DSMG; N=50) or a delayed intervention control group&#xD;
      (CG; N=50). Participants in the DSMG will receive culturally-tailored, group diabetes&#xD;
      self-management education delivered in a community setting by trained community peer&#xD;
      educators. To meet this objective, we have partnered with four community-based organizations:&#xD;
      1) Hawai'i Maoli Association of Hawaiian Civic Clubs, 2) Ke Ola Mamo Native Hawaiian Health&#xD;
      Care System, 3) Kokua Kalihi Valley Comprehensive Family Services, and 4) Kula No NƒÅ Po'e&#xD;
      Hawai'i. These four organizations provide services to a large number of Pacific People to&#xD;
      include, but not limited to, Native Hawaiians, Samoans, Filipinos, and Chuukese. They already&#xD;
      have intervention research experience as members of the PILI 'Ohana CBPR Project. The 3-month&#xD;
      face-to-face intervention will be community-based and community-led by trained community peer&#xD;
      educators from these four partnering community organizations. Individuals with a hemoglobin&#xD;
      A1c (HbA1c; average blood sugar levels) &gt;=8% will be recruited for the study because they&#xD;
      represent the most at-risk for diabetes-related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over a 1-year accrual period, the community partners will recruit and enroll 100 eligible NHs&#xD;
      and PPs (25 participants per a participating community), as well as deliver and evaluate the&#xD;
      intervention in their respective community settings. The primary outcomes of our study are&#xD;
      hemoglobin A1c and self-reported diabetes specific quality of life. Secondary outcomes are&#xD;
      cholesterol levels (including HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, and triglycerides), blood&#xD;
      pressure, body mass index, and psychosocial adaptation.&#xD;
