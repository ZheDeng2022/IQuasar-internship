  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2009 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Influenza A H1N1 (swine 'flu)&#xD;
      outbreak the first global pandemic of this century. It is thought to have been responsible&#xD;
      for 16,226 deaths globally as of 21st February 2010. The investigators know from previous&#xD;
      influenza outbreaks that the number of cases also tends to increase during the winter season&#xD;
      of the years after a pandemic. There is concern that last year's pandemic influenza strain&#xD;
      will return this winter and it has, therefore, been included in WHO's recommendations for&#xD;
      seasonal influenza vaccine combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the duration of the immune response to the H1N1 influenza vaccines&#xD;
      given last year, and how children will respond to this year's seasonal trivalent influenza&#xD;
      vaccine (which includes the H1N1 strain). Participating children would receive one dose of a&#xD;
      licensed seasonal influenza vaccine and blood tests would be taken before and after&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Autumn 2009 the investigators undertook a study assessing the safety and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      a two-dose schedule of the two Influenza A (H1N1) vaccines purchased by the UK Government,&#xD;
      the non-adjuvanted whole virion vaccine and the ASO3-adjuvanted split-virion, in children&#xD;
      aged 6 months to 12 years of age. 937 children completed the study by protocol and the main&#xD;
      findings were that the adjuvanted vaccine, while reactogenic, was more immunogenic especially&#xD;
      in younger children (seroconversion in children under 3 years of age was 98.2% vs. 80.1%,&#xD;
      p=0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following events in Australia, and regardless of the formal investigation outcome, it is&#xD;
      imperative to study the reactogenicity of UK seasonal influenza vaccines in children who had&#xD;
      previously received immunization with adjuvanted H1N1 vaccines. It would be particularly&#xD;
      important to gain early information on the fever rates in young children in order to assess&#xD;
      whether these are higher than expected and carry a potential risk of febrile convulsions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also important to determine the immunogenicity of trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine&#xD;
      in children previously given univalent pandemic influenza vaccine. There is emerging data&#xD;
      that different priming strategies with adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted vaccines may lead to&#xD;
      considerable differences in the response to subsequent influenza vaccines. In the head to&#xD;
      head paediatric study unpublished analyses show significantly lower immunogenicity in&#xD;
      children who had received seasonal influenza vaccines in the past, despite the receipt of two&#xD;
      doses of either Pandemrix or Celvepan. In addition, unpublished data from a manufacturer&#xD;
      study suggests a negative effect of two doses of Pandemrix on immune responses to subsequent&#xD;
      seasonal vaccine when given 3 weeks after the second dose (personal communication to E Miller&#xD;
      from MHRA). Alternatively, as shown with pandemic H5N1 influenza vaccine, there may be a&#xD;
      significant booster response to a subsequent dose following priming 6 or 14 months&#xD;
      previously. However, this has not been demonstrated with either Pandemrix or Celvapan, and it&#xD;
      is unknown how previous vaccination with these vaccines will affect the immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      H1N1 component of an unadjuvanted trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine given a year later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore propose a follow-on study to compare firstly, the persistence of&#xD;
      antibody against the A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) virus after the use of these novel H1N1&#xD;
      influenza vaccines and secondly the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of one dose of a&#xD;
      non-adjuvanted trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine in children, after receiving a two-dose&#xD;
      immunisation regimen of either Pandemrix or Celvapan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous pandemics, there have been further waves of infection in the subsequent influenza&#xD;
      seasons, particularly when the pandemic strain has drifted antigenically. It is important&#xD;
      therefore to study the persistence of antibody against pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infection&#xD;
      in children, particularly those for whom seasonal influenza vaccine will not be recommended&#xD;
      next year. Should a drifted H1N1 strain emerge next season, sera from children vaccinated in&#xD;
      2009 with the A/California/7/2009(H1N1) strain could be used to assess the likely cross&#xD;
      protection to such a drifted strain. The existence of this unique cohort of almost 1000&#xD;
      children will allow information on antibody persistence to be generated for both the&#xD;
      non-adjuvanted whole virion vaccine (Celvapan) or the ASO3-adjuvanted split-virion vaccine&#xD;
      (Pandemrix) and would provide a valuable source of sera to assess cross protection in the&#xD;
      event of emergence of a drifted strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore propose a follow-on study to compare firstly, the persistence of&#xD;
      antibody against the A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) virus after the use of these novel H1N1&#xD;
      influenza vaccines and secondly the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of one dose of a&#xD;
      nonadjuvanted trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine in children, after receiving a two-dose&#xD;
      immunisation regimen of either Pandemrix or Celvapan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This follow-on study will also provide an important opportunity to provide data on the long&#xD;
      term safety of the Pandemrix and Celvapan vaccines prior to enrolment in the follow-on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a non-adjuvanted trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine, FluarixÂ®&#xD;
      (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Dresden, Germany). It is approved by the EMEA for prophylaxis&#xD;
      of influenza in all ages and has been marketed since 1987. It has consistently been shown to&#xD;
      meet or exceed the regulatory criteria for immunogenicity against the three strains H1N1,&#xD;
      H3N2 and B, and has a good safety profile. (18) Although the option of receiving this vaccine&#xD;
      (and having a blood test to assess the immune response to this vaccine) will be offered to&#xD;
      all participants in the study, participants (or parents/ guardians, on the participant's&#xD;
      behalf) may decline to receive this vaccine and the second blood test. These participants&#xD;
      would still be eligible to take part in the study for the first blood test assessing the&#xD;
      persistence of antibody from the original study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persistence of seroprotection will be assessed by both haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and&#xD;
      microneutralisation (MN). Although EMEA guidelines for licensure of influenza vaccine are&#xD;
      based on HI assays, the primary objective for this study uses MN titres as its measure. The&#xD;
      decision for the preference of MN titres over HI titres was made based on recently published&#xD;
      observations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)(19, 20) and results from&#xD;
      the Health Protection Agency's own analysis, which showed that the MN assay generally yields&#xD;
      higher titres and detected more seroconversions to A/California/04/2009 than the HI assay&#xD;
      (although both generally show high correlation). The investigators therefore used MN titres&#xD;
      as the primary outcome measure in the original NIHR funded study (Clinicaltrials.gov&#xD;
      registration number: NCT00980850)(1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cellular immune response to influenza immunisation will be assessed in children where&#xD;
      sufficient blood is available and local laboratory facilities permit. Elispot assays will be&#xD;
      carried out using PBMCs isolated from the blood to determine the T cell response to internal&#xD;
      influenza antigens, and haemagglutinin (pandemic H1, seasonal H1 and seasonal H3).&#xD;
      Exploratory flow cytometry assays may also be used to determine whether the T cells are CD4+&#xD;
      or CD8+, and to examine cytokine secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RNA expression profiles pre and post vaccination will be scrutinised in 20 participants in&#xD;
      each group to elucidate genes that are differentially expressed in response to immunisation.&#xD;
      This analysis could highlight genes of particular importance in vaccine responses.&#xD;
      Furthermore, comparisons between RNA profiles and correlates of vaccine immunity may identify&#xD;
      profiles which could be useful 'biomarkers' of vaccine induced cellular and humoral immunity&#xD;
      in future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With appropriate consent, serum samples remaining after the analyses required for this study&#xD;
      will be stored for use in future infection and immunity related research studies at the&#xD;
      relevant study sites.&#xD;

        We intend to recruit all interested participants who completed the original NIHR funded&#xD;
        study (NCT00980850)(1) (n=937) into groups 1 &amp; 2 outlined in table one above. It is&#xD;
        anticipated that approximately 66% of these participants are likely to take part in this&#xD;
        follow-on study; therefore the study population for groups 1 &amp; 2 is likely to be&#xD;
        approximately 560 children. As the option of only having a blood sample taken at visit 1&#xD;
        will be made available to participants in this study, there will be two cohorts of&#xD;
        participants: the 'persistence' cohort (consenting to the baseline blood test alone) and&#xD;
        the 'booster' cohort (consenting to the baseline blood test, seasonal influenza vaccine and&#xD;
        post-immunisation blood test).&#xD;
