  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women Teaching Women (WTW) is proposed by a team of Washington University investigators who&#xD;
      have focused on HIV prevention efforts among out-of-treatment injecting drug users (IDUs) and&#xD;
      crack cocaine users, since 1988. Our peer-delivered prevention model was successful in&#xD;
      reducing cocaine use among men. The investigators believe no differences were found in drug&#xD;
      and sexual risk behaviors for women because the intervention lacked gender-specificity. Thus,&#xD;
      the investigators propose to tailor our previous intervention to women's needs to determine&#xD;
      the shorter and intermediate term effectiveness of a gender-specific model on reducing drug&#xD;
      use and sexual risks. The urgency for women-focused interventions is highlighted by&#xD;
      increasing HIV/STD rates among women nationwide. The intervention is designed to bring the&#xD;
      HIV prevention message to women in a public health environment. The three-arm intervention,&#xD;
      which targets out-of-treatment drug-using women, will assess the differential impact of a&#xD;
      woman-centered standard intervention alone, the same standard intervention plus a well-woman&#xD;
      exam, and those plus the addition of 4 educational sessions. This proposal responds to two&#xD;
      NIDA PAs: 95-083 (Women's HIV Risk and Protective Behaviors) and 96-018 (Drug Abuse&#xD;
      Prevention Intervention for Women and Minorities). Our risk reduction, epidemiological and&#xD;
      technology transfer aims include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk Reduction Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruit out-of-treatment female drug injectors, heroin, crack/cocaine and&#xD;
           methamphetamine users to into an intervention aimed at reducing high risk sexual and&#xD;
           drug use behaviors. Street outreach, bars and clubs, shelters, health fairs and daycare&#xD;
           facilities will be used to reach these vulnerable women at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Administer a modified theory-based, peer-delivered, gender and culture-specific&#xD;
           intervention that encourages women to reduce their high risk drug and sexual behaviors.&#xD;
           Women will be randomly assigned to one of three peer-delivered interventions: a modified&#xD;
           NIDA Cooperative Agreement Standard Intervention (SI), the SI + Well-Woman Exam&#xD;
           (SI+WWE), or the SI+Well-Woman Exam + 4 Educational Sessions (SI+WWE+4ES). The Standard&#xD;
           Intervention will be delivered by peers; the Well-Woman Examination will be conducted by&#xD;
           a nurse practitioner; the four 2 hour educational sessions will be conducted by peer&#xD;
           facilitators from area drug treatment programs paired with a community mental health or&#xD;
           health professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the effectiveness of the interventions in reducing drug and sexual risk at 4 and&#xD;
           12 months post-intervention, controlling for baseline characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate the relative cost-effectiveness of each intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Epidemiologic Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assess: a) incidence of HIV, Hepatitis B and C, syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea 12&#xD;
           months post-intervention; b) change in HIV risk and drug and alcohol use at 4 and 12&#xD;
           months post-intervention; c) the effect of psychopathology on behavior change at 12&#xD;
           months post-intervention; d) lifetime history of substance abuse and service utilization&#xD;
           for mental and physical problems at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Technology Transfer Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Disseminate findings to the scientific community, practitioners and community members in&#xD;
           formats that are appropriate, understandable, and usable in order that the best possible&#xD;
           women-centered intervention can be developed for reducing HIV risk behaviors. The&#xD;
           investigators propose to create a WebSite and present findings at local, national and&#xD;
           international symposia. Manuals describing the interventions will be developed and made&#xD;
           available to the field.&#xD;
