  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients receiving hemodialysis treatment (CKD stage 5) suffer&#xD;
      from a variety of co-morbid diseases, many of which may be mechanistically linked. Protein&#xD;
      malnutrition, muscle catabolism and wasting are especially common, and these lead to reduced&#xD;
      muscle strength, declines in physical function, and low levels of physical activity. Physical&#xD;
      inactivity exacerbates these functional declines, and also promotes cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (CVD) and bone disorders. This cycle of disease and disability greatly reduces quality of&#xD;
      life (QOL) and increases mortality rates in dialysis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many factors contribute to the development of these co-morbidities. Chronic inflammation is&#xD;
      believed to be a cause and a consequence of the protein malnutrition, CVD and bone disorders&#xD;
      in dialysis patients. In addition, abnormalities in mineral metabolism resulting from the&#xD;
      deficit in kidney function promote the loss of mineral from bone and the deposition of&#xD;
      mineral in the vasculature, a process termed vascular calcification (VC). VC is associated&#xD;
      with a variety of CVD-related disorders, including arterial stiffness, increases in arterial&#xD;
      wall intima-media thickness (IMT), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and declines in&#xD;
      cardiac function. As a result of these abnormalities, cardiovascular events are 10 to 30&#xD;
      times greater in dialysis patients than in age- and sex-matched subjects in the general&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

      cardiac function. As a result of these abnormalities, cardiovascular events are 10 to 30&#xD;
      times greater in dialysis patients than in age- and sex-matched subjects in the general&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A variety of pharmacological therapies are commonly used to help prevent or attenuate the&#xD;
      progression of CKD co-morbidities; however, morbidity and mortality in this population remain&#xD;
      extremely high, indicating that additional therapeutic strategies that may improve the health&#xD;
      and QOL in this population are needed. Recently, the National Kidney Foundation recommended&#xD;
      that dialysis patients increase their protein intake to 1.2 g/kg/day to help prevent protein&#xD;
      malnutrition; however, little is known about the efficacy of this recommendation.&#xD;
      Intradialytic (during dialysis) protein supplementation has been shown to increase serum&#xD;
      albumin levels11, and also increases amino acid uptake into skeletal muscle, an effect that&#xD;
      is potentiated by both resistance and endurance exercise. However, the individual and&#xD;
      combined effects of intradialytic protein supplementation and exercise training on lean mass,&#xD;
      muscle strength, and physical function is unknown. Furthermore, intradialytic protein&#xD;
      supplementation and exercise training improve many risk factors associated with CVD and renal&#xD;
      bone disease (e.g., plasma lipids, inflammatory variables), but their effect on functional&#xD;
      CVD outcomes (e.g., arterial stiffness, VC, IMT, LVH, myocardial performance) and bone health&#xD;
      in dialysis patients is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the proposed research is to evaluate the efficacy of intradialytic&#xD;
      oral protein supplementation, with and without concomitant intradialytic endurance exercise&#xD;
      training (cycling), on physical function, CVD risk, and bone health. We will also examine&#xD;
      potential mechanisms for these effects, and determine if improvements in these factors lead&#xD;
      to improvements in QOL. Hemodialysis patients will be randomized to the following groups for&#xD;
      12 months: 1) usual care/control (CON); 2) intradialytic protein supplementation (PRO); or 3)&#xD;
      intradialytic protein supplementation + exercise training (PRO+EX).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim #1: Examine the effects of intradialytic oral protein supplementation and&#xD;
      exercise training on physical function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #1: Physical function, as assessed by a shuttle walk test, will improve in PRO+EX&#xD;
      and PRO, compared to CON, and the magnitude of improvements will be greatest in PRO+EX. In&#xD;
      secondary analyses, we also will examine the effects of our interventions on other variables&#xD;
      related to physical function, including lean body mass, muscle strength, and activities of&#xD;
      daily living (ADL) assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim #2: Examine the effects of intradialytic oral protein supplementation and&#xD;
      exercise training on CVD risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #2: CVD risk, as assessed by carotid artery stiffness, will improve in PRO+EX and&#xD;
      PRO, compared to CON, and the magnitude of improvements will be greatest in PRO+EX. In&#xD;
      secondary analyses, we also will examine the effects of our interventions on other factors&#xD;
      related to CVD risk, including carotid IMT, myocardial performance, LVH, aortic&#xD;
      calcification, and epicardial fat levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim #3: Examine the effects of intradialytic oral protein supplementation and&#xD;
      exercise training on bone health as determined by bone mineral density (BMD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #3: BMD will be reduced significantly more in CON than in PRO+EX or PRO. We&#xD;
      anticipate that BMD will remain stable in PRO+EX or PRO. Because the exercise is not bone&#xD;
      loading (i.e., invoking ground or joint reaction forces), we do not expect additive effects&#xD;
      of PRO+EX on BMD.&#xD;
