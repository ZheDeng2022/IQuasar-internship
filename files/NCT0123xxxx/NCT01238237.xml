  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high-grade malignant brain tumors, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and anaplastic&#xD;
      astrocytoma (AA), comprise the majority of all primary brain tumors in adults. Initial&#xD;
      therapy consists of either surgical resection, external beam radiation or both. All patients&#xD;
      experience a recurrence after first-line therapy, so improvements in both first-line and&#xD;
      salvage therapy are critical to enhancing quality-of-life and prolonging survival. It is&#xD;
      unknown if currently used intravenous (IV) therapies even cross the blood brain barrier&#xD;
      (BBB). Superselective Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion (SIACI) is a technique that can&#xD;
      effectively increase the concentration of drug delivered to the brain while sparing the body&#xD;
      of systemic side effects. One currently used drug called, Cetuximab (Erbitux) has been shown&#xD;
      to be active in human brain tumors but its actual CNS penetration is unknown. This phase I&#xD;
      clinical research trial will test the hypothesis that Cetuximab can be safely used by direct&#xD;
      intracranial superselective intraarterial infusion up to a dose of 500mg/m2 to ultimately&#xD;
      enhance survival of patients with relapsed/refractory GBM/AA. By achieving the aims of this&#xD;
      study the investigators will determine the the toxicity profile and maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) of SIACI Cetuximab. The investigators expect that this study will provide important&#xD;
      information regarding the utility of SIACI Cetuximab therapy for malignant glioma, and may&#xD;
      alter the way these drugs are delivered to the investigators patients in the near future.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no current standard of care for recurring GBM after patients receive Bevacizumab&#xD;
      (Avastin) intravenously (IV) at 10mg/kg with CPT-11 (Irinotecan). At that point, these&#xD;
      patients are deemed treatment failures and are given another experimental treatment. Because&#xD;
      of the blood brain barrier (BBB) where IV drugs do not penetrate the blood vessel walls well&#xD;
      to get into the brain, no one knows for sure if these IV drugs actually get into the brain&#xD;
      after infusion. Previous studies have shown that if you want to increase your penetration of&#xD;
      drug to the brain, that intra-carotid artery (intraarterial) delivery is superior to standard&#xD;
      intravenous delivery. Previous techniques using intraarterial (intracarotid) infusion still&#xD;
      were non-selective as drug delivery still went to all blood vessels in the brain, so patients&#xD;
      still had significant adverse events, such as blindness. Newer techniques in interventional&#xD;
      neuroradiology have allowed for a more selective delivery of catheters higher up into the&#xD;
      arterial tree where agents such as chemotherapies, can be delivered without the risk of&#xD;
      adverse affects such as blindness. In fact, studies here at Cornell have developed very new&#xD;
      and exciting super selective intraarterial delivery treatments for Retinoblastoma, eye tumors&#xD;
      with little toxicity and a clinical trial of intraarterial delivery of Avastin is currently&#xD;
      underway for GBM. Therefore, this trial will ask one simple question: Is it safe to deliver a&#xD;
      dose of Cetuximab intraarterially using these super selective delivery techniques instead of&#xD;
      the standard intravenous route of administration? This should not only increase the amount of&#xD;
      drug that gets to the tumor but also spare the patient any adverse effects from a less&#xD;
      selective delivery. Prior to that single dose of intraarterial Cetuximab, the patient will&#xD;
      also receive a dose of mannitol that opens up the blood brain barrier to improve delivery of&#xD;
      the agent to the brain. After that single dose of Mannitol and Cetuximab intraarterially, the&#xD;
      patient will be evaluated for 4 weeks to assess for toxicity. After this point, the patient&#xD;
      is done with the &quot;experimental&quot; aspects of the protocol. If no toxicity at this point, then&#xD;
      the patient will go on and get their chosen chemotherapy as determined by their treating&#xD;
      oncologist. In summary, this is a Phase I trial that is designed to test the safety of a&#xD;
      single dose of intraarterial delivery of Mannitol and Cetuximab , prior to starting the&#xD;
      patients next round of chosen chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      To summarize:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current Standard of Care Therapy : None&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental portion of this proposal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 0: Intraarterial Mannitol to open the blood brain barrier followed by Intraarterial&#xD;
      Cetuximab single dose (starting at 100mg/m2 and up to 500mg/m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the experimental aspects of this treatment plan will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects will first be treated with Mannitol prior to chemotherapy infusion (Mannitol&#xD;
           25%; 3-10 mL/s for 30seconds) in order to disrupt the blood brain barrier. This&#xD;
           technique has been used in several thousand patients in previous studies for the IA&#xD;
           delivery of chemotherapy for malignant glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To add a single intraarterial delivery (SIACI) of the Cetuximab for patients with&#xD;
           recurring or relapsing high grade glioma. After a one cycle observation period to assess&#xD;
           for toxicity from the IA infusion, the subject will receive a regimen of chemotherapy to&#xD;
           be decided by their treating oncologist The dose escalation algorithm is as follows: We&#xD;
           will use a single intracranial superselective intraarterial infusion of Cetuximab,&#xD;
           starting at a dose of 100mg/m2 in the first three patients. Assuming no dose limiting&#xD;
           toxicity during the next 28 days after the infusion, the patient will then begin their&#xD;
           standard chemotherapy regimen which is to be determined by their treating oncologist.&#xD;
           The doses will be escalated from 100, to 200, 300, 400 and finally 500mg/m2 in this&#xD;
           Phase I trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity from the IA infusion of Cetuximab will be&#xD;
      determined and scored according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0). Monitoring&#xD;
      will also include an MRI of the brain at 4 weeks post infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients with GBM are also monitored every two months with serial history, neurological&#xD;
      and physical examinations together with serial blood counts, prothrombin time (PT), partial&#xD;
      thromboplastin time (PTT) and chemistries. In addition, most patients with GBM have an MRI&#xD;
      performed every two cycles or approximately every two months to assess for tumor progression.&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this is a Phase I trial, response is not a primary endpoint of the trial. However, we&#xD;
      will evaluate response to the one time IA Cetuximab therapy with a a MRI with the injection&#xD;
      of contrast about 4 weeks after infusion. Follow-up of all patients in the trial regardless&#xD;
      of the chemotherapy regimen they try after the IA Cetuximab therapy will continue until&#xD;
      disease progression or death. Survival will be measured from the time of the dose of IA&#xD;
      CetuximabÂ®. We expect patients in the trial to monitored for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This treatment may be harmful to a fetus . female subjects of childbearing age, will be asked&#xD;
      to practice birth control methods while participating in this research study and for 3 months&#xD;
      following her treatment. These methods include oral contraceptives, contraceptive shots, and&#xD;
      barrier methods, such as condom use, sponges, and diaphragms. Fertile males are required to&#xD;
      use these barrier methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient may be responsible for any additional costs associated with enrollment in the&#xD;
      trial. All costs of the IA delivery and the cost of the drug will be submitted to the&#xD;
      patient's insurance provider.&#xD;
