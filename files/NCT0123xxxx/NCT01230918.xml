  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to determine whether 99Technetium-NC100692 uptake in patients with ACS (MI)&#xD;
      can serve as a marker for scar formation as detected by contrast-enhanced MRI during the&#xD;
      process of myocardial remodelling after the ischemic insult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of ACS and HCM Populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine whether TcNC100692 imaging is able to quantify the&#xD;
      extent to which myocardial fibrogenesis occurring early post myocardial infarction differs&#xD;
      from that in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that since fibrogenesis is known to occur most intensely in the&#xD;
      first days to weeks post myocardial infarction, while it is a more protracted, less&#xD;
      predictable process in HCM, there will be significantly more TcNC100692 uptake in the early&#xD;
      post-ACS population than in the HCM population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal control images will allow for differentiation of uptake in the myocardium.&#xD;

      HCM Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine whether fibrosis detected by MRI and 99mTc-NC100692&#xD;
      uptake in patients with HCM are associated. The secondary objective is to determine whether&#xD;
      99mTc-NC100692 uptake correlates on a segmental basis with fibrosis visualised by late&#xD;
      Gd-enhancement MRI. The tertiary objective is to evaluate the relationship between the extent&#xD;
      of fibrosis assessed by 99mTc-NC100692 uptake and mean longitudinal strain as determined by&#xD;
      speckle tracking echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that there is an increased uptake of 99mTc-NC100692 in patients&#xD;
      with HCM fibrosis detected by MRI. The secondary hypothesis is that the location and extent&#xD;
      of increased 99mTc-NC100692 uptake will correlate with localization and extent measurements&#xD;
      of fibrosis by Gd-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. The tertiary hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      extent of fibrosis assessed by the number of segments with and the magnitude of 99mTc&#xD;
      NC100692 uptake will correlate with mean longitudinal strain as determined by speckle&#xD;
      tracking echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACS Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to determine whether 99Technetium-NC100692 uptake in patients with ACS (MI)&#xD;
      can serve as a marker for scar formation as detected by contrast-enhanced MRI during the&#xD;
      process of myocardial remodelling after the ischemic insult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that there is an increased uptake of 99Technetium-NC100692 in&#xD;
      patients following an ACS event (MI) and that the location and extent of increased&#xD;
      99Technetium-NC100692 uptake will correlate with the presence and extent of scar as detected&#xD;
      by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal Control Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary analysis of images from HCM population showed a diffuse, low grade uptake of&#xD;
      99Technetium-NC100692 in non-hypertrophied myocardial segments. Although not entirely&#xD;
      unexpected, comparison with control images will allow for quantification of low grade&#xD;
      fibrosis and low grade uptake.&#xD;
