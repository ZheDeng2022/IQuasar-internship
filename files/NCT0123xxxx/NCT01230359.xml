  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nutritional supplements like vitamin B6 and magnesium have demonstrated to have beneficial&#xD;
      effects in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The underlying theory for these&#xD;
      effects is that specific metabolic pathways in neuronal cells, e.g. the methionine cycle,&#xD;
      will be more balanced. Most studies have been focused on the clinical outcome with this&#xD;
      treatment. The present proposal will examine the effects on the different intermediates of&#xD;
      the methionine cycle (methylation and transulfuration capacity), suggested to play an&#xD;
      important role for the pathogenesis of ASD. The design is a prospective pilot study,&#xD;
      including 40 patients, aged 2-6 yrs, with newly diagnosed ASD. All participants will receive&#xD;
      the supplement (vitamin B6, magnesium; Kirkman formula) and placebo in a cross over design.&#xD;
      Metabolites in blood and urine will be measured prior to and at the end of the treatments in&#xD;
      the different groups. The results will then provide us with information, which will link&#xD;
      clinical outcomes with biological markers. Furthermore, the study has also the potential to&#xD;
      shed light on the pathogenesis of ASD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopment disorders characterized by impairments&#xD;
      in social relatedness and communication, repetitive behaviors, abnormal movement patterns,&#xD;
      and sensory dysfunction that affect children from birth or the early months of life, but only&#xD;
      recognized by most parents between 12 and 24 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that a diagnosis of autism can be reliably made between 2 and 3 years of&#xD;
      age, although a diagnosis of the broader autistic spectrum is less reliable at this age than&#xD;
      in older children While genetic factors are recognized as being important in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of ASDs, a metabolic and biochemical factors are considered to play an important role for the&#xD;
      pathogenesis. Treatment is directed on the impairing core features of the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) was first used with children diagnosed with &quot;autism syndrome&quot; when&#xD;
      speech and language improvement was observed in some children as a result of large doses of&#xD;
      B6. Magnesium was added to prevent the possibility of hyperactivity and peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy, which can occur if the vitamin B6 is taken by itself. An impairment of the&#xD;
      methionine cycle and transsulfuration was previously reported in autistic children. Recent&#xD;
      studies in autistic children have suggested a decreased capacity for methylation as&#xD;
      contributing factor to the development and clinical manifestation of the disease .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Homocysteine is removed either by its irreversible conversion to cysteine (transsulfuration)&#xD;
      or by remethylation to methionine. There are two separate remethylation reactions, catalyzed&#xD;
      by betaine. The reactions that remove homocysteine are very sensitive to B vitamin status as&#xD;
      both the transsulfuration enzymes contain pyridoxal phosphate, while methionine synthase&#xD;
      contains cobalamin and receives its methyl group from folic acid one-carbon pool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, vitamin B6 is required for over 100 enzymatic reactions, including the&#xD;
      production of major neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, and others) and glutathione&#xD;
      (needed for detoxification).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of studies attempted to assess the effects of vitamin B6-Magnesium (Mg) on&#xD;
      characteristics such as verbal communication, non-verbal communication, interpersonal skills,&#xD;
      and physiological function, in individuals with autism. There are over 22 studies of vitamin&#xD;
      B6 with Magnesium for ASD, including 11 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, making it&#xD;
      one of most studied treatments for autism. Many of these studies found some of the children&#xD;
      with ASD benefited from high-dose supplementation of vitamin B6 with Magnesium in many areas&#xD;
      of the spectrum including language, eye contact and behaviour . Twenty-one of these yielded&#xD;
      positive results, and only minor adverse effects were reported , In the Cochrane Database&#xD;
      Systematic Review only study yielded no significant performances between treatment and&#xD;
      placebo group performances following the B6 intervention on measures of social interaction,&#xD;
      communication, compulsivity, impulsivity or hyperactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, none of the above studies evaluated the effect of the vitamin B6 on the methionine&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the proposed study will compare biochemical alterations in a key metabolic&#xD;
      pathway, i.e. the methionine cycle, suggested by previous studies to play an important role&#xD;
      in the pathogenesis of ASD, with clinical parameters, during treatment with nutritional&#xD;
      supplement. Therefore, the results will provide clinicians with important information for&#xD;
      improvement and optimization of the treatment of patients with ASD.&#xD;
