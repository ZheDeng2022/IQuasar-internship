  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Olaparib is an experimental anti-cancer drug that is part of a class of drugs called PARP&#xD;
      inhibitors. PARP is a protein that is involved in repairing DNA damage, but it may also&#xD;
      encourage precancerous cells to develop into cancer cells. Olaparib has been given safely in&#xD;
      combination with carboplatin, a drug used to treat breast, ovarian, uterine, and cervical&#xD;
      cancer, but more research is needed to determine whether the drugs are more effective when&#xD;
      given together or which drug should be given first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the safety and effectiveness of combined carboplatin and olaparib as a&#xD;
      treatment for gynecologic (female organ) or breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women at least 18 years of age who have breast, ovarian, uterine, or cervical cancer&#xD;
           that has not responded to standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men at least 18 years of age who have metastatic breast cancer and have a BRCA-1/2&#xD;
           mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, as well&#xD;
           as blood and tumor samples and imaging studies as required by the researchers. Study&#xD;
           participants will then be divided into two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Participants will receive olaparib tablets twice a day for 7 days (14 doses)&#xD;
           and will receive carboplatin by vein on day 1 or 2, for a 21-day treatment cycle. Group&#xD;
           1 study is designed to determine the safety of new tablet formulation of olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: Participants will be divided into two smaller groups, with reversed treatment&#xD;
           schedules. Group 2 study is designed to evaluate which drug should be given first&#xD;
           through endpoint studies in blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2A: Participants will receive olaparib tablets twice a day for 7 days (14 doses)&#xD;
           and then carboplatin on day 8 of the first cycle. Cycle 2 will start with carboplatin on&#xD;
           day 1 and olaparib starting on day 2 for 7 days (14 doses).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2B: Participants will receive carboplatin on the first day of the first cycle, and&#xD;
           then olaparib on day 2, twice a day for 7 days (14 doses) of the first cycle. Cycle 2&#xD;
           will start with 7 days of olaparib (14 doses) and carboplatin will be given on day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From cycle 3 until completion of therapy, all Group 2 participants will follow the&#xD;
           schedule used for Group 1 (carboplatin on day 1 or 2 of the week of olaparib therapy,&#xD;
           also in 21-day cycles).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional blood and tissue samples and imaging studies will be conducted throughout the&#xD;
           treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants may receive no more than 8 cycles of olaparib and carboplatin therapy,&#xD;
           but may continue to take olaparib if their cancer responds to the treatment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Olaparib (AZD2281) is an oral PARP-1/2 inhibitor (PARPi) that affects tumors by&#xD;
           impairing repair of single stranded DNA and causing double strand breaks. Carboplatin&#xD;
           covalently crosslinks DNA causing stalled replication forks repaired through nucleotide&#xD;
           excision repair and homologous recombination (HR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is no published data on sequence-specificity of PARPi with platinums. Our&#xD;
           preclinical data indicate sequence may be important in growth inhibition and DNA damage&#xD;
           and repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We have demonstrated activity and safety with concomitant administration of olaparib and&#xD;
           carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We hypothesize that elucidation of sequence specificity may improve upon that clinical&#xD;
           benefit by optimizing drug administration and potentially safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine safe dose of olaparib tablet with carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of two schedules&#xD;
           of olaparib and carboplatin using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the schedule-associated safety of olaparib and carboplatin in women s&#xD;
           cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult women with recurrent/refractory epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian, primary&#xD;
           peritoneal, uterine papillary serous cancer, or malignant mixed mullerian tumors, or&#xD;
           recurrent/refractory breast cancer that is metastatic or unresectable and for which&#xD;
           standard therapies do not exist or are no longer effective. BRCA1/2 mutation carriers&#xD;
           will be eligible with any metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be off prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, or&#xD;
           biological therapy for at least 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status 0-2 and adequate organ and marrow function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A phase I 3 plus 3 safety run-in will optimize tablet olaparib dose (d1-7) in&#xD;
           combination with carboplatin on day 1. The carboplatin dose through the trial will be&#xD;
           AUC4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subsequent accrual will randomize patients to one of 2 schedules on cycle 1 with the&#xD;
           other schedule on cycle 2. A: olaparib d1-7 &gt; carbo d8; B: carbo d1 &gt; olaparib d2-8.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cycle 3-8 will be schedule B. After 8 cycles of carboplatin, olaparib will be&#xD;
           administered alone on a daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research samples will be obtained for PD endpoints prior to and approximately 24 hours&#xD;
           after carboplatin infusion and prior to the 1st and 3rd of olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples for olaparib PK will be obtained in all patients after the first dose of&#xD;
           olaparib in cycles 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be evaluated for toxicity in clinic every 3 weeks and every two cycles for&#xD;
           response using RECIST criteria. Imaging studies will be obtained every 3 cycles for&#xD;
           patients who stay on the study longer than four years.&#xD;

             therapy, radiotherapy, surgery, or complementary and alternative therapy within 4&#xD;
             weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who were treated with other PARP inhibitors greater than 28 days prior to&#xD;
             study are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be at least 2 weeks from the last phase 0 intervention (longer at the discretion&#xD;
             of the PI) and at least 1 day from non-cancer-related complementary and alternative&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Invasive cancer, other than co-existent breast/gynecologic cancers, within the past 2&#xD;
             years. Noninvasive nonmelanoma skin cancers are not exclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases diagnosed within 1 year will be excluded from&#xD;
             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop&#xD;
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic&#xD;
             and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with brain metastases diagnosed greater than 1 year prior to study entry may&#xD;
             be considered if they received sterilizing therapy to the CNS (resection or radiation)&#xD;
             and have been CNS recurrence-free for a full 1-year period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of grade 4 allergic reactions to platinums:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with allergic reaction to platinums (up to and including grade 3 without a&#xD;
        reaction protocol, and up to and including grade 2 in the face of aggressive pre-treatment)&#xD;
        may be eligible pending review of experience, and PI approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have not been rechallenged after a severe reaction may be eligible on a&#xD;
        case-by-case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant GI bleeding or hemoptysis within 28 days prior to the start of&#xD;
             the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to swallow pills&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection (no antibiotics prior to entering the study within 7 days), symptomatic&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and breast-feeding women: If a woman becomes pregnant or suspects she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with AZD2281. In addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy such as carboplatin. HIV- positive patients who are not on&#xD;
             combination antiretroviral therapy but with CD4 counts &gt;500, eligibility is a PI&#xD;
             decision on an individual patient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within the past 28 days&#xD;
