      Patients who have experienced and survived non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndromes&#xD;
      are often prescribed a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel to thin the blood and prevent&#xD;
      further acute coronary episodes. Both clopidogrel and aspirin may cause stomach bleeds and so&#xD;
      a prophylactic proton pump inhibitor is frequently co-prescribed in order to prevent such&#xD;
      bleeds. Recent mechanistic and observational studies suggest proton pump inhibitors may&#xD;
      reduce the effectiveness of clopidogrel and so patients may not benefit as much as expected&#xD;
      from combined aspirin and clopidogrel. The investigators propose a cohort study of patients&#xD;
      prescribed clopidogrel + aspirin. Amongst these patients the investigators will measure the&#xD;
      relative rate of acute coronary syndrome and death comparing patients with and without proton&#xD;
      pump inhibitor treatment. To provide a more complete picture of the risks and benefits of&#xD;
      treatment the investigators will also measure the relative rate of stomach bleeds in the same&#xD;
      groups of patients. In addition, whether the inhibitory effect of proton pump inhibitors on&#xD;
      the protective effect of clopidogrel is due to their inhibition of drug metabolising enzymes&#xD;
      will be explored by assessing the effects of other drugs that inhibit the same enzymes.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have experienced and survived non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndromes&#xD;
      are often prescribed a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel to thin the blood and prevent&#xD;
      further acute coronary episodes. Both clopidogrel and aspirin may cause stomach bleeds and so&#xD;
      a prophylactic proton pump inhibitor is frequently co-prescribed in order to prevent such&#xD;
      bleeds. Recent mechanistic and observational studies suggest proton pump inhibitors may&#xD;
      reduce the effectiveness of clopidogrel and so patients may not benefit as much as expected&#xD;
      from combined aspirin and clopidogrel. The investigators propose a cohort study of patients&#xD;
      prescribed clopidogrel + aspirin. Amongst these patients the investigators will measure the&#xD;
      relative rate of acute coronary syndrome and death comparing patients with and without proton&#xD;
      pump inhibitor treatment. To provide a more complete picture of the risks and benefits of&#xD;
      treatment the investigators will also measure the relative rate of stomach bleeds in the same&#xD;
      groups of patients. In addition, whether the inhibitory effect of proton pump inhibitors on&#xD;
      the protective effect of clopidogrel is due to their inhibition of drug metabolising enzymes&#xD;
      will be explored by assessing the effects of other drugs that inhibit the same enzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet drug used to prevent coronary events, particularly&#xD;
      in patients who have already experienced acute coronary syndrome (ACS). It is often used in&#xD;
      combination with aspirin, and due to the propensity of both drugs to cause gastrointestinal&#xD;
      (GI) bleeds, prophylactic therapy with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is frequently prescribed.&#xD;
      Some proton pump inhibitors and clopidogrel share a common metabolic pathway involving the&#xD;
      cytochrome P450 2C19 isoenzyme. Clopidogrel relies on P450 2C19 for conversion to its active&#xD;
      metabolite whilst some PPIs inhibit this enzyme; recent mechanistic studies suggest that PPIs&#xD;
      may reduce the platelet inhibitory effect of clopidogrel (Gilard et al 2006, Gilard et al&#xD;
      2008). Subsequent observational studies appear to show this effect may translate directly to&#xD;
      a reduction in clopidogrel efficacy with patients more likely to experience secondary&#xD;
      coronary events or death. Odds ratios of 1.25 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.41; Ho et&#xD;
      al 2009) and 1.27 (1.03-1.57; Juurlink et al 2009) have been reported, comparing clopidogrel&#xD;
      and PPI users with patients using clopidogrel without PPI. A further study suggests the&#xD;
      effect may be limited to clopidogrel in combination with omeprazole only (Sibbing et al&#xD;
      2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Research Questions: To investigate a possible drug interaction between clopidogrel and&#xD;
      proton pump inhibitors (PPI). Specific questions to be answered are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does combined use of clopidogrel/aspirin with a PPI increase the risk of acute coronary&#xD;
           syndrome or death compared with clopidogrel/aspirin without a PPI, and if so by how&#xD;
           much?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does combined use of clopidogrel/aspirin with a PPI decrease the risk of&#xD;
           gastrointestinal bleed compared with clopidogrel/aspirin without a PPI and if so by how&#xD;
           much?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the cohort method we will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Estimate the rate ratio for acute coronary syndrome or death, comparing individuals&#xD;
           prescribed clopidogrel + aspirin with a PPI with individuals prescribed clopidogrel +&#xD;
           aspirin without a PPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Estimate the rate ratio for gastrointestinal bleed, comparing individuals prescribed&#xD;
           clopidogrel + aspirin with a PPI with individuals prescribed clopidogrel + aspirin&#xD;
           without a PPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Estimate the rate ratio for acute coronary syndrome or death, comparing individuals&#xD;
           prescribed clopidogrel + aspirin with non-PPI cytochrome P450 2C19 inhibitors with&#xD;
           individuals prescribed clopidogrel + aspirin without non-PPI cytochrome P450 2C19&#xD;
           inhibitors using the cohort method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology and planned statistical analyses A cohort study is proposed to address the issues&#xD;
      outlined above. This is the optimum design since it will allow us to measure relative and&#xD;
      absolute rates of the events of interest. We will also be able to assign follow up time to&#xD;
      different exposure groups as dictated by patient prescriptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: All patients registered in the General Practice Research Database (GPRD)&#xD;
      from 1998 to date and receiving clopidogrel in combination with aspirin and with at least 12&#xD;
      months up-to-standard observation before the first prescription for clopidogrel will be&#xD;
      eligible for inclusion. Data will be restricted to 1998 onwards as this is the year&#xD;
      clopidogrel was licensed in the United Kingdom (UK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Exposure: Any PPI in combination with aspirin and clopidogrel. Prescriptions for&#xD;
      PPI's, aspirin and clopidogrel will be identified from patient records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome: A combined end point of all cause mortality OR incident myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (MI). Mortality will be determined using the GPRD-estimated date of death and&#xD;
      incident MI will be determined by searching clinical and referral records. Recent linkages&#xD;
      between GPRD and the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project [MINAP] will be exploited to&#xD;
      validate event diagnoses and to ensure events are incident rather than prevalent (see&#xD;
      sub-group analyses below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Exposures: A combination of aspirin and clopidogrel with any of the following will&#xD;
      be determined: CYP2C19 inhibiting PPIs, non-CYP2C19 inhibiting PPIs, omeprazole only,&#xD;
      paroxetine or fluoxetine. Paroxetine and fluoxetine have been selected as they are CYP2C19&#xD;
      inhibitors likely to be widely used over long periods of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes: Incident GI bleed, incident MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: Data will be analysed using STATA v9.2 (StataCorp, Texas) using Cox regression&#xD;
      and adjusting for possible confounders (see covariates below). Rate ratios (RR) and 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals will be estimated for the outcomes outlined above, comparing individuals&#xD;
      exposed to aspirin + clopidogrel + PPI with people exposed to aspirin + clopidogrel + no PPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up time for each individual will be classified according to the treatments being&#xD;
      received at any point in time. We will use recorded data on dosing frequency and pack size to&#xD;
      estimate the exposure period of each prescription. Where this data is missing, the median&#xD;
      length of exposure calculated for all other prescriptions of that drug will be assumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-group analyses: Since smoking is an important potential confounder and will not be&#xD;
      recorded perfectly in the GPRD, sensitivity analyses will be undertaken. The main imprecision&#xD;
      is likely to be among ex-smokers who are recorded as non-smokers. We will therefore undertake&#xD;
      an analysis including only people recorded as definite &quot;never smokers&quot; and people recorded as&#xD;
      current smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linkage between MINAP and GPRD is not available for all practices in the GPRD. All analyses&#xD;
      using the MINAP-validated date of ACS event will be restricted to patients from practices&#xD;
      where linkage has been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Power Calculation GPRD feasibility counts indicate &gt;40,000 patients may have&#xD;
      received clopidogrel and aspirin simultaneously and 31,000 of these have also received a PPI&#xD;
      at some point. Assuming a study period incidence of the primary outcome of 25%1 and a&#xD;
      conservative exposed/unexposed group size of 5,000 each, we would have &gt;99% power to detect a&#xD;
      rate ratio of 1.2 comparing the rate of death or MI among aspirin and clopidogrel users who&#xD;
      are taking a PPI with those not taking a PPI. This would be consistent with the effect&#xD;
      detected in studies to date (Ho et al 2009, Juurlink et al 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covariates&#xD;
&#xD;
      MI, mortality and GI bleeds have several well-established risk factors which are also likely&#xD;
      to be associated with the exposures of interest in this study. We will therefore examine the&#xD;
      possible confounding effects of the following covariates. The list includes covariates found&#xD;
      to be associated with PPI treatment in the observational studies done in this area to date:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age, sex, general practice, smoking status, alcohol consumption, body mass index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of:- diabetes, MI, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass&#xD;
           graft surgery, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, cancer, chronic obstructive&#xD;
           pulmonary disease, renal disease, hepatic disease, dementia, GI bleed, peripheral&#xD;
           vascular disease, other atherosclerotic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that some patients receiving clopidogrel + aspirin with a PPI will differ from&#xD;
      those not prescribed a PPI to such an extent that comparisons of the rate of MI, mortality&#xD;
      and GI bleeds may be invalid. To investigate this possibility we will calculate propensity&#xD;
      scores for PPI treatment using baseline characteristics. Only patients with propensity scores&#xD;
      within a common range between the 2 groups will be included in the cohort analysis, ensuring&#xD;
      a fair comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is part of the CALIBER (Cardiovascular disease research using linked bespoke&#xD;
      studies and electronic records) programme funded over 5 years from the NIHR and Wellcome&#xD;
      Trust. The central theme of the CALIBER research is linkage of the Myocardial Ischaemia&#xD;
      National Audit Project (MINAP) with primary care (GPRD), secondary care (HES) and other&#xD;
      resources. The overarching aim of CALIBER is to better understand the aetiology and prognosis&#xD;
      of specific coronary phenotypes across a range of causal domains, particularly where&#xD;
      electronic records provide a contribution beyond traditional studies. CALIBER has received&#xD;
      both Ethics approval (ref 09/H0810/16) and ECC approval (ref ECC 2-06(b)/2009 CALIBER&#xD;
      dataset)&#xD;
