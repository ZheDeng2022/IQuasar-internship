      Hypothesis and objectives of the study Systematic preparation of rehabilitation plan for&#xD;
      rehabilitation in Phase III based on identification of self-care behavior patients with heart&#xD;
      failure in NYHA class II and III, leading to patients' self-care behaviors strengthened,&#xD;
      which will result in increased health status and ADL level 6 months after discharge from&#xD;
      hospital with heart failure .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop evidence-based clinical guidelines for patient rehabilitation phase III&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test the effect of individual rehabilitation plans based on clinical guidelines for&#xD;
           patient rehabilitation in Phase III. Efficacy evaluated in relation to changes in&#xD;
           self-care behaviors, health status and ADL function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controlled longitudinal study. Each intervention patient receives before the end of hospital&#xD;
      rehabilitation designed a specific rehabilitation plan also contacted the patient by&#xD;
      specially trained nurse telephone 4 and 12 weeks after completion of their rehabilitation in&#xD;
      hospital and the patient has the opportunity to contact the department when needed. The&#xD;
      effect of rehabilitation assessed by sending questionnaires SF 36 and EHFScB Scale 9, to&#xD;
      assess patients' ADL functioning, self-care behaviors and self-rated health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients participating in the planned rehabilitation in hospitals, so that the baseline&#xD;
      is the end of Phase II. Intervention based on an analysis of the individual's need for&#xD;
      continued rehabilitation (self care behavior, health status, ADL function) and the patient's&#xD;
      perception of own situation. Draw up a plan and program together with the patient&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rehabilitation for people with serious illness, has been in focus over the last 10-15 years&#xD;
      which is also valid for heart field (1). The focus of cardiac rehabilitation has been on the&#xD;
      efficacy of treatment in relation to mortality, morbidity and health-related quality of life&#xD;
      (HRQoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of rehabilitation are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Rehabilitation is a targeted and time-bound collaborative process between an individual,&#xD;
      relatives and professionals. The aim is that citizens who have or are at risk of significant&#xD;
      limitations in physical, mental and / or social functioning, achieve an independent and&#xD;
      meaningful life. Rehabilitation based on the citizen's whole life situation and decisions&#xD;
      made by a coordinated, coherent, knowledge-based action (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background. Worldwide, estimated that around. 50 million people suffer from heart disease&#xD;
      (2). In Denmark assumed that 60,000 people live with chronic heart failure, with prevalence&#xD;
      increasing with increasing age (3) (4). In 2005 there were 142,245 hospitalizations with&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease in Denmark, by 86,336 people, 1,786 per 100,000 men and 1,409 per&#xD;
      100,000 women. Viewed in isolation on heart-related deaths in the period 1998 -2005 is a&#xD;
      decrease in mortality in general, and in 30 day mortality after AMI decreased from 10 to 4%&#xD;
      (5). Cardiac rehabilitation has been made in traditional hospital setting and there is a&#xD;
      documented effect of effort in terms of patients' physical function, decrease in relapse of&#xD;
      disease, and decrease in morbidity and mortality (2) (6) (7) (8) (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and objectives of the study Hypothesis: Systematic preparation of rehabilitation&#xD;
      plan in Phase III based on the identification of self care behavior patients with heart&#xD;
      failure in NYHA class II and III, leading to patients' self-care behaviors strengthened,&#xD;
      which will result in improved health status and ADL level 6 months after discharge from&#xD;
      hospital with heart failure .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop evidence-based protocol for patient rehabilitation phase III&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test the effect of individual rehabilitation plans based on evidence-based knowledge&#xD;
           of patient rehabilitation in Phase III. Efficacy evaluated in relation to changes in&#xD;
           self-care behaviors, health status and ADL function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods. 3.1 Population: Patients recruited from Zealand Region Hospital South&#xD;
      in Naestved and Slagelse. There are printed annually 55-60 patients with heart failure from&#xD;
      each of the respective hospitals. The material in the study are women and men with heart&#xD;
      failure in NYHA class II - III of participants are calculated based on strength calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in NYHA II-III Participation happens after written informed consent. Patients&#xD;
      included in the respective intervention or control group depending on the hospital site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who do not wish to participate. Patients with language and communication impedes&#xD;
      Sufficient participation. Patients who do not understand information, as well as patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with neurological deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of patient numbers are based on strength calculation. The level of type 1 error&#xD;
      set at 5% and type 2 errors to 20%, and expected an improvement in ADL level at 50%, Power&#xD;
      Calculation shows that the participating 60 patients in the control and 60 patients in the&#xD;
      intervention group (http:/ / statpages.org / proppowr.html). With an expected dropout rate of&#xD;
      25%, therefore, invited 72 patients in each group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. quasi experimental study of patients from the Regions Hospital in Naestved and the&#xD;
      hospital in Slagelse. Each intervention patient receives before the end of hospital&#xD;
      rehabilitation designed a specific rehabilitation plan also contacted the patient by&#xD;
      specially trained nurse telephone 4 and 12 weeks after completion of their rehabilitation in&#xD;
      hospital and the patient has the opportunity to contact the department when needed. The&#xD;
      effect of rehabilitation assessed by sending questionnaires SF 36 and EHFScB Scale 9 (36) to&#xD;
      assess patients' ADL functioning, self-care behaviors and self-rated health. Patients&#xD;
      included in the experimental and control group. Randomization and blinding is not possible&#xD;
      since the staffing resources are not sufficient to enable the staff only have contact with&#xD;
      the respective intervention or control patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients participating in the planned rehabilitation in hospitals, so that the baseline&#xD;
      is the end of Phase II. Intervention based on an analysis of the individual's need for&#xD;
      continued rehabilitation (selfcare behavior, health status, ADL function) and the patient's&#xD;
      perception of own situation. Draw up a plan and program together with the patient. The&#xD;
      program must be tailored to the individual patient's possibilities. The program supplied with&#xD;
      guides to what the patient can do yourself. The patient acknowledged copy of the plan to your&#xD;
      physician and home care. Furthermore, the patient will be contacted by specially trained&#xD;
      nurse telephone 4 and 12 weeks after initiation of phase III rehabilitation, providing&#xD;
      telephone support from a structured interview guide. Patients also have the opportunity&#xD;
      outside the agreed times to contact the specialist nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables: Demographic data, sex, age, living alone, dependent / independent of help from&#xD;
      others, diagnosis, status of job, comorbidities, NYHA class&#xD;
&#xD;
      NYHA classification is carried out by specialists at discharge from hospital and transition&#xD;
      to rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-Care Behavior and ADL functions, estimated using the European Heart Failure Self-Care&#xD;
      Behavior Scale. The instrument is translated and face validated in a pilot test before use.&#xD;
      The test measures patients' ability to assess their own situation and ability to act on the&#xD;
      observations made (36).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health Status Assessed with Short Form 36 (SF-36). The form is generic and covers the&#xD;
      patient's perception of their health. SF-36 has been translated into Danish and validated&#xD;
      (37). SF-36 includes 36 questions on self-assessment of health status that includes eight&#xD;
      specific areas: physical functioning, physical constraints, pain, general health, energy /&#xD;
      fatigue, social functioning, psychological constraints and psychological wellbeing. For each&#xD;
      of the eight strands transformed responses to an interval scale from 0-100 where 0 indicates&#xD;
      no impairment or full restriction and 100 indicates full function or no restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process variable: compliance over nursing program examined self-reported data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed in the statistical program SPSS. Ratio-scaled data from the two groups&#xD;
      is tested by F test MHP. of distribution. For normally distributed data are compared by using&#xD;
      parametric methods (t test), otherwise non-parametric methods (Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test).&#xD;
      Nominal Scale Data compared by chi-square test or by using 95% confidence interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project reported to the Data Inspectorate. Furthermore, the experiment reported to the&#xD;
      local Research Ethics Committee, and to www.Clinicaltrials.gov so that rights to the project&#xD;
      ensured.&#xD;
