      A pilot experiment to test the efficiency of the enzyme Collagenase in treating contractures&#xD;
      which result's from burn's healing process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, treatment of choice in patients with burn's created movement limiting contractures,&#xD;
      concentrated around supportive care. Patients were referred to surgical intervention only if&#xD;
      necessary. Treatment by injecting an external enzyme is avant-garde and hasn't been done&#xD;
      under such conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study might introduce a new kind of treatment, which can be done in ambulatory&#xD;
      environment .This type of treatment might significantly improve patients' function and&#xD;
      quality of life, with no need for a surgical intervention.&#xD;

      Scientific Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contracture is defined as a scar tissue that replaces the original tissue and leads to&#xD;
      shortening and tightening of the muscle results in a range of motion limitation and&#xD;
      deformity. Contracture creation is common in burn's healing process. The process itself&#xD;
      involves fibrosis of the effected area including intrusion towards the deep layers of the&#xD;
      skin, and can be described as ineffective healing process. In many cases these scars have&#xD;
      major functional and cosmetic implications that challenges the plastic surgery departments&#xD;
      around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creation of bands, webs and contractures close to a joint area can cause a significant&#xD;
      movement limitation and shortens the range of motion. Until recently, failure of treatment&#xD;
      with bandaging, splints and physiotherapy activity usually led to surgical intervention&#xD;
      involving many kinds of techniques ranging from simple incisions, Z-Plasties to skin grafts,&#xD;
      and flaps. All these methods were meant to release the contracture itself and restore the&#xD;
      functional capability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study showed that it's possible to use the collagenase enzyme in releasing&#xD;
      dupuytren's contracture by a simple injection, a procedure that can be preformed under&#xD;
      ambulatory conditions. This kind of contracture causes a fixed flexion of the fingers towards&#xD;
      the palm of the hand. The study was a double blinded, placebo controlled study and involved&#xD;
      308 patients, all suffered from contracture with at least 20 degrees range of movement&#xD;
      limitation. In the end, it was proved beyond any doubt that collagenase is effective in&#xD;
      releasing and restoring range of motion of dupuytren's contracture. These positive results&#xD;
      might indicate the possibility of using collagenase in other kinds of contractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators intend to perform a preliminary test of the effectiveness of&#xD;
      collagenase in treating contracture that developed due to the burn's healing process. As&#xD;
      comparison parameters the investigators will compare the range of motion before and after&#xD;
      treatment and subjective feeling of pain (again, before and after treatment) according to VAS&#xD;
      scale of pain. Also the investigators will try to monitor any kind of side effects that might&#xD;
      appear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the clinical aspect, this study might introduce the medical community with a new kind of&#xD;
      treatment protocols and even might decrease the need for surgical intervention in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot experiment to test the efficiency of the enzyme Collagenase in treating contractures&#xD;
      which result's from burn's healing process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study the investigators will recruit about 10 patients which suffer from a known&#xD;
      contracture that causes movement's restriction and can be attributed to burn's healing&#xD;
      process. These patients will have to meet the exclusion and inclusion criteria of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will sign an informed consent in according to the Helsinki Committee, containing the&#xD;
      list of complications and side effects expected. Patients will go through Collagenase enzyme&#xD;
      injections according to the protocol that was conducted in the dupuytren's study. Before&#xD;
      performing the injections, the range of motion's limitations will be measured using&#xD;
      goniometer and a pain scale questionnaire (VAS) will be filled by the patient. Remeasuring&#xD;
      will be done in several time periods, after the first injection, ranging from 24 hours, a&#xD;
      week, 14 days and 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results and research significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, treatment of choice in patients with burn's created movement limiting contractures,&#xD;
      concentrated around supportive care. Patients were referred to surgical intervention only if&#xD;
      necessary .Treatment by injecting an external enzyme is avant-garde and hasn't been done&#xD;
      under such conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injections attempts of various enzymes such as hyaluronidase , Collagenase and also&#xD;
      Gelatinase are documented in the literature as therapeutic trial for Keloid and hypertrophic&#xD;
      scars in the aesthetic aspect, were found ineffective. However, literature review found no&#xD;
      evidence of therapeutic attempts using Collagenase in burn's healing contracture for the&#xD;
      functional aspect. These processes are known to be fibrotic and rich with collagen&#xD;
      deposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study might introduce a new kind of treatment, which can be done in ambulatory&#xD;
      environment .This type of treatment might significantly improve patients' function and&#xD;
      quality of life, with no need for a surgical intervention.&#xD;
