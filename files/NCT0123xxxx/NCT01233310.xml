      Study Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that by re-programming some of the PillCam COLON2 system parameters it can&#xD;
      serve as tool for visualizing both small bowel and colon. As such, the system may be utilized&#xD;
      in CD patients for monitoring mucosal healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate two different video output methods in the visualization of the SB and colon in CD&#xD;
      patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the level of agreement between PillCam system and ileocolonoscopy on the&#xD;
           assessment of CD findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effectiveness of PillCam regimen in CD patients&#xD;
&#xD;

           capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Study design: Multi-center, prospective study Number of subjects: Up to 30 study duration: up&#xD;
      to 18 months Subject population: Subjects with moderate to severe Crohn's disease&#xD;
      demonstrating colon involvement who are indicated to undergo standard ileocolonoscopy as part&#xD;
      of their disease management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Each patient will undergo PillCam, procedure followed by conventional ileocolonoscopy&#xD;
           procedure with intubation of the terminal ileum&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. During the ileocolonoscopy procedure, the colonoscopist will document his findings&#xD;
           according to the parameters defined in the SES-CD score and the overall assessment in&#xD;
           the following segments:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Rectum&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Left colon (including sigmoid)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Transverse colon&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Right colon&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Terminal ileum&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cleansing level for the ileocolonoscopy procedure will be assessed at each site&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. From each capsule endoscopy procedure two RAPID video versions will be generated and&#xD;
           segmented into segments&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A committee composed of the study investigators will review all the RAPID video segments&#xD;
           and document their findings according to the parameters defined in the SES-CD, Lewis and&#xD;
           CECDAI scoring systems and an overall assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The parameters for each segment per each of the two RAPID movies will be compared and&#xD;
           the preferable video setup will be chosen&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Final RAPID and colonoscopy movies will be de-identified in regards to patient and site&#xD;
           identity&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The preferable full RAPID version will be reviewed by investigators which will document&#xD;
           their findings according to the parameters defined in the SES-CD scoring system and&#xD;
           overall assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. cleansing level for the capsule procedure will be assess&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above evaluations per each subject will be within 24 from end of rocedure.&#xD;
