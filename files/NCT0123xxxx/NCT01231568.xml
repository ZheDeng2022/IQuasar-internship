    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the effects of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      150 mg of GSK2118436, as well as the effects of particle size on the relative bioavailability&#xD;
      of GSK2118436.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GSK2118436 is an orally administered, potent and selective small molecule BRAF inhibitor that&#xD;
      is currently being developed for the treatment of BRAF mutation-positive tumors. This study&#xD;
      is designed to evaluate the effects of particle size on the relative bioavailability of&#xD;
      GSK2118436 (Cohort 1) and to evaluate the effects of a high-fat meal on the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of GSK2118436 (Cohort 2). Subjects will randomly receive two of four possible regimens over&#xD;
      two periods. Subjects enrolled in Cohort 1 will receive a single 150 mg dose of GSK2118436 as&#xD;
      micronized particles fasted (gelatin capsule formulation) and a single 150 mg dose of&#xD;
      GSK2118436 as non-micronized particles fasted (larger particle size). Subjects enrolled in&#xD;
      Cohort 2 will receive a single 150 mg dose of GSK2118436 (HydroxyPropyl Methyl Cellulose&#xD;
      (HPMC) capsule formulation) fasted and with a high-fat breakfast. GSK2118436 will be&#xD;
      administered as the mesylate salt (equivalent to 150 mg free base). Safety and tolerability&#xD;
      will also be evaluated. The study will be conducted at a sufficient number of centers to&#xD;
      complete approximately 28 adult subjects (14 subjects per cohort) with BRAF mutation-positive&#xD;
      tumors. Following completion of this study, subjects may continue dosing with GSK2118436 in&#xD;
      the roll-over study, Protocol BRF114144.&#xD;
