      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Researchers who study health and nutrition are interested in developing more accurate&#xD;
      methods of determining what people eat from day to day and how it affects their general&#xD;
      health. In particular, better methods are needed to determine if people are accurately&#xD;
      remembering what they ate. One possible method involves the use of biomarkers, or indicators&#xD;
      in urine, blood, saliva, fat, and hair, which are related to the intake of a particular food&#xD;
      in a consistent way. One set of biomarkers in blood samples and hair may be used to determine&#xD;
      the relative amount of meat, fish, and soda (corn/sugar cane) in a person s diet. However,&#xD;
      more research is needed to study the effectiveness of using these biomarkers to accurately&#xD;
      track dietary intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To validate the use of biomarkers as representative of specific dietary intake patterns&#xD;
      (meat/fish/soda).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy, nondiabetic men between 18 and 65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study involves an initial screening visit and a 12-13 week inpatient dietary study&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, as well&#xD;
           as blood and urine samples and a glucose tolerance test to exclude individuals who have&#xD;
           diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After 3 days of a standard weight-maintaining diet, participants will have a glucose&#xD;
           tolerance test and a body fat scan; provide hair, blood, and fat tissue samples; and&#xD;
           complete questionnaires and performance tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will spend one day in a metabolic chamber to measure their energy&#xD;
           expenditure and general metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will then be randomized into one of eight carefully designed diets for 12&#xD;
           weeks. The diets will differ in the amount of meat, fish, and soda, including one diet&#xD;
           where none of the three biomarker-related foods will be permitted. Blood samples will be&#xD;
           collected throughout the study diet period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of the 12-week study diet period, participants will provide additional hair,&#xD;
           blood, and fat tissue samples, and will have a second metabolism assessment in the&#xD;
           metabolic chamber.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies of health and nutrition use a variety of tools to determine what people eat from day&#xD;
      to day. Unfortunately, most of the methods used are not accurate for a variety of reasons and&#xD;
      do not provide solid information on which to base health recommendations or public policy. In&#xD;
      general, when people are asked to keep track of what they eat or recall what they have eaten&#xD;
      in the past, they make mistakes in estimating both amounts and specifics of what was eaten.&#xD;
      New tools that can help determine if people are accurately remembering what they ate are&#xD;
      desperately needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers are things that can be measured (in urine, blood, hair, etc.) which are related to&#xD;
      the intake of a particular food in a consistent way and may therefore be more accurate than a&#xD;
      food record. One set of biomarkers that may be used are naturally occurring (present in all&#xD;
      foods) stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen to determine the relative amount of meat, fish,&#xD;
      and soda (corn/sugar cane) in a person s diet. These isotopes can be measured in blood&#xD;
      samples and hair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to validate the use of stable isotope biomarkers as representative&#xD;
      of specific dietary intake patterns (meat/fish/soda). This study will be an inpatient study&#xD;
      in which highly specific diets will be fed to volunteers for ~12 weeks and stable isotopes&#xD;
      will be measured in blood and hair. The ultimate goal is to develop biomarkers to be used to&#xD;
      validate food intake patterns in outpatient clinical and epidemiological studies.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Current or past history of: bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or presence of psychotic&#xD;
             symptoms, bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa, or current major depressive disorder&#xD;

&#xD;
        Conditions not specifically mentioned above may serve as criteria for exclusion at the&#xD;
        discretion of the investigators. Additionally, potential subjects might be excluded if they&#xD;
        demonstrate a style of interpersonal relationships that would inhibit successful completion&#xD;
        of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Non-English speaking subjects as a population will be excluded from participation in this&#xD;
        protocol. One of the secondary hypotheses of the protocol relates to a battery of&#xD;
        psychological questionnaires and performances tests which are administered to the&#xD;
        volunteers at the beginning and end of the study. There are currently no validated,&#xD;
        translated forms of these questionnaires and tests available; therefore we will restrict&#xD;
        enrollment to English speaking subjects only.&#xD;
