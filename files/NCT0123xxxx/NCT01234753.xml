  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of adults with congenitally malformed hearts is increasing. According to a&#xD;
      prospective population-based cohort study from Sweden (1992-2001) the prevalence of&#xD;
      cardiovascular defects was 9.1 per 1,000 births, which is comparable to other presented&#xD;
      prevalence data in the world.On the basis of 9 million inhabitants, Sweden should have&#xD;
      approximately 82000 born with CHD and approximately 20000 will, in adult age, need regular&#xD;
      follow up in cardiac care. This is a result of the greater improvements within paediatric&#xD;
      heart surgery and there is an increasing demand for continuous follow up in the healthcare&#xD;
      system.[2] Guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology and the Canadian Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Society recommend follow-up oriented towards both medical and psychosocial problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Earlier studies have shown that adults with CHD have poor knowledge about their heart&#xD;
      disease.The results are difficult to summarise because of the use of different instruments,&#xD;
      methods and sample sizes. Most of the adults with CHD did not know their clinical diagnosis&#xD;
      or what endocarditis was. However, we do not know if everyone in these studies was&#xD;
      recommended endocarditis prophylactics or their definition of poor knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present different programmes for adults with CHD are established in hospital outpatient&#xD;
      clinics. These studies describe the established programmes. They also address the needs for&#xD;
      development of care e.g. a multicenter approach, transitions from paediatric to adult health&#xD;
      care, delivery care in Europe, programmes for pregnancy, how to provide clinical strategies,&#xD;
      health care resource utilization or outpatient nursing clinic for adults with CHD. But there&#xD;
      is a lack of knowledge regarding how education and psychosocial support should be given to&#xD;
      adults with congenitally malformed hearts and what effects that can be achieved. The aim is&#xD;
      to evaluate the effects of a nurse-led intervention consisting of education by a&#xD;
      computer-based educational programme and psychosocial support to adults with congenitally&#xD;
      malformed hearts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sample: 114 adults with congenitally malformed hearts as ventricular septal defect, atrial&#xD;
      septal defect, coarctation of the aortae, tetralogy of Fallot, complete transposition of the&#xD;
      great arteries, congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries, single ventricle,&#xD;
      Ebstein anomaly, coarctation of the aortae, Eisenmenger syndrome and aortic valve stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method and Measures: Randomised, controlled study where. the iIntervention-group will receive&#xD;
      medical consultation, nurse consultation with psychosocial support, verbal and computer-based&#xD;
      education. A care-plan with individual goals will be developed for each individual. Follow up&#xD;
      of the care plan will be conducted after 1 month. The Control-group will receive: standard&#xD;
      care with medical consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected at baseline and after 3 and 12 months. Instruments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Knowledge instrument developed in Belgium , translated, further developed, tested in&#xD;
           study 3. Now further reliability and validity tests in this study 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health related quality of life, Short Form 36 (SF-36). SF-36 has good validity and&#xD;
           reliability and is adjust to Swedish circumstances • Anxiety and depression, Hospital&#xD;
           Anxiety and Depression Scale, (HADS)&#xD;
