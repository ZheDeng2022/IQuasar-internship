  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of lymphedema has been a major focus of attention for physicians and scientists&#xD;
      for several decades. At this time, no successful techniques have been developed to prevent&#xD;
      lymphedema, and therefore, a great deal of emphasis is placed on treatment modalities that&#xD;
      can lessen the severity and impede the progression of this debilitating condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment on offer usually consists of a maintenance phase using compression garments and&#xD;
      an intensive treatment phase, which includes the use of skin care, compression bandaging,&#xD;
      exercise and manual lymphatic drainage (MLD). The intensive phase is usually described as&#xD;
      complex decongestive therapy (CDT). This is time consuming and requires high resource usage.&#xD;
      Pneumatic compression devices (PCD) offer and alternative to MLD and can be used by the&#xD;
      patient. There are a number of devices on the market that are categorized into 1. without&#xD;
      calibrated gradient compression 2. With calibrated gradient compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will compare two PCDs, a simple device without calibrated compression, and an&#xD;
      advanced device with calibrated compression, in the reduction of swelling and maintenance of&#xD;
      reduced limb volume in 262 patients with lower limb lymphoedema. The primary end point will&#xD;
      be limb volume reduction over 12 weeks of treatment, with secondary outcome after 24 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Multicentre, prospective, single (assessor) blind randomised study. The primary&#xD;
      objective of the study is to assess volume reduction in the treatment of lymphoedematous legs&#xD;
      with an advanced PCD compared to a simple PCD in patients with lower limb lymphoedema. The&#xD;
      main outcome is the percentage volume reduction of the affected limb at end of treatment&#xD;
      compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of the study are Assessment of safety Quality of life Health economic&#xD;
      parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total 262 patients with leg lymphoedema will be enrolled into the study. Patients eligible&#xD;
      for the study are those who suffer from late stage II and stage III according to the&#xD;
      International Society of Lymphology lymphoedema staging. Lymphoedematous legs can be of&#xD;
      primary or secondary origin and uni or bilaterally affected. Medical history will be taken at&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be taught how to use the device they have been randomised to. Visits will then&#xD;
      take place at weeks 1,4,8,12 and 24 weeks. The device will be used for up to 60 minutes each&#xD;
      day on the trial limb. At each visit sequential circumferences of the affected and unaffected&#xD;
      limbs will be measured with a tape measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events will be documented. At beginning and end of study quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaires and health economic information will be completed by the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Derby site assessment of tissue quality will be made using ultrasound and moisture&#xD;
      meter to assess tissue fluid.&#xD;

Flexitouch System: A segmental, programmable, gradient pneumatic compression device. It consists of a controller and garment set. The garments are constructed of nylon and have 27-32 chambers, depending upon garment size. The pressure setting is variable between &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;increased.&quot; The device is intended to be used for 60 minutes per day.</description>
