      The purpose of the study is to investigate the factors affecting corneal hysteresis (CH) in&#xD;
      Taiwanese.&#xD;

      The ocular response analyzer (ORA, Reichert Ophthalmic Instruments, Buffalo, NY, USA)&#xD;
      measures the biomechanical properties of the cornea in vivo. It provides several measurements&#xD;
      including CH, corneal resistance factor (CRF), corneal-compensated intraocular pressure&#xD;
      (IOPcc), and Goldmann-correlated intraocular pressure (IOPg). Corneal hysteresis is described&#xD;
      as the viscous damping due to the viscoelastic resistance of the cornea to a deformation&#xD;
      pulse by an air jet of the tonometer. Whereas CH may reflect corneal viscosity, the CRF may&#xD;
      relate to the elastic properties of the cornea. Both parameters are measured by the ORA using&#xD;
      a dynamic bidirectional process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CH can be affected by various ocular disorders and operation. In previous studies, CH was&#xD;
      found to be significantly lower in keratoconus, Fuchs' dystrophy, and glaucoma. After laser&#xD;
      in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and phacoemulsification, CH permanently or temporally&#xD;
      decreased. Among normal population, CH was also variable and associated with several factors:&#xD;
      age, gender, intraocular pressure, central corneal thickness, and corneal curvature. High&#xD;
      myopic patients with long axial length were found to have lower CH than in normal subjects.&#xD;
      CH can also affected by races, and CH was largely discussed in Caucasian population. Herein&#xD;
      we studied normal population of CH and associated factors and in Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are planned to conduct a retrospective study from January to July, 2009 at Department of&#xD;
      Ophthalmology, Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan by chart review. We will enroll&#xD;
      the patients with bilateral cataract, or unilateral cataract and healthy fellow eye, who not&#xD;
      having other ocular pathology, prior ocular surgery, or previous trauma. Several ocular&#xD;
      parameters and demographics of both un-operated eyes in these patients are measured. CRF,&#xD;
      IOPcc, IOPg, and CH are measured by ORA. Central corneal thickness is measured using the&#xD;
      ORA's integrated handheld ultrasonic pachymeter. The IOLMaster (Carl Zeiss, Jena, German) is&#xD;
      used to obtain the ocular biometry including axial length, anterior chamber depth, and&#xD;
      keratometry. Linear regression models were used to test the correlation of CH and&#xD;
      quantitative factors. The chi-square test was used to find the significance of correlation in&#xD;
      categorical values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One or two eyes of the patients undergoes uneventful phacoemulsification and in-the-bag&#xD;
      implantation of posterior chamber intraocular lens (one-piece AcrySof, Alcon lab, Texas, USA)&#xD;
      by one surgeon (Wang JK). The sutureless corneal wound was 2.75 mm long. CRF, IOPcc, IOPg,&#xD;
      and CH are measured by ORA preoperatively and 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 1 month, 2&#xD;
      months, and 3 months postoperatively. Paired t test was used to compare the changes of these&#xD;
      parameters following the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that some factors will correlate with CH, such as axial length, IOP, age, and&#xD;
      central corneal thickness. Temporary reduction in CH is possibly shortly after&#xD;
      phacoemulsification, and returning to the baseline following a period of time.&#xD;
