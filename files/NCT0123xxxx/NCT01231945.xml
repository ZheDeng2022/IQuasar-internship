      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Low-cost molecular human papillomavirus (HPV) testing may offer a more robust alternative&#xD;
      to Pap smears and visual inspection for cervical cancer screening of underserved women. Two&#xD;
      low-cost molecular tests for human HPV, the HPV E6 Test and the careHPV test, have been&#xD;
      developed to detect cervical cancer by testing for HPV DNA. These tests take between 2 and 3&#xD;
      hours to run and may provide point-of-care (diagnostic testing at or near the site of patient&#xD;
      care) testing for HPV. Researchers are interested in evaluating both tests to determine the&#xD;
      best strategy for HPV testing of women who live in rural or underserved areas that have a&#xD;
      high prevalence of cervical cancer diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the clinical performance of the HPV E6 Test and careHPV in detecting&#xD;
           cervical cancer and precancerous lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the best low-cost test or combination of tests for women who have been&#xD;
           referred for cervical cancer screening or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the clinical performance of self-collected specimens versus&#xD;
           clinician-collected specimens in detecting cervical cancer and precancerous lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Women between 25 and 65 years of age who live in rural China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study involves an initial testing visit and a 1-year followup visit for a high-risk&#xD;
           subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have the HPV E6 test, careHPV, and a visual inspection test for&#xD;
           cervical cancer. For comparison, participants will also have the standard HPV test&#xD;
           approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who test positive for HPV on any of the above tests will also have&#xD;
           colposcopy to collect samples of cervical tissue for further study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A random sample of women who test negative for HPV will also have colposcopy.&#xD;
           Participants may also have biopsies if there is visual evidence of cervical&#xD;
           abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the 1-year followup visit, participants in the high-risk subgroup will have the same&#xD;
           tests as in the previous visit..&#xD;

      Low-cost, molecular human papillomavirus (HPV) testing may offer a more robust alternative to&#xD;
      Pap smears and visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) for cervical cancer screening of&#xD;
      underserved women. Two low-cost molecular tests for human papillomavirus (HPV) have been&#xD;
      developed: 1) AVantage HPV E6 Test (Arbor Vita Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) ( HPV E6 Test&#xD;
      ) detects E6 oncoproteins from HPV16, 18, and 45 and 2) careHPV (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD,&#xD;
      USA) detects the DNA for a pool of 14 carcinogenic HPV genotypes. The HPV E6 Test will be&#xD;
      ready for the first clinical evaluations in 2010. The HPV E6 Test works like an ELISA in&#xD;
      strip format such that it takes less than two hours to run and may provide point-of-care&#xD;
      (diagnostic testing at or near the site of patient care) testing. careHPV, a batch HPV DNA&#xD;
      test that takes 2.5 hours to perform, has already been developed and is currently being used&#xD;
      in demonstration projects. The results to date for careHPV are promising. As our primary&#xD;
      objective, we wish to evaluate both tests, and to evaluate the best low-cost triage&#xD;
      strategies for careHPV-positive results in areas of high prevalence of carcinogenic HPV DNA.&#xD;
      A study of 7,500 women, ages 25-65 years, identified from an age- and region-stratified&#xD;
      sample of women living in rural China will be conducted. All women will be screened at&#xD;
      enrollment, and a high-risk subgroup at the one-year follow-up, by the following tests: HPV&#xD;
      E6 Test, careHPV, and visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). Women will also be screened&#xD;
      at enrollment, and a high-risk subgroup at the one-year follow-up, using the digene HC2 HPV&#xD;
      DNA Test TM ( HC2 ) (formerly known as Hybrid Capture 2)(Qiagen), the first U.S. Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration-approved HPV test and the gold standard for clinical HPV testing. At both&#xD;
      time points, all screen-positive women will be evaluated by colposcopy using a rigorous&#xD;
      diagnostic protocol. A random sample of screen negatives will undergo colposcopy but will&#xD;
      only undergo biopsies if there is visual evidence of cervical epithelial abnormalities.&#xD;
      careHPV-positive specimens will be tested for most carcinogenic HPV genotypes, HPV16, HPV18,&#xD;
      and HPV45 using careHPV16/18/45. This triage test utilizes the same test platform as careHPV&#xD;
      but screens only for those 3 carcinogenic HPV genotypes. The primary goals are 1) to evaluate&#xD;
      the clinical performance of careHPV, the HPV E6 Test, and VIA for detection of cervical&#xD;
      precancer and cancer and 2) to determine the positive predictive values of VIA, the HPV E6&#xD;
      Test, and HPV16/18/45 detection by careHPV16/18/45 for cervical precancer and cancer among&#xD;
      careHPV-positive women.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  We will not exclude women if they have had previous cervical cancer screening because&#xD;
             we assume that even if a few women have been screened for cervical cancer, the quality&#xD;
             of cytology screening was very poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1) are not married AND report never having had sexual intercourse 2) have had a total&#xD;
        hysterectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3) have a history of cervical cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        4) are physically or mentally unable to undergo routine cervical cancer screening or unable&#xD;
        to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5) are pregnant or have been pregnant in the last month&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Women who are currently menstruating at the time of enrollment will be deferred from&#xD;
        participating, and will become eligible to participate 7-14 days after menstruation has&#xD;
        ended. The menstruating women will be advised to return for the screening 7 to 14 days&#xD;
        after their menstrual period has concluded.&#xD;
