    <textblock>
      Voclosporin is an investigational medication previously studied to prevent acute rejection in&#xD;
      patients who receive a kidney transplant. This study is a compassionate release program where&#xD;
      subjects previously participating in the study entitled A Phase 2B, Randomized, Multicenter,&#xD;
      Open-Label, Concentration Controlled, Safety Study of ISA247 and Tacrolimus (Prograf®) in&#xD;
      denovo Renal Transplant Patients (ISA05-01)&quot; may be eligible to continue to receive&#xD;
      voclosporin despite the Phase 2B study being terminated by the sponsor. Under the&#xD;
      compassionate release program, subjects previously taking voclosporin may continue to receive&#xD;
      the study medication until the drug is FDA-approved and commercially available in the United&#xD;
      States.&#xD;

      Voclosporin is an investigational medication previously studied to prevent acute rejection in&#xD;
      patients who receive a kidney transplant. This study is a compassionate release program where&#xD;
      subjects previously participating in the study entitled A Phase 2B, Randomized, Multicenter,&#xD;
      Open-Label, Concentration Controlled, Safety Study of ISA247 and Tacrolimus (Prograf®) in&#xD;
      denovo Renal Transplant Patients (ISA05-01)&quot; may be eligible to continue to receive&#xD;
      voclosporin despite the Phase 2B study being terminated by the sponsor. Under the&#xD;

      the study medication until the drug is FDA-approved and commercially available in the United&#xD;
      States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive voclosporin and will be followed in an outpatient setting. After their&#xD;
      initial visit, patients will return for follow-up at least every 3 months (through month 24)&#xD;
      and then every 6 months (beginning at month 24). Safety and efficacy measurements will be&#xD;
      taken at appropriate time points as outlined in the table below. Trough voclosporin&#xD;
      measurements will be collected at least every 3 months (through month 24) and then every 6&#xD;
      months (beginning at month 24) or more frequently at clinic visits as appropriate (as&#xD;
      indicated by clinical events (such as rejection, infection, adverse event) or concomitant&#xD;
      administration of an interacting medication. Patient and graft survival data will be&#xD;
      collected on an annual basis for safety reporting.&#xD;
