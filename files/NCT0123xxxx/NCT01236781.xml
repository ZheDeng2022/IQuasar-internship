  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter trial using Hologic digital mammography units will evaluate the specificity&#xD;
      of 2-D full field digital mammography (FFDM) versus a combination of 2-D and 3-D&#xD;
      tomosynthesis imaging in breast cancer screening. Specificity, in this study, will be&#xD;
      measured by the participant call-back rate by each modality. Varying combinations of 2-D&#xD;
      mammography and tomosynthesis projections will be evaluated to optimize the screening&#xD;
      paradigm and limit radiation exposure when tomosynthesis is incorporated. Both prospective&#xD;
      and retrospective imaging data will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Digital breast tomography (DBT) will improve the specificity of breast cancer&#xD;
      screening as measured by a reduction in the call-back rate while maintaining the sensitivity&#xD;
      of cancer detection. This improved accuracy will be achieved by the optimization of the&#xD;
      imaging sequence and number of views obtained at a capped radiation dose in the combined DBT&#xD;
      and 2-D screening sequence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asymptomatic women 25 years and older with no history of breast cancer will be recruited from&#xD;
      a prospective population of patients scheduled for screening mammography (Group A). A similar&#xD;
      population of women called back from screening for 2-D FFDM-detected abnormalities will also&#xD;
      be recruited to provide an enriched population of true-positive and false-positive 2-D FFDM&#xD;
      and tomosynthesis cases (Group B). Pregnant women, women unable to tolerate compression of&#xD;
      the breast associated with mammography, women with implants, and women with breasts too large&#xD;
      to accommodate adequate positioning of the breast for DBT are excluded from trial&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 550 participants will be recruited--500 women will enroll for collection of&#xD;
      prospective imaging data in this trial (Group A); 50 additional participants, recalled for&#xD;
      diagnostic assessment after positive screening findings, will be recruited for DBT imaging&#xD;
      data collection and retrospective image analysis (Group B). Participating institutions for&#xD;
      this trial will be clinical research institutions in Pennsylvania with Hologic tomosynthesis&#xD;
      units.&#xD;
