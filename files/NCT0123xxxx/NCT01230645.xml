    <textblock>
      RV568 is being developed for the treatment of diseases such as asthma, COPD and allergic&#xD;
      rhinitis (e.g. hayfever). The main aim of this study is to investigate whether RV568 is&#xD;
      effective in reducing the inflammation caused by viral infections such as RSV (respiratory&#xD;
      syncytial virus).&#xD;
