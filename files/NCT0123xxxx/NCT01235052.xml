  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck cancer is the sixth most frequent cancer worldwide, excluding lymphomas and&#xD;
      skin cancer. If 18FDG PET is considered today as a standard tool in patients with head and&#xD;
      neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) not only for tumoral or nodal staging but also for&#xD;
      assessment of distant metastases and synchronous second primary malignancies, hypoxia is one&#xD;
      of the most important prognostic factors in radiotherapy of this type of tumors. The only&#xD;
      gold standard method for direct determination of oxygen tension is based on using oxygen&#xD;
      electrodes showing a good relation with clinical outcome but complex in its realisation. So,&#xD;
      PET using 18F-FMISO has been described to be useful for the non invasive assessment of&#xD;
      hypoxia in cancer. Especially in France, the use of this radiotracer is very limited and&#xD;
      there is no standardised methodology to acquire and quantify 18F-FMISO signal. So there is a&#xD;
      need for a rigorous evaluation of this PET tracer. In another way, it could be a very useful&#xD;
      tool for evaluation of new therapies and modification of volumes in radiotherapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hypoxia is one of the major worst prognostic factors of clinical outcome in cancer. It is&#xD;
      actually admitted that hypoxia is heterogeneous, variable within different tumour types and&#xD;
      that it varies spatially and temporally in a tumor. Hypoxia induce proteomic and gene&#xD;
      expression changes that lead to increase angiogenesis, invasion and metastases. So, the&#xD;
      hypoxic fraction in solid tumours reduces their sensitivity to conventional treatment&#xD;
      modalities, modulating therapeutic response to ionizing radiation or certain chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      agents. This is particularly important in head and neck cancers (HNC). Hypoxic cells in solid&#xD;
      tumours could influence local failure following radiotherapy and has been associated with&#xD;
      malignant progression, loco regional spread and distant metastases and represents an&#xD;
      increasing probability of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the non-invasive determination and monitoring of the oxygenation status could be of&#xD;
      tumours is of importance to predict patient outcome and eventually modify therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies in those tumours. Today, the oxygenation status of individual tumours is not&#xD;
      assessed routinely. Numerous different approaches have been proposed to identify hypoxia in&#xD;
      tumours. Eppendorf oxygen electrode measurements (pO2 histography) may be considered as a&#xD;
      'gold standard' for hypoxia in human malignancies. However, it is an invasive method being&#xD;
      confined to superficial, well accessible tumours and requires many measures. PET using&#xD;
      [18F]Fluoro-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG), allows non-invasive imaging of glucose metabolism and&#xD;
      takes a growing place in cancer staging, But 18F-FDG can't assess correctly the oxygenation&#xD;
      status of tumours. PET with appropriate radiotracers enables non-invasive assessment of&#xD;
      presence and distribution of hypoxia in tumours. Nitroimidazoles are a class of electron&#xD;
      affinic molecules that were shown to accumulate in hypoxic cells in vitro and in vivo.&#xD;
      [18F]-FMISO is the most frequently used tracer ; its intracellular retention is dependent on&#xD;
      oxygen tension. Consequently, [18F]-FMISO has been used as a non-invasive technique for&#xD;
      detection of hypoxia in humans. Different authors have demonstrated that it is suitable to&#xD;
      localize and quantify hypoxia. Thus, [18F]-FMISO PET has been studied to evaluate prognosis&#xD;
      and predict treatment response. However, some investigators report an unclear correlation&#xD;
      between Eppendorf measurements and standardized uptake values (SUV). This observation may be&#xD;
      explained by the structural complexity of hypoxic tumour tissues. Nevertheless, there is a&#xD;
      need of standardized procedures to acquire and quantify [18F]-FMISO uptake. Today, the use of&#xD;
      this tracer is very limited in clinic and the academic studies have included small&#xD;
      populations of patients and suffer of the heterogeneity of technical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the optimal acquisition protocol and image&#xD;
      reconstruction to describe [18F]-FMISO uptake in HNC, then, to validate [18F]-FMISO-PET as a&#xD;
      predictive marker of response to treatment.&#xD;

    <description>We will introduce a pretherapy [18F]-FMISO PET-CT in the treatment planning of patients suffering of head and neck cancer and eligible to a radical treatment with curative intent, consisting of conformational radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy or associated targeted therapy. [18F]-FMISO PET-CT results will not be taken into account for the patients' management. We will test different acquisition protocols and use a wild panel of quantification parameters issued from published studies and originals 'one developed by our team enable to describe [18F]-FMISO uptake. Patients will be followed clinically and para-clinically during two years after the end of the treatment according to the edited recommendations of these tumours type and grade to analyze outcome.</description>
