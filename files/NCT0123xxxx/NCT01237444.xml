      The purpose of this study is designed to compare the safety, tolerability, antiviral activity&#xD;
      and immunological effect of lopinavir/ritonavir plus lamivudine (3TC) versus standard therapy&#xD;
      with 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus&#xD;
      lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of naïve HIV-1 infected subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Combination therapy with 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) plus a&#xD;
      non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or a protease inhibitor (PI) has been&#xD;
      the mainstay of therapy for over 10 years, based on sound evidence derived from randomized&#xD;
      controlled clinical trials and epidemiological data.A variety of new approaches designed to&#xD;
      address the problems associated with combination highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)&#xD;
      are currently being explored. These include strategic treatment interruptions to reduce time&#xD;
      on therapy, toxicity and cost;Based on its performance, a dual drug combination that includes&#xD;
      lopinavir/ritonavir and spares the more toxic NRTIs such as thymidine nucleoside-analogs, but&#xD;
      maintains non-thymidine nucleoside-analogs appears as a potentially simple, safe and&#xD;
      effective regimen.&#xD;
