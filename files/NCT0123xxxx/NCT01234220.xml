      The AVIS Study is a retrospective multicenter international study that aims to answer a&#xD;
      series of questions on the use and performance of adrenal venous catheterization (AVS) for&#xD;
      the diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism subtype. A questionnaire will be circulated among&#xD;
      the centres that are internationally recognized and have published in the field of AVS and&#xD;
      have agreed to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim of the AVIS study is to collect summary data on how AVS is being performed&#xD;
      throughout the world to answer the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How many AVS studies haw been performed yearly from 2005 to 2010 at each center?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How many adrenal vein ruptures occurred during the AVS at each center?Has the rate of&#xD;
           adrenal vein rupture been steady or has it changed over the 5 years?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How many centers use bilaterally simultaneous and how many use sequential AVS&#xD;
           catheterization?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How many radiologists perform AVS at each center?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How many centers use a cosyntropin stimulation during AVS?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the percentage of PA patients in whom AVS is performed?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How many centres calculate the selectivity index? What is the minimum cutoff used?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How many centers calculate the lateralization index? What is the minimum cutoff used?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are the AVS studies that are not bilaterally selective used for diagnosis?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How many centers calculate the controlateral suppression index and what is the minimum&#xD;
           cutoff used?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the cost of AVS for the National Health System or Insurance and for patients?&#xD;
           The second aim of the study is to calculate the rate of AVS studies that are selective&#xD;
           and show lateralization of aldosterone excess at each center by applying predefined set&#xD;
           of criteria for defining selectivity and lateralization. Data on the final diagnosis of&#xD;
           the PA subtype will be gathered and used as reference to assess the performance of AVS&#xD;
           using receiver operating characteristic curves analysis and the Youden index to&#xD;
           determine the optimal cutoffs. A worksheet will need to be completed providing&#xD;
           information on the following: Demography; Date of AVS;Baseline blood pressure (BP)&#xD;
           values and serum K+;Dynamic test during the AVS if any; plasma aldosterone and cortisol&#xD;
           concentration in the infra-adrenal inferior vena cava and in the right and left adrenal&#xD;
           vein; diagnosis of PA subtype; treatment (adrenalectomy or pharmacological therapy);&#xD;
           post-treatment BP and serum K+ values; concordance/discordance between imaging (CT or&#xD;
           RM) and AVS.&#xD;

      Background. AVS is recommended by the current Endocrine Society Guideline as the gold&#xD;
      standard for the identification of the surgically curable subtype of primary aldosteronism&#xD;
      (PA).(Funder 2008) However, consensus on the way AVS should be performed and on the&#xD;
      interpretation of its results still lacks, as recently pointed out. (Stewart 2010, Auchus&#xD;
      2010) In particular, some centers use the bilateral simultaneous technique, while others&#xD;
      perform the sequential catheterization. Moreover, some centers perform AVS during or after&#xD;
      using ACTH stimulation, albeit with different doses, and others do not use any&#xD;
      stimulation.(Seccia 2009) In addition, some are utilizing the absolute values of plasma&#xD;
      cortisol and aldosterone to determinate the lateralization (Nishikawa 2007), whereas others&#xD;
      are relying on calculation of the selectivity index to determine the collection of adrenal&#xD;
      vein blood, followed by calculation of the and the lateralization index only if bilaterally&#xD;
      selective samples were obtained.(Rossi 2008) Moreover, large differences in the cutoffs for&#xD;
      establishing selectivity and lateralization exist, which have not been clarified by recent&#xD;
      studies that rather added further complexity to this field.(Mulatero 2010) If a consistent&#xD;
      degree of success rate can be achieved by having only one or two radiologists performing AVS&#xD;
      at each centre, or if more radiologists can become proficient in performing the procedure and&#xD;
      consistently achieving adequate results, also remains to be clarified. Finally, some centers&#xD;
      perform AVS in all patients who are plausible candidates to adrenalectomy, while other submit&#xD;
      to AVS only a small proportion of the patients (Young WJ personal communication).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, it remains unclear which is the proportion of patients with PA who are offered AVS at&#xD;
      the different centers, and how many of those who are submitted to AVS ultimately undergo&#xD;
      adrenalectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an era of shrinking budget the issue of cost the issue of costs of the procedure also&#xD;
      remains a relevant one when assessing the cost-effectiveness of the diagnostic work-up of PA.&#xD;
      A preliminary survey suggests that there are huge variations across different countries in&#xD;
      the charges for AVS to both the patients and/or the health care and insurance system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is likely that one of the reasons for the lack of consensus on AVS could depend on the&#xD;
      facts that: i) no single centre as gathered a number of AVS studies large enough to warrant&#xD;
      solid conclusions; ii) there has been no systematic survey of the AVS data that have been&#xD;
      generated around the world in this field&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study. Based on this background, the aims of the AVIS study are those described&#xD;
      above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design. To the first aim a questionnaire will be circulated among the centers that are&#xD;
      internationally recognized and have published in the field of AVS and have agreed to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected and handled at the maximum level of confidentiality under the&#xD;
      requirement of the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study selection criteria. Eligible centers will be identified among those that have published&#xD;
      in the English literature on AVS or PA (reported variously as observational cohort studies,&#xD;
      or clinical trials): Studies will be identified through computer-assisted literature searches&#xD;
      of databases, scanning of reference lists, hand-searching of relevant journals,&#xD;
      correspondence with authors of relevant reports and consultation with experts in the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria will be the consent of the leading investigator to participate in the&#xD;
      data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only exclusion criteria will be the refusal to participate in the study. The number of&#xD;
      adhering and non-adhering centers will be recorded and mentioned in the publications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection. Data will be collected in an anonymous way on many characteristics at&#xD;
      baseline and at subsequent surveys during follow-up. Information on categorical variables,&#xD;
      will be systematically re-coded to ensure comparability among studies. For each individual&#xD;
      patient, data were sought on the following outcomes: blood pressure and antihypertensive&#xD;
      medications at follow-up post-adrenalectomy and on dates of occurrence of cardiovascular&#xD;
      events, including non-fatal CHD; non fatal stroke; specific cause mortality (or at least&#xD;
      fatal CDH and fatal stroke) and other cardiovascular outcomes. Being a retrospective study,&#xD;
      precise details of the diagnostic criteria used for the definition of incident cases will be&#xD;
      sought from each centre (as were data on the completeness of follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data obtained from each participating study will be checked for internal consistency and any&#xD;
      queries that might arrive will clarified with the P.I. of each centre, before harmonization&#xD;
      to a standard format.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The content of the data will be unchanged by this process, and computer-generated detailed&#xD;
      summary tabulations based will be reviewed and confirmed by collaborators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be stored securely and anonymously at the coordinating centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed by use of summary statistics after appropriate&#xD;
      transformation of the variables that show a skewed distribution as PAC and PCC by means of&#xD;
      the SPSS for Mac (vers 18.0), GaphPad and the MedCalc softwares.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific Committee. The leading investigator of each centre contributing at least 50 AVS&#xD;
      studies will be invited to participate in the scientific committee of the AVIS study and will&#xD;
      have full access to the locked database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results. Upon completion of the first phase of the study the investigators expect to&#xD;
      be able to gather information on the way AVS is being performed around the world and&#xD;
      therefore to prepare a first manuscript reporting on the number of AVS per centre, the rate&#xD;
      of adrenal vein ruptures during the procedure, the rate of use of simultaneous/sequential AVS&#xD;
      catheterization, the number of radiologists that perform AVS and their success rate in the&#xD;
      procedure, the rate of use of stimulation test during the perform of AVS, the percentage of&#xD;
      PA patients to whom AVS is offered at each center, the rate of calculation of the selectivity&#xD;
      index, the lateralization index and the contralateral suppression index and their cutoff&#xD;
      limits, the use of AVS studies that are not bilaterally selective for diagnosis and the costs&#xD;
      of AVS for the National Health System or Insurance and for the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the database with the individual data the investigators expect to be able&#xD;
      to gather &gt; 2000 AVS studies, in a single database. After harmonization of the data,&#xD;
      identification of the outliers and of the underlying reasons (by interaction with the leading&#xD;
      investigator at each center), the database will be locked. The investigators will then&#xD;
      undertake the statistical analysis, which will entail the following variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demography (sex, age, race);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) values;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum K+ before AVS;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dynamic test during the AVS if any;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plasma aldosterone (PAC) and cortisol concentration (PCC) in the infraadrenal inferior&#xD;
           vena cava (IVC) and in the right (RAV) and left (LAV) adrenal vein;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Final diagnosis (bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia (BAH), unilateral adrenocortical&#xD;
           hyperplasia (UAH), aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), bilateral APA;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment (adrenalectomy or pharmacological therapy);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-treatment blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) values;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-treatment sK+ ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis concordance/discordance between imaging (CT or RM) and AVS. Data on the&#xD;
           demography, biochemical and hemodynamic features of the patients selected for AVS in the&#xD;
           different continents will be obtained and information on the rate of successful&#xD;
           catheterization will be generated. The concordance rate of imaging and AVS results will&#xD;
           also be determined and the clinical usefulness of the AVS for establishing the&#xD;
           indication to adrenalectomy will be ascertained in the largest database available ever.&#xD;
