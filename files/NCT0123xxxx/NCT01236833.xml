  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is determining if enteral administration of Lactated Ringer's&#xD;
      solution (LR) in preterm infants with feeding intolerance enables for faster advancement of&#xD;
      milk feeding than fasting.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Feeding intolerance is a common problem in premature infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit. Definition is clinical and based on abdominal distension, abdominal tenderness, emesis,&#xD;
      change in gastric residuals, presence of blood in stool, and apnea with bradycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feeding intolerance is associated with serious complications: necrotizing enterocolitis,&#xD;
      longer hospitalization and prolonged intravenous nutrition complications (e.g. sepsis, liver&#xD;
      damage). Therefore, the investigators aim to achieve adequate enteral nutrition as soon as&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because LR is a an amniotic fluid-like solution, it may improve gastro-intestinal function&#xD;
      and avoid fasting, as well as its multiple problems (e.g. intestinal atrophy and decreased&#xD;
      intestinal motility). LR was chosen as the test solution because of experience documenting&#xD;
      its safe use in comparable groups: in newborn resuscitation parenterally, in amnioinfusion,&#xD;
      and in bowel irrigation. Moreover, LR is similar in electrolytes composition to the&#xD;
      experimental solution used in previous studies by Barney et al in neonates.&#xD;
