    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the current study was to determine the association between halitosis&#xD;
      detection (presence or absence) and periodontal status in non-smoking subjects, and also&#xD;
      assess whether halitosis recordings were related to periodontal clinical parameters, tongue&#xD;
      coating and quantities of two putative periodontal pathogens on the posterior region of the&#xD;
      tongue determined by real-time PCR. Secondary, halitosis recordings were compared among&#xD;
      subjects with chronic periodontitis, chronic generalized gingivitis and periodontal health.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A debate in the literature exists as to whether periodontitis is linked with oral malodour&#xD;
      and this study attempts to understand the way in which periodontal disease is associated with&#xD;
      oral malodour-related parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventy-eight systemically healthy non-smokers were screened for oral halitosis in the&#xD;
      Department of Periodontology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. These were&#xD;
      non-halitosis complaining subjects. After initial screening for suitability and obtaining a&#xD;
      signed informed consent approved by the Ethics Committee of the Dental School, Aristotle&#xD;
      University of Thessaloniki, a full-mouth periodontal charting was recorded including plaque&#xD;
      index (PI), clinical probing depth (CPD), clinical attachment levels (CAL) and bleeding on&#xD;
      probing (BOP) at six sites per tooth using a manual periodontal probe (Hu-Friedy XP-23/QW).&#xD;
      The subjects that fulfilled the clinical inclusion criteria were classified as chronic&#xD;
      periodontitis (N=28), chronic generalised gingivitis (N=23) or healthy individuals (27) and&#xD;
      were further clinically and microbiologically monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of tongue coating:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Winkel Tongue Coating Index (Winkel et al., 2003) was visually determined by dividing the&#xD;
      dorsum of the tongue into sextants. A score between zero and two was given to each sextant&#xD;
      according to the amount of deposits and these scores were added giving a total ranging from&#xD;
      zero to 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of tongue sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A specimen was collected from the rear of the tongue dorsum for quantitative analysis of two&#xD;
      putative periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, by&#xD;
      real-time PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to avoid interference of bleeding on probing and tongue sampling with the&#xD;
      organoleptic assessments and primarily with the evaluation of the tongue odour, subjects were&#xD;
      recalled on a second visit at the same time of the day and within a period of four days for&#xD;
      oral malodour assessment. Within this short time interval, participants were asked not to&#xD;
      change their routine dietary and oral hygiene habits except for 48 hours prior to the next&#xD;
      visit when the halitosis assessments were carried out (Roldán et al., 2003; Donaldson et al.,&#xD;
      2007). Written instructions were given to each participant regarding food and drink&#xD;
      consumption and oral hygiene habits. In more detail, spicy food, onion, garlic, alcohol and&#xD;
      mouthwashes were avoided 48 prior to the examination. On the morning of evaluation coffee,&#xD;
      mints, chewing gum, oral hygiene practices, scented cosmetics or aftershave lotion were&#xD;
      avoided. Consumption of water and oral rinses with water were allowed at least two hours&#xD;
      prior to the odour assessment. In a similar manner, the judge who carried out the&#xD;
      organoleptic assessments of oral malodour followed the same instructions as the participants&#xD;
      for 24 hours before undertaking the examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral malodour assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Halimeter® (Halimeter® RH-17, Interscan Corporation, Chatsworth, CA, USA) was used&#xD;
           to measure the concentration of volatile sulphide compounds (VSC) in parts per billion&#xD;
           (p.p.b.) (Rosenberg et al., 1991). The assessments were always carried out between&#xD;
           10.00-12.00 at the same dental chair in the clinic to minimise daily variability in the&#xD;
           room's temperature and humidity (Liu et al., 2006);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Organoleptic assessments (ORG) ranging from zero to five (Rosenberg et al., 1991)&#xD;
           assessed the odour of the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole mouth air (ORG1) - subjects were asked to exhale gently into a 20cm long tube through a&#xD;
      screen, to avoid eye contact with the odour judge, who evaluated breath odour at the other&#xD;
      end of the tube (Murata et al., 2002); Anterior region of the dorsum of tongue (ORG2) -&#xD;
      subjects were asked to lick their wrists and wait a couple of seconds to allow the area to&#xD;
      dry out before the odour was assessed; Posterior region of tongue (ORG3) - material was&#xD;
      harvested from the rear of the lingual dorsum in a standardized manner using a plastic spoon;&#xD;
      Nose air - subjects were asked to exhale through one nostril after capping the opposite&#xD;
      nostril with their finger in order to exclude extra-oral causes that may be related to bad&#xD;
      breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A calibrated single &quot;examiner&quot; recorded the periodontal measurements and Halimeter® readings,&#xD;
      whereas one calibrated &quot;judge&quot; carried out the organoleptic assessments of halitosis. All&#xD;
      participants were assessed by the same examiner and judge. To assure unbiased data collection&#xD;
      the odour judge was blinded regarding the Halimeter® measurements and the clinical status of&#xD;
      the individual. Prior to and during this investigation the odour judge and an additional&#xD;
      odour &quot;evaluator&quot; were repeatedly standardized against a wide range of n-butanol solutions&#xD;
      with intensities from 25 to 6075 parts per million (Nachnani et al., 2005; Saad et al., 2005)&#xD;
      and also on the mouth odour of patients attending the periodontal clinic. In order to assess&#xD;
      the reliability of the judge's ratings, the judge and the evaluator examined the mouth odour&#xD;
      of a number of study participants without being aware of one another's score. A statistically&#xD;
      significant correlation was found between the scores (Spearman's rho=0.64 for the odour of&#xD;
      whole mouth air, p&lt;0.001) (S.A.C.M.O.T., 2002). It should be noted that only the judge's&#xD;
      assessments were used in data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were designated as halitosis positive (+) when either the organoleptic score of the&#xD;
      whole mouth air was two or more, and/or the readings of the Halimeter® exceeded 140 p.p.b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real-time polymerase chain reaction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DNA of P. gingivalis strain W50 and F. nucleatum strain ATCC 10953 was prepared at the&#xD;
      Dental School, University of Glasgow following the standard protocol. Briefly, P. gingivalis&#xD;
      and F. nucleatum were grown on fastidious anaerobe agar and harvested after three to seven&#xD;
      days. The organisms from a single agar plate were harvested with swabs and dispersed into PBS&#xD;
      containing 0.1mM disodium EDTA (PBSE). After one washing in PBS, they were resuspended in 1ml&#xD;
      sterile deionised water and aliquoted into two 1.5ml screw top microcaps. DNA was extracted&#xD;
      from the organisms by placing the tubes in a boiling water bath for ten minutes. The lysate&#xD;
      was mixed with an equal volume of phenol: chloroform: isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1; v/v/v) for&#xD;
      five minutes. After centrifugation (13000rpm, 10min) the aqueous upper phase from each&#xD;
      preparation was transferred to a fresh tube and mixed with one volume of chloroform: isoamyl&#xD;
      alcohol (24:1) for five minutes. After centrifugation (13000rpm, 10min) the aqueous upper&#xD;
      phase from each preparation was transferred to a fresh tube and 0.1 volume of 4.5M sodium&#xD;
      acetate solution (pH 5.4) and two volumes of ethanol were added. DNA was precipitated&#xD;
      overnight at -20oC. The DNA was pelleted by centrifugation (13000rpm, 10min) washed&#xD;
      sequentially in 1mL of 70% ethanol, 95% ethanol and allowed to almost dry. The DNA was then&#xD;
      dissolved in 100µl water. The nucleic acid concentration and purity was measured at a&#xD;
      wavelength of 260 nanometres and the ratio of the absorbance at 260 and 280 nanometres was&#xD;
      measured using a sterile quartz cuvette in a spectrophotometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A real-time PCR assay using the TaqMan system (Yoshida et al., 2003) was used in the current&#xD;
      study for the quantitative analysis of the 16S rRNA of F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis in&#xD;
      tongue coatings. Lysates of samples were prepared by boiling the aliquot for 10 minutes after&#xD;
      puncturing the cap with a fine sterile needle to prevent pressure build up. PCR was performed&#xD;
      at a total volume of 20μl using the Light CyclerTM Fast Start DNA Master Hybridization Probes&#xD;
      kit (Roche Diagnostics, Manheim, Germany), 500nM each of sense and antisense primers, 200nM&#xD;
      probe and 5μl of lysed cells. The species-specific primers and TaqMan probes used are shown&#xD;
      in Table 1. The specificity of the amplified products and therefore of the primers was&#xD;
      confirmed previously (Kato et al., 2005; Yoshida et al., 2003). Amplification and detection&#xD;
      were performed with the LightCycler Sequence Detection System (Roche Diagnostics, Manheim,&#xD;
      Germany) with the following cycle conditions, identical for both assays: 95C for 10min, and&#xD;
      then 45 cycles of 95C for 10sec, 58C for 25sec and a final elongation at 40C for 30sec. A&#xD;
      standard curve was plotted for each assay by using serial dilutions of known quantities of&#xD;
      purified genomic DNA of each test organism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical null hypothesis that there is no association between halitosis detection&#xD;
      (presence or absence) and periodontal status in non-smoking subjects was tested by logistic&#xD;
      regression. Since the size of each clinical group was above 20 and the minimum number of&#xD;
      halitosis positive subjects per clinical group exceeded ten, with the exception of the&#xD;
      healthy group (nine halitosis positive subjects), the sample size was deemed adequate for the&#xD;
      application of this statistical model (Peduzzi et al. 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association between halitosis presence or absence and clinical indices (PI, CPD, CAL,&#xD;
      BOP, sites &gt; 5mm CPD, WTCI) was examined using logistic regression. Spearman's rho&#xD;
      correlation coefficient estimated the association between scale variables and also the&#xD;
      agreement between the scores of the two odour assessors. The assumption of normality for&#xD;
      scale variables was tested by the Shapiro Wilk test. Between groups comparisons were&#xD;
      performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, while pair-wise comparisons were conducted by the&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test with Bonferroni's adjustment of type I error.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of data was performed using the SPSS version 16.0 software and the level of&#xD;
      statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;

      The tongue coating was collected with repeated strokes under relative pressure, using a&#xD;
      sterile plastic microbiology loop of 10μl capacity from the terminal sulcus to the apex of&#xD;
      the tongue. Samples were stored on ice in 1.5ml sterile Eppendorf tubes containing 0.4ml&#xD;
      purified H2O. After vortex mixing for 30 seconds to evenly disperse the material the samples&#xD;
      were stored at -70oC until required. The laboratory analysis was performed blind. Once thawed&#xD;
      the tongue specimen was vortex mixed for 30 seconds and an aliquot was taken for subsequent&#xD;
      use in the real-time PCR analysis. Lysates of samples were prepared by boiling the aliquot&#xD;
      for 10 minutes after puncturing the cap with a fine sterile needle to prevent pressure build&#xD;
