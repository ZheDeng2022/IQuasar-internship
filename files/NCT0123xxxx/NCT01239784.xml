  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to investigate the feasibility of using a home-based,&#xD;
      parent-delivered model for providing neurodevelopmental rehabilitation programmes to infants&#xD;
      who have had surgery for a complex heart defect.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurodevelopmental deficits are a common morbidity among children who receive surgical&#xD;
      treatment for complex congenital heart defects in infancy. Over 40% of children with complex&#xD;
      heart defects will have neurodevelopmental deficits that persist throughout childhood even&#xD;
      after a successful surgical procedure in infancy1. These deficits are typically related to&#xD;
      basic motor perceptual motor or visual motor skills. Problems integrating what is seen&#xD;
      (visual perceptions) with body movement (motor skills) makes it difficult for children to&#xD;
      participate in peer play and limits their ability to succeed in school, thereby having a&#xD;
      significant impact on the child's quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional, therapist-delivered rehabilitation programmes to address these delays in&#xD;
      neurodevelopment have not previously been attempted. It would be difficult to provide direct&#xD;
      rehabilitation programmes to these patients given that their defects are rare and few&#xD;
      patients are located within the same geographical area. Home-based, parent-delivered&#xD;
      rehabilitation programmes have previously been shown to be effective at improving the motor&#xD;
      skills of school-age children with complex heart defects5. Since a home-based parent&#xD;
      delivered model would enable the participation of infants regardless of geographic location,&#xD;
      the feasibility of using such a model for delivering neurodevelopmental rehabilitation should&#xD;
      be investigated.&#xD;

    <description>Participation in the study will require the parent and child to attend two assessment visits in addition to completing a series of parent and infant activities on a daily basis throughout the 10-week intervention period. The parent-led activities will include activities such as walking with the child, stacking blocks, rolling a ball to the child, hiding a toy under a blanket for the child to find, encouraging the child to kick a rattle while the child is lying on his/her back, or crawling or rolling in different directions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Families will be eligible to participate in this study if the child:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had the arterial switch operation (for transposition of the great arteries) or has had&#xD;
             a Glenn procedure (for functional single ventricle).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is medically stable for normal infant activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is between 12 and 24 months of age in January 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Families will be excluded from study participation if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The child has a recognized syndrome or other disability affecting neurodevelopment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The child has had a medical procedure in the 3 months preceding the baseline study&#xD;
             assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The cardiologist responsible for the child's care refuses to allow the child's&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The child performs substantially above age-appropriate developmental milestones during&#xD;
             the initial assessment (in which case an intervention is unlikely to have a detectable&#xD;
             additional benefit).&#xD;
