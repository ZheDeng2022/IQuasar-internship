      Study design: Multicenter,randomized, prospective, open label, cross over, six segments,&#xD;
      pilot trial to evaluate blood glucose control overnight under closed-loop insulin delivery&#xD;
      with MD-Logic Artificial Pancreas (MDLAP) system in patients with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      on the first segment 15 eligible subjects will be enrolled from the three participating&#xD;
      centers (5 patients at each center). All 15 patients will participate in the overnight closed&#xD;
      loop session in the hospital settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the second segment, 54 eligible subjects will be enrolled (18 at each center). Each&#xD;
      subject will participate in the two consecutive overnight sessions in diabetes camp settings,&#xD;
      one under closed-loop with MDLAP and one under sensor augmented pump therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the third segment,9-20 eligible patients will be enrolled at the Israeli center only.Each&#xD;
      subject will participate in up to four consecutive overnight under closed loop with MDLAP and&#xD;
      up to four additional overnight under regular sensor augmented pump therapy at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the fourth segment, 45-60 patients will be enrolled at the Israeli center only. This&#xD;
      segment will be conducted at a diabetes camp and will consist of two main parts. In part 1,&#xD;
      15-20 patients will be randomized to participate in one of the two groups: 2-4 nights under&#xD;
      closed loop control while the MD-Logic learning algorithm is activated or 2-4 nights under&#xD;
      closed loop control without activating the MD-Logic learning algorithm. In part 2 of the&#xD;
      forth segment 30-40 patients will participate in two consecutive24-48 hours sessions,one&#xD;
      under closed loop control and the second under sensor augmented pump therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the fifth segment 40-80 eligible patients will be enrolled at the Israeli center only.The&#xD;
      first 10 patients will participate in a pilot session and data gathered at this pilot session&#xD;
      will not be used at the final analysis.This segment will consist of two parts. At part 1 each&#xD;
      subject will participate in 4weeks-1.5 months period of over nights either using closed-loop&#xD;
      with MDLAP or using sensor augmented pump (SAP) therapy.At the end of the first 4 weeks-1.5&#xD;
      months of the study, statistical analysis will be performed in order to decide whether to&#xD;
      extend the study with an optional period of extra 4 weeks-1.5 months.In case it will be&#xD;
      decided to extend the study, additional 4 weeks-1.5 months intervention period following&#xD;
      completion of final visit activities will be offered to participants. Subjects that have&#xD;
      participated in the control group (sensor augmented pump therapy) will be offered the&#xD;
      opportunity to continue to 4 weeks-1.5 months of closed-loop control and the study group will&#xD;
      be offered to switch to sensor augmented pump therapy. In segment 5 part 2, up to 40 patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled. Each patient will participate in 3 months study period either using&#xD;
      overnight closed loop under MDLAP or sensor augmented pump therapy.Participants in segment 5&#xD;
      part 2 will be offered to participate in part 2A. At this part, sleep quality assessment will&#xD;
      be made (by using actigraf and sleep questionnaire) At the end of this period an optional 3&#xD;
      months extension period will be offered with the other arm (cross-over)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Segment 6 will be consist of two main parts.In part 1, up to 40 eligible patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled at the Israeli center only. Each subject will participate in up to 72 hours of&#xD;
      closed-loop with MDLAP at home and up to 72 hours under regular sensor augmented pump therapy&#xD;
      . The sequence of the treatment intervention will be randomly assigned. The sequence of the&#xD;
      treatment intervention will be randomly assigned. In part 2 of this segment 40 eligible&#xD;
      patients will enrolled at the Israeli center only. Each subject will participate in up to 2&#xD;
      weeks of closed loop with MDLAP at home and up to 2 weeks under regular sensor augmented pump&#xD;
      therapy. The sequence of the treatment intervention will be randomly assigned&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The objective of this feasibility study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      blood glucose control using the MD-Logic Artificial Pancreas System in individuals with type&#xD;
      1 diabetes in the hospital settings,at a diabetes camp and finally at patient's home.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the last two decades, remarkable technological progress has been made with the development&#xD;
      of continuous glucose sensors, miniature devices, implantable pumps and sensors and wireless&#xD;
      communications, interest in the closed-loop insulin delivery was revived.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control trails that evaluate the clinical benefits of continuous glucose sensor have shown&#xD;
      improved HbA1c with no significant increase in sever hypoglycemia, trend towards lower&#xD;
      hypoglycemic episodes although not significant and no significant change in sever&#xD;
      hypoglycemia. One of the main drawbacks of continuous glucose sensor is noncompliant of the&#xD;
      patient, the flow of information and the need to act accordingly makes this devise a burden&#xD;
      for some patients. Theoretically subcutaneous insulin pumps and glucose sensors attached to&#xD;
      an artificial pancreas in a closed-loop system can mimic the activity of functioning&#xD;
      pancreatic beta cells, with strict control of blood glucose levels. Such a system may also&#xD;
      offer an opportunity to free the patients from the daily burden of dealing with their&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We developed the MD-Logic Artificial Pancreas (MDLAP) which is based on a model which&#xD;
      imitates the logic of diabetes care givers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aimed to evaluate blood glucose control overnight under closed- loop insulin delivery with&#xD;
      MD-Logic Artificial Pancreas (MDLAP) system in patients with type 1 diabetes in the hospital&#xD;
      settings,at diabetes camp settings and finally at patient's home .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives To determine the safety and efficacy of using the MDLAP system to&#xD;
      automatically control blood glucose in type 1 diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Scope This is a three center, prospective pilot trail to evaluate blood glucose control&#xD;
      under closed-loop insulin delivery with MD-Logic Artificial Pancreas (MDLAP) system in&#xD;
      patients with type 1 diabetes, being conducted in: Tel Aviv, Israel;Ljubljana, Slovenia and&#xD;
      Hannover, Germany&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study will be consist from six segments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In segment 1, 15 eligible patients will be enrolled for the pilot study. 5 patients will be&#xD;
      recruited at each center.Data generated from the first patient at each center will not be&#xD;
      included at the final statistical analysis and will be used to assess logistical and training&#xD;
      issues only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the second segment, 54 eligible subjects will be enrolled (18 at each center). Each&#xD;
      subject will participate in the two consecutive overnight sessions in diabetes camp settings,&#xD;
      one under closed-loop with MDLAP and one under sensor augmented pump therapy. Staying at a&#xD;
      camp, can represent the home setting, but has on site the support of a medical team trained&#xD;
      in diabetes. A remote safety and control diabetes management system will be utilized at this&#xD;
      segment to enable the supervising personnel to alert the patient and intervene in cases of&#xD;
      impending hypoglycemia, long standing hyperglycemia and technical faults of any component of&#xD;
      the AP system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the third segment,9-20 eligible patients will be enrolled at the Israeli center only.Each&#xD;
      subject will participate in up to four consecutive overnight under closed loop with MDLAP and&#xD;
      up to four additional overnight under regular sensor augmented pump therapy at home.In&#xD;
      similar to segment 2, we will use also at segment 3 the remote safety and control diabetes&#xD;
      management system which enable the supervising personnel to alert the patient or parents and&#xD;
      intervene in cases of impending hypoglycemia, long standing hyperglycemia and technical&#xD;
      faults of any component of the AP system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the fourth segment, 45-60 patients will be enrolled at the Israeli center only, This&#xD;
      segment will be conducted at a diabetes camp and will consist of two main parts. In part 1,&#xD;
      15-20 patients will be randomized to participate in one of the two groups: 2-4 nights under&#xD;
      closed loop control while the MD-Logic learning algorithm is activated or 2-4 nights under&#xD;
      closed loop control without activating the MD-Logic learning algorithm. In part 2 of the&#xD;
      forth segment 30-40 patients will participate in two consecutive 24-48 hours sessions,one&#xD;
      under closed loop control and the second under sensor augmented pump therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the fifth segment 40-80 eligible patients will be enrolled at the Israeli center only and&#xD;
      will be conducted at patient's home. This segment will consist of two main parts .The first&#xD;
      10 patients will participate in a pilot session and data gathered at this pilot session will&#xD;
      not be used at the final analysis. At part 1 each subject will participate in 4 weeks-1.5&#xD;
      months period of over nights either using closed-loop with MDLAP or using sensor augmented&#xD;
      pump (SAP) therapy.At the end of the first 4 weeks-1.5 months of the study, statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be performed in order to decide whether to extend the study with an optional&#xD;
      period of extra 4 weeks-1.5 months.In case it will be decided to extend the study, additional&#xD;
      4 weeks-1.5 months intervention period following completion of final visit activities will be&#xD;
      offered to participants. Subjects that have participated in the control group (sensor&#xD;
      augmented pump therapy) will be offered the opportunity to continue to 4 weeks-1.5 months of&#xD;
      closed-loop control and the study group will be offered to switch to sensor augmented pump&#xD;
      therapy. In segment 5 part 2, up to 40 patients will be enrolled. Each patient will&#xD;
      participate in 3 months study period either using overnight closed loop under MDLAP or sensor&#xD;
      augmented pump therapy. Participants in segment 5 part 2 will be offered to participate in&#xD;
      part 2A. At this part, sleep quality assessment will be made (by using actigraf and sleep&#xD;
      questionnaire). At the end of this period an optional 3 months extension period will be&#xD;
      offered with the other arm (cross-over).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Segment 6 will be consist of two main parts.In part 1 up to 40 eligible patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled at the Israeli center only. Each subject will participate in up to 72 hours of&#xD;
      closed-loop with MDLAP at home and up to 72 hours under regular sensor augmented pump therapy&#xD;
      . The sequence of the treatment intervention will be randomly assigned. In part 2 of this&#xD;
      segment 40 eligible patients will enrolled at the Israeli center only. Each subject will&#xD;
      participate in up to 2 weeks of closed loop with MDLAP at home and up to 2 weeks under&#xD;
      regular sensor augmented pump therapy. The sequence of the treatment intervention will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned&#xD;
