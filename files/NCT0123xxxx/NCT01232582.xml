  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain affects an estimated 50 to 65 million individuals in the US, and its incidence&#xD;
      and prevalence is steadily on the rise in correspondence with the increasing longevity of the&#xD;
      population. Spinal pain, encompassing lower back, thoracic and neck pain, is a very common&#xD;
      type of chronic pain that can greatly reduce quality of life. Facet joint pain is most often&#xD;
      associated with facet arthropathy or degenerative arthritis of the joint. This condition&#xD;
      develops due to progressive wear and tear caused by the small but repetitive strain of the&#xD;
      joints throughout a lifetime. Strain and inflammation can induce fluid distention of the&#xD;
      joints which in turn can result in compression of the nerve roots of the joint - the origin&#xD;
      of the chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatments for facet arthropathy and pain include oral medications, intra-articular&#xD;
      injections of anesthetic or steroid medications, energy ablation (e.g. radiofrequency&#xD;
      ablation) for denervation, and in some severe cases facet rhizotomy (surgical severing of the&#xD;
      nerves).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ExAblate magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound system enables noninvasive focal&#xD;
      ablation of tissue. Results from feasibility studies, including those from the FDA approved&#xD;
      feasibility study (IDE # G050177) have shown the palliative effect of the ExAblate for&#xD;
      patients with bone metastases. It is reasonable to assume that this palliative effect of&#xD;
      MRgFUS could also translate to the alleviation of facet pain if focused ultrasound beams are&#xD;
      directed to the facet joints. The highly-target focal ablation could also diminish the risk&#xD;
      of complications that are often associated with other less selective denervation techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the ExAblate&#xD;
      system and the treatment of pain resulting from facet joint osteoarthritis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, phase I study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of using ExAblate MRgFUS in the treatment of pain resulting from facet joint&#xD;
      osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with chronic LBP associated with one or more lumbar zygapophysial joints that meet&#xD;
      all eligibility requirements and have given their written informed consent will be enrolled&#xD;
      to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated and followed for 12-months post treatment. A total of 50&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled at up to two clinical sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate incidence and severity of adverse events&#xD;
      associated with the ExAblate MRgFUS system used for the treatment of pain resulting from&#xD;
      facet joint osteoarthritis&#xD;
