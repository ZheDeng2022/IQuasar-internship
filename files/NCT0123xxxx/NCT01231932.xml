      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Fatigue is a common side effect of cancer and its treatment. Up to 96% of patients with&#xD;
      cancer have fatigue. The cause of fatigue in people with cancer or those receiving treatment&#xD;
      is poorly understood, making fatigue hard to treat. More research is necessary to understand&#xD;
      why cancer patients experience fatigue. Previous research has shown that fatigue may be&#xD;
      caused by a number of factors, including problems with the immune system response of the body&#xD;
      while undergoing cancer treatment. The researchers of this study are trying to understand how&#xD;
      the immune system and other chemicals of the body change while a person receives cancer&#xD;
      treatment and how these changes play a role in causing fatigue. The researchers are also&#xD;
      interested in how a person s quality of life is affected by fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study fatigue in individuals who have cancer, are receiving cancer treatment, or have&#xD;
      recently completed cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Receiving cancer treatment, OR recently completed primary treatment for cancer (e.g.,&#xD;
           cancer survivors), OR on active surveillance for localized cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study involves an initial screening visit and up to three outpatient visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history review (can be done virtually) and&#xD;
           blood tests. A physical exam might also occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants undergoing cancer treatment that has a clear completion date, will have the&#xD;
           following visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Before the start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At least 3 months after treatment ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants not receiving treatment, are cancer survivors, or undergoing cancer&#xD;
           treatment that does not have a clear completion date, will have up to 3 visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Before the start of treatment or whenever you begin the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At least 3 months after your first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At least 3 months after your second visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At each study visit, participants will complete the following tasks (some of the tasks&#xD;
           can be done from home or virtually):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Questionnaires about physical activity, fatigue, depression, and quality of life&#xD;
                (can be done at home or virtually).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Have blood drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical activity device and journals to study how fatigue affects physical&#xD;
                activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Optional tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Computer games testing your memory, attention, and ability to follow&#xD;
                     directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Hand grip strength test to evaluate physical strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be provided under this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the underlying mechanisms of fatigue have been studied in several disease&#xD;
      conditions, the etiology, mechanisms, and risk factors remain elusive, and this symptom&#xD;
      remains poorly managed at present. Longitudinal studies related to treatment-related fatigue&#xD;
      in cancer patients have been conducted but there are limited data showing changes in&#xD;
      molecular mechanisms before and after cancer therapy which can identify individuals who are&#xD;
      at risk to experience fatigue during and after therapy. Fatigue is conceptualized as a&#xD;
      multidimensional symptom which incorporates temporal, sensory, cognitive/mental,&#xD;
      affective/emotional, behavioral, and physiological dimensions. This prospective,&#xD;
      observational study will explore the molecular-genetic mechanisms underlying fatigue&#xD;
      experienced by cancer patients receiving various therapies (e.g. immune therapy, hormone&#xD;
      therapy, radiation therapy and chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to describe the changes in the self-reported fatigue&#xD;
      experienced by cancer patients over time. The secondary objectives of this study are to (1)&#xD;
      investigate the associations between inflammatory, neurometabolic, stress, and mitochondrial&#xD;
      markers with fatigue intensification over time during the course of treatments, (2) determine&#xD;
      changes in gene expression from peripheral blood samples over time during the course of&#xD;
      treatments, (3) relate changes in the levels of these biological markers (i.e.,&#xD;
      inflammatory/metabolic/stress profiles and gene expression) to patient reported outcomes&#xD;
      (PROs) of self-reported fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression, and health-related quality of&#xD;
      life (HRQOL) scores, (4) measure cognitive functioning, skeletal muscle strength, physical&#xD;
      activity levels and energy expenditure of patients and relate these findings with changes in&#xD;
      PRO scores, the inflammatory/metabolic/stress profiles and gene expression, and (5)&#xD;
      investigate the psychometric property of the Saligan-Walitt Integrated Fatigue Tool (SWIFT).&#xD;
