      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the effect of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetic profile of&#xD;
      teriflunomide administered as a single 14 mg dose as compared to healthy subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To assess the tolerability of teriflunomide administered as a single 14 mg dose in subjects&#xD;
      with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with renal impairment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subject between 18 and 75 years of age inclusive and postmenopausal female&#xD;
             between 45 and 75 years of age inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic severe renal impairment as defined by Cockroft-Gault formula (creatinine&#xD;
             clearance (CLcr) &lt; 30mL/min, but not requiring hemodialysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory parameters within the acceptable range for subjects with renal impairment;&#xD;
             in particular, hepatic enzymes (ALT, AST) and bilirubin should be &lt; 2 x upper limit of&#xD;
             normal range and neutrophils should be within normal ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Matched healthy subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subject between 18 and 75 years of age inclusive and postmenopausal female&#xD;
             between 45 and 75 years of age inclusive, matched by age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight within 15% of the body weight of the subjects with renal impairment to be&#xD;
             matched and Body Mass Index between 18.0 and 30.0 mg/kg2 inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Certified as healthy by a comprehensive clinical assessment (detailed medical history&#xD;
             and complete physical examination).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Laboratory parameters within the normal range, unless the Investigator considers an&#xD;
             abnormality to be clinically irrelevant for healthy subjects; however serum&#xD;
             creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, hepatic enzymes (AST, ALT), bilirubin (unless the&#xD;
             subject has documented Gilbert syndrome) should not exceed the upper limit of normal&#xD;
