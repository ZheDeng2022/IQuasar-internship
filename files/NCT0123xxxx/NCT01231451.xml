  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DMPA (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate or the 'depot' injection) is a widely used&#xD;
      contraception. It is popular in woman with HIV as it probably still works when you take HIV&#xD;
      drugs. HIV drugs can increase or decrease the level of other drugs (e.g. contraceptives) in&#xD;
      your bloodstream which may make them work less well or increase side effects. It is assumed&#xD;
      that DMPA can be given with HIV drugs there are no studies proving this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether an HIV drug combination containing&#xD;
      lopinavir/ritonavir affects DMPA when they are taken at the same time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) is licensed for use in combination with other antiretrovirals for&#xD;
      the treatment of HIV infection. Like other agents from the protease inhibitor class, LPV/r&#xD;
      inhibits the 3A isoenzyme of the hepatic cytochrome P450 system and may increase the levels&#xD;
      of drugs metabolised via this route. However, LPV/r has also been shown in vivo to induce its&#xD;
      own metabolism and to increase the biotransformation of some drugs metabolized by P450&#xD;
      enzymes and by glucuronidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women account for an increasing proportion of the HIV epidemic in the UK. The huge reductions&#xD;
      in HIV-related mortality and morbidity associated with the use of effective combination&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy have led to a shift in focus to longer term issues, including&#xD;
      reproductive health and contraception. The impact of a variety of antiretrovirals on the&#xD;
      plasma pharmacokinetics of oral oestrogen and progesterone preparations have been&#xD;
      investigated and in general NNRTIs and boosted PIs cause a reduction in levels of both,&#xD;
      particularly oral oestrogen preparations. Most package inserts for combined (oestrogen and&#xD;
      progestogen) and progestogen-only oral contraceptives recommend that additional contraceptive&#xD;
      methods be employed with concomitant use of enzyme-inducing agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injectable contraception provides highly effective contraception without the need for daily&#xD;
      pill taking, an important factor to consider for individuals already taking regular&#xD;
      medication. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) is the most frequently prescribed&#xD;
      injectable method. DMPA, like other progestogens, is metabolised by the cytochrome P450&#xD;
      system but interaction studies in women on antiretrovirals are limited. A study of 59 women&#xD;
      on DMPA contraception plus an unboosted PI (nelfinavir) or an NNRTI (efavirenz or nevirapine)&#xD;
      measured DMPA levels and compared them with 16 women on either no therapy or NRTIs only (no&#xD;
      potential for drug interaction). DMPA levels were similar in all groups and suppression of&#xD;
      ovulation over a 12 week period was also similar in all groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the high levels of DMPA achieved over the dosing interval make any pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      interaction unlikely to be clinically significant, some clinicians advise a reduction in the&#xD;
      interval between DMPA injections from 12 to 10 weeks in patients on an NNRTI or boosted PI;&#xD;
      there is no clear evidence to support this approach. Although the described study supports&#xD;
      normal dosing intervals for women on an NNRTI, the unboosted PI nelfinavir is not recommended&#xD;
      as standard of care and the impact of ritonavir-boosted PIs is unclear. The summary of&#xD;
      product characteristics for DMPA advises a normal dosing interval even when using a potent&#xD;
      enzyme inducers, suggesting no additional intervention is required when prescribing a boosted&#xD;
      PI. Formal pharmacokinetic data is crucial to clarify this important area.&#xD;
