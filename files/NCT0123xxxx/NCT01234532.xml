  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving entinostat and anastrozole together works in&#xD;
      treating postmenopausal women with triple-negative breast cancer that can be removed by&#xD;
      surgery. Entinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed&#xD;
      for cell growth. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using&#xD;
      anastrozole may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells.&#xD;
      Giving entinostat together with anastrozole may be an effective treatment for breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of entinostat in combination with anastrozole or&#xD;
      tamoxifen. (Pilot) II. To determine the optimal dose of entinostat in combination with&#xD;
      anastrozole or tamoxifen for phase II. (Pilot) III. To determine baseline and percentage&#xD;
      change in proliferative index (Ki67) before and after treatment with entinostat and&#xD;
      anastrozole/tamoxifen in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). (Phase II) IV. To determine&#xD;
      the estrogen receptor (ER) expression after treatment with entinostat and&#xD;
      anastrozole/tamoxifen in TNBC. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate baseline and change in the expression levels of progesterone receptor (PR),&#xD;
      human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),&#xD;
      cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6), and aromatase before and after treatment with entinostat and&#xD;
      anastrozole/tamoxifen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess baseline and change in tumor tissue histone H3 and H4 acetylation before and&#xD;
      after treatment with entinostat and anastrozole/tamoxifen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the clinical and pathological response to preoperative combination of&#xD;
      entinostat and anastrozole/tamoxifen in TNBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To correlate the levels of histone H3 and H4 acetylation in tumors with the changes in&#xD;
      Ki67 and ER.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate baseline and change in gene methylation silencing and expression of candidate&#xD;
      genes in tissues and in circulating DNA, including estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha, ER-beta,&#xD;
      RAR-beta, cyclin D2, Twist, RASSF1A, and HIN-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate entinostat trough concentrations with histone H3 and H4 acetylation in&#xD;
      tumors as well as the change in Ki67 and ER.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate baseline and change in the global gene expression profile before and after&#xD;
      treatment with entinostat and anastrozole/tamoxifen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, pilot study followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive entinostat orally (PO) once daily on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 and&#xD;
      anastrozole PO once daily on days 4-29. Patients then undergo mastectomy or lumpectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor tissue samples are collected at baseline or from original diagnosis, and during surgery&#xD;
      for correlative studies by IHC and RT-PCR. Blood samples are also collected at baseline, on&#xD;
      days 1 and 15, and during surgery for correlative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

    <description>To address the safety of the regimen, a maximum width 90% confidence interval for any grade 3 or higher toxicity will be approximately 30%. For 35 patients in this study, if the true unknown probability of a rare toxicity is 10%, the probability of observing 1 or more toxicities is 97%, and if the true toxicity rate is 5% then the probability of observing one or more rare toxicities is 83%.</description>

    <description>The 95% confidence intervals will be constructed for the observed proportions. Exploratory data analysis and appropriate graphs will be used to decide whether data transformation (e.g. log or square-root) is necessary to assure an approximate normality. All descriptive statistics will be reported for ER and Ki67 expression. The general linear model approach and/or its non parametric alternative, the Wilcoxon test, will be used to assess whether there is any evidence of changes due to treatment.</description>
