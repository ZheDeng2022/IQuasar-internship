      This phase I trial is studying the side effects, best way to give, and best dose of Akt&#xD;
      inhibitor MK2206 (MK2206) in treating patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors or&#xD;
      leukemia. MK2206 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed&#xD;
      for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      l. To estimate the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose of MK-2206&#xD;
      (Akt inhibitor MK2206) administered orally every other day (schedule 1) or once weekly&#xD;
      (schedule 2) to children with refractory or recurrent solid malignancies, including central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) tumors or lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define and describe the toxicities of MK-2206 in children with refractory solid&#xD;
      malignancies administered on this schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the tolerability of MK-2206 at the solid tumor MTD in patients with recurrent&#xD;
      or refractory leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of MK-2206 in children with recurrent or refractory&#xD;
      cancer. (exploratory)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of MK-2206 within the confines of a phase 1&#xD;
      study.(exploratory) II. To evaluate biological activity of MK-2206 by measuring&#xD;
      phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin&#xD;
      (mTOR) signaling in tumor and peripheral blood mononuclear cells and measure the expression&#xD;
      of biomarkers related to AKT activation phenotypes. (exploratory)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study (part A) followed by treatment at the&#xD;
      maximum-tolerated dose (part B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) every other day (schedule 1) OR once weekly&#xD;
      (schedule 2) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up 12 courses (1 year) in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;
