      RATIONALE: Aspirin mouthwash may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of aspirin mouthwash&#xD;
      in treating patients with oral leukoplakia.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if oral topical acetylsalicylic acid mouthwash achieves modulation of&#xD;
           COX-1, COX-2, and prostaglandin in oral dysplasia tissues in patients with oral&#xD;
           leukoplakia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if this drug achieves alteration of histopathology and gene and protein&#xD;
           expression in tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if this drug achieves aspirin-induced tissue changes relating to altered&#xD;
           tumor biology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess local and general tolerability and safety of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: All patients undergo tissue biopsy for histological diagnosis. Patients without a&#xD;
      histological diagnosis of precancerous oral dysplasia undergo routine follow-up. Patients&#xD;
      with a histological diagnosis of precancerous oral dysplasia are sequentially allocated to 1&#xD;
      of 4 treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Patients receive acetylsalicylic acid mouthwash (one 75 mg tablet dissolved in&#xD;
           250 mL of water) twice daily for 4-6 weeks, gargling for 60 seconds then expectorate it&#xD;
           fully, before planned definitive surgical excision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: Patients receive acetylsalicylic acid mouthwash (two 75 mg tablets of&#xD;
           acetylsalicylic acid dissolved in 250 mL of water) twice daily for 4-6 weeks, gargling&#xD;
           for 60 seconds then expectorate it fully, before planned definitive surgical excision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3: Patients receive acetylsalicylic acid mouthwash (one 300 mg tablet of&#xD;
           acetylsalicylic acid dissolved in 250 mL of water) twice daily for 4-6 weeks, gargling&#xD;
           for 60 seconds then expectorate it fully, before planned definitive surgical excision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 4: Patients receive acetylsalicylic acid mouthwash (one 300 mg tablet of&#xD;
           acetylsalicylic acid dissolved in 250 mL of water) three times daily for 4-6 weeks,&#xD;
           gargling for 60 seconds then expectorate it fully, before planned definitive surgical&#xD;
           excision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of definitive surgical excision, the patient is asked to gargle with the last&#xD;
      dose of acetylsalicylic acid mouthwash just before being anesthetized. A small biopsy of the&#xD;
      dysplasia lesion is taken and examined for immediate effects of the acetylsalicylic acid&#xD;
      mouthwash on the dysplasia lesion. The surgically excised tissue is treated in the same way&#xD;
      as the initial biopsy tissue (i.e., half being used for routine histology to confirm the&#xD;
      diagnosis and the other half for research purposes). Tissue samples are analyzed via enzyme&#xD;
      immunosorbent assay, qRT-PCR, immunoblotting, ELISA, immunohistochemistry, gene array&#xD;
      analysis, and microvessel density analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete a questionnaire assessing local and general tolerability as well as adverse&#xD;
      effects during the period of use of the mouthwash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;
