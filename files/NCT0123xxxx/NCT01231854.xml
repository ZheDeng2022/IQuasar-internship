    <description>In accordance with the current guideline concerning the use of ciclosporin in dermatology and the current guideline management of hand eczema the daily oral dosage of ciclosporin microemulsion is 2.7 to 4.0 mg/kg bodyweight (half of the total daily dosage will be administered in the morning and in the evening). To enable both body-weight adjusted treatment and double-blind treatment patients will be allocated to 2 different dosages depending on their body weight (50-74.9 kg: daily dosage 200 mg; 75-100 kg: daily dosage 300 mg).</description>
