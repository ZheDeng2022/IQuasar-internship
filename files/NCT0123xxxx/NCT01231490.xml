  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a methodological study designed to investigate a new model for testing pain agents in&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis (OA). This will be a double-blind, randomised,&#xD;
      placebo controlled three-way cross-over study in patients with OA of the knee.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include an interim analysis after approximately 50 patients have been&#xD;
      randomised. Up to 100 patients with painful Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee may be recruited&#xD;
      into the study. Eligible subjects will wash out of all treatments for their OA pain for a&#xD;
      minimum of 7 days apart from protocol rescue medication (paracetamol). Following this,&#xD;
      subjects will participate in three short term treatment periods with repeated administration&#xD;
      of Naproxen (500 mg/twice daily) or placebo for 3 days. Between treatment periods subjects&#xD;
      will receive placebo. Endpoints will include objective assessments of function (time to walk&#xD;
      and stair climbing) and subjective assessments of pain including current pain, the Western&#xD;
      Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) and Patient Global Impression of&#xD;
      Change. Throughout the study subjects will be asked to rate their pain periodically. Subjects&#xD;
      will attend the unit on Day 1 to be dispensed with study medication and to take their first&#xD;
      dose in the unit. They will then return to the unit on Days 8, 10, 15, 17, 22 and 24 for pain&#xD;
      assessments, with medication dispensed at each of these visits, excluding Day 24.&#xD;

             clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the&#xD;
             population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Have symptomatic OA of at least one knee. The symptoms should be significantly&#xD;
                  worse in one knee than the other if OA affects both knees.&#xD;
