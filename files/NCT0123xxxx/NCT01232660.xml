    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of adding a drug called&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine, usually used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, to patients' usual&#xD;
      antiretroviral combination. HIV causes activation of some parts of the immune system and this&#xD;
      immune activation may persist despite effective antiretroviral therapy. Ongoing activation&#xD;
      may be responsible for poor CD4 rise on antiretroviral therapy and for some HIV-related&#xD;
      complications. Drugs like hydroxychloroquine work by inhibiting immune activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will primarily investigate the effect of adding this medication on immunological&#xD;
      parameters (particularly CD4 count), on other safety parameters (such as cholesterol),&#xD;
      patients' side effects and viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you decide to take part, the duration of your involvement in the study will be 24 weeks&#xD;
      plus two screening visits up to 84 days prior to the start of the study and a follow up&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;

      Studies exploring changes in antiretrovirals or addition of antiretrovirals from new classes&#xD;
      in patients with discordant immune response to suppressive HAART have, in general, yielded&#xD;
      disappointing results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of the antiretroviral maraviroc (a CCR5 antagonist) in patients who had been on&#xD;
      suppressive HAART for at least a year but with a CD4 count less than 250 (and not rising)&#xD;
      yielded no improvement in CD4 counts in 6 individuals after approximately 5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small study investigating the benefit of switching to lopinavir/ritonavir (predominantly&#xD;
      from NNRTI-based therapy) showed a significant improvement in CD4 cell count with a reduction&#xD;
      in cell apoptosis at 6 months.However, data for other switches are lacking and&#xD;
      lopinavir/ritonavir may not be a preferred switch option due to gastrointestinal tolerability&#xD;
      and an increased risk of myocardial infarction in cohort analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic HIV infection is characterised by gradual loss of CD4 T-cells by direct (virus&#xD;
      mediated CD4 death) and indirect mechanisms. Increased immune activation is an indirect&#xD;
      mechanism that is central to CD4 T-cell loss. In observational studies, the level of immune&#xD;
      activation is associated with the rate of CD4 decline and in patients taking antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy (with or without complete viral suppression) the extent of CD4 recovery is associated&#xD;
      with the degree of immune activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune activation has also been shown to correlate with disease progression and survival. The&#xD;
      causes of generalized immune activation in HIV are not fully understood but may be related to&#xD;
      nef or gp120.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine [PlaquanilÂ®] is licensed to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other&#xD;
      inflammatory conditions; it is related to the antimalarial chloroquine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have long been used as immunomodulatory therapies for&#xD;
      T-cell mediated disorders. The exact mechanisms of hydroxychloroquine are not fully&#xD;
      understood, but the agent appears to affect T-cell proliferation and signalling.&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine also inhibits T-cell proliferative responses and production of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been shown to inhibit HIV replication, regardless of&#xD;
      viral clade or co-receptor tropism, and promote CD4 immune protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three small clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine have been reported in HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients. Hydroxychloroquine was associated with small to modest reductions in viral load&#xD;
      both as monotherapy and as part of combination therapy. In one of these studies,&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine was compared with zidovudine in HIV-infected patients and patients in both&#xD;
      groups had reduced levels of plasma HIV-1 RNA and serum p24 antigen after 16 weeks.&#xD;
      Interleukin-6 (an inflammatory cytokine associated with increased risk of mortality in cohort&#xD;
      studies of HIV) levels were significantly reduced in the hydroxychloroquine group but not in&#xD;
      the zidovudine group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usual minimum effective dose of hydroxychloroquine is 400mg once daily (administered as&#xD;
      two 200mg film-coated tablets) administered orally. This is also the dose selected for an&#xD;
      ongoing Medical Research Council study investigating the immune benefits of&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine in treatment-naive patients not needing to start antiretrovirals.&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine is cumulative in action and requires several weeks to exert its beneficial&#xD;
      effects; for rheumatic disease, treatment should be discontinued if there is no improvement&#xD;
      by 6 months. On this basis we feel that 3 months is sufficient time to detect most&#xD;
      improvement in immune activation and 6 months sufficient time to observe any benefits if they&#xD;
      occur. The maximum recommended dose of hydroxychloroquine is 6.5mg/kg/day.&#xD;
