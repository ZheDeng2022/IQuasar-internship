  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Current military involvement in Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom - OEF)&#xD;
      and Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom - OIF) has created unforeseen burdens on the mental health&#xD;
      and well-being of US service women and men. Although OEF/OIF service members and veterans are&#xD;
      at high risk of developing sub-threshold combat stress and depressive symptoms or full&#xD;
      disorders in the post-deployment period, only a small fraction ever receive care. The VETS&#xD;
      PREVAIL Intervention, which combines Cognitive-Behavioral-Therapy-based (CBT-based) coping&#xD;
      skills training with peer-to-peer support and counseling, was specifically designed to offer&#xD;
      the returning OEF/OIF service member or veteran an accessible and confidential first step to&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation Study: RISE Consulting, lead by Dr. Benjamin W. Van Voorhees, MD, MPH, was&#xD;
      contracted to supervise a pilot study of potential benefit, feasibility and safety of the&#xD;
      VETS PREVAIL Intervention. The study would consist of a single group pre/post comparison&#xD;
      study of N=50 recent OEF/OIF veterans in the frame work of a phase 1 clinical trial (phase&#xD;
      1). Feasibility (adherence and satisfaction), evidence of clinical benefit would be evaluated&#xD;
      through changes in the following clinical self-report measures: i) symptoms of depressed mood&#xD;
      (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, CES-D), ii) post traumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Military, PCL-M), and iii) functional&#xD;
      status (Short Form 12, SF-12), as well as changes in key attitudes toward mental health care&#xD;
      seeking (intent to seek treatment, mental health self-efficacy and stigma).&#xD;

      Intervention overview content and design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention, VETS PREVAIL, will empower the user to gain control over life problems&#xD;
      through enhancement of coping strategies, self-care, social support, and a repertoire of&#xD;
      problems solving skills in an interactive internet intervention. This intervention will have&#xD;
      two components: internet delivery of the intervention and brief person-to-person electronic&#xD;
      contact structured around ensuring effective motivation, engagement, and completion. The&#xD;
      coaching model for the person-to-person contact will be based on motivational interviewing&#xD;
      with masters level social workers , as well as contact with peers who have completed the&#xD;
      Vet-to-Vet certificate program offered by the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA).&#xD;
      The internet component is focused on combat stress, self-assessment, coping strategies,&#xD;
      problem solving, and social support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trainer Role:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 6 weeks of Vets Prevail a trainer, a masters level social worker, will engage with&#xD;
      subjects through one online chat per week, post lesson (approximately 15 minute time blocks;&#xD;
      duration will vary per subject). The total amount of person-to-person contact time, with a&#xD;
      trainer, is an estimated 90 minutes throughout the 6 week program; contact time may vary per&#xD;
      subject. The trainer will use motivational interviewing to clarify concepts within each&#xD;
      week's lesson. In addition, the trainer will be responsible for making referrals and follow&#xD;
      ups, when needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Masters level social work education trains people to use evidence-based knowledge derived&#xD;
      from research, practice evaluation and theories of human development and behavior and social&#xD;
      systems to analyze complex situations between individuals and their environment, in addition&#xD;
      to facilitating individual, organizational, social and cultural changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peer Role:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 6 weeks of Vets Prevail a peer, a DBSA certified veteran, will engage with subject&#xD;
      through one online chat per week, pre lesson (approximately 15 minute time blocks: duration&#xD;
      will vary per subject). The total amount of person-to-person contact time, with a peer, is an&#xD;
      estimated 60 minutes throughout the 6 week program; contact time my vary per subject. The&#xD;
      purpose of the peer engagement is to motivate the subject to complete the activities they&#xD;
      schedule for themselves during the week and to apply the lessons from each session into their&#xD;
      lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DBSA training trains people to use their experiences to work with others. Training features a&#xD;
      nationally-developed recovery philosophy curriculum to enhance wellness and treatment&#xD;
      strategies, through peer delivery services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internet based component:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current intervention will have four major sections. The first section will relate stress&#xD;
      in the context of depressive symptoms with direct tactics that can be immediately implemented&#xD;
      to reduce symptoms and guide users towards their individual goals. The second section will&#xD;
      demonstrate how to recognize treatment obstacles and organizing implementation of the tactics&#xD;
      from section one. The third section addresses overcoming treatment obstacles along with&#xD;
      reinforcing reduction of symptoms and goal-directed action. The fourth section provides&#xD;
      instruction and application of personal problem-solving, taking goal-directed action to full&#xD;
      implementation. The intervention concludes with a review, a reinforcement of&#xD;
      personally-relevant treatment applications, and an evaluation of techniques. The internet&#xD;
      component will also require active engagement of the individual with interactive activities&#xD;
      to improve learning/skill building along with other activities designed to identify how they&#xD;
      would manage specific behavioral symptoms (skill development). The internet component will&#xD;
      consist of 6 individual sessions, with approximately one week between sessions. The&#xD;
      electronic chat with the peer will occur directly before the subjects view this content, and&#xD;
      the chat with the trainer occurs immediately afterwards so the trainer can answer any&#xD;
      questions about the content the subject might have.&#xD;

    <description>The PTSD Checklist-Military (PCL-M) is a 17-item self-report measure of PTSD symptoms that requires respondents to rate the severity of each symptom during the past 30 days on a five-point ordinal scale. A total PCL-M score was created by summing the item ratings.</description>

    <description>The SF-12 is a generic measure and does not target a specific age or disease group. It is a shorter, valid alternative to the SF-36. The SF-12 is weighted and summed to provide separate scales for an individuals phisical and mental health called the Physical Composite Score (PCS) and Mental Composite Score (MCS).</description>

    <description>N=50. Participants were recent veterans (deployed after September 11, 2001) of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan who were experiencing depression/distress symptoms at the time of screening (CES-D &gt; 8) but who were not considered to be inappropriate for a health promotion intervention (CES-D &gt; 35 indicating severe depressed mood or exhibiting self-harm risk).</description>

    <description>The intervention has two primary components that are both delivered over the Internet:&#xD;
The first component is a structured series of brief peer-to-peer instant messaging &quot;Chats&quot; structured around ensuring effective motivation, engagement, and completion. This component was modeled after Motivational Interviewing (MI) techniques. The peer-to-peer contact was provided by a master's level social worker, as well as by trained and certified combat veterans who completed the Vet-to-Vet counseling certificate program offered by the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA).&#xD;
The second component consists of six 30-minute &quot;e-Learning Lessons&quot; using standard Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) approaches to reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms and strengthening coping skills.</description>
