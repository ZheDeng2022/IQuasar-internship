  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is assess the safety of administering repeated doses of IMF-001, a&#xD;
      vaccine, to patients with solid tumors that express NY-ESO-1 antigen. If the vaccine is&#xD;
      therapeutically useful, a second goal is to establish the maximum therapeutic dose to treat&#xD;
      patients with NY-ESO-1 positive cancers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NY-ESO-1 was isolated by serological analysis of recombinant cDNA expression libraries&#xD;
      (SEREX), using tumor mRNA and autologous serum from an esophageal cancer patient. Reverse&#xD;
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that NY-ESO-1 displayed the&#xD;
      typical expression pattern of cancer testis antigens (CT antigens). NY-ESO-1 mRNA was&#xD;
      expressed only in testis of normal tissues tested and in various types of cancer, including&#xD;
      lung cancer, breast cancer, malignant melanoma and bladder cancer. Since testis is an immune&#xD;
      privileged organ where HLA molecules are not expressed, these antigens can be considered&#xD;
      tumor-specific.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMF-001 is a CHP-NY-ESO-1 complex consisting of recombinant NY-ESO-1 protein and cholesteryl&#xD;
      hydrophobized pullulan (CHP). CHP forms colloidally stable nanoparticles in water and&#xD;
      complexes with substrate such as NY-ESO-1 protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that exogenous antigen proteins can induce specific CD4+ T cells but not&#xD;
      specific CD8+ T cell. Dendritic cells pulsed with IMF-001 induced NY-ESO-1 specific CD8+ T&#xD;
      cells in blood samples of 4 healthy volunteers. These data suggest that immunization of&#xD;
      patients with IMF-001 can evoke not only specific CD4+ T cells responses but also specific&#xD;
      CD8+ T cell response to NY-ESO-1 more effectively than NY-ESO-1 protein alone. Similar&#xD;
      results for both cellular and humoral immunity in response to NY-ESO-1 protein were observed&#xD;
      in previous clinical investigational studies with IMF-001.&#xD;
