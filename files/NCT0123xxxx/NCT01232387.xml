      Objectives: 1) To determine risk factors for fetomaternal hemorrhage. 2) To identify a&#xD;
      cost-effective method to detect fetomaternal hemorrhage prior to significant fetal anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance/Background: Fetomaternal hemorrhage (FMH) is a condition in which occurs when&#xD;
      the placenta transfers blood from the fetus to the mother. Normally, nutrition and gasses&#xD;
      pass from mother to baby through the placenta and only waste products pass from baby to&#xD;
      mother through the placenta. Whole blood cells do not normally cross the placenta in&#xD;
      significant amounts. Mild FMH, where a small amount of whole blood passes from fetus to&#xD;
      mother but does not hurt the mother or baby, occurs in about 75% of pregnancies. A pregnant&#xD;
      woman does not know this occurs. It is only discovered if a special blood test that is&#xD;
      labor-intensive to perform and difficult to interpret called the Kleihauer-Betke acid elution&#xD;
      test is done. As mild FMH hurts no one, this test is not part of routine care. In most cases,&#xD;
      testing is done only if a baby is born sick with unexplained anemia. Severe FMH, which can&#xD;
      cause the baby to become sick from anemia (low red blood cell count) is caused by large blood&#xD;
      loss into the mother, occurs in only 1-3 per 1000 births. Severe anemia caused by FMH can&#xD;
      result in death of the baby before or after birth, or significant illness in the newborn&#xD;
      period. Short term problems for the baby include difficulty breathing, difficulty maintaining&#xD;
      blood pressure, and difficulty providing oxygen to all parts of the body. This can cause&#xD;
      multiple problems with the function of internal organs including the liver, kidneys,&#xD;
      intestines, and brain. Babies who become sick from severe FMH can develop long-term problems&#xD;
      including cerebral palsy (a lifelong problem with body movements) and/or mental retardation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not known why some pregnancies are affected by FMH and others are not. It is thought&#xD;
      that FMH may occur more frequently now than in the past, but no one knows why. If identified&#xD;
      early, FMH is readily treatable by blood transfusion of the baby before or after birth and/or&#xD;
      early delivery. Current laboratory testing for FMH is difficult and expensive. There is great&#xD;
      need identify high risk patients early in pregnancy in order to treat the condition before&#xD;
      the baby gets sick.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach: Five hundred women will be asked to participate in the study at the time they are&#xD;
      admitted to the Mount Sinai labor floor for delivery at term. After birth, newborns of study&#xD;
      mothers will be tested for anemia. Mothers of anemic babies will donate blood for&#xD;
      confirmation of FMH by established laboratory methods as well as for development of a new&#xD;
      laboratory screening protocol. All mothers will provide medical, social, environmental, and&#xD;
      full pregnancy history. Risk factors for FMH will be identified by statistical analysis of&#xD;
      this information.&#xD;

      1. Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The objective of this study is to identify candidate clinical predictors of fetomaternal&#xD;
           hemorrhage (FMH) and to devise a screening strategy to identify pregnancies affected by&#xD;
           the condition before the fetus is compromised by severe anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fetomaternal hemorrhage is a condition in which the placental barrier fails and the&#xD;
           fetus &quot;bleeds&quot; into the maternal circulation. When functioning correctly, the placenta&#xD;
           allows transfer of nutrients and waste between the mother and fetus while keeping the&#xD;
           cellular components of blood separate. It is not uncommon for small amounts of fetal&#xD;
           blood to reach the maternal circulation without adverse effect on the fetus. In fact,&#xD;
           mild FMH can be detected in up to 75% of normal pregnancies. In approximately 3 in 1000&#xD;
           pregnancies, however, the volume of fetal blood transferred to the mother causes&#xD;
           clinically-significant anemia in the fetus. Fetal anemia can cause significant morbidity&#xD;
           and mortality. In fetuses who survive severe anemia, life-long disability is common.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Diagnosis of FMH is most commonly made after an adverse fetal or neonatal outcome has&#xD;
           occurred, indicating the need for testing. Early risk factors for FMH are unknown.&#xD;
           Clinical predictors of FMH have been suggested, but have not been born out in&#xD;
           retrospective study. Current standard of care testing for FMH, the Kleihauer-Betke (KB)&#xD;
           acid elution test, is labor-intensive and time-consuming, and therefore expensive.&#xD;
           Additionally, the KB test is observer-dependent and can be significantly affected by&#xD;
           variations in sample preparation. No screening protocol for FMH with automated&#xD;
           laboratory testing appropriate for use in the general pregnant population exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific Aim: To identify an appropriate laboratory protocol for diagnosis of&#xD;
           fetomaternal hemorrhage by prospective study and to pilot a study intended to determine&#xD;
           early clinical predictors of mild fetomaternal hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Background and Significance Fetomaternal hemorrhage occurs when the normal flow of blood&#xD;
           within the placenta is disrupted and the cellular components of fetal blood cross into&#xD;
           the maternal circulation. A healthy placenta permits transfer of dissolved substances&#xD;
           between the mother and fetus while keeping the cellular components of the two&#xD;
           circulations separate. It is common for the placental filter to &quot;leak&quot; during normal&#xD;
           pregnancies, resulting in transfer of small volumes of fetal whole blood into the&#xD;
           maternal bloodstream. Volumes of fetal blood under 1 mL can be detected in up to 75% of&#xD;
           pregnancies. This volume of blood loss is thought to be clinically insignificant to the&#xD;
           fetus. Severe FMH with a large volume of blood transfer from the fetus to the mother is&#xD;
           less common. Although the exact volume of blood transfer needed to classify FMH as&#xD;
           &quot;severe&quot; is debated, it is clear that significant acute or chronic hemorrhage leads to&#xD;
           adverse perinatal outcome. Estimates of the incidence of severe FMH vary, primarily&#xD;
           because no comprehensive epidemiologic studies of the condition exist. Estimates based&#xD;
           on screening for Rh alloimmunization in Rho(d) negative women suggest that severe FMH&#xD;
           occurs in 1-3 of 1000 pregnancies, , but accounts for almost 14% of otherwise&#xD;
           unexplained fetal deaths. Large volume FMH can result in severe fetal anemia. Although&#xD;
           fetal anemia can manifest in utero with recognized hydrops fetalis or intrauterine&#xD;
           growth restriction, more commonly there are no outward signs of FMH-related severe&#xD;
           anemia before stillbirth, fetal distress at delivery, or neonatal critical illness. The&#xD;
           immediate sequelae of severe FMH for neonates that survive delivery include devastating&#xD;
           illnesses such as persistence of the fetal circulation, hypovolemic shock, and&#xD;
           hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Ultimate detrimental outcomes include high rates of&#xD;
           mental retardation, cerebral palsy, neurologic devastation, and death. Despite these&#xD;
           consequences, and a suspected recent rise in incidence of severe FMH, early predictors&#xD;
           of severe FMH remain unknown and no cause of hemorrhage can be identified in over 80% of&#xD;
           cases. Maternal or pregnancy risk factors appropriate for early screening or diagnosis&#xD;
           of severe FMH in the general pregnant population have not been elucidated. , If&#xD;
           identified prior to delivery, fetal anemia from FMH can be successfully managed by&#xD;
           intrauterine fetal transfusion and delivery prior to the onset of labor. , Outcomes&#xD;
           following treatment of fetal anemia with fetal transfusion, even repeated fetal&#xD;
           transfusion, are encouraging. Thus, empirical predictors of FMH would offer immediate&#xD;
           promise for improving clinical outcomes. The social and financial cost of both initial&#xD;
           intensive care and long-term chronic care for children with cognitive and motor&#xD;
           disability resulting from FMH is substantial. There is considerable need for early risk&#xD;
           identification and a practical screening strategy to mitigate the human and economic&#xD;
           costs of severe FMH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validated clinical predictors of FMH include decreased fetal movement, sinusoidal fetal heart&#xD;
      rate tracing, and hydrops fetalis. , These markers are not useful for prevention of adverse&#xD;
      events stemming from FMH as each signifies established severe fetal anemia. Maternal&#xD;
      characteristics purported to increase the risk of FMH include hypertension, placental&#xD;
      abruption, substance abuse, and trauma. These were evaluated in retrospective study of&#xD;
      stillbirths in a 1999 study. None were significantly associated with FMH. Clinical&#xD;
      characteristics with suspected association with FMH were evaluated in a 2004 study of&#xD;
      Rho(d)-negative women. Only twin gestation was significantly associated with FMH. It is&#xD;
      unknown whether the incidence of FMH in multiple gestations is higher than those in singleton&#xD;
      pregnancies. No prospective or retrospective epidemiologic survey of FMH in the general&#xD;
      pregnant population has been published. No epidemiologic description over the spectrum (mild,&#xD;
      moderate, severe) of FMH exists. No series of placental pathology drawn from cases of FMH has&#xD;
      been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, even if at-risk pregnancies worthy of screening are identified prior to&#xD;
      devastating outcome, laboratory testing for FMH is not straightforward. The most commonly&#xD;
      used laboratory test to detect and quantify the volume of fetal blood in the maternal&#xD;
      circulation is the Kleihauer-Betke (KB) acid elution test. The reagents for the KB test are&#xD;
      relatively inexpensive, but the test is operator-dependent and labor-intensive making it an&#xD;
      unappealing candidate for use in expanded screening. The test is based on the fact that an&#xD;
      acid eluent will lyse fragile maternal erythrocytes while fetal hemoglobin stabilizes fetal&#xD;
      erythrocytes. Maternal blood is obtained and exposed to the acid eluent. Remaining intact&#xD;
      fetal cells are stained and counted. Estimates of maternal and fetal total blood volume are&#xD;
      then used to calculate the volume of FMH. The KB test is influenced by sample handling, is&#xD;
      technician-dependent, and can be inaccurate if patient blood volumes or blood counts are not&#xD;
      similar to standard estimates used. It is hypothesized that using maternal height and weight&#xD;
      to estimate maternal blood volume for each individual tested can improve the accuracy of KB&#xD;
      testing. This method is not widely practiced and has not been validated in the general&#xD;
      pregnant population. Such a &quot;corrected KB&quot; warrants further examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional test that has been explored to avoid some of the pitfalls of KB testing is&#xD;
      evaluation of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels. The concentration of&#xD;
      fetal-derived AFP in the maternal circulation can be used to estimate volume of FMH. As AFP&#xD;
      levels vary during and across pregnancies, however, AFP testing is most useful when multiple&#xD;
      levels obtained over the course of pregnancy are compared. The vast majority of pregnant&#xD;
      women in the United States undergo AFP testing in the second trimester as part of the &quot;quad&quot;&#xD;
      or &quot;triple&quot; screening tests for fetal aneuploidy and neural tube defects. Although&#xD;
      theoretically viable, no published reports document the use of this second-trimester AFP&#xD;
      baseline level for detecting FMH following additional AFP testing closer to term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most accurate measurement of FMH developed to date is achieved with flow cytometry (FC)&#xD;
      using antibodies specific to the hemoglobin of fetal cells. Cells must be made permeable&#xD;
      chemically to permit exposure of the FC antibody to intracellular hemoglobin prior to&#xD;
      analysis. Additionally, FC using monoclonal antibodies to fetal hemoglobin has only been&#xD;
      documented to reliably diagnose FMH &gt;0.1% in the general clinical population. This is less&#xD;
      sensitive than the KB test when performed under standard clinical conditions. Finally, as&#xD;
      currently practiced, FC using antibodies to fetal hemoglobin is time-consuming and expensive.&#xD;
      This test is therefore not appropriate for large-scale screening at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No series of placental pathology related to FMH has been published. As FMH is thought to be a&#xD;
      disease of placental failure, systematic review of placentas of pregnancies affected by FMH&#xD;
      could illuminate the pathogenesis of this type of placental abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetomaternal hemorrhage is an under-studied disease entity with significant associated&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. This study aims to identify early clinical predictors of the disease&#xD;
      and to develop an automated screening strategy appropriate for wide-spread use. Standard&#xD;
      epidemiologic techniques will be used in combination with adaptation of existing laboratory&#xD;
      techniques to fully address this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Methods: To address these Specific Aims, we propose (1) to test our automated laboratory&#xD;
      testing procedures for FMH and (2) to pilot a protocol using the novel automated laboratory&#xD;
      testing procedures to identify neonate-mother pairs affected by FMH for identification of&#xD;
      early clinical predictors of FMH. This is a pilot prospective nested case-control study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In collaboration with the Red Cell Physiology laboratory at the New York Blood Center, we&#xD;
      have developed a prototype automated assay for FMH using flow cytometry facilities and&#xD;
      reagents available at the New York Blood Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A convenience sample of women admitted to the Mount Sinai Medical Center labor floor will be&#xD;
      selected for this pilot study. Eligible women will be those admitted for term delivery&#xD;
      (delivery between 37 0/7 and 41 6/7 weeks from the last menstrual period). Mothers carrying&#xD;
      fetuses with known fetal anomaly will be excluded. Women with pre-eclampsia or anomaly of&#xD;
      placental implantation (accreta, abruption) will be included, as these conditions may place&#xD;
      the pregnancy at risk for FMH but do not currently indicate pregnancy surveillance for fetal&#xD;
      anemia. Multiple gestations will be included. Women unable to complete the consent process&#xD;
      due to likely precipitous delivery, severe labor discomfort, or fetal distress requiring&#xD;
      immediate obstetric intervention will be excluded. Each woman will be enrolled in the study&#xD;
      prior to the required antepartum blood draw and/or IV placement, such that a study blood&#xD;
      specimen can be obtained with clinically indicated phlebotomy. Study specimens will be banked&#xD;
      for batch testing those from pregnancies of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Not all women who donate blood as part of this study will have their blood tested for signs&#xD;
      of FMH. Although 5mL of blood will be drawn from eligible consenting women prior to delivery,&#xD;
      only specimens of those selected for our stratified sample population based on neonatal&#xD;
      hematocrit (HCT) will be tested. All maternal blood drawn will be fixed and/or frozen&#xD;
      immediately after phlebotomy for later batched analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible neonates of consenting mothers will have 0.5mL (approximately 3 drops) of blood&#xD;
      collected for determination of hematocrit at the time of the required blood draw for the New&#xD;
      York State Newborn Screening Program on day two of life. Eligibility will be determined by&#xD;
      the absence of a clinical history other than FMH to explain neonatal anemia. Clinical&#xD;
      indicators of anemia unrelated to FMH that will be treated as exclusion criteria include&#xD;
      hemolytic disease (due to known Rh, Kell, etc sensitization, or Coombs test positive), known&#xD;
      significant cord compression at the time of delivery (prolapsed cord, tight cord around the&#xD;
      neck or body), twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome recognized as anemia in the donor twin and&#xD;
      polycythemia in the recipient twin, and known neonatal blood loss (unclamped cord,&#xD;
      laceration). Neonates who have hematocrit measured within the first 48 hours of life for a&#xD;
      clinical indication will not have additional blood drawn for this study; results of&#xD;
      clinically-indicated samples will be used. All newborns of enrolled mothers will have HCT&#xD;
      tested. All mother-baby pairs with demonstrated neonatal anemia (HCT ≤ 50%) will be included&#xD;
      in the pilot cohort. In the case of multiple gestation, all siblings will be included for&#xD;
      analysis if any demonstrate anemia. Twenty-five percent of neonates with HCT over 50% will&#xD;
      also be included in the pilot cohort (every fourth study subject with HCT &gt; 50%). This&#xD;
      sampling strategy will allow evaluation over the spectrum of newborn blood counts,&#xD;
      over-representing those with anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal blood of study cohort subjects undergo multiple tests for FMH including FC, AFP, and&#xD;
      KB. Flow cytometry will be performed at the New York Blood Center. Determination of AFP level&#xD;
      and KB testing will be performed by the Mount Sinai Hospital laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal blood samples will be appropriately fixed at the time of collection, then frozen and&#xD;
      batch tested weekly. Any clinically-indicated testing for FMH will be performed independently&#xD;
      on blood specimens obtained post-partum, and will not be included in our analysis. All&#xD;
      available first trimester AFP testing results will be obtained for cohort mothers.&#xD;
      Anthropometric data will be gathered to correct testing results for estimated maternal blood&#xD;
      volume based on maternal height and weight. Accuracy of various testing methods at predicting&#xD;
      volume of fetal blood in the maternal circulation will be determined by comparison with the&#xD;
      KB specimens corrected for actual rather than estimated maternal blood volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All placentas of study subjects will be fixed and held by the pathology laboratory for&#xD;
      standard one-week duration post-partum. Thirty pregnancies chosen by stratified sampling&#xD;
      based on severity of FMH will have the pregnancy placenta(s) subjected to a full pathologic&#xD;
      exam. Standard examination techniques including gross and microscopic exam will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After study cohort mothers have been identified, we will collect medical, social,&#xD;
      environmental, and full pregnancy history via directed interview. Elements of particular&#xD;
      interest will include those hypothesized in the literature to be associated with FMH. Factors&#xD;
      suspected in the literature as being associated with FMH include maternal hypertension during&#xD;
      pregnancy, maternal pre-eclampsia, maternal trauma during pregnancy, placental abruption, and&#xD;
      multiple gestation. The survey tool will investigate these elements of the maternal history&#xD;
      as well as take a broad survey of the environmental and social history in an attempt to&#xD;
      identify unrecognized clinical predictors of FMH. Maternal subjects will be interviewed&#xD;
      during the post-partum stay in the hospital. Data will be used for identification of early&#xD;
      risk factors of FMH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors will be identified through logistic regression modeling with a multilevel&#xD;
      outcome in which FMH is coded as absent (referent), mild, or severe, generating separate odds&#xD;
      ratios for mild and severe FMH. The alternate laboratory approaches to identification of FMH&#xD;
      will be compared by examining agreement using a kappa statistic, and quantifying agreement&#xD;
      across categories.&#xD;
