  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a controversy in the dentistry literature about how the use of associated light to&#xD;
      activate 35% hydrogen peroxide gel during in-office tooth bleaching may increase the&#xD;
      bleaching effectiveness. The studies that demonstrated an increased level of bleaching using&#xD;
      light activation employed lower hydrogen peroxide gels while the ones reporting no&#xD;
      statistical difference employed higher hydrogen peroxide gels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that the effectiveness of light activation tooth bleaching in&#xD;
      dependent on the hydrogen peroxide concentration employed.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to compare the color change and tooth sensitivity of in-office&#xD;
      bleaching using different hydrogen peroxide concentrations and with or without light&#xD;
      activation. Sixty patients will be enrolled in this trial and divide equally into 4 groups&#xD;
      according to the combination of the main factors hydrogen peroxide concentration (35% or 20%)&#xD;
      or LED/laser activation (yes or no). Three 15-min applications will be performed in each&#xD;
      clinical appointment. A LED/laser device will be used in the respective groups for three&#xD;
      1-min application with an interval of 2 min. The same procedure will be repeated one week&#xD;
      later. The color change will be assessed after hte 1st and 2nd session, after 1 week and 6&#xD;
      months of the end of the treatment using a value-oriented shade Vita Classical and a&#xD;
      spectrophotometer Easy Shade. The tooth sensitivity will be reported by patients using a 0 to&#xD;
      10 visual analog scale. The Student t test (α = .05) will be used to compare the tooth color&#xD;
      changes and the intensity of tooth sensitivity between groups at baseline and immediately&#xD;
      after the first and second bleaching appointments. The Fisher exact test and Student t test&#xD;
      (α = .05), respectively, will be used to analyze the percentage of patients with tooth&#xD;
      sensitivity and its intensity.&#xD;

    <description>Two clinical sessions of tooth bleaching will be performed in each patient with a 1-week interval between them. In each session, three 15-min applications of the gel will be done using one of the two concentrations under investigation. In half of the sample of each concentration, the gel will be activated with a LED/laser device for a total of 3 min, as specified by the DMC manufacturer.</description>
