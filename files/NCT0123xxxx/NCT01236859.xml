      Intrathecal morphine provides good postoperative analgesia for up to 18-24 hour after&#xD;
      administration. Pruritus is the most common side effect of intrathecal morphine, which the&#xD;
      incidence was reported as 20%-100%2 and 63% in Songklanagarind Hospital. Pathophysiology of&#xD;
      opioid-induced pruritus remain unclear and more than one mechanism may be involved in the&#xD;
      development of opioid-induced pruritus, such as, mediated central µ opioid receptors,&#xD;
      Dopamine (D2) receptors, Serotonin (5-HT3) receptors, prostaglandin system, GABA receptors,&#xD;
      and glycine receptors, so that why opioid-induced pruritus is difficult to manage. Many&#xD;
      medications have been used to treat this side effect included antihistamines, 5-HT3&#xD;
      (serotonin) receptor antagonists, opioid antagonists, opioid agonist-antagonists, propofol,&#xD;
      and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant, a structural analog of aminobutyric acid, and currently&#xD;
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of partial seizures and&#xD;
      postherpetic neuralgia. Many studies have shown gabapentin to be effective in the case of&#xD;
      brachioradial pruritus, itch of neuropathic in origin, uremic pruritus, multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis-induced pruritus,cholestatic pruritus, itch produced by burn, and pruritus of&#xD;
      unknown origin. However, there is only one small study in Taiwan shown the effectiveness of&#xD;
      gabapentin 1200 mg in prevention of intrathecal morphine-induced pruritus in orthopedic&#xD;
      surgery, which could reduce incidence of pruritus from 77.5% to 47.5% (38.7% reduction).&#xD;
      Because gabapentin has several side effects especially in high dose such as drowsiness, dry&#xD;
      mouth, headache, unsteadiness, reduced co-ordination or slowed reaction, constipation,&#xD;
      diarrhea, peripheral edema, dizziness, confusion, loss of concentration, weight gain, and&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, so in our study we decided to reduce the dose of gabapentin. Therefore, we&#xD;
      would like to know if gabapentin in a smaller dose (600 mg) used in the wider range of age&#xD;
      including the elderly can decrease the incidence of intrathecal morphine-induced pruritus in&#xD;
      orthopedic surgery in Songklanagarind Hospital.&#xD;

      The study was approved by the ethic committee of Songklanagarind Hospital in Songkhla,&#xD;
      Thailand, and was designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. All&#xD;
      patients gave their informed consent after receiving written information of the study.&#xD;
      Orthopedic patients were invited to participated between September 2009 and August 2010.&#xD;
      Patients were considered eligible if they were aged between 15-70 yr, ASA physical status&#xD;
      I-III, and were scheduled for lower limb surgery under spinal anesthesia. Patients were&#xD;
      excluded if they presented of any following reasons: contraindication for spinal anesthesia,&#xD;
      known allergy history to gabapentin, complaint of pruritus before surgery, morbid obesity&#xD;
      (BMI &gt; 35), coexisting skin disorder, and any systemic disease associated with pruritus.&#xD;
      Patients who had history of seizure attacks, mental illness, chronic headache, or neuropathic&#xD;
      pain and were concomitantly using of anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antipsychotics, or&#xD;
      antihistamine were also excluded. Patients were randomized into the treatment and the placebo&#xD;
      groups according to a computer-generated randomization list and patients were allocated&#xD;
      consecutively. The blinding was maintained by keeping the treatment code with one of the&#xD;
      investigators, separating them from the investigator performing the assessments. Patients in&#xD;
      the gabapentin group received two capsules of gabapentin 300 mg (Neurontin®, Pfizer) at 2 h&#xD;
      before operation. The patients in the placebo group received equal numbers of identical&#xD;
      looking placebo, according to the same schedule. In order to prepare the identical looking&#xD;
      medications, for gabapentin group we coated gabapentin capsules by other capsules and for&#xD;
      placebo group we filled the identical looking capsules with flour. All patients did not&#xD;
      receive any other sedative agents beside the study drugs. After standard monitoring&#xD;
      (electrocardiogram, noninvasive arterial blood pressure, and pulse oximetry) was set-up in&#xD;
      the operating room, each patient was received Ringer's lactate or normal saline solution 5-10&#xD;
      mL/kg, spinal anesthesia was performed at the L2-3 or L3-4 interspace with a 27-gauge&#xD;
      Quincke-type needle using 0.5% isobaric bupivacaine plus 0.2 mg of preservative-free&#xD;
      morphine. Midazolam, morphine, fentanyl and propofol were administered intravenously (IV) for&#xD;
      intraoperative sedation at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. We excluded the patient&#xD;
      who failed spinal block, inadequate block, and the patient who had prolong operative time&#xD;
      which had to continue with general anesthesia because we could not evaluate pruritus. The&#xD;
      sedation level was evaluated by the Ramsay Sedation Scale during the operation. The patients&#xD;
      were followed for 24 h after intrathecal administration of morphine. Postoperative wound pain&#xD;
      was assessed with a verbal numeric rating scale (VNRS). Rescue treatments for postoperative&#xD;
      pain were provided with any medications ordered by anesthesiologists or orthopedists.&#xD;
      Pruritus was evaluated at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 24 h after intrathecal administration of&#xD;
      morphine by a blinded investigator. The patients were questioned about the presence and&#xD;
      degree of pruritus. The degree of pruritus was classified as 0 = absent, 1 = mild (restricted&#xD;
      to one area such as face or arms, not troubling the patient, often reported only after&#xD;
      prompting), 2 = moderate (affecting a larger area such as face and arms or face and anterior&#xD;
      surface of thorax, not disturbing the patient, therefore not requiring treatment), or 3 =&#xD;
      severe (extensive or generalized, often disturbing the patient to the point of necessitating&#xD;
      treatment). Severe pruritus was treated with 10 mg IV chlopheniramine. Patients were also&#xD;
      evaluated the severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) which graded on a four&#xD;
      point scale as 0 = no nausea or vomiting, 1 = mild nausea only, 2 = nausea or vomiting&#xD;
      responding to initial treatment, and 3 = nausea or vomiting requiring repeat treatment, the&#xD;
      presence of urinary retention and the other side effects of drug treatment. Patients who&#xD;
      reported vomiting received 4 mg IV ondansetron or 10 mg IV metoclopramide. The primary&#xD;
      outcome measure of the study was the incidence of pruritus during the 24 h follow-up period.&#xD;
      The difference of onset time and severity of pruritus in the gabapentin and placebo groups&#xD;
      served as the secondary outcome measure. Additional secondary outcome measures were side&#xD;
      effects of the gabapentin group. There was an intention-to-treat in our study. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis was performed using the R 2.11.1 software. We considered a 35% reduction in the&#xD;
      incidence of pruritus to be clinically important according to the previous study's result&#xD;
      showed that gabapentin 1200 mg could reduce incidence of intrathecal morphine-induce pruritus&#xD;
      by 38%12. In our study we reduced the dose of gabapentin to 600 mg as describe previously so&#xD;
      we think the efficacy of the drug may decrease so we assumed that gabapentin 600 mg could&#xD;
      reduced incidence of intrathecal morphine-induced pruritus by 35%. Power analysis was&#xD;
      performed to determine the sample size with a probability for a type II error of 0.2 and type&#xD;
      I error of 0.05. To detect a 35% reduction in the incidence of pruritus, using the incidence&#xD;
      of pruritus in Songklanagarind Hospital which was 63%, a sample size of 80 patients in each&#xD;
      group was estimated to be required. To accommodate for 10% patient dropouts and failure of&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia, 88 patients were enrolled in each group. Incidence of pruritus was&#xD;
      measured by using Chi-Square test. The onset time and severity of pruritus was analyzed by&#xD;
      means of Kaplan-Meier probability curves. Continuous data were analyzed using un-paired&#xD;
      student T-test for normal distribution data such as BMI and by Mann-Whitney U test for non&#xD;
      normal distribution data such as age, operative time, postoperative verbal numeric rating&#xD;
      pain score. Comparison of the categorical data was performed using chi-square test such as&#xD;
      incidence of PONV, hypotension, and shivering and by Fisher's exact test if expected value &lt;&#xD;
      5 such as type of operation, incidence of bradycardia, and ASA classification. Results are&#xD;
      expressed as mean+SD for normal distribution data and median (range) for non normal&#xD;
      distribution. For all determinations, P values of &lt; 0.05 were considered to be statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
