  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies suggest that whole grain consumption affects measures of obesity&#xD;
      including BMI, body fat tissue, and body weight. Most cross-sectional studies demonstrate&#xD;
      rather consistently an inverse association between BMI and whole grain consumption.&#xD;
      Furthermore, prospective cohort studies suggest that people with high whole grain consumption&#xD;
      have less risk for body weight gain compared with low whole grain consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of inclusion of whole grain in the diet on&#xD;
      anthropometric measures, particularly abdominal fat regain after a weight loss diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that the short-term regain of abdominal fat after a weight loss diet is&#xD;
      lower in volunteers consuming whole grain than in volunteers consuming refined grain.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy subject, as determined by clinical examination, and medical history,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-menopausal woman,&#xD;

          -  Normal blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) after 10 minutes in supine position.&#xD;
             Individuals values out of the normal range can be accepted if judged clinically non&#xD;
             relevant by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory parameters within the normal range of the laboratory (haematological, blood&#xD;
             chemistry tests, urinalysis). Individual values out of the normal range can be&#xD;
             accepted if judged clinically non relevant by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject with a habitual low (&lt; 16 g/day) intake of whole grain foods (from cereal food&#xD;
             intake questionnaire),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  willing to eat breakfast cereals&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  no intense physical activity,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  written consent to participate in the study,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  covered by Health Insurance System and / or in compliance with the recommendations of&#xD;
             National Law in force relating to biomedical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  registered in the national file of volunteers participating in biomedical research,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject who has lost at least 6% initial body weight after the weight loss diet will&#xD;
             be randomized to either the whole grain or the refined grain diet&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject having a history of metabolic disease (i.e, diabetes),&#xD;
&#xD;

             to interfere with the evaluation of the studied parameters and in particular weight&#xD;
             (eg, appetite suppressants, slimming or treatment which could interfere with the&#xD;
             metabolism and dietary behaviour),&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject with ongoing medication not stabilized since more than 3 months,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject having had a general anaesthesia in the month preceding inclusion, or&#xD;

             clinical study in the last month,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of laxatives, except in few occasions, if, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             does not interfere with the optimal participation,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject having received more than 4500 Euros in indemnity for participation in&#xD;
             clinical studies in the last 12 months, including participation in the present study,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject in a situation that, in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject under any administrative or legal supervision.&#xD;
