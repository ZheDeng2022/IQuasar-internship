      This is a phase II treatment protocol offering 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy for somatostatin&#xD;
      receptor expressing cancers including, but not limited to, those arising from the neural&#xD;
      crest and involving such organs as the lungs, breast, gastrointestinal tract, skin and&#xD;
      endocrine (examples: pheochromocytoma, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, non radioiodine&#xD;
      avid differentiated thyroid cancer, melanoma, renal cell, Merkel cell, paraganglioma, small&#xD;
      cell lung, Carcinoid and pancreatic islet cell malignancies).&#xD;

      (177)Lutetium-DOTA-Octreotate Therapy in Somatostatin Receptor-Expressing Neuroendocrine&#xD;
      Neoplasms&#xD;
&#xD;
      First Annual Report on protocol IND# 78,256 at RITA Foundation in collaboration with Excel&#xD;
      diagnostics and Nuclear Oncology center and Baylor College of Medicine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol number 78,256 calls for recruitment of sixty patients on this protocol. As of August&#xD;
      15th, 2011, we have enrolled 23 patients on this study ages between 27 and 83 years old with&#xD;
      average of 61.6. Among patients there were 22 Caucasians (95.7%) and 1 African American (4.3&#xD;
      %). Eleven of the patients were female (48%) age between 46 and 83 years old with average of&#xD;
      63.9 years old. Twelve male patients (52%) were treated with ages between 27 and 86 years old&#xD;
      with average of 59.58 years old. 15 patients (65.2%) had Gastro-entero-pancreatic&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumor (GEPNET), 7 had carcinoid tumors (30.4%) and 1 had bronchial carcinoid&#xD;
      (4.3%). All patients had progressive disease with multiple distant metastases that poorly&#xD;
      responded to prior surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, chemo-embolization or cold Octreotide&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full phase I dosimetry evaluation, including dosimetric evaluation of multiple urine and&#xD;
      blood sample collections, was performed on 6 patients and submitted to FDA. Ten patients&#xD;
      received one therapy with an average dose of 199mCi/patient (188.52-208.15 mCi). Eight&#xD;
      patients received two cycles of therapies with an average dose 390.29mCi/patient&#xD;
      (363.49-413.26 mCi). Two patients received three therapies with an average dose&#xD;
      592.11mCi/patient (587.52-596.7mCi) and three patients have received four therapies with an&#xD;
      average dose of 787.62mCi/patient (784.21-794.28 mCi).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were evaluated for any evidence of renal, hepatic or hematologic toxicity using NCI&#xD;
      common toxicities criteria following each cycle of therapy. No significant acute toxicity was&#xD;
      observed immediately following treatment, and no patients required supportive treatment&#xD;
      during therapy. Of 23 evaluable patients, 6 patients (26%) had grade 2 or 3 hematological&#xD;
      toxicity which no supportive therapy was required. Average duration of hematological&#xD;
      toxicities grade 2 was 8.3 weeks (range 4-16 weeks) and 4.5 weeks (range 1-8 weeks) for&#xD;
      toxicity grade 3. Grade 2 or 3 liver toxicity was observed in 2 patients (8.6%). In addition,&#xD;
      2 patients (8.6%) had renal toxicity grade 2. 11 patients (47.8%) had moderate or severe&#xD;
      nausea/vomiting after their treatment recovered between 1 to 3 days after completion of&#xD;
      therapy. In one patient (4.3%), skin flushing, sweating and diarrhea developed after the&#xD;
      therapy which recovered within 48 hours following the therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among 13 patients who have received 2 or more cycles of therapy, 4 (30%) had a partial&#xD;
      response to treatment and 9 patients (70%) exhibited stable disease. No disease progression&#xD;
      was noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 patient deaths have been reported so far. None of these patients were able to complete all&#xD;
      four cycles of the therapy. All patients died as a result of massive tumor burden. The&#xD;
      average time interval between the death and the last treatment is 1.41 months (0.76-2.23&#xD;
      months).&#xD;
