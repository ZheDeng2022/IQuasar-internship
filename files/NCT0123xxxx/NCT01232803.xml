      MTN-007 is a Phase 1, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled safety and acceptability study&#xD;
      of vaginally formulated tenofovir 1% gel (a reduced-glycerin formulation), when applied&#xD;
      rectally. The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of vaginally formulated&#xD;
      tenofovir 1% gel when applied rectally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing screening and baseline evaluation, eligible participants will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive tenofovir 1% gel, 2% nonoxynol-9 gel (N-9) or placebo gel. The study will also&#xD;
      include a no treatment arm. There will be 15 participants in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return to the clinic, where they will self-administer a single dose of the&#xD;
      study gel under observation. Within approximately 30 minutes, lavage, stool, and rectal&#xD;
      biopsy specimens will be obtained. After a one-week recovery period, participants will return&#xD;
      to the clinic for assessment. If no significant adverse events (AEs) are reported they will&#xD;
      begin to self-administer once-daily outpatient doses of the study gel for 7 days.&#xD;
      Participants will return to clinic for evaluation and specimen collection after completion of&#xD;
      7 days of daily dosing.&#xD;

      MTN-007 is a Phase 1, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled safety and acceptability study&#xD;
      of vaginally formulated tenofovir 1% gel (a reduced-glycerin formulation), when applied&#xD;
      rectally. The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of vaginally formulated&#xD;
      tenofovir 1% gel when applied rectally. This study will also determine whether rectal use of&#xD;
      tenofovir 1% gel is associated with rectal mucosal damage using a broad range of&#xD;
      immunological safety biomarkers, utilizing N-9 as a positive control, as rectal application&#xD;
      of N-9 is known to cause mild but transient mucosal damage. Other secondary objectives&#xD;
      include evaluations of the acceptability of rectal administration of tenofovir 1% gel as well&#xD;
      as the safety of hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) placebo gel when applied rectally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to receive a single dose of tenofovir 1% gel, 2% N-9 gel or a&#xD;
      placebo gel that is applied by a clinician at the study site. The study will also include a&#xD;
      no treatment arm. There will be 15 participants in each arm. Participants will return to the&#xD;
      clinic, where they will self-administer a single dose of the study gel under observation.&#xD;
      Within approximately 30 minutes, lavage, stool, and rectal biopsy specimens will be obtained.&#xD;
      After a one-week recovery period, participants will return to the clinic for assessment. If&#xD;
      no significant adverse events (AEs) are reported they will begin to self-administer&#xD;
      once-daily outpatient doses of the study gel for 7 days. Participants will return to the&#xD;
      clinic for evaluation and specimen collection after completion of 7 days of daily dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Receptive anal intercourse is common among men who have sex with men and there is increasing&#xD;
      evidence that heterosexual women in the developed and developing world also practice anal&#xD;
      sex. It can therefore be anticipated that once vaginal microbicides are licensed, they will&#xD;
      be used in both the vaginal and rectal compartments. As a consequence, there is a need to&#xD;
      evaluate both the rectal and vaginal safety profile of candidate microbicides. The Rectal&#xD;
      Microbicide Program clinical protocols have therefore been developed to assess the safety and&#xD;
      pharmacology of tenofovir 1% gel when used rectally in men and women as well as address&#xD;
      critical questions regarding rectal microbicides through exploratory objectives.&#xD;
