      This study was designed to confirm that the surgeon is able to perform surface registration&#xD;
      of standard liver features used as landmarks during a scheduled laparoscopic liver procedure.&#xD;
      Additionally, registrations will be obtained with full insufflation pressure and with half&#xD;
      insufflation pressure during the laparoscopic procedure. Under the presence of both&#xD;
      insufflation pressures, the surface of the liver will be manually swabbed with the study&#xD;
      tracked laparoscopic probe with landmarks noted during data collection. After registration of&#xD;
      the liver is obtained, the registration points obtained during this procedure will be&#xD;
      evaluated by the surgeon by moving the tracked laparoscopic probe over the liver surface and&#xD;
      evaluating the location of the tracked laparoscopic probe displayed on the guidance system 3D&#xD;
      image. The surgeon will accept or reject the registration accuracy. Upon completion of the&#xD;
      scheduled laparoscopic procedure, the subject will then undergo the open procedure scheduled&#xD;
      for the surgical case. An open liver registration will be obtained with manual swabbing of&#xD;
      the liver using the study tracked probe and will be accepted or rejected by the surgeon using&#xD;
      the process described in the laparoscopic procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that the disease is determined to be too great for surgical repair during the&#xD;
      laparoscopic staging procedure, only minimally invasive liver surface data will be acquired&#xD;
      and the patient will not be included in the overall study population.&#xD;

      The Pathfinder System used during this study is used for data collection purposes only and is&#xD;
      not used during the surgical procedure as an image guided system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative CT scans, obtained as standard of care, will be used to generate the image&#xD;
      guided liver system 3D liver surface images used during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the laparoscopic procedure, the Pathfinder device will be inserted through the&#xD;
      standard laparoscopic ports (5mm or 10mm) being used for the staging procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of the study, subjects will be enrolled following the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Written informed consent must be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients enrolled must be undergoing a staging laparoscopy for with the intention for&#xD;
           conversion to laparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient must be 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Women of childbearing age without documented evidence of menopause or sterility must&#xD;
           have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test at the time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Any condition which, in the judgement of the clinical investigator or his designee,&#xD;
           might increase the risk to the subject or decrease the chance of obtaining satisfactory&#xD;
           data to achieve the objectives of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients that have a condition rendering them unable to understand the nature, scope and&#xD;
           possible consequences of this study and therefore unable to give proper consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with Cirrhosis of the liver classified as Child-Pugh B or C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients undergoing liver surgery for the purpose of receiving a liver transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients with established renal insufficiency (defined as creatinine greater than 2.5&#xD;
           mg/dl), or a condition that requires hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total study population will include 20 subjects that complete both the laparoscopic and&#xD;
      open liver procedures scheduled.&#xD;
