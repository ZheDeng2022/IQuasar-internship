      The main purpose of this study is to find out how stimulant medications (methylphenidate or&#xD;
      amphetamine/ dextroamphetamine) for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder&#xD;
      (ADHD)are processed in HIV-1 infected and HIV-uninfected children and adolescents.&#xD;

      P1080 is a pilot population pharmacokinetic study of HIV-1 infected and uninfected children&#xD;
      and adolescents who are taking methylphenidate or amphetamine/ dextroamphetamine for the&#xD;
      treatment of ADHD. Prescribing various psychiatric medications in combination with&#xD;
      antiretroviral regimens is a standard clinical practice occurring without adequate evidence&#xD;
      regarding benefits and risks. The goals of this study are to determine plasma concentrations&#xD;
      of psychiatric and antiretroviral medications in children and adolescents. Psychiatric&#xD;
      medication dose requirement and exposure in HIV-1 infected subjects will be compared to that&#xD;
      seen in uninfected children and adolescents, and antiretroviral exposure will be compared to&#xD;
      published studies in children and adolescents.&#xD;
