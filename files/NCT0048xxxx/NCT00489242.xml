  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aims of this study will be to assess the difference in CFV/CFR (Coronary flow&#xD;
      velocity/reserve) in diabetic vs. non-diabetic patients and to correlate CK-MB, TnI and HsCRP&#xD;
      release after otherwise successful coronary stenting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-procedure CK-MB and troponin I (TnI) and HsCRP elevation, in the absence of obvious&#xD;
      procedural events, is most likely caused by distal micro-thromboembolism of platelet&#xD;
      aggregates and atheromatous debris causing microvascular bed obstruction. This, in turn, will&#xD;
      result in lower coronary flow reserve and regional left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.&#xD;
      Therefore, patients with normal CFV/CFR (coronary flow velocity/reserve) by Doppler wire and&#xD;
      FFR (fractional flow reserve) by flow wire should have no peri-procedural CK-MB, TnI&#xD;
      elevation as compared to patients with peri-procedural CK-MB and TnI elevation where all&#xD;
      markers of microcirculation will be reduced. This observation will have a prognostic value at&#xD;
      short and long-term. This study may also have clinical implications for patients with&#xD;
      intra-coronary stenting and normal microvascular parameters post PCI that these patients may&#xD;
      be discharged early while others may need to be monitored in-hospital for an extended period&#xD;
      of time.&#xD;
