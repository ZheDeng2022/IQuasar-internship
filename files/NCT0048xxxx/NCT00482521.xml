      RATIONALE: CC-4047 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of CC-4047 in treating&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors that did not respond to treatment.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of CC-4047 in patients with advanced refractory&#xD;
           solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the safety of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the antitumor activity of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effect of this drug on fetal hemoglobin levels in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a open-label, uncontrolled, nonrandomized, dose-escalation, multicenter&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment phase (course 1): Patients receive oral CC-4047 once daily on days 1-21&#xD;
           followed by a 7-day recovery period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CC-4047 until the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6&#xD;
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with no clinical evidence of progressive disease or DLT after course 1 continue&#xD;
      study treatment during the extension phase. Patients who develop a DLT during course 1 may&#xD;
      continue study treatment at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extension phase: Patients continue taking CC-4047 at their assigned cohort dose as in&#xD;
           course 1. Patients who tolerate a treatment-phase dose higher than the MTD continue&#xD;
           treatment at the MTD. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 24 months in the absence of&#xD;
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood collection at baseline and periodically during study to evaluate fetal&#xD;
      hemoglobin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 28 days.&#xD;
