      Any patient admitted into the chosen ICU will be a potential patient for this study. One of&#xD;
      the main purposes of this study is to discover the various types of bacteria that cause VAP,&#xD;
      and their frequency of occurrence. In order to obtain accurate and applicable results, as&#xD;
      many subjects should be tested as possible. Approximately 500 patients will be included in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAP is defined as any lower respiratory tract infection that developed after 2 day of MV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criteria for clinical suspicion of pneumonia are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presence of a new or persistent lung opacity on chest radiographs, plus two of the following&#xD;
      items:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fever &gt; 38.3ºC or hypothermia &lt; 36ºC;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. WBC count &gt; 10,000/mm3 or &lt; 5,000/mm3, and/or purulent endoctracheal aspirate;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Purulent endotracheal aspirate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient suspected of having pneumonia will undergo fiberoptic bronchoscopy to obtain&#xD;
      samples by means of a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). VAP will be diagnosed based on results of&#xD;
      BAL where BAL cultures yielding &gt; 104 cfu/ml.&#xD;
