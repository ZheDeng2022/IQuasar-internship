  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are evaluating a new computer software package to help us acquire and interpret heart CT&#xD;
      studies, which is the purpose of this research project. We plan to compare the acquiring and&#xD;
      analysis of heart artery calcium scores and CT angiograms (scans of the heart arteries) with&#xD;
      the new SYNGO Somaris/7 Cardiac software to our previous experience with the the existing&#xD;
      Siemens software and the TeraRecon software (current software used in the Cardiovascular&#xD;
      MR/CT lab). The main objective of this study is to provide information to Siemens regarding&#xD;
      the ease of use and capability of the scanner's software. The goal of this study is to&#xD;
      determine whether the acquisition and interpretation information with the new software&#xD;
      functionally meets the guidelines specified by Siemens, and also to determine whether the&#xD;
      software is equivalent or superior to previous versions we used from April 2004 to April&#xD;
      2006.&#xD;

      We will obtain and read CT coronary angiograms (CAT scans of the heart arteries) with the&#xD;
      assistance of the new imaging software analysis package. Analysis of technical and clinical&#xD;
      data will be recorded on the case report forms. This will be an observational design. We&#xD;
      intend to test the results of our analyses through a Test Plan looking at Cardio&#xD;
      functionality (hardware and software), System performance (reconstruction, loading,&#xD;
      transferring, archiving),and System stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to find out the relevant effect of our clinical reading results by enrolling our&#xD;
      patients in a long-term clinical outcomes database. To evaluate the presence of traditional&#xD;
      coronary risk factors, a focused medical history will be requested (see attached) as well as&#xD;
      access to relevant medical records to determine the presence of major adverse cardiac events.&#xD;
      These will be handled in a confidential manner and will be de-identified using subject number&#xD;
      and initial only to be compliant with HIPAA.&#xD;
