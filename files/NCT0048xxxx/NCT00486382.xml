  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a vaccine (called Leish-111f + MPL-SE) is safe&#xD;
      and whether it can or cannot produce a protective response against visceral leishmaniasis&#xD;
      when injected to healthy subjects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of an&#xD;
      investigational vaccine being developed for immunotherapy of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and&#xD;
      post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). The vaccine, identified as Leish-111f + MPL-SE,&#xD;
      consists of a recombinant three-antigen Leishmania polyprotein (Leish-111f) together with&#xD;
      adjuvant MPL-SE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the Leish-111f + MPL-SE&#xD;
      vaccine given as three subcutaneous injections every 28 days at each of three dose levels of&#xD;
      the Leish-111f protein (5 μg, 10 μg, or 20 μg) together with MPL-SE adjuvant (25 μg) in&#xD;
      healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to assess the immunogenicity of the vaccine by evaluating T-cell&#xD;
      and antibody response to the Leish-111f protein of the vaccine.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and females ≥ 18 years and &lt; 55 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be in good general health as confirmed by a medical history and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DAT titer must be &lt;1:400 and rK39 serology negative (for inclusion in the DAT-negative&#xD;
             group) or DAT titer ≥1:1600 (for inclusion in the DAT-positive group).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The following laboratory blood tests must have values within the normal ranges at&#xD;
             screening (Appendix 4): sodium, potassium, urea, ALT, AST, total bilirubin,&#xD;
             creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, hemoglobin, total WBC count and platelet&#xD;
             count.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The following serology tests must be negative at screening: HIV 1/2, hepatitis B&#xD;
             surface antigen (HBsAg), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody. All subjects will&#xD;
             receive HIV related counseling prior to testing. Subjects with positive HIV test&#xD;
             results will receive counseling at the University and will be referred to the national&#xD;
             AIDS control program for treatment if appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must give written informed consent, be willing and able to attend all&#xD;
             required visits, have a permanent address, and be reachable by study site personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at&#xD;
             screening, a negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours before study injection,&#xD;
             must not be breast-feeding, and are required to use adequate contraception through Day&#xD;
             84 of the study. These precautions are necessary due to unknown effects that&#xD;
             Leish-111f + MPL-SE might have in a fetus or newborn infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             administration of study injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of autoimmune disease or other causes of immunosuppressive states.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or evidence of any acute or chronic illness that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Principal Investigator, may interfere with the evaluation of the safety or the&#xD;
             immunogenicity of the vaccine. (Potential subjects presenting with concomitant illness&#xD;
             will be referred for clinical care.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of use of any medication that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator,&#xD;
             may interfere with the evaluation of the safety or the immunogenicity of the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of significant psychiatric illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known to be a current drug or alcohol abuser.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of previous anaphylaxis, severe allergic reaction to vaccines&#xD;
             or unknown allergens, or allergic reaction to eggs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of chronic headaches or migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are unlikely to cooperate with the requirements of the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are not permanent residents or who are planning to move to another&#xD;
             town/city.&#xD;
