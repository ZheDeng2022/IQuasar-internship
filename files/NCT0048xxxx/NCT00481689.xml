  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers want to find out if a drug called Cipro® XR (ciprofloxacin extended-release) can&#xD;
      help people with a complicated urinary tract infection caused by a kind of bacteria called&#xD;
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The study doctor will give Cipro XR to some people to see if it is&#xD;
      safe and works to treat complicated urinary tract infections caused by Pseudomonas&#xD;
      aeruginosa. The study doctor will also gather information about using Cipro XR to treat&#xD;
      complicated urinary tract infections caused by other bacteria. About 500 people with&#xD;
      complicated urinary tract infections who are 18 years old and older will join this study.&#xD;
      Cipro XR is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of&#xD;
      complicated urinary tract infections and acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis (inflammation of&#xD;
      the kidney). The dose of Cipro XR used in this study (1000 mg a day for 7 to 14 days), has&#xD;
      been shown to be safe and effective. This study is being done to gather more information on&#xD;
      using this dose of Cipro XR for complicated urinary tract infections caused by Pseudomonas&#xD;
      aeruginosa, as well as by other bacteria.&#xD;
