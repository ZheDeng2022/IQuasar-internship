      Patients with Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) suffer from impaired postprandial hepatic glycogen&#xD;
      storage and breakdown, if they are under poor glycaemic control. Poor glycogen storage in the&#xD;
      liver puts these patients at risk of fasting hypoglycaemia. Amelioration of glycaemic control&#xD;
      could improve these abnormalities and thereby reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia in these&#xD;
      patients. The &quot;gold standard&quot; technique for the assessment of hepatic glycogen metabolism in&#xD;
      humans, 13 C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C-MRS), is expensive and limited to a few&#xD;
      centers worldwide. Furthermore, treated type 1 diabetic patients exhibit skeletal muscle&#xD;
      insulin resistance when treated insufficiently. This condition can also be reversed by&#xD;
      improvement of glycaemic control. Recent studies link skeletal muscle insulin resistance to&#xD;
      impaired mitochondrial function. Up to date, the impact of glycaemic control on skeletal&#xD;
      muscle mitochondrial function has not yet been assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 of our project is to establish a new assessment method for glycogen metabolism. This&#xD;
      new method is based on oral administration of 2H2O and acetaminophen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our second aim is to examine the impact of improvements of glycaemic control on skeletal&#xD;
      muscle mitochondrial function in type 1 diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our third aim is to assess the ATP-synthesis in T1DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a prospective study on 14 patients with type 1 diabetes and 14 healthy&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the respective study day, participants will be served three standardized meals, blood&#xD;
      sugar will be controlled hourly and blood samples will be drawn at timed intervals to&#xD;
      determine glucoregulatory hormones, metabolites and enrichments of [6,6-2H2]glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the night, four 13C-MRS-measurements will be performed in combination with&#xD;
      [6,6-2H2]glucose infusion to assess glucose production, glycogen breakdown and&#xD;
      gluconeogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, patients will drink 3g/kg bodyweight 2H2O and acetaminophen will be&#xD;
      administered. Thus the new 2H2O-acetaminophen method will be applied simultaneously with the&#xD;
      &quot;gold standard&quot; method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following morning, mitochondrial function will be assessed in skeletal muscle from&#xD;
      unidirectional flux through ATP synthase by 31P MRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIDM patients will be studied twice. First, under conditions of insufficient glycaemic&#xD;
      control and the second time after three months of intensified insulin treatment using CSII&#xD;
      pumps aiming at optimized metabolic control. Healthy controls will be studied only once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess muscular mitochondrial function in T1DM we will measure ATP synthesis in a calf&#xD;
      muscle with magnetic resonance spectroscopy. First, we will conduct a basal measurement.&#xD;
      Thereafter, we will start a hyperinsulinaemic euglycemic calmp to stimulate the ATP synthesis&#xD;
      and measure again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide information on rates of post absorptive glycogen breakdown,&#xD;
      gluconeogenesis, and postprandial glycogen storage in the liver and on the skeletal muscle&#xD;
      mitochondrial function under conditions of optimized glycaemic control for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, this study will demonstrate whether or not poorly controlled type 1 diabetic&#xD;
      patients exhibit abnormalities in muscle mitochondrial function and to what extent those&#xD;
      alterations can be reversed by optimized glycaemic control. We expect to validate the&#xD;
      2H2O-acetaminophen method, which will provide justification for a broad scale in clinical&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;

      Non-Invasive Assessment of Liver Glycogen-Kinetics in Type1 Diabetics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic glycogen is the principal short-term reserve for circulating glucose in humans. Up to&#xD;
      50-60% of endogenous glucose production is derived from hepatic glycogenolysis during&#xD;
      overnight fasting. In healthy subjects, deprivation of hepatic glycogen by prolonged fasting&#xD;
      (60-65 hours) depresses fasting glucose production and plasma glucose levels approach the&#xD;
      hypoglycemic range. T1DM were shown to have lower rates of hepatic glycogen synthesis during&#xD;
      feeding and lower rates of glycogenolysis during fasting. Thus, this dangerous condition may&#xD;
      develop during overnight fasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, defective hepatic glycogen metabolism in T1D can be therapeutically restored,&#xD;
      suggesting that measurements of glycogen kinetics could be useful for evaluating both new and&#xD;
      existing therapies of glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accepted &quot;gold standard&quot; for hepatic glycogenolysis measurements in humans involves a&#xD;
      direct measurement of the natural abundance 13C hepatic glycogen signal using localized 13C&#xD;
      NMR on a high-field clinical whole body magnetic resonance system. This method is only&#xD;
      available in a handful of clinical research centers around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our proposed measurement is highly practical and relatively inexpensive since it involves&#xD;
      oral administration of a small amount of deuterated water (2H2O) tracer and a standard dose&#xD;
      of Acetaminophen. This new method is based on the analysis of deuterium enrichment of urinary&#xD;
      glucuronide, which is derived from the glucose moiety of hepatic UDP-glucose, the immediate&#xD;
      hexose precursor pool of glycogen synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there have been no direct comparisons of the 2H2O measurement and clinical 13C MR&#xD;
      methods for quantifying rates of fasting glycogenolysis in T1D subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mitochondrial dysfunction assessed by impaired myocellular ATP synthesis, is associated with&#xD;
      insulin resistance in relatives of T2DM, in patients with overt T2DM and T1DM with poor&#xD;
      glycemic control. However it is yet unknown to what extend alterations in hyperglycemia&#xD;
      contribute to this abnormality. Our hypothesis is that improvement of hyperglycemia in type 1&#xD;
      diabetic patients who do dot suffer from genetically induced insulin resistance, will&#xD;
      increase myocellular ATP synthesis. Thus, this study will examine basal myocellular ATP&#xD;
      synthetic flux in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus before and after improvement of&#xD;
      glycemic control. In addition, we will perform hyperinsulinaemic euglycemic clamp tests to&#xD;
      stimulate mitochondrial ATP synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Protocols:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simultaneous in vivo 13C NMR and 2H2O-glucuronide measurements of hepatic glycogenolysis&#xD;
      (Vienna):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 24 subjects consisting of 12 healthy controls and 12 TID patients, first, in&#xD;
      insufficient metabolic control (HbA1c 8.5-10.0%) and again after 3 months of intensified&#xD;
      insulin treatment using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII pump) aiming at&#xD;
      optimized metabolic control (HbA1c &lt;7.5%) will be studied following informed consent at the&#xD;
      MR Centre-of-Excellence, Medical University of Vienna.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All measurements will either take place in the Hanusch Hospital (Heinrich Collin Stra√üe 30,&#xD;
      A-1140 Vienna) or the MR Center-of-Excellence at the General Hospital of Vienna(Lazerettgasse&#xD;
      14, A-1090 Vienna).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a 24 hour period before the study, T1D patients will be instructed to omit NPH or&#xD;
      Zn-insulin and only use regular insulin to control blood glucose concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 1, staring in the Hanusch Hospital, subjects will ingest 3 standard mixed meals (60%&#xD;
      CHO, 20% protein and 20% fat; 720kcal, 710kcal and 800kcal) at 08:00, 13:00 and 18.40. The&#xD;
      last meal will be served after transferring to the MR-Centre-of-Excellence and the first&#xD;
      MR-measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sugar will be controlled hourly and blood samples will be drawn at timed intervals to&#xD;
      determine glucoregulatory hormones and metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be transferred periodically to the magnetic resonance spectroscopy unit, where&#xD;
      in vivo 13C NMR spectra lasting 1 hour will be performed at 17.30-18.30 (before dinner),&#xD;
      23:30-0:30, 02:00-03:00 and 06:50-07:50. There will be performed an additional 31P NMR&#xD;
      measurement to assess the intramyocellular ATP synthesis of the right leg between&#xD;
      05.30-06.30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 22:30, a 8-hour primed infusion of [6,6-2H2]glucose will be started. The priming dose of 5&#xD;
      mg/kg will be adjusted according to fasting blood glucose levels and will be followed by a&#xD;
      constant infusion of 0.05 mg/kg/min. Plasma samples will be collected twice before the&#xD;
      infusion starts and then from 0:30 -0:50, 3:10 - 3:30 and 6:30-6:50 in ten minutes intervals&#xD;
      respectively, to quantify enrichment of plasma [6,6-2H2]glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 23.00, subjects will ingest 2H2O to 0.3% body water and at 03:00, they will ingest 1000 mg&#xD;
      Acetaminophen (Paracetamol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6:00 the participants are instructed to void. This Urine will be collected as Urine 1.&#xD;
      Between 06:00 and 08:00, Urine will be collected for recovery of Acetaminophen glucuronide&#xD;
      (Urine2) at which point the study will finish. The urine will be evaporated, frozen and sent&#xD;
      to Coimbra for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After day one, intensified insulin treatment using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion&#xD;
      (CSII pump) will start. Patients will be re-measured after three month according to the same&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy controls will be examined only once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATP-synthesis will be measured on a separate study day. Patients and healthy controls will be&#xD;
      admitted to the MR-Centre-of-Excellence at 6:00 a.m. First, there will be a basal measurement&#xD;
      of ATP-synthesis. Thereafter, the clamp will be started and conducted for 4 hours. Then, the&#xD;
      second 31P NMR measurement will be performed to assess whether ATP synthesis can be&#xD;
      stimulated in T1DM patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be released after a meal at 15:00&#xD;
