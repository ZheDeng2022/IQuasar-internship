      The purpose of this research is to compare two different standard of care surgical methods&#xD;
      for the following large bowel (colon) procedures: laparoscopic right colectomy, total&#xD;
      colectomy, and left colectomy. The study will compare electrocautery, used with surgical&#xD;
      clips and/or surgical staplers, and the Ligasure vessel sealer. The investigators will be&#xD;
      looking at which procedure is faster and more cost efficient and the investigators will&#xD;
      calculate hospital expenses for the two groups to make comparisons.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The application of laparoscopic surgery has expanded over the last decade to include many&#xD;
      complex abdominal procedures that have traditionally been performed through a laparotomic&#xD;
      incision. The widespread acceptance and utilization of laparoscopy has directly resulted in a&#xD;
      continuing need to develop both new techniques and ancillary surgical instrumentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic instruments that provide adequate hemostasis and allow for precise dissection of&#xD;
      tissues are needed for a safe and efficient operation. Furthermore, as new devices emerge and&#xD;
      the volume of laparoscopic cases increases the importance of cost and ergonomically sound&#xD;
      instrumentation have become apparent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and efficacy of laparoscopic colectomy for benign disease has been demonstrated by&#xD;
      several case series over the last decade. The advantages of smaller wounds, shorter ileus,&#xD;
      earlier resumption of dietary intake, and reductions in hospital stay have been consistently&#xD;
      reported as the major benefits of this approach. More recently, in a multi-center randomized&#xD;
      prospective trial laparoscopic colectomy for curable cancer resulted in equivalent cancer&#xD;
      related survival to open colectomy when performed by experienced surgeons. Adherence to&#xD;
      standard cancer resection techniques including but not limited to complete exploration of the&#xD;
      abdomen, adequate proximal and distal margins, ligation of the major vessels at their&#xD;
      respective origins, containment and careful tissue handling, and en bloc resection with&#xD;
      negative tumor margins using the laparoscopic approach resulted in acceptable outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantages of standardized surgical technique's for laparoscopic colectomy that were&#xD;
      discussed in this multicenter trial were well outlined in one previous study. This study&#xD;
      retrospectively reviewed a consecutive series of patients undergoing laparoscopic sigmoid&#xD;
      colectomy from 1999 to 2001 at a single institution. The potential benefits of a standardized&#xD;
      technique included 1) standardization of surgical instrument sets, 2) definition of&#xD;
      benchmarks for the decision to convert before inappropriate investments in time and&#xD;
      equipment, and 3) provision of an easily transferred skill set for residents in training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the obvious value of this standardized approach, a variety of techniques and&#xD;
      laparoscopic instruments for tissue dissection and coagulation are currently utilized. These&#xD;
      options include laparoscopic staplers, lap clip appliers, suture ligature, electrothermal&#xD;
      bipolar vessel sealers, electric cautery, and ultrasonic shears. Dissection, coagulation, and&#xD;
      the division of the mesocolon and mesorectum during laparoscopy, continue to represent a&#xD;
      technical and hemostatic challenge. When dealing with inflamed tissues, as in diverticulitis&#xD;
      or inflammatory bowel disease, or when the mesocolon and mesorectum are fatty, reliable&#xD;
      hemostasis is not always easy to obtain. Concerning tissue dissection and coagulation,&#xD;
      electrosurgery, widely implemented in open surgery, has displayed some complications and&#xD;
      limits related to minimally invasive techniques. The search for safer multidimensional&#xD;
      instruments has led to the development of both the ultrasonic dissector(UCS), (Harmonic&#xD;
      Scalpel, Ultracision, Ethicon Endosurgery Inc., Cincinnati, OH) and the endoscopic Ligasure&#xD;
      (LIG or EBVS), (Valleylab, Boulder, CO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of ultrasonic dissection in colorectal laparoscopic surgery has recently been reviewed&#xD;
      retrospectively in two studies. Both studies concluded that ultrasonic dissection was safe&#xD;
      and effective. A prospective randomized clinical trial also demonstrated that use of UCS&#xD;
      provided the advantage of a decreased blood loss when compared with ES without and any&#xD;
      increase in morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently an electrothermal bipolar vessel sealer, (EBVS) (Ligasure, Valleylab, Boulder, CO,&#xD;
      USA) was developed for both laparoscopic and open procedures as an alternative to suture&#xD;
      ligatures, hemoclips, staplers and ultrasonic coagulator's for ligating vessels, and tissue&#xD;
      bundles. The EBVS is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to seal vessels up to 7mm&#xD;
      in diameter. It does so by applying high current and low voltage, which differs from the&#xD;
      energy used in standard monopolar and bipolar cautery. This unique form of energy denatures&#xD;
      collagen and elastin within the vessel wall and surrounding connective tissue. The addition&#xD;
      of extreme pressure applied by the instrument, which also differs from other energy sources,&#xD;
      causes the denatured protein to reform, with the vessel walls in apposition. Clinically, the&#xD;
      result is a nearly translucent &quot;seal&quot; that may be transected. The Ligasure device has been&#xD;
      used in all types of gastrointestinal surgery including small and large bowel resection,&#xD;
      gastrectomy, pancreatectomy, splenectomy, esophagogastric devascularization for portal&#xD;
      hypertension, and transplantation. To date, the device appears to be cost effective in&#xD;
      teaching institutions when used in difficult open and laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial results with the EBVS and colorectal surgery were from a prospective review of 98&#xD;
      cases by a single surgeon from 1998 to 2000. These included both laparoscopic and open cases&#xD;
      and involved 53 colon resections. No postoperative hemorrhagic complication occurred and&#xD;
      there was an estimated mean reduction in operative time of 39 minutes. Additionally, the same&#xD;
      authors' applied the ligasure technology to a pig animal model and consistently reported no&#xD;
      evidence of postoperative bleeding. They concluded that the EBVS was safe and effective and&#xD;
      may potentially reduce operative times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second study, also a retrospective analysis, compared Ligasure to an ultrasonic coagulator&#xD;
      for total abdominal colectomy in 15 patients with ulcerative colitis. The procedure using&#xD;
      Ligasure reduced the operating time, intraoperative bleeding and operator's stress in&#xD;
      comparison with ultrasonic coagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third study, another retrospective comparative model, was conducted to address the&#xD;
      differences between EBVS and ultrasonic shears for laparoscopic transverse and sigmoid&#xD;
      colectomy. The study included 30 patients and found that the incidence of rebleeding was&#xD;
      significantly lower in the EBVS group than in the the UCS group for both surgical procedures.&#xD;
      In addition the required time for mesocolon dissection was also significantly shorter when&#xD;
      the EBVS was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only prospective randomized study with Ligasure and laparoscopic colorectal surgery&#xD;
      addressed the speed, reliability and cost to guide surgeons in their choice for&#xD;
      intracorporeal pedicle ligation. This study involved both straight laparoscopy and&#xD;
      hand-assisted laparoscopy and compared laparoscopic vascular staplers and disposable clip&#xD;
      appliers with the Ligasure Atlas during elective right, left, and total colectomy. Cases were&#xD;
      stratified by procedure and failure was defined as any bleeding after pedicle ligation. 100&#xD;
      patients were included in the study and the Ligasure atlas was found to be more cost&#xD;
      effective and associated with lower failure rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance and Purpose The utilization and safety of surgical staplers and disposable clips&#xD;
      for laparoscopic colectomy is established and has been adopted by the majority of surgeon's&#xD;
      performing these procedures. Although the growing evidence supporting the application of&#xD;
      Ligasure to laparoscopic colorectal surgery has demonstrated its safety and efficiency, most&#xD;
      of the studies have been limited by sample size and their retrospective nature. There also&#xD;
      have been several questions left unanswered. A standardized approach for laparoscopic right,&#xD;
      total, and left colectomy has never been substantiated by any prospective study. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the difficult and somewhat dangerous steps involved with division of the mesorectum during&#xD;
      both laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy and low anterior resection have not been appropriately&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine the best technical approach to laparoscopic&#xD;
      right, total, and left colectomy by comparing the utilization of the Ligasure device to&#xD;
      electrocautery with the application of surgical clips and/or surgical stapler's. To answer&#xD;
      this question the investigators will compare each approach regarding tissue dissection,&#xD;
      colonic mobilization and pedicle ligation. Safety, cost, operative time, time to pedicle&#xD;
      ligation and hemostasis will be objectively measured in each treatment group.&#xD;
