  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether the proposed first line treatment for&#xD;
      falciparum malaria in this region (sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine + artesunate) would be no worse&#xD;
      a treatment for vivax malaria that the standard vivax treatment of chloroquine. In areas&#xD;
      where vivax and falciparum malaria co-exist misdiagnosis of vivax malaria as falciparum is&#xD;
      not unlikely; it is important to know whether adequate treatment will be received in these&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In areas co-endemic for falciparum and vivax malaria incorrect differential diagnosis is&#xD;
      always a risk. Where the recommended treatment for the two diseases is the same this presents&#xD;
      no problem for effective treatment or clinical cure of either species. Chloroquine remains an&#xD;
      effective treatment of choice for vivax malaria in most settings, but with the spread of&#xD;
      chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria across Asia, many countries now use&#xD;
      artemisinin-based combination therapy for this species of malaria. Differential diagnostic&#xD;
      practices, have not improved in parallel. In Afghanistan the adoption of&#xD;
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus artesunate (SP+AS) as first-line falciparum treatment raises&#xD;
      the prospect of a significant proportion of vivax malaria being misdiagnosed and treated with&#xD;
      the combination. SP is considered to have limited efficacy against vivax malaria and the&#xD;
      efficacy of SP+AS against vivax has not been established in areas that have made the switch.&#xD;
      A randomized, non-inferiority trial comparing SP+AS (1 day SP, 3 days AS) to chloroquine&#xD;
      monotherapy was undertaken on 190 vivax patients in Eastern Afghanistan. A margin of&#xD;
      equivalence of 14%, with 90% power and 95% CI (two-sided α = 0.05) was used. Standard WHO&#xD;
      procedures for in vivo evaluation of antimalarial drugs were followed. 180 individuals&#xD;
      completed the trial to day 42. The primary outcome was proportion of patients free from&#xD;
      failure at day 28. Using a per protocol analysis both regimens resulted in ≥96% treatment&#xD;
      success at 28 days, but significantly more cases failed in the CQ arm (46%) than in the SP+AS&#xD;
      arm (24%) by day 42. Based on predetermined statistical criteria SP+AS was shown to be&#xD;
      non-inferior to the standard chloroquine treatment. In areas where vivax infections might be&#xD;
      misdiagnosed as falciparum infections and treated with SP+AS, patient management would be as&#xD;
      good or better than with the standard CQ treatment.&#xD;
