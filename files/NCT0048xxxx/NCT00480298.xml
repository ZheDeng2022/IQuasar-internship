    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blinded, randomized, placebo controlled, multi-center trial in which&#xD;
      120 subjects with nasal polyposis (NP) will be treated during 20 days with oral&#xD;
      corticosteroids (OCS) in decreasing doses or oral doxycyclin (ODOX) or placebo. At each visit&#xD;
      the clinical and the biological activity will be assessed by nasal peak inspiratory flow&#xD;
      (nPIF), symptoms, olfactory test, endoscopic evaluation of nasal polyps, peripheral&#xD;
      eosinophil levels and markers of inflammation IL-5, IL-5 receptor alpha, ECP, TGFÎ²1, IgE and&#xD;
      specific IgE in serum and nasal secretion.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be at least 18 years of age, of either sex and any race.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a diagnosis of bilateral nasal polyps at Screening and Baseline&#xD;
             that have recurred after surgical resection or nasal polyps that are Grades 3 or 4 in&#xD;
             both nares.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be in good health, free of any clinically significant disease that would&#xD;
             interfere with the study schedule or procedures or compromise his/her safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing to give informed consent and adhere to visit schedules,&#xD;
             medication restrictions, and agree to perform daily diary entries.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with concurrent asthma must be maintained on no more than 1000 mcg/day BDP or&#xD;
             the equivalent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nonpregnant women of childbearing potential must use a medically acceptable, adequate&#xD;
             form of birth control. This includes: a) hormonal contraceptive as prescribed by a&#xD;
             physician (eg, oral combined, hormonal implant, depot injectable); b) medically&#xD;
             prescribed IUD; c) condom in combination with a spermicide; d) monogamous relationship&#xD;
             with a male partner who has had a vasectomy or is using a condom plus spermicide&#xD;
             during the study. They must have started this birth control method at least three&#xD;
             months prior to Screening (with the exception of condom in combination with a&#xD;
             spermicide), and they must agree to continue its use for the duration of the study.&#xD;
             Women of childbearing potential who are not currently sexually active must agree and&#xD;
             consent to using a double-barrier method should they become sexually active during the&#xD;
             course of this study. Women who are surgically sterilized or are at least one year&#xD;
             postmenopausal are considered not to be of childbearing potential. However, all female&#xD;
             subjects must have a urine pregnancy test prior to treatment, which must be negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects must agree to use an adequate form of birth control for the duration of&#xD;
             the study. They must either agree to use a condom with spermicide or agree to have&#xD;
             sexual relations only with women using medically acceptable forms of birth control as&#xD;
             described above&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women must not be pregnant, breast feeding, or premenarcheal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have required a burst of oral corticosteroids within the previous three&#xD;
             months prior to Screening are excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with systemic fungoid infections, known allergic reaction on&#xD;
             methylprednisolon or tetracyclines, hypertension, diabetes (type 1 and 2), glaucoma,&#xD;
             children, tuberculosis, herpes infection, zona oftalmica.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with acute sinusitis, concurrent nasal infection, or subjects who have had a&#xD;
             nasal or upper respiratory tract infection within two weeks of the Screening Visit are&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary's dysfunction or Kartagener's syndrome&#xD;
             by history are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not have been diagnosed with a parasitic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not be known to be HIV positive or positive to hepatitis B surface&#xD;
             antigen or C antibodies. Testing will not be done at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not have had an acute asthmatic attack requiring admission to a hospital&#xD;
             (excluding emergency room visits which resulted in direct discharge without&#xD;
             hospitalization) within the four weeks prior to Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
