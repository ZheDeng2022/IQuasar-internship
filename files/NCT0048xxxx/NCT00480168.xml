      The purpose of this study is to observe patients aged 6-18 with various psychiatric diagnosis&#xD;
      being treated with drugs called atypical antipsychotics to determine the effects of the drugs&#xD;
      on growth, weight gain, and laboratory tests.&#xD;

      Introduction: Antipsychotics have been used for many years to treat serious mental illnesses&#xD;
      like schizophrenia and bipolar illness (manic depression). These older drugs carry a higher&#xD;
      risk of side effects like shaking, stiffness, restlessness or uncontrolled movements. They&#xD;
      may occur when the drugs are first taken, or later, after years of use. Newer drugs called&#xD;
      atypical antipsychotics (ATA's) are much less likely to cause these problems. Their lack of&#xD;
      these side effects and greater safety have led doctors to use them for other diseases in both&#xD;
      adults and younger patients. They have proved to be helpful in aggression, impulsiveness,&#xD;
      anxiety and mood swings. Unfortunately, a number of other side effects, such as weight gain,&#xD;
      increased rates of diabetes and increases in cholesterol have also been identified. While a&#xD;
      lot of current research into these side effects has been done in adults, there have been few&#xD;
      studies with younger patients. The research so far has been brief and involved small numbers.&#xD;
      This is especially important in this young and potentially vulnerable group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Methods: This research will study children and teens aged 6 to 18 who are being treated&#xD;
      with the newer drugs for the first time. If agreeable to the patients and their parents or&#xD;
      guardians, their doctors will prescribe one of the newer drugs and will measure the effects,&#xD;
      if any, on weight, blood sugar, cholesterol as well as the improvement in their condition.&#xD;
      Weight, height, and blood work will be done before the drug is started, and 6 and 12 months&#xD;
      after they have been on it, comparing the results with their original values. The doctor, the&#xD;
      patient and the parent or guardian will rate the patients' condition at these times, as well,&#xD;
      to evaluate their improvement.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  No initiation of or changes of doses of other psychotropic medication prescribed for&#xD;
             the indication of which the atypical antipsychotic is being prescribed in the&#xD;
