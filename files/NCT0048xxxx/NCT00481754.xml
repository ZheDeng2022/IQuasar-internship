      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the uterus) is the most common gynecologic&#xD;
           cancer in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Currently, there are no markers (components of blood and tissue that determine who might&#xD;
           be at risk for developing cancer) for endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To see if women who are undergoing hysterectomy are willing to provide blood and tissue&#xD;
      samples to help doctors identify markers that would indicate increased risk for developing&#xD;
      endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Women between 35 and 54 years of age who will undergo hysterectomy for a non-cancerous&#xD;
      condition, such as uterine fibroids, uterine prolapse, abnormal uterine bleeding, and others&#xD;
      at Magee-Women's Hospital in Pittsburgh, Penn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients' medical records are reviewed and patients complete a questionnaire including&#xD;
           information on race and ethnic background, education, marital status, family history,&#xD;
           height, weight, pregnancy history, smoking history, medication history, history about&#xD;
           menstrual periods and menopausal symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients provide blood and urine samples before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A sample of fat tissue is removed during surgery in patients undergoing abdominal&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue samples from the removed uterus (and ovaries if the ovaries are also removed) are&#xD;
           collected and analyzed for markers for endometrial cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that silent molecular lesions, defined as molecular alterations&#xD;
&#xD;
      detectable in histologically normal endometrial, ovarian, and tubal tissues, represent&#xD;
      markers of cancer risk. Incessant ovulation represents one of the most widely-recognized&#xD;
      models to explain the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer, with women who have had a high number&#xD;
      of lifetime ovulatory menstrual cycles being at increased cancer risk because of repeated&#xD;
      ovulation-related injury to, and repair of, ovarian surface epithelium (OSE). This extremely&#xD;
      delicate single layer of cells exfoliates easily on handling, with the majority of cells&#xD;
      typically being lost in routine handling, when collected post-operatively. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      identification of early stage ovarian cancer is uncommon, and the vast majority of ovarian&#xD;
      cancers are not associated with recognizable precursors. The lack of effective techniques for&#xD;
      collecting and studying OSE in the laboratory represents a major barrier to molecular studies&#xD;
      designed to uncover the etiology and early pathogenesis of ovarian cancer. This proposal will&#xD;
      develop a collection method for OSE, and demonstrate its utility for various molecular&#xD;
      analyses. Recent evidence suggests that a subset of ovarian cancers may originate in the&#xD;
      fallopian tubes. Therefore, we will pilot the collection of cells from the fallopian tubes.&#xD;
      If successful, the collection of OSE and fallopian tube cells will provide the basis for&#xD;
      larger studies aimed at identifying early molecular events in ovarian carcinogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot, we will collect endometrial and ovarian tissues (that would otherwise have&#xD;
      been discarded without histopathologic examination) from 125 hysterectomy and/or unilateral&#xD;
      or bilateral oophorectomy specimens obtained from women ages 18 and older who were operated&#xD;
      on for benign indications. As an amendment to this active protocol, we propose demonstrating&#xD;
      the feasibility of obtaining intra-operative cytobrushings of ovarian surface epithelial&#xD;
      cells on 50 women to be accrued onto the study, which will include women having hysterectomy&#xD;
      (or unilateral oophorectomy) alone without removal of the ovaries at the time of surgery.&#xD;
      Furthermore, we will extend the collection to cells from the fallopian tubes in 225 women for&#xD;
      a total population of 400.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will administer a questionnaire assessing endometrial and ovarian cancer risk factors and&#xD;
      gynecologic history; obtain blood and urine; and obtain carefully-mapped frozen and fixed&#xD;
      endometrial and ovarian tissues. We will immunostain endometrial tissues to assess the&#xD;
      presence, number, location, and size of foci containing PTEN-null glands, which represents a&#xD;
      validated surrogate of mutations in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene. This pilot will&#xD;
      demonstrate the feasibility of executing this complex protocol; determine the number and&#xD;
      spacing of sections required to accurately and efficiently assess the PTEN status of the&#xD;
      endometrium; and provide data for developing power estimates needed to propose a full-scale&#xD;
      study with a sufficient number of subjects to test our hypothesis that PTEN abnormalities&#xD;
      account for a substantial proportion of the risk associated with recognized epidemiologic&#xD;
      endometrial cancer risk factors. It will assess the feasibility of performing molecular&#xD;
      analyses on ovarian surface epithelial cells and tubal cells collected intra-operatively, and&#xD;
      correlating molecular findings with known ovarian cancer risk factors. If successful, this&#xD;
      will provide the basis for larger studies aimed at identifying early molecular events in&#xD;
&#xD;
      ovarian carcinogenesis, particularly in the setting of women at increased genetic&#xD;
&#xD;
      risk of ovarian cancer. The pilot itself will also provide an extremely valuable&#xD;
&#xD;
      repository for future biomarker pilot studies.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inclusion criteria include: 18 years of age and older with:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  a benign condition for which subject has decided to have a hysterectomy (removal&#xD;
                  of the uterus), performed through an abdominal incision (open procedure) or&#xD;
                  through a laparoscope (minimally invasive procedure). The hysterectomy can be&#xD;
                  performed with or without removal of the tubes, ovaries or cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  a benign cyst on the ovary(s) which subject has decided to have removed, with or&#xD;
                  without removal of the entire ovary. The surgery will be done with either an&#xD;
                  abdominal incision (open) or through a laparoscope (minimally invasive&#xD;
                  procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  positive test for the BRCA 1 or 2 gene, which puts subject at an increased risk&#xD;
                  for breast cancer, and subject has decided to undergo surgery (either with an&#xD;
                  abdominal incision or through a laparoscope) to remove the uterus, tubes and&#xD;
                  ovaries, or any combination&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  diagnosis of ovarian cancer or possible ovarian cancer and subject has been&#xD;
                  advised to undergo a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus), removal of the tubes&#xD;
                  and ovaries or any combination, with an abdominal incision or through a&#xD;
                  laparoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Evidence on gross examination of the surgically removed uterus that there is a carcinoma&#xD;
        invading the myometrium; however, post-operative diagnosis of early endometrial carcinoma&#xD;
        will not be a cause for post-hoc exclusion after specimen and data collection. We will&#xD;
        exclude women with a previous gynecologic or gastrointestinal cancer. At the discretion of&#xD;
        the surgeon, we will exclude women with cancer in whom the study procedures may interfere&#xD;
        with clinical management (e.g. staging of the cancer). We will exclude women who had&#xD;
        neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and women who underwent chemoprevention of ovarian or breast&#xD;
        cancer. We will also exclude women currently wearing an intrauterine device.&#xD;
