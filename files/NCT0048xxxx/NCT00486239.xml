      The purpose of the study is to assess the effects of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) on memory&#xD;
      and emotional functioning. The study will evaluate the known lateralized neurological&#xD;
      dysfunction(Right TLE versus Left TLE) on emotional verbal and visual memory function. Study&#xD;
      data will assess the ability of participants with known lateralized neurological dysfunction&#xD;
      (Right TLE versus Left TLE) to differentially perceive emotional stimuli. Another component&#xD;
      of the study will evaluate possible changes in memory function for emotionally charged&#xD;
      material following right or left temporal lobectomy for the treatment of medically&#xD;
      intractable epilepsy. It is expected participants with known lateralized dysfunction will&#xD;
      exhibit differential ability to discriminate emotional charged visual and verbal material.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a relatively common neurological disorder diagnosed when individuals suffer from&#xD;
      repeated unprovoked seizures. Estimates of prevalence rates vary, but it is generally&#xD;
      considered to be about 1% of the U.S. population. Of the patients diagnosed with epilepsy,&#xD;
      about 60-70 percent are diagnosed with complex-partial seizures, and of these about 30-40&#xD;
      percent are medication refractory. The majority of individuals with medically refractory&#xD;
      epilepsy have seizures arising from the temporal lobe area, labeled as Temporal Lobe Epilepsy&#xD;
      (TLE). Patients with TLE experience neurological and psychiatric comorbidity. The surgical&#xD;
      treatment of patients with medically refractory epilepsy has become increasingly recognized&#xD;
      as an effective treatment to reduce or eliminate seizures in selected patients. Up to 90&#xD;
      percent of selected participants with TLE have been seizure free for a year following&#xD;
      temporal lobectomy. However, patients undergoing neurological surgery for medication&#xD;
      refractory epilepsy can experience a variety of cognitive and emotional comorbid&#xD;
      complications. These include declines in memory and language functions as well as onset of&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, and, rarely, de novo psychosis has been reported. This study will assess&#xD;
      the material specific memory and emotion functioning of subjects with medically refractory&#xD;
      temporal lobe epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incorporation of neuropsychological assessment in the pre-surgical evaluation of patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with medically refractory epilepsy has been successful in reducing the risk of&#xD;
      individuals experiencing catastrophic declines in memory and language functioning following&#xD;
      neurological surgery. However, material specific memory loss remains a problematic issue in&#xD;
      the surgical treatment for TLE. Despite 30 years of research, there remains questions about&#xD;
      the lateralized function of mesial temporal structures. In addition, it has become&#xD;
      increasingly recognized emotional function in patients with medically refractory epilepsy are&#xD;
      related to quality of life and functional outcomes following temporal lobectomy. Indeed,&#xD;
      post-surgical symptoms of depression and anxiety are significantly related to patient quality&#xD;
      of life and, to a lesser extent, seizure freedom. Initial results suggested patients with&#xD;
      right TLE were at greater risk for post-surgical emotional difficulties; however, more recent&#xD;
      data question earlier observations and suggest hemisphere dominance has little affect on&#xD;
      psychiatric outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is little doubt neurological surgery for medically refractory can significantly&#xD;
      decrease, and in many instances, eliminate seizures in patients. However, individuals are at&#xD;
      risk for cognitive and emotional comorbidity with these medical treatments and there remains&#xD;
      a paucity of empirical study to help guide treatment. Despite increasing empirical evaluation&#xD;
      of emotional (psychiatric) status in individuals with medically refractory epilepsy, there is&#xD;
      a paucity of data exploring the interaction of learning and emotion functions. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to prospectively evaluate the memory functioning of individuals with medically&#xD;
      refractory TLE for emotional material. In addition, a component of the study will evaluate if&#xD;
      there are differences in the ability to evaluate the emotional content of stimuli. Data from&#xD;
      participants with epilepsy will be compared to a control group of healthy volunteers. The&#xD;
      stimuli will consist of positive and negative material. It is suspected these data will, in&#xD;
      the future, improve the pre-surgical evaluation of individuals with medically refractory&#xD;
      epilepsy and reduce risk of the person having a pronounced psychiatric complication following&#xD;
      temporal lobectomy.&#xD;
