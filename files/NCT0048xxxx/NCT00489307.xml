  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if dexamethasone can help to control&#xD;
      symptoms such as fatigue, pain, nausea, weight loss, loss of appetite, sleep problems, and/or&#xD;
      depression in patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;

      Dexamethasone decreases inflammation and also suppresses the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible for this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the toss&#xD;
      of a coin) to receive either dexamethasone or a placebo by mouth in the morning and at night&#xD;
      with food every day for 14 days. A placebo is a substance that looks like the study drug but&#xD;
      which has no active ingredients. You will have an equal chance of being placed in either of&#xD;
      the 2 groups. You, the medical staff, and researchers will not know to which group you have&#xD;
      been assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning on Day 15 [± 3 days], regardless of if you were assigned to the dexamethasone or&#xD;
      placebo group during the first 14 days, you will begin receiving the dexamethasone. On Days&#xD;
      15-21, you will receive dexamethasone 2 times a day. On Days 22-28 you will continue to take&#xD;
      dexamethasone 2 times a day, but it will be at a lower dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you develop intolerable side effects while on this study, the medication will be stopped&#xD;
      and you will be removed from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to return to the outpatient clinic on Days 8 [± 3 days], 15 [± 3 days] , 22&#xD;
      [± 3 days], and 29 [± 3 days] to answer a questionnaire about your cancer diagnosis, the&#xD;
      medication you are taking, and the symptoms you are having (for example, pain, fatigue,&#xD;
      nausea, appetite problems, sleep problems, depression, and your overall sense of well-being).&#xD;
      The questionnaire will take approximately 30 minutes to complete. Blood (about 1 tablespoon)&#xD;
      will be drawn to measure protein levels and to check the iron level in your blood. If you are&#xD;
      unable to return to the clinic on days 8, 15, 22, or 29; the assessments will be done by the&#xD;
      research nurse by phone; the blood work will not be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be considered off-study on Day 29 [ ± 3 days]. All study patients will have a 2 week&#xD;
      follow-up on day 43 [± 3 days] after study drug has been discontinued, for safety and&#xD;
      toxicity assessments. If you are unable to return to the clinic on day 43, the research nurse&#xD;
      will do the safety and toxicity assessment by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Dexamethasone has been approved by the FDA and is a&#xD;
      commercially available drug. It is FDA approved at this dose level. Its use in this study,&#xD;
      for this purpose, is investigational. About 160 patients will take part in this study. Up to&#xD;
      110 will be enrolled at the University of Texas (UT) MD Anderson Cancer Center. The other&#xD;
      sites participating in this study are Lyndon Baines Johnson [LBJ] breast oncology clinic&#xD;
      Houston Texas, and Four Seasons Hospice in Flat Rock, North Carolina.&#xD;
