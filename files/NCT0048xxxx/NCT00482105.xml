      This study is divided into distinct sample collection and analysis phases. In the sample&#xD;
      collection phase investigators will tape strip lesions that are designated for biopsy because&#xD;
      they are suspected for melanoma. No biopsies will be taken solely in support of this study;&#xD;
      rather patients that present lesions that are to be biopsied-in the context of the standard&#xD;
      of care-will be enrolled in the study and will have that lesion(s) tape stripped before the&#xD;
      biopsy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase of the study, tape strip samples will be extracted and RNA purified and&#xD;
      expression profiled by DNA microarray. The gene expression data will be correlated with&#xD;
      histopathology with the expectation that an expression classifier that distinguishes suspect&#xD;
      lesions from melanoma can be defined. That classifier will be validated in future studies.&#xD;

      This is a multi-center study, sponsored by Derm Tech (DTI) International.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study proposes to use a non-invasive method to capture superficial cells on&#xD;
      pigmented skin lesions that are suspected of being early melanomas. This non-invasive&#xD;
      &quot;biopsy&quot; technology has been developed and patented by DermTech International. RNA in skin&#xD;
      cells captured by this method will be profiled in order to diagnose the nature of the lesion&#xD;
      (i.e. malignant melanoma or not). A successful outcome of this proposal would create a&#xD;
      candidate non-invasive diagnostic assay based on a gene expression profile for identifying&#xD;
      early stage melanomas. This assay and more in particular the diagnostic gene expression&#xD;
      profile are considered candidate because the profile would have to be validated (i.e. proven&#xD;
      to be diagnostic) in larger clinical trials. Secondary outcomes could include tests for&#xD;
      diagnosis and prognosis of a variety of pigmented skin lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To create a sample set of pigmented skin lesions. Each sample consisting of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. RNA recovered by tape stripping the superficial epidermis overlying the lesion (tape&#xD;
           stripping will also be used to recover RNA from normal skin areas and benign nevi as&#xD;
           controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A standard biopsy of the same lesion and accompanying histology and diagnosis. Biopsies&#xD;
           would be taken after tape stripping and subjected to standard histopathologic analysis,&#xD;
           which would provide a &quot;gold standard&quot; diagnosis. These diagnoses could then be&#xD;
           correlated with the data generated in Specific&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This specific aim is composed of three individual aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Analysis of selected lesion RNA samples by DNA microarray.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Correlation of gene expression data with histopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Creation of a candidate expression classifier for diagnosis of melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tape stripping (commercialized as a method for RNA recovery as Epidermal Genetic Information&#xD;
      Retrieval or EGIR™) is a non-invasive method that allows recovery of cells comprising and&#xD;
      associated with the upper epidermis [4]. The feasibility of non-invasive sampling of human&#xD;
      epidermis by sequential adhesive tape stripping was shown by Morhenn et al [4]. Their work&#xD;
      showed that tape stripping of skin yielded sufficient RNA for analysis by ribonuclease&#xD;
      protection assay to detect specific RNA species, including those known to be at low&#xD;
      abundance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Therapeutically removed tissue will be collected&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tape-stripping procedure will be performed before all biopsy procedures. The tape will be&#xD;
      applied to the site and briskly rubbed with the blunt rounded end of a marker or plastic test&#xD;
      tube in a circular motion. A minimum of 15 circular motions must be completed before the tape&#xD;
      is removed. To accommodate the fact that many sites will be smaller than the diameter of the&#xD;
      tape, care will be taken to apply the tape only to the lesion or control site and not to the&#xD;
      surrounding normal epidermis. The border of the lesion will be demarcated on the tape with a&#xD;
      surgical marker; when the tapes are processed for RNA extraction, the marking will allow&#xD;
      removal of tape that did not contact the lesion (and that might harbor normal epidermis). A&#xD;
      total of 4 tapes will be used to sample a site greater than or equal to 6 mm in diameter.&#xD;
      Preliminary data obtained from DTI show that lesions less than 6 mm in diameter may require&#xD;
      up to 8 tapes to recover RNA. Tape stripping will also be performed on one normal appearing&#xD;
      skin area (preferably; upper back or mastoid process) as well as one benign nevus (if&#xD;
      available) to use as a comparison. After sampling, the tapes will be stored at -20oC or&#xD;
      below. The tapes will be shipped to DTI on dry ice, by express mail, for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy After the tape-stripping procedure is completed, the whole lesion will be surgically&#xD;
      excised according to standard clinical practice. The biopsy is a standard of care procedure&#xD;
      that would be conducted regardless of the research. All tissues removed are fixed in formalin&#xD;
      and sent to a histopathology laboratory, where they are embedded in paraffin and sectioned&#xD;
      for histopathological analysis. Pathology results will be collected for distinguishing&#xD;
      diagnosis. The subject pathology reports will be identified with the assigned unique subject&#xD;
      identifiers prior to use in the study to protect subject identity.&#xD;
