  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence of a reciprocal interrelationship between chronic heart failure&#xD;
      (CHF) and insulin resistance (IR). Studies have shown that patients with CHF have IR and that&#xD;
      the degree of IR is associated with reduced exercise capacity and peak oxygen consumption&#xD;
      (VO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IR has also been linked to decreased exercise capacity in patients with diabetes mellitus and&#xD;
      other chronic disease states, as well as in healthy subjects confirming that IR is&#xD;
      independently linked to exercise intolerance studies have shown that IR is&#xD;
      pathophysiologically linked with CHF and is implicated in the disease progression in CHF.&#xD;
      This is likely because IR is associated with endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, increased&#xD;
      oxidative stress and myocardial remodelling; processes that accelerate the progression of&#xD;
      disease in CHF. Therefore, the IR has now emerged as a potential target for intervention in&#xD;
      improving the symptoms and outcome in patients with CHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are still some key unanswered questions. Firstly, what is the prevalence of IR&#xD;
      in the cohort of CHF patients in Tayside? Previous studies outside the UK examining&#xD;
      prevalence of IR in CHF were conducted in the pre-B-blocker era. However, B-blockers, which&#xD;
      may worsen metabolic control, are now widely used in the treatment of CHF. It is likely that&#xD;
      the prevalence might be higher in our present cohort of patients with CHF. Secondly, what are&#xD;
      the potential contributory factors to IR in CHF?The exact mechanisms of IR in CHF are not&#xD;
      known. Sympathetic over-activity in CHF can acutely reduce insulin sensitivity and it also&#xD;
      decreases the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells, and increases hepatic&#xD;
      glucose production. Other mediators include cytokines and adiponectin and leptin. The loss of&#xD;
      skeletal muscle bulk and impaired endothelial function with reduced skeletal muscle blood&#xD;
      flow may also contribute to IR in CHF. Determining the relative importance of these various&#xD;
      factors may help identify therapeutic strategies in overcoming IR in CHF. Finally, what is&#xD;
      the mechanism for the impaired exercise capacity and reduced peak VO2 in CHF? Exercise VO2&#xD;
      measures the total body's oxygen consumption which reflects both cardiac output and&#xD;
      peripheral utilization of oxygen. We do not know whether the problem is due to a worsening of&#xD;
      the reduced cardiac output in CHF and/or decreased peripheral utilization. To determine this,&#xD;
      we plan to measure the cardiac output at the same as the measurement of VO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims and objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the prevalence of Insulin resistance (IR) among chronic heart failure (CHF)&#xD;
           patients in Tayside&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify factors associated with IR in CHF&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives IR could have potential functional consequences&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is it associated with a decrease in exercise capacity ?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is it associated with altered endothelial function ?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will arrive in the research laboratory having fasted overnight. Following written&#xD;
      informed consent, patients will undergo a complete medical examination and bloods (40 ml)&#xD;
      will be drawn for measurement of neurohormones. Thereafter, the following tests will be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i). Measurement of insulin resistance will be assessed using empirical fasting insulin&#xD;
      resistance index (FIRI).For this test fasting blood glucose and insulin level will be&#xD;
      measured. Fasting insulin resistance index is consist of the product of plasma insulin and&#xD;
      glucose, FIRI= fasting glucose X fasting insulin / 25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii). Anthropometric measurements (for measurement of fat mass and fat free mass). Body fat&#xD;
      can be measured by (height, weight, skin fold thickness, waist, and hip circumference).&#xD;
      Estimation of body fat in this study will be by skin fold thickness measurement or Holtain&#xD;
      skin fold caliper18. Measurement can use from 3 to 9 different standard anatomical sites&#xD;
      around the body. The right side is usually only measured, by pinching the skin at the&#xD;
      appropriate site to raise a double layer of skin and the underlying adipose tissue, but not&#xD;
      the muscle. The calipers are then applied 1 cm below and at right angles to the pinch, and a&#xD;
      reading taken 2 seconds later. The mean of two measurements should be taken. If the two&#xD;
      measurements differ greatly, a third should then be done, then the median value taken. In&#xD;
      this study the Holtain skin fold calliper will be used for measuring triceps skin fold until&#xD;
      their two exactly similar consecutive readings from each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iv). Endothelial function will be determined by reactive hyperaemia-peripheral arterial&#xD;
      tonometry [RH-PAT] RH-PAT is a non-invasive technique to assess peripheral microvascular&#xD;
      endothelial function by measuring changes in digital pulse volume during reactive hyperaemia&#xD;
      21-24. Bonetti and colleagues21 recently reported that it is reliable non-invasive tool to&#xD;
      identify individuals with coronary microvascular endothelial dysfunction digital. The device&#xD;
      (Itamar Medical Ltd., Caesarea, Israel) consists of two finger-mounted probes, which include&#xD;
      a system of inflatable latex air cushions within a rigid external case. The probe design&#xD;
      allows the application of a constant and evenly distributed near-diastolic counter pressure&#xD;
      within the entire probe, which increases sensitivity by unloading arterial wall tension, and&#xD;
      prevents venous blood pooling to avoid venoarteriolar reflex vasoconstriction. Pulsatile&#xD;
      volume changes of the fingertip are sensed by a pressure transducer and transferred to a&#xD;
      personal computer where the signal is band pass-filtered (0.3 to 30 Hz), amplified,&#xD;
      displayed, and stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PAT studies will perform with the patient in the supine position and both hands on the&#xD;
      same level in a comfortable, thermoneutral environment. A blood pressure cuff will be placed&#xD;
      on one upper arm (study arm), while the contralateral arm serves as a control (control arm);&#xD;
      RH-PAT probes will be placed on one finger (finger II, III, or IV) of each hand (same finger&#xD;
      on both hands). The fingers on either side of the one with the probe will be separated using&#xD;
      soft sponge rings, and continuous recording of pulsatile blood volume responses from both&#xD;
      hands will be initiated. After a 10-min equilibration period, the blood pressure cuff on the&#xD;
      study arm will be inflated to 60 mm Hg above systolic pressure for 5 min. The cuff will then&#xD;
      be deflated to induce reactive hyperaemia, whereas PAT recording will be continued. Ten&#xD;
      minutes later, the patients will be given a single dose of nitroglycerin (NTG) (0.4 mg,&#xD;
      sublingual) to assess endothelium-independent PAT response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reactive hyperaemia-PAT data will be analyzed by a computer in an operator-independent&#xD;
      manner. As a measure of the extent of reactive hyperaemia, the reactive hyperaemia-PAT index&#xD;
      will be calculated as the ratio of the average amplitude of the PAT signal over a 1-min time&#xD;
      interval starting 1 min after cuff deflation divided by the average amplitude of the PAT&#xD;
      signal of a 3.5-min time period before cuff inflation (baseline); reactive -PAT index values&#xD;
      from the study arm will then normalized to the control arm to compensate for potential&#xD;
      systemic changes. Hyperaemic response to NTG will be assessed in a similar manner. At first,&#xD;
      average PAT signal amplitude of four consecutive 1-min periods starting at 5 min after&#xD;
      administration of sublingual NTG (5- to 6-min, 6- to 7-min, 7- to 8-min, and 8- to 9-min&#xD;
      interval) will be calculated; PAT response to NTG will then be calculated as the ratio of the&#xD;
      PAT amplitude of the 1-min interval during which peak average PAT signal was recorded divided&#xD;
      by the amplitude of the PAT signal at baseline (NTG-PAT index).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (v). Cardiopulmonary exercise testing will be determined by means of incremental cycle&#xD;
      ergometry. Expired gas analysis will be performed continuously throughout the test with the&#xD;
      Innocor System (Innocor, Denmark), which allows determination of VO2 and cardiac output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will perform a graded maximal bicycle exercise test. After 3 minutes of rest,&#xD;
      exercise will begin at a workload of 0 Watts and increase every 3 minutes by 25 Watts until&#xD;
      symptom limited maximum. Expired gas analysis will be performed continuously throughout the&#xD;
      test with the Innocor System (Innocor, Innovision A/S, Odense, Denmark) which allows&#xD;
      determination of VO2 and cardiac output. Peak oxygen uptake will be defined as the highest&#xD;
      value of oxygen uptake achieved in the final 20 seconds of exercise. In addition to oxygen&#xD;
      uptake [V02], carbon dioxide production [VC0 2], respiratory rate [RR], peak rate pressure&#xD;
      product [RPP] and total expiratory volume [VE] will be determined. Anaerobic threshold will&#xD;
      be determined from the nadir of the ventilatory equivalent for VO2. Cardiac output will be&#xD;
      determined by the inert gas rebreathing method (R), using N2o (blood soluble gas) and SF6&#xD;
      (blood insoluble gas), with concentrations, enriched with o2, of 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively.&#xD;
      Tidal volume will progressively increase in the closed circuit to match the physiologic&#xD;
      increase. Use of SF6 allows us to measure the volume of lungs, valve and rebreathing bag. N2o&#xD;
      concentration decreases during the rebreathing maneuver. Three to four respiratory cycles&#xD;
      will be needed to obtain N2o washout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (vi). Neurohormones: Blood will be drawn for plasma noradrenaline, serum leptin, and&#xD;
      adiponectin and plasma cytokines. (a) The quantitative measurement of leptin25-28 in serum&#xD;
      performed by using a leptin enzyme immunoassay or ELISA kit29 (DRG Diagnostics, Marburg,&#xD;
      Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions: Briefly, 100µl of diluted leptin&#xD;
      conjugate will dispensed into each well of the microtiter plate and incubate at room&#xD;
      temperature for 1 h. The contents of the wells will shake out and the wells rinse three times&#xD;
      with diluted wash solution. Into each appropriate well were dispensed 50µl of samples&#xD;
      (diluted 1:5) and standards at concentrations of 0, 0.8, 1.6, 3.1, 6.2, 12.5, and 25 ng/ml.&#xD;
      Fifty microliters of leptin antibody were then dispensed into the center of each well to&#xD;
      achieve complete mixing, and the plate will incubate overnight at 4Â°C in a humidity chamber.&#xD;
      The contents of the wells will shake out, the wells rinse thrice, and residual droplets will&#xD;
      be removed. One hundred microliters of diluted second antibody will dispense into each well&#xD;
      and incubate at room temperature for 1.5 h. The contents of the wells will shake out and the&#xD;
      wells will be washed three times. One hundred microliters of horseradish peroxidase enzyme&#xD;
      complex will dispense into each well and incubate at room temperature for 45 min. Removal and&#xD;
      washing of the wells will be repeated before 100µl of tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution&#xD;
      will be added and then incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The enzymatic reaction will&#xD;
      be terminated by adding 50µl of sulfuric acid stop solution into the center of each well, and&#xD;
      the absorbance at 450 nm will determined using an ELISA microtiter plate reader (Tecan,&#xD;
      Salzburg, Austria). A standard curve will construct by plotting a graph of the absorbance of&#xD;
      each reference standard against its corresponding concentration in nanograms per milliliter.&#xD;
      Using the corresponding absorbance to extrapolate the value from the standard curve and&#xD;
      multiplying this by the dilution factor of 5 will determine the leptin concentration of each&#xD;
      serum sample. (b) Adponetin30-33 levels will be measured by radioimmunoassay by Professor&#xD;
      Jill Belch's laboratory. (c) Plasma noradrenaline Blood samples from patients were&#xD;
      centrifuged at 4Â°C for 20 minutes, and the separated plasma will immediately frozen and&#xD;
      stored at -80Â°C until tested. Plasma noradrenaline (NA) will be measured by high performance&#xD;
      liquid chromatography using an electrochemical detector. It is a simplified, sensitive, and&#xD;
      reliable method for the determination of NA in plasma.(d) Cytokines: Tumor Necrosis Factor a&#xD;
      (TNF- a) ELISA kit will be used for measurement of TNF-a in serum by radioiimunoassay 34-36.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (vii). Physical activity questionnaire; in this study will use Kansas City Cardiomyopathy&#xD;
      Questionnaire (KCCQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (viii).Endothelial Cell and Blood Collection With use of a 0.021-inch-diameter, J-shaped wire&#xD;
      (Daig) inserted through an 18-gauge Angiocath (Becton Dickinson), endothelial cells will be&#xD;
      collected from a superficial forearm vein. The wire will transferred to dissociation buffer&#xD;
      (0.5% bovine serum albumin, 2 mmol/L EDTA, and 100 _g/mL heparin in phosphatebuffered saline)&#xD;
      at 4°C. Cells will be rinsed, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, transferred to slides, air dried,&#xD;
      and stored at _80°C. Plasma and serum will be separated by centrifugation and stored at&#xD;
      _80°C.&#xD;

        evidence of LV systolic dysfunction). All patients with stable CHF were included in the&#xD;
        study. Inpatients with CHF who were hospitalized were also included, except patients with&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One hundred patients with Left ventricular Ejection Friction (LVEF) &lt;35% in NYHA class&#xD;
             I II III or IV; aged 30-90, attending the CHF clinic will be studied&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of CHF will be based on medical history of exertional dyspneoa, muscle&#xD;
             fatigue and/or fluid retention and diminished LVEF (LVEF&lt;35%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The diagnosis of ischemic heart disease will be based on documentation of previous&#xD;
             myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass surgery or pathologic findings on&#xD;
             coronary angiography. Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy will be diagnosed in the&#xD;
             absence of a specific etiology for left ventricular dysfunction and on the basis of&#xD;
             normal coronary arteries&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients should be stable with their treatment and no change in their treatment&#xD;
             regimen for &gt; 6 weeks before the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with CHF due to coronary artery disease are more likely to have abnormalities&#xD;
             in glucose metabolism than are patients with CHF due to idiopathic dilated&#xD;
             cardiomyopathy. Therefore, we also plan to study a control group [n=50] of age and sex&#xD;
             and BMI matched patients divided into 2 groups 25 with coronary artery disease without&#xD;
             heart failure and 25 healthy control. These patients will be identified from the&#xD;
             Cardiology Clinics&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with decompensated CHF with signs of congestion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Since the objective of the study is to assess prevalence of insulin resistance in CHF&#xD;
             and not CHF secondary to other diseases like diabetes mellitus (DM), patients&#xD;
             suffering from DM will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individual found during study cognitively impaired rendering them incapable to take&#xD;
