           height) than children in the control group.&#xD;

        2. Children in the home intervention group will have better behavior than children in the&#xD;
           control group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      During the first years of life when energy needs are high, growth serves as an objective&#xD;
      measure of children's well-being. Failure-to-thrive (FTT) occurs when infants' rate of weight&#xD;
      gain is below expectations based on age and gender-specific growth charts. The proposed&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial evaluates whether a home-based intervention delivered by&#xD;
      community health workers is effective in altering patterns of children's growth and&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants were recruited from pediatric primary care clinics serving low-income, urban&#xD;
      communities from 1988 through 1993. Eligibility criteria included age &lt; 25 months, at least&#xD;
      35 weeks gestational age and appropriate birth weight for gestational age, and no congenital&#xD;
      problems, disabilities, or chronic illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children in the FTT group had to meet one of two criteria using age and gender-specific&#xD;
      National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) growth charts: sustained weight-for-age below&#xD;
      the 5th percentile, weight-for-length below the 10th percentile or weight for age crossing&#xD;
      two major centiles and falling below the 25th percentile. All infants were examined by a&#xD;
      pediatrician, who also reviewed their medical charts to ensure that they met criteria for FTT&#xD;
      and there were no known syndromes or obvious major organ system dysfunctions, such as&#xD;
      congenital heart disease, to account for the growth failure of the infants in the FTT group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers were invited to participate in a longitudinal research project, using consent&#xD;
      procedures approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Maryland,&#xD;
      Baltimore. Over 90% of eligible caregivers agreed and participated in an initial evaluation&#xD;
      that included measures of growth, standardized developmental assessments, and a 60-minute&#xD;
      interview of questionnaires on demographics, children's behavior, and maternal and family&#xD;
      functioning. Developmental assessments were administered by psychology graduate students,&#xD;
      supervised by a pediatric psychologist. A home visit was scheduled within two weeks of the&#xD;
      initial evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with FTT were treated in an interdisciplinary clinic. Based on a randomization&#xD;
      procedure, stratified by race, gender, and infant age to ensure equivalence across groups,&#xD;
      children with FTT were randomized to receive either the clinical intervention plus home&#xD;
      intervention (FTT-HI) or the clinical intervention only (FTT-CO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention was based on ecological theory and included a therapeutic alliance between&#xD;
      the interventionist and the caregiver; support to the caregiver's personal, family, and&#xD;
      environmental needs; opportunities to model and promote responsive parent-infant interaction;&#xD;
      and problem-solving strategies regarding personal, parenting, and children's issues. The&#xD;
      Hawaii Early Learning Program was used as a curriculum guide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention was delivered by three, part-time lay home visitors employed by a&#xD;
      community-based agency specializing in early intervention. The home visitors received an&#xD;
      eight-session training program and were supervised by a community health nurse. The home&#xD;
      visitors had portable mats and toys to demonstrate developmentally appropriate activities and&#xD;
      to facilitate parent-child interaction. They did not focus on nutrition or feeding behavior&#xD;
      and they did not weigh the children. One-hour visits were scheduled weekly for one year; the&#xD;
      number of visits varied from 0 to 47.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children and caregivers return for regularly scheduled evaluations throughout the child's&#xD;
      life. Evaluators are unaware of their growth or intervention status. Caregivers provide the&#xD;
      name of the children's school and requests are sent for information on classroom behavior.&#xD;
      Families and teachers are compensated for participating in evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures are growth, cognition, academic performance, and social behavior.&#xD;
      Evaluators are unaware of the children's growth history or group assignment. Standardized&#xD;
      measures are used.&#xD;
