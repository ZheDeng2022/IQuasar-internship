      The primary objective of this study is to establish the safety of CD-NP in normal human&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two phases. The first phase, &quot;ascending dose phase&quot;, will be&#xD;
      an open-label study in cohorts of four (4) subjects (entered two subjects at a time) with the&#xD;
      primary objective of establishing the safety of CD-NP. The second phase, &quot;MTD confirmation&#xD;
      phase&quot;, will be conducted under randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled conditions in a&#xD;
      larger cohort of subjects (10 subjects). The primary objective of this phase will be to&#xD;
      confirm the safety and pharmacodynamic findings at the apparent MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include evaluation of the effect of CD-NP on: mean arterial pressure&#xD;
      (MAP), heart rate (HR), urinary sodium and potassium excretion (UNaV and UKV, respectively),&#xD;
      urinary flow rate (UV), and creatinine clearance. Plasma concentrations of CD-NP, angiotensin&#xD;
      II, and aldosterone, and the urinary excretion rates of cGMP and CD-NP will also be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;

             gastrointestinal, hepatic, or central nervous system; or other conditions that may&#xD;
             interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of study drug, or&#xD;
             would place the subject at increased risk&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The presence of abnormal laboratory values which are considered clinically&#xD;
             significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
