  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the drug&#xD;
      Olanzapine that can be given to patients with advanced cancer who are experiencing weight&#xD;
      loss. Researchers want to find out if Olanzapine can help decrease weight loss in patients&#xD;
      who are experiencing it because of cancer. How this drug affects performance status,&#xD;
      cancer-related symptoms, and nutritional status in patients with advanced cancer will also be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Olanzapine is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. However,&#xD;
      patients who have received this drug for these reasons have also experienced weight gain.&#xD;
      Further studies in patients with cancer showed an improvement in appetite, a decrease in&#xD;
      nausea, and a control of flushing (feeling of warmth) and sweating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study and before you receive your first&#xD;
      dose of Olanzapine, you will have routine blood tests (about 2 teaspoons). You will be asked&#xD;
      a series of questions about your nutrition and how well you are able to perform daily&#xD;
      activities. These questions should take about 20 minutes to answer. Your answers will help&#xD;
      the study doctor decide if the study drug is helping you gain weight and if your weight gain&#xD;
      is helping you feel better. You will also have an electrocardiogram (ECG - a test to measure&#xD;
      the electrical activity of the heart). Women who are able to have children must have a&#xD;
      negative blood pregnancy test (about 1 teaspoon).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the tests above are completed, you will begin receiving Olanzapine. The study drug will&#xD;
      be taken by mouth once daily at bedtime for 28 days in a row. Seven different doses of the&#xD;
      drug are planned with 6 patients enrolled on each level. The level you are assigned to will&#xD;
      depend on when you are enrolled on this study. All participants will begin taking the same&#xD;
      strength of the study drug. This will gradually increase about every 3 - 14 days until you&#xD;
      reach the highest strength of the study drug for the dose level to which you are assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About every 2 weeks during this study for the first month and then about once a month&#xD;
      thereafter, you will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs (blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate), and your medical history will be&#xD;
      discussed. You will also have routine blood tests (about 2 teaspoons) to check your general&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will continue to receive the highest strength of the study drug for the dose level to&#xD;
      which you are assigned for about 4 months unless you have intolerable side effects or if your&#xD;
      weight continues to decrease. The study doctor will decide if you should continue receiving&#xD;
      Olanzapine after 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The FDA has approved Olanzapine for mental health diseases&#xD;
      (schizophrenia, acute mania, and bipolar disorder). Its use in preventing weight loss is&#xD;
      experimental. Up to 57 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;
