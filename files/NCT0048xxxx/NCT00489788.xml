      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive test that can look at the heart without&#xD;
      using radiation. An MRI will allow the doctors to look at the heart in order to assess how&#xD;
      well the ventricle is pumping, the amount of blood that it is pumping in addition to how much&#xD;
      it is stretching. An engineer at Georgia Tech has developed a new way of looking at an MRI.&#xD;
      It is believed that this new way of looking at an MRI may be better able to tell us when to&#xD;
      replace the valve in these children. If this new process works, not only can we apply it now&#xD;
      but we will be able to look at previously performed MRIs and gather more information about&#xD;
      these children and their heart function in order to help these and other children in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are planning on enrolling 30 subjects in this study. Some of the subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      and have their MRI strictly for the purpose of this study. Some of the subjects will be&#xD;
      already scheduled for a routine MRI of their heart and we will ask them if we can do extra&#xD;
      images for the study while they are already here.&#xD;

      Cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of morbidity and death in the Western World.&#xD;
      Assessment of Myocardial function has proven to be a clinically relevant method for&#xD;
      monitoring and evaluating outcomes of medical therapy and surgery for structural lesions or&#xD;
      acquired disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common form of cyanotic congenital heart disease with a&#xD;
      prevalence of 0.26 to 0.8 per 1000 live births The current surgical approach favors primary&#xD;
      repair in infancy. This decreases the necessity for palliative procedures and has a low&#xD;
      operative mortality. Complete repair often results in pulmonary regurgitation (PR), which is&#xD;
      generally well tolerated in infancy. Late complications may include ventricular dilatation,&#xD;
      tricuspid regurgitation, diastolic and systolic dysfunction, arrhythmias and sudden cardiac&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) is required in approximately 20% of patients with repaired&#xD;
      TOF and has a 1-4% peri-operative mortality. Thus, early intervention may reduce irreversible&#xD;
      right ventricle injury; however no definitive tools are presently available for determining&#xD;
      patients at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial strain analysis has not been critically evaluated to determine its value for&#xD;
      predicting RV failure. This study will investigate the practicality and accuracy of a novel&#xD;
      mathematical method, developed by the investigators, for analysis of cardiac deformation&#xD;
      recovery from dynamic Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMRI) sequences. The&#xD;
      proposed method requires structural MRI data, offering several important advantages over&#xD;
      existing methods. These include reduced requirements in imaging time and analysis effort, and&#xD;
      the option to use a large database of prior structural MRI studies of TOF patients in&#xD;
      retrospective research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This three-dimensional method is mathematically based on nearly incompressible tissue&#xD;
      deformations. The project proposes validation of technique, comparing its results with&#xD;
      current 'gold standard' methods that presently use CMRI myocardial tagging and phase velocity&#xD;
      mapping, as a pilot study for clinical validation of strain imaging in TOF patients. The&#xD;
      method tracks movement of myocardial tissue throughout the cardiac cycle to compute strain&#xD;
      associated with normal and a clinical disease state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study we will customize the method and software for specific use with CMRI and&#xD;
      TOF. We will test the method on normal controls and TOF patients pre and post pulmonary valve&#xD;
      replacement.&#xD;
