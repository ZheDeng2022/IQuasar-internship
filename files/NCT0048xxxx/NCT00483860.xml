        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A performance status score of 0, 1, or 2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group&#xD;
             (ECOG) Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Histologically- or cytologically-confirmed advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Failed conventional therapy for their tumor type; or subjects who have a tumor type&#xD;
             for which no standard effective therapy exists; or subjects for whom single-agent&#xD;
             topotecan therapy is suitable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Completion of a 24-hour urine collection within 14 days prior to the first dose to&#xD;
             calculate the creatinine clearance value and determine the renal impairment category&#xD;
             (refer to Appendix 8).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Using Cockcroft-Gault formula (refer to Appendix 6), documentation of stable renal&#xD;
             function should be performed within 14 days of the first scheduled dose of study&#xD;
             medication using at least 2 serum creatinine values separated by a minimum of 7 days.&#xD;
             Stable renal function is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. ≤25% change for CrCl &lt;40 mL/min or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. ≤10 mL/min change for CrCl ≥40 mL/min NOTE: Documentation of stable renal&#xD;
                  function will NOT be required if the 24-hour urine collection to determine the&#xD;
                  renal impairment category is completed within 7 days prior to the first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently undergoing dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential who refuse to either abstain from sexual intercourse&#xD;
             or practice adequate contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential who have not had a prior&#xD;
             vasectomy or if both the male subject and the female partner refuse to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception beginning 14 days before exposure to study drug, continuing throughout&#xD;
             the clinical trial, and for a period of 3 months after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled emesis, regardless of etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 X ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SGOT/AST, SGPT/ALT and alkaline phosphatase &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
             if no evidence of potentially associated metastases (e.g., liver or bone) by computed&#xD;
             tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). If potentially associated&#xD;
             metastases (e.g., liver or bone) are present, subjects with &lt;5 times ULN are eligible&#xD;
             to participate, following discussion with and approval from a GSK Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hematological values outside of acceptable ranges. Active infection. Prior anti-cancer&#xD;
        therapy, including, but not limited to, chemotherapy (except nitrosurea or mitomycin C),&#xD;
        radiotherapy, biologic therapy, investigational therapy or major surgery within 21 days of&#xD;
        the first scheduled dose of study drug. Prior nitrosurea of mitomycin C chemotherapy within&#xD;
        6 weeks of first scheduled dose of study drug. Failure to recover to Grade 1 or better from&#xD;
        any toxicity (except alopecia) related to prior anti-cancer therapy by Day 1, Course 1&#xD;
        unless agreed to by a GSK Medical Monitor and the Investigator. Clinical evidence of a&#xD;
        gastrointestinal (GI) condition (i.e., removal of a portion of the stomach, recent GI&#xD;
        obstruction or GI neuropathy) or taking drugs that would alter GI absorption or motility.&#xD;
        Currently taking or will require treatment with cyclosporin A. Concurrent severe medical&#xD;
        problems unrelated to the malignancy, which would significantly limit full compliance with&#xD;
        the study or expose the subject to extreme risk (including major surgery within 21 days or&#xD;
        placement of biliary stents or nephrostomy tubes within 7 days). History of allergic&#xD;
        reactions to topotecan or compounds chemically related to topotecan (e.g., irinotecan).&#xD;
