      A research study to find out more about a specific white blood cell called a dendritic cell.&#xD;
      These cells are found in a layer of fat in the body called the omentum. The omentum is a&#xD;
      layer of fat that covers the bowels (intestines) and protects them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to allow us to compare dendritic cells in normal weight&#xD;
      individuals to the dendritic cells of people who are extremely overweight. These cells will&#xD;
      be collected from the omentum, the layer of fat that covers and protects the bowels&#xD;
      (intestines), from the mesentery, which is another layer of fat that surrounds the intestines&#xD;
      directly, and from the subcutaneous tissue, which is the layer of fat just under the skin.&#xD;

      Obesity continues to be a major source of morbidity and mortality in the United States. The&#xD;
      association between obesity and type II diabetes is well known. Several studies suggest that&#xD;
      fat may generate a low grade inflammatory response that may be responsible for the metabolic&#xD;
      changes in obese patients. More specifically, a certain type of white blood cell that causes&#xD;
      inflammation called a dendritic cell has been found in high concentrations in omental fat.&#xD;
      This cell has not been extensively studied in human patients with morbid obesity, though it&#xD;
      may play a central role in the development of insulin resistance. Aside from weight loss, the&#xD;
      surgical treatment of obesity also results in a decrease in the markers of inflammation. Many&#xD;
      of the comorbidities of morbid obesity improve or are cured. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric&#xD;
      banding is safer than other gastric bypass procedures and results in similar amounts of&#xD;
      weight loss after 2 years postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much of the work regarding dendritic cells in human subjects has been in patients with&#xD;
      Crohn's disease. Both the cytokine profile and characteristics of the dendritic cells have&#xD;
      been extensively studied in Crohn's patients, but not in obese individuals. In addition to&#xD;
      this, these cells have not been re-evaluated after a period of weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A more detailed analysis of the inflammation of obesity and its subsequent resolution with&#xD;
      weight loss will contribute to the growing body of information on this subject. Further work&#xD;
      will lend insight into the pathogenesis of the comorbidities of obesity and may contribute to&#xD;
      uncovering potential treatments for these illnesses. Dendritic cells have been extensively&#xD;
      studied in animal models. We now know specific cell surface markers and signaling pathways&#xD;
      for these cells, their responses to stimulating factors, and their ability to secrete&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. We hope to translate these findings to humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is now recognized that chronic low-grade inflammation is the critical element leading to&#xD;
      insulin resistance in insulin target cells. The evidence for this is substantial, including&#xD;
      consistent measurements of elevated inflammatory markers in plasma from insulin&#xD;
      resistance/diabetic humans and rodents. This concept was further established by the recent&#xD;
      discovery that obese adipose tissue contains large numbers of resident macrophages. In fact,&#xD;
      in the lean state, about 10% of all the cell types within adipose tissue consist of&#xD;
      macrophages, and this number can go as high as 50% in obesity. Furthermore, FACS sorting of&#xD;
      adipose tissue macrophages based on surface markers, has indicated that it is a subpopulation&#xD;
      of macrophages which accounts for this remarkable increase. This subpopulation involves&#xD;
      macrophages which are positive for F4/80, CD11B and CD11C and are, therefore, dendritic-like&#xD;
      in their phenotype. There are also reports in the literature which suggests that visceral&#xD;
      adipose tissue may be particularly &quot;inflamed&quot; compared to subcutaneous adipose tissue and&#xD;
      that increased macrophage infiltration and inflammatory markers are expressed in visceral&#xD;
      fat. More recent evidence, in which the macrophage inflammatory pathway is specifically&#xD;
      disabled, in knock-out mice, conclusively demonstrates that the macrophage can be the&#xD;
      initiating or orchestrating cell type responsible for the inflammatory response which&#xD;
      ultimately leads to systemic insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These concepts will be assessed in using the subcutaneous and visceral fat samples obtained&#xD;
      under this protocol. The adipose tissue samples will be collagenase digested to release all&#xD;
      of the adipocytes and non-adipocyte cell types within the tissue. Using differential&#xD;
      centrifugation and filtration, the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) will be separated from the&#xD;
      adipocytes. The SVF contains the macrophages, and these cells will undergo FACS analysis&#xD;
      based on the expression of F4/80, CD11B and CD11C to determine the absolute number of&#xD;
      macrophages within a given adipose tissue sample, and the proportion of classical macrophages&#xD;
      versus dendritic cell-like macrophages. The cells will then be sorted, and inflammatory&#xD;
      marker expression will be measured in the classical macrophages (F4/80 positive, CD11B&#xD;
      positive, but CD11C negative) versus the dendritic-like cells (F480 positive, CD11B positive,&#xD;
      and CD11C positive). This analysis will involve direct measurement of cytokine expression by&#xD;
      these cells (TNF, IL-1, and IL-6) as well as PCR-based measurements of mRNA expression of&#xD;
      inflammatory pathway components. These measurements will be performed on the subcutaneous and&#xD;
      visceral adipose tissue obtained at the time of the initial surgery, as well as on the&#xD;
      subcutaneous adipose tissue samples at follow up after weight reduction.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For gastric banding subjects to qualify for study inclusion, subjects have to have a&#xD;
             BMI ranging from 33-40. Currently a BMI of 33 is our lower level of acceptable for&#xD;
             bypass. Subjects with a BMI&gt;40 will be excluded because their fat cells are very large&#xD;
             and therefore fragile and unsuitable for research use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Control Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All adult subjects 18 years or greater being seen in the minimally invasive surgery&#xD;
             clinic for elective laparoscopic surgery will also be screened.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  These will be subjects who are non-obese (BMI&lt;30) and undergoing laparoscopic surgery&#xD;
             for a different indication such as hernia repair or cholecystectomy. These will be&#xD;
             patients who are undergoing elective procedures to minimize the impact an acute&#xD;
             inflamed abdomen may have on the fat cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant will be excluded from this&#xD;
             study. Gastric banding cannot not be performed on pregnant women.&#xD;
