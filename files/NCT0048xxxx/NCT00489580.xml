      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To document the safe and effective application of the F.T.M. Arm Training Program using&#xD;
           the SaeboFlex to an inpatient post stroke rehabilitation population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare functional improvements in hand and UE use achieved with the F.T.M. program&#xD;
           as compared to generally applied therapeutic treatment approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To develop recommendations for an inpatient retraining protocol that could then be&#xD;
           evaluated in a multi-center trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To document the retention of UE and hand improvements after SaeboFlex training is&#xD;
           discontinued as well as the carry over of these gains into daily function after therapy&#xD;
           has been discontinued.&#xD;

      Therapeutic interventions for the recovery of hand function after a neurological injury have&#xD;
      historically been very limited. A significant body of research now supports the use of an&#xD;
      upper extremity retraining approach for functional recovery after neurological injury. Few&#xD;
      therapeutic approaches offer any intervention specifically focused on grasp and release&#xD;
      retraining. In an effort to address this deficit, the SaeboFlex dynamic hand orthosis was&#xD;
      developed by occupational therapists. The F.T.M. Arm Training Program has been safely used by&#xD;
      hundreds of occupational and physical therapists on over one thousand patients in outpatient&#xD;
      neurological rehabilitation over the past two years. It is currently an accepted modality of&#xD;
      treatment for the management of hand paresis in the acquired brain injury population. During&#xD;
      that time, two factors, other than the severity of the initial injury, were identified as&#xD;
      having a significant affect on the outcomes achieved in treatment. They are learned non-use&#xD;
      and soft tissue shortening of the finger flexors. All treatment delivered to the subjects&#xD;
      that partake in this study will be clinical care and the only research component of this&#xD;
      study will be the assessment of outcomes. The purpose of this study is to explore the proper&#xD;
      treatment dosage and treatment protocol for the application of the F.T.M. Program to the&#xD;
      inpatient post stroke rehabilitation population. Additionally, information on functional&#xD;
      outcome measures will be collected and compared to a matched control group that undergoes the&#xD;
      standard therapeutic protocol.&#xD;
