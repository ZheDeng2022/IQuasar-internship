  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After the diagnosis of prostate cancer, many men alter their lifestyle or diet or use various&#xD;
      supplements in an attempt to retard the growth of their cancer. While there is limited data&#xD;
      on the use of diet and supplements to alter the risk of prostate cancer, even less is known&#xD;
      regarding the ability of diet or supplements to alter progression. For men who have elected&#xD;
      active surveillance, the investigators propose to investigate the ability of vitamin D to&#xD;
      retard the growth of prostate cancer.&#xD;

      Men will be randomized to each of two arms for a total of 24 subjects: calcitriol alone&#xD;
      (DN101, 45 micrograms once weekly) or placebo. Baseline laboratory assays, including serum&#xD;
      PSA, serum and urine calcium and creatinine, will be performed and the EPIC questionnaire&#xD;
      (expanded prostate cancer index composite, validated HRQOL tool for prostate cancer patients)&#xD;
      will be completed. Patients will also undergo prostate needle biopsy [4 cores taken under&#xD;
      transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guidance] to establish baseline levels of gene expression.&#xD;
      Follow-up at the end of 2 weeks (just prior to the third dose) will include a history and&#xD;
      physical, and a repeat of all baseline blood and urine tests. Follow-up at 3 months will&#xD;
      include a history and physical, repeating all blood and urine tests, and the EPIC&#xD;
      questionnaire. At 6 months, in addition to the history and physical, blood and urine tests,&#xD;
      and the EPIC questionnaire, a TRUS-guided prostate needle biopsy will be performed. This will&#xD;
      be a standard 12-core scheme and 4 of these cores will be used for laboratory analysis. Renal&#xD;
      ultrasounds will again be performed on men in the calcitriol arms to look for stones.&#xD;
      Patients who show no evidence of clinical progression will be offered to remain on study, in&#xD;
      their designated treatment arm, for an additional 6 months. Any patient exhibiting clinical&#xD;
      progression at any time will be withdrawn from the study and offered standard treatment&#xD;
      options. For patients remaining on study at 12 months, an end-of-study biopsy will be&#xD;
      requested (12-core scheme with 4 cores used for laboratory analysis)&#xD;
