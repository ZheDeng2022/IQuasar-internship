      The aim of this study is to validate the ability of Capsule Endoscopy (CE) to accurately&#xD;
      diagnose small bowel (SB) Crohns disease in patients with symptoms of abdominal pain and&#xD;
      diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate whether Capsule Endoscopy prior to&#xD;
      colonoscopy will improve diagnosis in patients with suspected Crohns disease when compared to&#xD;
      standard diagnostic testing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease is a chronic, inflammatory disorder (IBD) affecting any part of the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract but frequently involves the small and large bowel. Typical presenting&#xD;
      symptoms include abdominal pain and diarrhea. Patients with this disorder may also have&#xD;
      extraintestinal manifestations including arthritis, uveitis and aphthous stomatitis, erythema&#xD;
      nodosum and pyoderma gangrenosum. The etiology of Crohn's disease is unknown. It affects&#xD;
      populations around the globe and occurs at any age but it has a predilection to affect those&#xD;
      between the ages of 15 and 35.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While about one half of patients have involvement of the ileum and large bowel, another third&#xD;
      have disease isolated to the small bowel. Frequently, small bowel Crohn's disease can be&#xD;
      difficult to diagnose using the traditional methods of evaluation including colonoscopy with&#xD;
      ileoscopy and contrast radiography. Mucosal features of Crohn's disease are often subtle and&#xD;
      difficult to identify by small bowel follow through (SBFT). The SBFT has traditionally been&#xD;
      relied on to evaluate the small intestine for evidence of Crohn's disease but it has been&#xD;
      shown to have a relatively low accuracy of only 30%. This has led to delays in the diagnosis&#xD;
      of Crohn's disease with reports ranging from one to three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past few years, capsule endoscopy has sparked renewed interest in the investigation of&#xD;
      IBD and Crohn's disease of the small bowel. A PillCam™ SB2 capsule (Given Imaging Ltd,&#xD;
      Yoqneam, Israel) is an ingestible, disposable video camera that transmits high quality images&#xD;
      of the small intestinal mucosa. This enables the small intestine to be readily accessible to&#xD;
      physicians investigating for the presence of small bowel disorders which in the past was&#xD;
      inaccessible to physicians. A number of small pilot studies demonstrated capsule endoscopy&#xD;
      efficacy in diagnosing SB Crohn's disease. Diagnostic yields of 70% have been reported in&#xD;
      small series of studies performed in suspected small bowel Crohn's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to determine the yield and clinical impact of Capsule Endoscopy (CE)&#xD;
      in detecting suspected IBD and suspected Crohn's Disease of the small bowel when compared to&#xD;
      SBFT.&#xD;
