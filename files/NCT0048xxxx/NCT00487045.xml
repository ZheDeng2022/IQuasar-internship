      This study is being conducted to evaluate an investigational instrument called the HEM-AVERT™&#xD;
      Perianal Stabilizer and its efficacy in reducing the occurrence or severity of hemorrhoids&#xD;
      and thrombosed external hemorrhoids (TEH). Hemorrhoids and TEH are caused by blood pooling in&#xD;
      a distended vein and forming a clot, or thrombose, in the outer region of the anus. An anal&#xD;
      fissure is a small split or tear in the anal mucosa that may result in painful bowel&#xD;
      movements and bleeding. Like hemorrhoids, anal fissures are common in women after childbirth.&#xD;
      Lacerations are graded as first, second, third and fourth degree. First and second degree are&#xD;
      perineal lacerations and involve the mucosa and perineum and usually heal by themselves.&#xD;
      First and second degree lacerations are considered to be a normal occurrence in child birth.&#xD;
      Third degree lacerations involve the anal sphincter and fourth degree lacerations involve the&#xD;
      sphincter and mucosa of the anus with bowel involvement and usually require surgical repair.&#xD;
      Per the product classification that was assigned to this instrument by the FDA, the&#xD;
      instrument is both non-invasive and posses a non-significant risk. It is classified as a&#xD;
      manual, general instrument with no specific indications, but has a general indication of&#xD;
      stabilizing pressure. The purpose of this clinical study is to collect data to support a&#xD;
      510(k) application to obtain the specific indication of preventing the occurrence of&#xD;
      hemorrhoids, or reducing the severity of hemorrhoids which often occur during vaginal&#xD;
      deliveries. Hemorrhoids and TEH represent common adverse events in vaginal births with&#xD;
      reported occurrences ranging from a low of 9% to a high of 34% in the reported literature.&#xD;
      Currently no preventative treatment exists. There will be two study groups; an&#xD;
      investigational group (subjects receiving the HEM-AVERT™ instrument) and the control group&#xD;
      (subjects will not receive the HEM-AVERT™ instrument). The HEM-AVERT™ Perianal Stabilizer is&#xD;
      a Class 1, exempt device in accordance with FDA regulation 21 CFR 890.5765. The HEM-AVERT™ is&#xD;
      a non-invasive instrument used to provide continuous pressure to the perianal region as a&#xD;
      means to help provide support during the labor process. Each HEM-AVERT™ instrument is a&#xD;
      single use, disposable, sterile, individually packaged instrument. The HEM-AVERT™ instrument&#xD;
      consists of three components: 1) a rigid polymer base manufactured from a medical grade&#xD;
      polycarbonate; 2) a centrally located cushioning pad which is composed of a laminate of&#xD;
      medical grade polyester non-woven tape and medical grade polyethylene foam tape; and 3) two&#xD;
      lateral hook and loop fastener adhesive strips (with liners) (&quot;loop&quot; strips that attach to&#xD;
      the mating &quot;hook&quot; [similar to VELCRO®]) which is used to provide the tension needed to keep&#xD;
      the instrument firmly in place during delivery. The cushioning pad and adhesive strips are&#xD;
      manufactured using materials commonly found in medical instruments and used in medical&#xD;
      procedures. All of the materials used to manufacture this instrument meet the available&#xD;
      national or international standards specifications as applied to this instrument. This&#xD;
      instrument is not to be implanted.&#xD;
