  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory muscle strength is used as an outcome measure in intervention studies. There are&#xD;
      reference values for respiratory muscle strength in 'healthy' people but not in those with&#xD;
      bronchiectasis disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the reliability of&#xD;
      respiratory muscle strength measurements and identify reference values for those with stable&#xD;
      moderate to severe bronchiectasis disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty 'healthy' participants and 20 participants with moderate to severe bronchiectasis in a&#xD;
      stable state were recruited. Three readings for pulmonary function (FEV1); and respiratory&#xD;
      muscle strength (PImax;PEmax) were taken on two occasions 10-14 days apart according to a&#xD;
      standardised protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard protocol and instructions for all measurements of respiratory strength were used.&#xD;
      Measurements were made at the same time of day and with no change in medication. Before the&#xD;
      subject undertook the respiratory muscle strength tests the assessor provided verbal&#xD;
      explanations and demonstration of the procedure. The subject then had a practice run before&#xD;
      values were recorded. Values were reported as positive numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements were obtained by one of three assessors. Pretraining ensured that all assessors&#xD;
      followed standardised methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary function measures were conducted according to the ATS standards (ATS, 2002). The&#xD;
      FEV1 percentage predicted value was reported as the ECCS scale. FEV1 had to remain within 10%&#xD;
      to eliminate the possibility of a pulmonary exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory muscle strength measurements were conducted using a handheld mouth pressure&#xD;
      meter, a one way inspiratory or expiratory valve, a single use bacterial filter, nose clips&#xD;
      and a standard flanged mouthpiece (Micro Medical Ltd UK). The pressure gauge was calibrated&#xD;
      with a small air leak (greater than 1mm in diameter) to reduce use of the buccal muscles. A&#xD;
      hand held mouth pressure machine computed average pressures in cmH2O sustained over two&#xD;
      seconds and a microprocessor displayed a digital result.PImax was measured near residual&#xD;
      volume after maximal expiration. PEmax was measured near total lung capacity after a maximal&#xD;
      inspiration. There was a minute's rest between each manoeuvre. Verbal encouragement was given&#xD;
      to each participant to obtain maximal effort. Three technically acceptable readings for&#xD;
      inspiratory and expiratory pressure measured were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants gave written informed consent.&#xD;
