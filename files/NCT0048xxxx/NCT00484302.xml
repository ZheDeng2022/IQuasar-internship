      The purpose of the trial is to investigate the effect of specialized treatment of cannabis&#xD;
      abuse among young people with psychosis. The specialized treatment consists of manualized&#xD;
      individual treatment and group therapy. It will be compared with the standard treatment,&#xD;
      which consists of non-specialized, non-manualized treatment. 140 patients will be randomised&#xD;
      to one of the two treatments, and the investigator(s) will be blinded to the treatment&#xD;
      received.&#xD;

      PURPOSE OF THE TRIAL:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomized clinical trial aims to examine the effect of specialized treatment of cannabis&#xD;
      abuse amongst young people with psychosis. Specialized addiction treatment is compared with&#xD;
      treatment as usual. Treatment as usual is a non-specialized, non-manualized treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to examine the effect of the two treatments, patients are randomized to either&#xD;
      specialized addiction treatment or treatment as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically, consensus exists about the fact that cannabis can cause psychotic symptoms that&#xD;
      cannot be distinguished from schizophrenia, and that abuse of cannabis among patients with&#xD;
      psychosis can maintain and worsen the psychotic symptoms. This has also been found in&#xD;
      scientific studies [Linszen et al., 1994]. Several studies show that use of cannabis&#xD;
      increases the risk of development of schizophrenia-like symptoms, especially in young men&#xD;
      disposed to developing psychosis [Zammit et al., 2002; Arseneault et al., 2002; Arseneault et&#xD;
      al., 2004; Henquet et al., 2005]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comorbid schizophrenia and substance abuse (dual-diagnosis) have been associated in several&#xD;
      reviews with lack of compliance to treatment. A systematic examination of hospitalized&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia found that lack of compliance to the treatment was related to&#xD;
      substance abuse and lack of insight (Kamali et al., 2001). A follow-up study of patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia and cannabis abuse found significantly more rehospitalizations, worse&#xD;
      psychosocial functioning, higher levels of thought disorders and more pronounced paranoia&#xD;
      compared to non-abusing patients with schizophrenia (Caspari, 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the &quot;Reference Programme for Schizophrenia&quot; [Sekretariatet for reference programmer,&#xD;
      2004], the Danish National Board of Health makes the following recommendation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Since patients with schizophrenia and concomitant cannabis abuse have a poorer prognosis,&#xD;
      the treatment system should therefore develop treatment methods that are effective at&#xD;
      alleviating cannabis abuse.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence for the effect of treatment for cannabis abuse:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is little evidence concerning the treatment of cannabis abuse, but the literature&#xD;
      suggests that it can be treated using methods that are effective for other types of abuse.&#xD;
      Several randomized trials show an effect of cognitive behavioural therapy [Waldron and&#xD;
      Kaminer, 2004]; however, treatment programmes that combine motivational interviewing, family&#xD;
      involvement, and cognitive behavioural treatment seem to be more effective [McRae et al.,&#xD;
      2003; Carroll, 2005].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence for the effect of treatment of patients with dual diagnosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Cochrane review from 2002 concludes that insufficient evidence exists to show that any&#xD;
      intensive treatment method is superior to others [Ley et al., 2000]. It is recommended not to&#xD;
      offer the treatment separately but as a part of treatment programmes [Linszen et al., 1994b;&#xD;
      Drake et al., 2004]. A randomized trial showed that the combination of cognitive behavioural&#xD;
      therapy, motivational interviewing, and family involvement had a significant positive effect&#xD;
      on level of functioning, psychotic symptoms, and duration of periods without abuse, compared&#xD;
      with regular treatment [Barrowclough et al., 2001]. Two reviews conclude that there is&#xD;
      positive evidence for integrated treatment with motivational interviews, cognitive&#xD;
      behavioural therapy (individual or group-based), 12-step treatment, and a harm-reduction&#xD;
      approach [Ziedonis, 2004; Rachbeisel et al., 1999].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence for the effect of group-based intervention for cannabis abuse:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no evidence to show that group-based interventions are superior to individual&#xD;
      treatment (McRoberts et al., 1998; Greene, 2002). Treatment in groups is less expensive. In a&#xD;
      literature review, Weiss et al. conclude that specialized group therapy can reinforce the&#xD;
      effect of the existing treatment (Weiss et al., 1992). A study from 1999 that robustly&#xD;
      implemented a manualized behavioural group intervention showed a significant positive effect&#xD;
      on symptoms, level of functioning, and lower costs for supportive services [Jerrell and&#xD;
      Ridgely, 1999].&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence for the efficacy of a stepwise or phase-specific treatment that is&#xD;
      successively based on engagement, motivation, coping with symptoms, and preventing relapse&#xD;
      [Drake et al., 2004].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A review of the literature shows that there is a lack of randomized trials that can ensure&#xD;
      that the treatment of patients with dual diagnosis is evidence-based. This trial will assist&#xD;
      in solving this problem by building on best practice. Therefore, we plan a trial in which&#xD;
      group-based, combined treatment, such as motivational interviewing, psychoeducation,&#xD;
      cognitive behavioural therapy, and social skills training is compared with treatment as&#xD;
      usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The experimental intervention: Cannabis and Psychosis (CapOpus) - the specialized&#xD;
           treatment programme:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patient is connected to a case manager who is offered education and supervision by&#xD;
           one of the two addiction consultants employed in the trial-project.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The addiction consultants are both directly and indirectly involved in the treatment of&#xD;
           the patient. During the month prior to the group intervention, one of the addiction&#xD;
           consultants is in contact with the patients once or twice a week. A meeting is also held&#xD;
           with the patient's family and fortnightly contact with the case manager is established.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the three months of group intervention, one of the addiction consultants has&#xD;
           weekly individual contacts with the patient and two meetings with the family. In&#xD;
           addition, the patient follows the weekly group intervention (12 meetings of 1½ hours)&#xD;
           and has fortnightly consultative contacts to the case manager.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the two months following the group intervention, the addiction consultants are in&#xD;
           weekly contact with the patient and the family is invited to a meeting. The addiction&#xD;
           consultants contact the patient's case manager every three weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the purpose of creating alliance and motivation, the treatment starts with&#xD;
           motivational interviewing [Miller, 1983; Miller and Rollnick, 1991]. There is good&#xD;
           evidence for the efficacy of motivational interviews in short-term treatment [Hettema et&#xD;
           al., 2005; Burke et al., 2003].&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patient formulates individual goals for the treatment and is offered the group&#xD;
           intervention. The groups consist of 6 to 8 patients, with the addiction consultants as&#xD;
           trainers. Each group runs for three months with weekly sessions lasting 1½ hours. The&#xD;
           group is conducted at a fixed time on a weekday and the structure of the agenda is the&#xD;
           same at all meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The group intervention is followed by two months during which the individual weekly&#xD;
           meetings with the patient continue. The two addiction consultants offer consultative&#xD;
           assistance to the patient's case manager, who also has the possibility of involving the&#xD;
           consultants directly in the treatment of the patient. The entire specialized treatment&#xD;
           programme, in which the addiction consultants are involved, amounts to six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A manualized treatment programme based on the Australian EPPIC manual [Hinton et al.,&#xD;
           2002] especially developed for first-episode psychotic patients with cannabis abuse is&#xD;
           used. This method is well described and incorporates methods with a high degree of&#xD;
           evidence. Motivational interviewing with analyses of advantages and drawbacks of&#xD;
           continued abuse are used. Instruction is given in coping skills in relation to craving&#xD;
           and situations that usually trigger abuse, and in developing personal strategies for&#xD;
           avoiding or handling these situations. Furthermore, strategies for handling withdrawal&#xD;
           symptoms and for preventing relapse are facilitated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           General coping skills are introduced, such as handling unpleasant emotions,&#xD;
           stress-management, social skills training, and relaxation techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An element of contingency management is introduced to enhance motivation for&#xD;
           participation in the group intervention. In a Cochrane Review from 2006, Denis et al.&#xD;
           conclude that contingency management treatment may enhance outcomes combined with CBT or&#xD;
           motivational enhancement [Denis et al., 2006] Contingency management in the CapOpus&#xD;
           trial is solely connected to positive reinforcement of attendance in the group&#xD;
           intervention. It has no connection to whether or not the use of cannabis is decreased.&#xD;
           Patients are offered participation in free excursions, cinema visits etc. in the company&#xD;
           of one of the addiction consultants. Also, sandwiches are served in conjunction with&#xD;
           group sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An important part of &quot;Cannabis and Psychosis&quot; is to understand and to help the patients&#xD;
           understand the mechanisms that prevent them from abstaining from cannabis. The overall&#xD;
           target is harm reduction, a method which has proved effective in several studies&#xD;
           [Ziedonis, 2004b; Rachbeisel et al., 1999]. The treatment is based on the patients' own&#xD;
           goals for tackling cannabis abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The treatment is structured around the circle of change [Prochaska, 1991; Prochaska and&#xD;
           Diclemente, 1992]. This describes changes in behaviour as a process that runs through&#xD;
           phases of pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance.&#xD;
           Relapse is considered to be an integrated part of the process, after which the phases&#xD;
           must be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pedagogy of the group intervention takes into account that psychotic patients most often&#xD;
           have subnormal cognitive functioning. It is therefore important that the structure of&#xD;
           each session is predictable and over-learning is encompassed. This is done by using the&#xD;
           same agenda at each session:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Round - what has happened the past week.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Repetition from last session.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Homework assignment for this session.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Talk/psychoeducation (new topic in each session).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Discussion of participants' experience with the topic.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  New homework assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Finishing round - evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The active participation of the patients is facilitated through discussions and&#xD;
           role-playing and homework between each session. To increase motivation, the teaching is&#xD;
           made relevant in relation to the life of each patient and their individual goals for the&#xD;
           treatment. The overall principles are described in the manual, but each session leaves&#xD;
           room for adaptation to the patients' wishes and stage in the circle of change.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Therapist roles are directive and direct, but non-confronting non-critical. Emphasis is&#xD;
           on empathy and positive reinforcement, problem solving and generalization to the&#xD;
           patients' daily life. The atmosphere is sought to be relaxed and with room for humour.&#xD;
           For the concluding part of the group intervention, a patient with former cannabis abuse&#xD;
           is involved as a role model.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Methods of treatment are all part of the cognitive therapeutical framework, using&#xD;
           psychoeducation, cognitive behavioural therapy, and social skills training. The aim is&#xD;
           to ensure that the patients gain insight into inappropriate patterns of thoughts and&#xD;
           actions and develop coping strategies. This is facilitated through: Exploration of the&#xD;
           patient's reasons for using cannabis and the connection to symptomatology. Mapping of&#xD;
           advantages/disadvantages of cannabis use and cessation of use. Warning signs of&#xD;
           craving/relapse. Problem-solving skills and coping skills for symptoms. Use of&#xD;
           behavioural chain analysis (Mørch and Rosenberg, 2005). Work with negative automatic&#xD;
           thoughts and alternative thoughts. Social skills training (e.g. to refuse drugs, solve&#xD;
           conflicts, and engage in new contacts). Facilitating daily and recreational activities.&#xD;
           Relapse prevention and developing a crisis plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Structure of the modules in the group-intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The structure of the intervention is based on the stages in Prochaska and Diclemente's&#xD;
           model of change (circle of change). The model is based on the view that the patient&#xD;
           often fluctuates between the different stages and undergoes relapses before being able&#xD;
           to reach the final stage, which marks lasting change.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In order to support the group and patient in the process of changing lifestyle, the&#xD;
           therapists must be able to identify the current stage of the group/patient. Thus, the&#xD;
           intervention can be aimed specifically, either by being oriented towards motivation&#xD;
           enhancing or advisory techniques, or by changing focus, e.g. from exploring reasons for&#xD;
           change to making plans for change. The purpose is to motivate the patient to move on&#xD;
           through the stages; therefore, the model is also called &quot;the motivational cycle&quot; or&#xD;
           &quot;circle of change&quot;. In this way, each session in the group can be adapted to the&#xD;
           participants' motivational level and stage of change.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sessions for the pre-contemplation stage:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Psychoeducation about:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Knowledge of psychotic symptoms. Knowledge of the psychosis-inducing effect of cannabis.&#xD;
           Knowledge of risks and harms caused by cannabis use. Knowledge of abstinence symptoms&#xD;
           following cannabis use (Budney et al., 1999). Knowledge of the effect of decreased use&#xD;
           (harm reduction).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mapping the individual pattern of use, with focus on disadvantages of cannabis use and&#xD;
           the triggers for craving and use. This is done by using registration charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Contemplation stage:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exploration of pros and cons of cannabis use and cessation of use. This is used with the&#xD;
           aim of replacing some of the advantages of cannabis use with other interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exploration of connections between cannabis abuse and symptomology. Ambivalence and&#xD;
           resistance is addressed from an accepting viewpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Preparation stage:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Individual goal-setting with focus on disadvantages of cannabis use. Exploration of the&#xD;
           connection between cannabis use and symptomatology. Development of symptom-coping skills&#xD;
           and alternative coping strategies. This is facilitated through exploration of pros/cons,&#xD;
           behavioural chain analysis and exploration of negative automatic thoughts and actions in&#xD;
           relation to the cannabis abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Social skills training to enhance ability to refuse drugs, solve conflicts, and initiate&#xD;
           contacts to non-users. Introduction to the problem-solving model (Mørch and Rosenberg,&#xD;
           2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Action stage:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Problem solving, where coping strategies are tested. Mapping of warning signs for&#xD;
           relapse and triggers for cannabis use. Individual crisis plans in relation to relapse&#xD;
           and worsening of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Maintenance stage:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Development of new skills and habits in daily life. Support (in cooperation with the&#xD;
           case manager) to maintain an active life with focus on activities of daily life (ADL),&#xD;
           exercise and work/education/recreational activities. Widening of personal network with&#xD;
           non-cannabis users. Training of general coping skills such as social skills training,&#xD;
           handling of unpleasant emotions, stress management, and relaxation techniques.&#xD;
           Strategies for relapse prevention and coping strategies for craving are tested in daily&#xD;
           life. Involvement of patient with former cannabis abuse as a consultant and role model.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Relapse:&#xD;
&#xD;
           De-dramatizing and normalization with focus on learning from relapse. Support in order&#xD;
           to re-engage in the stages of change, with focus on the patient's own coping strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Programme adherence:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To ensure programme adherence, the number of contacts with the patient, the patient's&#xD;
           family, and the case manager are registered during the six-month intervention period.&#xD;
           Forms for registration of programme adherence are implemented in individual and group&#xD;
           sessions. Registration forms are also used to ensure that the planned content in the&#xD;
           group intervention is sufficiently implemented. These forms are anonymized and reviewed&#xD;
           by the research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The addiction consultants are supervised by an external supervisor with expertise in&#xD;
           cannabis abuse, motivational interviewing, and cognitive behavioural therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The control intervention: non-specialized individual treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non-specialized treatment programme is carried out by staff in OPUS (a treatment for&#xD;
      young people with psychosis in Copenhagen), in Assertive Community Treatment or in Community&#xD;
      Mental Health Centres. Thus, the control intervention is identical to the treatment that is&#xD;
      ordinarily offered to this patient-group. The frequency of contact with the patients may&#xD;
      vary. There is no standardized manual for this treatment. The treatment approach is&#xD;
      supportive and not condemnatory. It is important to advise the patient about alternative&#xD;
      coping strategies and to encourage every small reduction in abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH PLAN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research assistant is responsible for conducting interviews at the time of inclusion in the&#xD;
      trial, at six months, and again ten months later. Thereby, the first follow-up interview is&#xD;
      held when the specialized CapOpus treatment is concluding. The second follow-up interview is&#xD;
      held four months after the specialized treatment has ended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment instruments used as effect measures are all validated psychometric scales,&#xD;
      which the research assistant is certified to use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Referred patients will be assessed by a research assistant to ensure that they meet the&#xD;
      criteria for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization into one of the two treatment arms is performed after the baseline assessment.&#xD;
      Firstly, randomization is stratified by severity of cannabis abuse as measured by TLFB, by&#xD;
      creating two sub-strata; one of patients having used cannabis less than 15 days in the&#xD;
      preceding 30 day period, and one of patients having used cannabis 15 days or more. This is&#xD;
      done to avoid the risk of heavy-users of cannabis being overrepresented in either of the&#xD;
      treatment groups. Similarly, randomization will be stratified based on the referrer - OPUS,&#xD;
      CMHC, or ACT, as it is unlikely that patients from these three referrers are comparable with&#xD;
      regard to psychotic symptoms and level of functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Copenhagen Trial Unit (CTU) will perform the centralized randomization, and only the CTU&#xD;
      will know the block size used to randomize. A research assistant provides information on the&#xD;
      patients to the CTU after conducting the baseline assessment. The CTU then performs the&#xD;
      randomization procedure based on computer-generated allocation sequences, and communicates&#xD;
      the allocated treatment to the CapOpus consultants responsible for the CapOpus experimental&#xD;
      intervention. If a patient is allocated to CapOpus intervention, the consultants contact the&#xD;
      patient. Regardless of allocation, the consultants also contact the patient's case manager,&#xD;
      so that the treatment as usual intervention can be commenced. This procedure ensures that the&#xD;
      research assistant, who will be doing the subsequent patient assessments, is blinded to the&#xD;
      allocated intervention. Blinding is maintained until the end of the trial. Patients are&#xD;
      instructed not to reveal details that may cause the research assistant to deduce which&#xD;
      treatment they are receiving. At each of the two follow-up assessment points, the research&#xD;
      assistant will register a guess as to which treatment the patient is receiving. When the&#xD;
      trial is finished, inter-rater reliability between the actual treatment and the research&#xD;
      assistant's guess will be estimated using Cohen's kappa coefficient to assess whether&#xD;
      blinding has been successful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following effect measurements are used at baseline, after six months and after ten&#xD;
      months:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Severity of abuse. Assessment of number of days with cannabis abuse during the last&#xD;
           month with Time Line Follow-Back (Sobell and Sobell, 1992). This effect measurement is&#xD;
           the best for measuring the effect the trial aims to influence; namely whether number of&#xD;
           days with cannabis use can be reduced. Information supplied by patients on cannabis use&#xD;
           will be validated with the results of blood analysis. Blood tests are taken at the&#xD;
           six-month and ten-month follow-up interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the comparison of results of blood analysis and the patient's self-report in Time&#xD;
           Line Follow-Back indicates that the patient's reports are reliable, Time Line&#xD;
           Follow-Back is used to measure effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Influence and severity of other substance use, including prescribed medication, and&#xD;
           establishment of the severity of consequences of cannabis use, are assessed using&#xD;
           sections 11 (use of alcohol) and 12 (use of psychoactive substances other than alcohol)&#xD;
           of the SCAN interview (Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry).[Wing et&#xD;
           al., 1990]&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Psychosis symptoms are assessed by the use of The positive and negative syndrome scale&#xD;
           (PANSS) for schizophrenia. [Kay et al., 1987] A psychiatrist, who is blinded to&#xD;
           patients' allocations, rates samples of videotaped interviews to measure the reliability&#xD;
           of the rating of these interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Cognitive function: Danish Adult Reading Test (DART) is used as an estimate of&#xD;
           prepsychotic IQ. Speed of information processing is assessed with BACS' symbol coding&#xD;
           and with Trailmaking A. Attention/vigilance is assessed by CBT test. Working memory is&#xD;
           assessed with Trailmaking B. Memory and verbal learning is assessed with Hopkins Verbal&#xD;
           Learning Test. Executive functioning is assessed with NAB Mazes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Social functioning (major life areas; community, social, and civic life) is assessed&#xD;
           with WHODASII.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Quality of life is assessed with MANSA and EQ-5D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. User satisfaction is assessed with Client Satisfaction Questionnaire [Larsen et al.,&#xD;
           1979]&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Expenses for the experimental intervention (CapOpus) and control intervention is&#xD;
           measured by examining number of outpatient treatment and bed days in both treatment&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up is planned to be undertaken at six months, because patients in specialized CapOpus&#xD;
      treatment have just finished the intervention at that time. Follow-up at ten months is&#xD;
      chosen, because this allows for a four-month follow-up period after the end of specialized&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and power calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our power sample size calculation is based on a t-test with five fewer days of cannabis use&#xD;
      in one of the treatments, and with a standard deviation of five. This means that 22 patients&#xD;
      should be allocated to each of the two treatments. In the OPUS-study, those receiving&#xD;
      standard treatment and who had a substance abuse at baseline had a drop-out rate of 37% after&#xD;
      one year. Generalizing this to the present study, and ignoring the likelihood of a smaller&#xD;
      drop-out in the intervention arm, we require at least 35 patients to be allocated to each&#xD;
      intervention. However, we aim to include between 60 and 70 patients in each group in order to&#xD;
      be able to measure differences in secondary outcomes. In the group intervention, the maximum&#xD;
      inclusion is 32 patients annually (4x8); therefore, it is necessary for the project to&#xD;
      continue for several years in order to recruit the necessary number of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The necessary number of patients can be ensured by launching the project as a cooperation&#xD;
      between the three OPUS teams in Copenhagen, Assertive Community Treatment, Community Mental&#xD;
      Health Centres, and treatment facilities for cannabis abusers in Copenhagen and&#xD;
      Frederiksberg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main null-hypothesis to be tested is that there is no difference between the two&#xD;
      treatment arms with regard to decrease in cannabis use. All randomized patients will be&#xD;
      analyzed, including those who stop receiving treatment, according to the intent-to-treat&#xD;
      principle. Continuous outcome measures, including the primary outcome of reduction of days&#xD;
      with cannabis abuse, will be analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) mixed models with&#xD;
      repeated measurements. This will include interaction analyses of time and type of treatment,&#xD;
      in order to evaluate the effect over time. Binary outcome measures will be analyzed using&#xD;
      multivariate logistic regression models. The subgroup of patients who complete the entire&#xD;
      experimental treatment will be compared with all those randomized into the trial. Sensitivity&#xD;
      analyses will be carried out to evaluate the effect of treatment in patients that are&#xD;
      inaccessible for follow-up. This will be conducted by multiple imputation methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the trial will be published in national and international journals. Authorship&#xD;
      is determined in an agreement of cooperation for the entire project. The publications will be&#xD;
      publicized according to Consort and Vancouver guidelines of publication of randomized trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants are invited by letter to an assessment by the research assistant, who&#xD;
      presents the trial to the patients, both orally and in writing. The research interviews can&#xD;
      take place at Bispebjerg Hospital, in OPUS, in the patient's home, or wherever it may be&#xD;
      possible. In the oral presentation, it is stated explicitly that participation is voluntary&#xD;
      and not dangerous, and that the patient can withdraw informed consent at any time without any&#xD;
      consequences for the treatment. Oral and written informed consent are obtained. The trial is&#xD;
      registered with the ethics committee, the data surveillance agency and 'clinicaltrials.gov'.&#xD;
