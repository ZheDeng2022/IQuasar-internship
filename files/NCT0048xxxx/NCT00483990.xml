  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of repeated&#xD;
      application of PSD502 to the glans penis in healthy male volunteers&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, double-blind, stratified, parallel group, placebo-controlled repeat dose&#xD;
      study in a minimum of 8 circumcised and 8 uncircumcised healthy male volunteers. Subjects&#xD;
      will attend 2 study visits, of which 1 will be a Screening Visit (Visit 1) and the other, a&#xD;
      consecutive 21-day treatment visit (Visit 2; Days 1-21) which commences no more than 14 days&#xD;
      after the Screening visit. Subjects will reside in the phase I unit throughout the treatment&#xD;
      period. The duration of each subject's participation in the study will be up to 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are stratified based on whether they are circumcised or uncircumcised and within&#xD;
      each stratified group subjects are randomized to PSD502 (lidocaine prilocaine spray) or&#xD;
      placebo in a 3:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures during the 21 day treatment period include: visual examination of the glans penis,&#xD;
      blood sample collection for pharmacokinetic analysis of lidocaine and prilocaine, swabbing of&#xD;
      the glans penis for residual PSD502, vital signs and 12-lead ECG, adverse event enquiries and&#xD;
      collection of concomitant medications. Subjects are discharged from the clinic on Day 21&#xD;
      following a safety evaluation.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Safety testing abnormalities at the Screening Visit, in particular liver function&#xD;

             participation, in the opinion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant abnormality of the glans penis that would preclude interpretation of the&#xD;
