      The Worksite Nutrition Study is 22-week translational study aimed at determining how well a&#xD;
      worksite-based nutrition program, as compared to a control group, is able to 1) produce&#xD;
      clinically significant weight-loss, 2) improve cardiovascular factors, 3) decrease work&#xD;
      absenteeism, 4) improve overall quality of life, 5) improve diabetes control in participants&#xD;
      with diabetes, and 6) promote dietary adherence and acceptability. The nutrition program for&#xD;
      the intervention group consists of once-weekly group meetings where participants will receive&#xD;
      group support and nutrition education on a low-fat, vegan diet.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 65 percent of Americans are overweight or obese. They are at increased risk for&#xD;
      diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, respiratory&#xD;
      disorders, pregnancy complications, and premature death. Research has demonstrated that&#xD;
      weight status is associated with certain types of malignancies, including endometrial, colon,&#xD;
      gall bladder, prostate, kidney, and postmenopausal breast cancer. The total direct and&#xD;
      indirect costs attributed to overweight and obesity amounted to 117 billion U.S. dollars in&#xD;
      2000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 22-week Worksite Nutrition Study will (1) test whether a worksite intervention, which&#xD;
      prescribes a low-fat vegan diet, is effective in promoting clinically significant weight&#xD;
      loss, (2) evaluate whether the intervention reduces cardiovascular risk, particularly blood&#xD;
      pressure and lipid concentrations, (3) assess whether the intervention improves glycemic&#xD;
      control in individuals with type 2 diabetes, and (4) examine how the intervention affects&#xD;
      work impairment and absenteeism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (Group 1, n=60) at a specified worksite will be assigned to the diet&#xD;
      intervention program, which prescribes a low-fat, vegan diet. A control group (Group 2, n=60)&#xD;
      will be designated at a separate worksite. The participants in the control group will not&#xD;
      receive an active intervention during the designated study period. Participants in the active&#xD;
      intervention will attend weekly group meetings for nutrition education on the intervention&#xD;
      diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diets will be assessed, in order to monitor adherence and for the purposes of comparison, in&#xD;
      the intervention and control groups at baseline and at weeks 11 and 22 using a 3-day dietary&#xD;
      record. Dependent measures, including body weight, blood pressure, lipid concentrations,&#xD;
      quality-of-life measures, and A1c (for those with diabetes) will be assessed in the&#xD;
      intervention and control groups at weeks 0, 11, and 22.&#xD;
