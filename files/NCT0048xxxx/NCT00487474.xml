      -  Measure the mid-facial volumetric correction from SCULPTRA treatment, using&#xD;
           three-dimensional digital surface imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the mean change from baseline in facial contour deficiency as measured by the&#xD;
           Dermik Nasolabial Photo-numeric Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate volumetric correction with clinical improvement as measured by the Dermik&#xD;
           Nasolabial Photo-numeric Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate the mean volumetric change in mid-facial treatment area with the amount of&#xD;
           product used&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate subject and investigator global assessment of improvement and subject treatment&#xD;
           satisfaction at the end of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain photographs pre- and post-treatment for the purpose of providing a subject visual&#xD;
           aid during the course of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect safety data&#xD;
