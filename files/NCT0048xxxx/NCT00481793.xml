  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a collaborative study by the National Cancer Institute, Columbia University, and the&#xD;
      Southern Urals Biophysics Institute in Russia. It will examine the relationship of&#xD;
      differences in certain genes to the development of chromosomal abnormalities in workers at&#xD;
      the Mayak nuclear production plant in Ozyorsk, Russia. This population was exposed to higher&#xD;
      radiation doses from external and internal sources than those received by their counterparts&#xD;
      in other countries or considered permissible today. If a risk relationship is found between&#xD;
      genetic differences and chromosome abnormalities, the information might be useful in studies&#xD;
      designed to examine how high radiation exposures cause cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation-exposed Mayak workers employed from 1948 to 1972 in the three Ozyorsk plants&#xD;
      directly related to nuclear weapons production may be eligible for this study. They must have&#xD;
      remained local residents in the area and estimates of their external and internal radiation&#xD;
      exposures must be available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants provide a blood sample for genetic studies and answer a questionnaire that&#xD;
      includes demographic information and information about their family health history, history&#xD;
      of benign tumors, if any, and history of smoking and alcohol consumption. Additional&#xD;
      information is collected from patients' medical records.&#xD;

      Greater understanding of the role of individual variation in response to radiation exposure&#xD;
      might clarify the inconsistent relationship between radiation dose, intermediate markers of&#xD;
      induced DNA damage, and subsequent cancer risk. REB proposes to collaborate with Columbia&#xD;
      University and the Southern Urals Biophysics Institute to elucidate the contribution of&#xD;
      germline genetic variation to the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in a cohort of Russian&#xD;
      nuclear workers with notable and atypical radiation exposures. Our collaborators are&#xD;
      utilizing a new biodosimetry method, termed mBAND, to measure intra-chromosomal aberrations,&#xD;
      a potentially useful biomarker of exposure to high linear energy transfer radiation such as&#xD;
      plutonium. In addition, they will assess inter-chromosomal aberrations using mFISH&#xD;
      (multicolor fluorescent insitu hybridization). As factors other than radiation dose may&#xD;
      influence aberration frequency, REB proposes to add to this DOE-funded study an investigation&#xD;
      of germline genetic variation in DNA repair and other genes in relation to aberration risk.&#xD;
      Mayak nuclear workers (n = approximately 350) employed from 1948-72 will receive a short&#xD;
      questionnaire and have a blood sample drawn while receiving routine annual medical exams.&#xD;
      Germline genotype will be assessed as a risk factor for chromosome aberration frequency. In&#xD;
      this study, we have the opportunity to address scientific questions regarding radiation&#xD;
      carcinogenesis mechanisms at relatively little cost in a population with rare, higher dose&#xD;
      exposures.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA - EXPOSED POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals eligible to be included in the 'exposed' population include all those employed&#xD;
        from 1948-1972 in the three plants directly related to nuclear-weapon production (nuclear&#xD;
        reactor, radiochemical production plant, plutonium production plant), who have remained&#xD;
        local residents, and who have estimates of their external gamma dose and internal plutonium&#xD;
        exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Some eligible workers did not have any plutonium exposure, but are still eligible to be&#xD;
        included in the exposed sample due to their external radiation exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants are required to be cancer-free at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - EXPOSED POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals who have a medical history of radiation therapy or a blood transfusion within&#xD;
        the previous year will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        As the sample size would not be adequate to examine their risk separately, Tartars and&#xD;
        Bashkirs will not be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA - COMPARISON GROUP:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The comparison population will be drawn from current and former workers in the auxiliary&#xD;
        plants (water treatment facility and mechanical repair plant) at the Mayak facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Included will be a stratified random sample of these workers who were employed from&#xD;
        1948-1972, who have remained local residents, and who have estimates of their external&#xD;
        gamma dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals selected will be frequency-matched according to age (5 year age groups) and&#xD;
        gender to the exposed worker population.&#xD;
