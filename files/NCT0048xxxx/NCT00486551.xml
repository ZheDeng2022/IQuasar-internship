      This is a clinical study of a cognitive-behavioral therapy known as anger control training in&#xD;
      adolescents with Tourette Syndrome and explosive, disruptive behavior. ACT is compared to&#xD;
      treatment as usual (TAU) in a randomized clinical trial.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled study of a cognitive-behavioral, anger control training (ACT)&#xD;
      in adolescents with Tourette Syndrome (TS) complicated by disruptive behavior. Disruptive&#xD;
      behaviors in TS may take numerous forms including noncompliance, anger outbursts, and&#xD;
      physical aggression. Anger outbursts in TS have been described as rage attacks or rage storms&#xD;
      due to their high intensity and unpredictability in response to minimal provocation. Whether&#xD;
      these behaviors are part of TS, related to comorbid conditions, or due to the burden of&#xD;
      chronic illness is not clear. Nevertheless, these disruptive behaviors can result in&#xD;
      significant functional impairment and often require clinical attention. The purpose of the&#xD;
      ACT intervention is to improve the explosive and noncompliant behavior in adolescents with TS&#xD;
      by enhancing affect regulation and social problem-solving skills. The treatment is based on&#xD;
      anger control training which has been empirically supported for reducing aggressive behaviors&#xD;
      and improving social functioning in aggressive youths. The primary outcome measures include&#xD;
      the parent-rated Oppositional Defiant Scale and the Clinicians Global Improvement Score&#xD;
      assessed by a clinician blind to treatment assignment.&#xD;
