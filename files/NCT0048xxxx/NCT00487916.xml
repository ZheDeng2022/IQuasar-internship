  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a vaccine called AMA1-C1/ISA.&#xD;
      Malaria is a serious infection of red blood cells caused by a parasite. There are 300 to 500&#xD;
      million malaria cases worldwide each year. About 2 to 3 million deaths annually are from&#xD;
      malaria alone or along with other diseases. Researchers hope to find a vaccine to fight&#xD;
      malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients ages 18 to 45 who are in good health, are not pregnant or breast feeding, have no&#xD;
      history of malaria, and have not lived for more than 1 month in an area where malaria is&#xD;
      prevalent may be eligible for this study. There will be 28 participants, each assigned to one&#xD;
      of three dose groups: 12 get 5 microg, 12 get 20 microg, and 4 get 80 microg of AMA 1-C1&#xD;
      formulated in ISA 720. The vaccine might block the parasite from entering red blood cells and&#xD;
      causing disease. This study is the first time the vaccine will be given to human beings for&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have a medical history, physical exam, laboratory tests, and pregnancy tests.&#xD;
      The study will last 48 weeks. One or two vaccinations are given by injection, at least 12&#xD;
      weeks apart. After each vaccination, patients will be asked to stay in the clinic for at&#xD;
      least 30 minutes for observation. They will return to the clinic on Days 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, and&#xD;
      56 after each vaccination. There will be a check of vital signs, brief physical exam, history&#xD;
      of symptoms and medications taken since the last visit, and blood tests to check for vaccine&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness. Photographs of the injection site on the arm may be taken. Patients&#xD;
      will receive a thermometer, diary card, and plastic measuring device. Each day they will&#xD;
      record their temperatures and any symptoms, and measure the size of any reactions at the&#xD;
      vaccination site. They will be asked to do this for 27 days after vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After injections, there may be pain, swelling, and redness at the vaccination site, and&#xD;
      limitation of arm movement. General side effects from the vaccine may be fever, chills,&#xD;
      headache, fatigue, and muscle and joint pain. Patients will be asked if they agree to have&#xD;
      researchers keep any unused serum samples, for use only in research into malaria and other&#xD;
      diseases. Genetic testing would not be done on those samples. Stored samples will be labeled&#xD;
      with a code, and information is kept private.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AMA1-C1 with Montanide ISA 720, is a blood stage malaria vaccine candidate. The objectives of&#xD;
      this phase 1 trial are to study the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of this&#xD;
      vaccine and to assess the level, kinetics, and the in vitro biological activity of the&#xD;
      antibody response it induces. The study is an open label, dose escalation, phase 1 clinical&#xD;
      trial in healthy adult volunteers. Volunteers will be screened and 28 participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled into 3 dose cohorts. Cohort 1 will receive 5 micrograms of AMA1-C1/ISA 720 at each&#xD;
      injection, Cohort 2 will receive 20 micrograms, and Cohort 3 will receive 80 micrograms.&#xD;
      Cohorts 1 and 2 will receive 2 injections, 3 months apart. Cohort 3 will receive only 1&#xD;
      vaccination. Safety outcome measures are local and systemic (including laboratory) adverse&#xD;
      events. Immune responses to vaccination will be measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay&#xD;
      (ELISA) and parasite growth inhibition assay (GIA), and will be compared among dose groups.&#xD;
