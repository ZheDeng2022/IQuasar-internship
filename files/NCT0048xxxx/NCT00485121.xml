      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of adding ezetimibe to statin therapy&#xD;
      on levels of inflammatory markers and adipokines in patients with atherosclerosis disease and&#xD;
      features of the metabolic syndrome,whose LDL-c remains above target (&gt; 2.0 mmol/L) despite&#xD;
      statin monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the addition of Ezetimibe (10mg per day for 12 weeks) to ongoing statin&#xD;
      therapy in patients with atherosclerosis and features of the metabolic syndrome will&#xD;
      favourably modify levels of inflammatory biomarkers and adipokines.&#xD;

      Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in industrialized&#xD;
      nations despite major advances in its diagnosis, treatment and prevention. While there has&#xD;
      been a trend over the last half century showing a general decline in the age-adjusted death&#xD;
      rates of heart disease and stroke, the increasing epidemic of obesity, followed closely by&#xD;
      insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes will likely slow the decline and promise to reverse&#xD;
      this trend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity mediates increased cardiovascular disease risks through multiple pathways. Adipose&#xD;
      tissue is no longer viewed as a passive repository for triacylglycerol storage and a source&#xD;
      of free fatty acids (FFAs). It is recognized as a rich source of proinflammatory mediators,&#xD;
      many of which are cytokines, growth factors and hormones that directly contribute to the&#xD;
      proinflammatory milieu mediating vascular injury, insulin resistance and ultimately impacting&#xD;
      on cardiovascular health. These proinflammatory adipocytokines, or adipokines include tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor- α (TNF α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), leptin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1&#xD;
      (PAI-1), angiotensinogen, resistin and more recently C-reactive protein (CRP). On the other&#xD;
      hand, nitric oxide (NO) and another adipokine called adiponectin confer protection against&#xD;
      inflammation and obesity-linked insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evolving role of augmented adipokine production in obese and insulin resistant states in&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease risk opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions. Treatment of the&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome will need to embrace new strategies to reduce the burden of&#xD;
      proinflammatory adipokines. Lifestyle intervention remains the cornerstone therapy, but&#xD;
      considerations should also be given to a number of drugs that can decrease the inflammatory&#xD;
      adipokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ezetimibe selectively inhibits the absorption of biliary and dietary cholesterol and&#xD;
      phytosterols at the intestinal brush border. When added to or coadministered with a statin,&#xD;
      ezetimibe produces significant incremental LDL-C, apolipoprotein (apo) B, and triglyceride&#xD;
      (TG) reductions, beneficial effects on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) compared&#xD;
      to statin monotherapy, and is well tolerated with a low incidence of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was previously demonstrated that in a 12 week trial that the addition of ezetimibe to&#xD;
      simvastatin resulted in significant incremental reductions in CRP compared to simvastatin&#xD;
      monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outlined study protocol investigates the effects of adding ezetimibe to statin therapy on&#xD;
      levels of inflammatory markers and adipokines in patients with atherosclerosis and features&#xD;
      of the metabolic syndrome, whose LDL-c remains above target (&gt; 2.0 mmol/L) despite statin&#xD;
      monotherapy.&#xD;
