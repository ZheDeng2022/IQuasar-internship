    <textblock>
      A prospective two-center antibiotic regimen switch study will be conducted to compare the&#xD;
      clinical efficacy of two antibiotic regimens - penicillin/gentamicin versus&#xD;
      ampicillin/gentamicin - in the empirical treatment of early onset neonatal sepsis. The&#xD;
      influence of either regimen on bowel colonization pattern and on the development of&#xD;
      antibiotic resistance of gut microflora will also be assessed. The primary endpoint is the&#xD;
      need for a change in antibacterial treatment within 72 hours of therapy, based on pre-defined&#xD;
      criteria. Secondary endpoints will be the incidence rate and etiology of early and late onset&#xD;
      neonatal sepsis and susceptibility pattern of causative microorganisms; mortality rate within&#xD;
      60 days; duration of hospitalization in NICU; duration of artificial ventilation;&#xD;
      colonization pattern and susceptibility of colonizing bacteria (including resistance to&#xD;
      empiric antibiotic regimen).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized two-centre antibiotic regimen switch study will be conducted in the&#xD;
      NICU-s of Tartu University Clinics and of Tallinn Children's Hospital. Initially all patients&#xD;
      who need empiric treatment for early onset neonatal sepsis (as defined by Schrag et al. 2002)&#xD;
      in Tartu will be treated with penicillin/gentamicin and those in Tallinn with&#xD;
      ampicillin/gentamicin. When half of the needed subjects have been recruited, departmental&#xD;
      antibiotic regimen will be switched so that ampicillin is used in Tartu and penicillin in&#xD;
      Tallinn. Based on the present patient population and hospitalization rate, about 120-150&#xD;
      babies, eligible for the study will be admitted to either units every a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all subjects predefined pre- and intranatal risk factors of infection will be registered.&#xD;
      During the NICU stay laboratory and clinical signs of infection, need for respiratory support&#xD;
      and vasoactive therapy, enteral and parenteral nutrition will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, CSF and urine cultures will be taken according to the routine of the ward but&#xD;
      certainly before every change in antibacterial treatment. For colonization studies&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal or tracheal and anal swabs will be collected from all neonates admitted during&#xD;
      the study period on admission and thereafter biweekly until discharge from the NICU or until&#xD;
      the 60th day of treatment. A separate protocol will be followed for microbiological&#xD;
      investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the need for a change in antibacterial treatment within 72 hours. In&#xD;
      discussions with clinical experts in both wards the following criteria for the change in&#xD;
      antibacterial treatment were defined:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. proven or suspected meningitis or abdominal infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. isolation from a relevant site of the mother or an infant of a microorganism, resistant&#xD;
           to initial empiric treatment regimen in babies with early onset neonatal sepsis or&#xD;
           septic shock&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. deterioration of the clinical status on initial antibiotic regimen and suspected/proven&#xD;
           neonatal sepsis&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. suspected/proven late onset sepsis or nosocomial infection (defined as the development&#xD;
           of clinical/ laboratory signs of infection at postnatal age of 72 hours or more)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. other situations, where the treating physician considers change in antibiotic regimen&#xD;
           necessary - the reasons will be recorded in the case report form Patients, who die&#xD;
           before 72 hours or in whom the antibacterial therapy is changed for other than the&#xD;
           above-mentioned reasons, will be handled as treatment failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will be the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incidence rate and etiology of early and late onset neonatal sepsis, susceptibility&#xD;
           pattern of causative microorganisms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incidence rate and etiology of nosocomial sepsis, susceptibility pattern of causative&#xD;
           microorganisms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mortality rate within 60 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  duration of hospitalization in NICU stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  duration of artificial ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  colonization pattern and susceptibility of colonizing bacteria (including resistance to&#xD;
           empiric antibiotic regimen).&#xD;
