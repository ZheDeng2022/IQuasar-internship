&#xD;
          1. Have clearly documented HIV infection, determined by the presence of HIV confirmed by&#xD;
             one of the following: Western blot, immunofluorescence assay, HIV culture, polymerase&#xD;
             chain reaction (PCR) amplification, branched DNA (bDNA) signal amplification or the&#xD;
             presence of p24 antigen. These tests may have been performed at any time in the past,&#xD;
             but the results must be available for review by Serono prior to entry into the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Documented unintentional weight loss of at least 10%, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In the absence of unintentional weight loss of 10%, weight less than 90% of ideal&#xD;
                  body weight (Metropolitan Height and Weight Tables), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In the absence of unintentional weight loss of 10%, body mass index &lt; 20 kg/m².&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Be receiving at least 90% of estimated caloric requirement on current nutritional&#xD;
             regimen, according to a formal nutritional analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Meet the following laboratory testing criteria at the week -4 visit (pre study&#xD;
             screening):&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Fasting glucose &lt; 110 mg/dl (or &lt; 6.1mmol/l).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Be taking an antiretroviral medication that is approved or available under a Treatment&#xD;
             IND (in the US) or a temporary approval (outside the US).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The subject must have been on the antiretroviral therapy for at least 8 weeks&#xD;
                  prior to study Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The subject must agree not to change the antiviral regimen during the 12 weeks of&#xD;
                  study drug administration (unless medically mandated).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Be capable of completing all required study activities and assessments (including all&#xD;
             required exercise performance tests).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Understand and sign an informed consent document.&#xD;
