  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether prucalopride is safe and effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prucalopride 2 mg and 4 mg given once daily for 12 weeks is superior to placebo for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with chronic constipation and is well tolerated in those patients&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, Phase III trial with a parallel-group design, consisting of a 2 week&#xD;
      drug-free run-in period, followed by a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the run-in period, the subject's bowel habit will be documented and the existence of&#xD;
      constipation confirmed. At the start of this period, all existing laxative medication will be&#xD;
      withdrawn and subjects will be instructed not to change their diet or lifestyle during the&#xD;
      trial. Subjects will be allowed to take a laxative (Dulcolax) as a rescue medication&#xD;
      throughout the trial, but only if they have not had a bowel movement for three or more&#xD;
      consecutive days. No Dulcolax should be taken or enemas used within 48 hours prior to the&#xD;
      start of the double-blind treatment (48 hours prior to visit 2) and 48 hours following the&#xD;
      start of double-blind treatment (48 hours following visit 2). Subjects will enter the&#xD;
      double-blind period if constipation is shown to be present during the run-in period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the definition of constipation is not met during the 2-week run-in, the subject will be&#xD;
      considered ineligible for the double-blind period and will be discontinued from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled period, subjects will be treated for&#xD;
      12 weeks with either 2 mg or 4 mg R108512 or placebo, given once daily before breakfast.&#xD;

             (no upper age limit).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of constipation; the subject reports, on average, two or fewer spontaneous&#xD;
             bowel movements per week that result in a feeling of complete evacuation and one or&#xD;
             more of the following for at least 6 months before the selection visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. very hard (little balls) and/or hard stools at least a quarter of the stools&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. sensation of incomplete evacuation following at least a quarter of the stools&#xD;

&#xD;
        Subjects who never have spontaneous bowel movements are considered to be constipated and&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects in whom constipation is thought to be drug-induced, or subjects using any&#xD;
             disallowed medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects suffering from endocrine disorders, metabolic disorders or neurologic&#xD;
             disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with a megacolon/megarectum or a diagnosis of pseudo-obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Constipation as a result of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known or suspected organic disorders of the large bowel, i.e. obstruction, carcinoma,&#xD;
             or inflammatory bowel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with severe and clinically uncontrolled cardiovascular, liver, or lung&#xD;
             disease, neurologic or psychiatric disorders (including active alcohol or drug abuse),&#xD;
             cancer or AIDS, and other gastrointestinal or endocrine disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with impaired renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with clinically significant abnormalities of haematology, urinalysis, or&#xD;
             blood chemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Females of child-bearing potential without adequate contraceptive protection during&#xD;
