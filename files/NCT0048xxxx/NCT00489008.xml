    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)&#xD;
      can help to control NSCLC. The safety of SBRT will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess therapeutic efficacy and toxicities of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for&#xD;
      patients with medically inoperable stage I (T1-2, N0,M0), selective stage II (chest wall T3,&#xD;
      N0M0) or isolated peripheral lung recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary goal: Improve 2 years progression free survival at the treated primary tumor site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improve disease free survival, disease specific survival and overall survival at 2&#xD;
           years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Decrease grade 3 and above acute and/or chronic toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Collect blood for future biomarkers study&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic body radiotherapy is designed to provide an image guided, more focused, dose&#xD;
      escalated radiotherapy over a shorter time frame (1 week rather than 7 weeks) than&#xD;
      conventional radiation therapy. The goal of SBRT is to improve tumor control while reducing&#xD;
      the side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive daily SBRT for 4&#xD;
      days in a row over a 45 minute time period. During the treatment, you will lie still on a&#xD;
      table for about 45 minutes per day in the same position. The machine will deliver the dose&#xD;
      according to the plan developed by the doctor and the dose will be controlled by a computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment, you will be seen by a doctor and research nurse once a week to evaluate&#xD;
      possible side effects. A physical exam and a medical history will be done at these visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects&#xD;
      occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a follow-up visit 6 weeks after completion of radiotherapy to check for side&#xD;
      effects. You will continue to have follow-up visits that will decrease in frequency over&#xD;
      time. You will have imaging tests (chest CT or positron emission computed tomography (PET)&#xD;
      scan) and routine blood tests (about 2 teaspoons) at these follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. SBRT is FDA approved for the treatment of lung cancer.&#xD;
      About 138 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

             N0M0) after surgical resection or definitive radiotherapy with/without chemotherapy.&#xD;
             Recurrent disease is defined as NSCLC with same histology, same lobe that recurs&#xD;
             within 5 years after initial definitive therapy. Patient refuses surgery is also&#xD;
             eligible. Patient received systemic therapy is eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Cohort 2: Performance score KPS 60-100.&#xD;

             inoperable isolated lung parenchyma lesion that has been documented histologically or&#xD;
             cytologically as NSCLC without evidence of lymph node or mediastinal involvement&#xD;
             (clinical stage T1-2, chest wall involvement T3, N0M0) and not eligible for cohort 1&#xD;
             and recurrent disease as defined in Cohort 2. This includes NSCLC happens within 5&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. (cont.) Cohort 3: Possible stage IV disease is eligible as long as it meets the&#xD;
             criteria above since there is no definitive way to confirm it. Patient refuses surgery&#xD;
             is eligible. Patient received systemic therapy is eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Cohort 3: Performance score KPS 60-100.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any tumor involving main bronchus, major vessels, heart, esophagus, trachea, carina,&#xD;
             spinal cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any tumor that causes collapsed lobe of lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any tumor with malignant pleural effusion.&#xD;
