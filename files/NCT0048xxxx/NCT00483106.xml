    <textblock>
      Attention deficit with hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a very common behavioral problem&#xD;
      during childhood. It is estimated that up to 80% of this disorder could be related to genetic&#xD;
      factors. The most common treatment for ADHD is psychostimulants. In this study, the&#xD;
      researchers investigate the effect of genetic variants in increasing the risk for behaviours&#xD;
      pertinent to ADHD or in modulating the response of these behaviours to methylphenidate.&#xD;
      Response to methylphenidate is evaluated through a double blind placebo controlled one week&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a syndrome that is characterized by&#xD;
      inattention, motor hyperactivity and impulsivity. It affects 8 to 12% of the population. The&#xD;
      presentation of children with ADHD can be varied, from simple inattention to severe motor&#xD;
      hyperactivity and impulsivity. It has a negative impact on the child's life, including poor&#xD;
      school achievement and difficulty with peer and family relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the etiology of ADHD is not well understood, genetic factors are known to play a&#xD;
      significant role in the pathogenesis of ADHD, as indicated by family, twin and adoption&#xD;
      studies. In addition, environmental factors such as smoking during pregnancy and obstetrical&#xD;
      complications have been found to contribute significantly in increasing the risk for and&#xD;
      severity of ADHD. It is therefore likely that genetic predisposing factors interact with&#xD;
      environmental factors to produce the behavioral disturbances observed in ADHD. The first goal&#xD;
      of this study is therefore to investigate possible genetic and environmental risk factors,&#xD;
      and examine how they might interact to confer increased risk for ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A majority of children (70%) with ADHD show a significant improvement with of their&#xD;
      behavioral disorder when treated with stimulant drugs such as methylphenidate (MPH). However,&#xD;
      the extent to which each child benefits from MPH is variable and some of the children do not&#xD;
      improve at all in spite of adequate trials with stimulant drugs. The second purpose of this&#xD;
      project is to study the correlates/predictors of responsiveness to MPH in school-aged&#xD;
      children and to identify genetic factors that may modulate the behavioral response to this&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve our research goals, children with ADHD are invited to participate to a&#xD;
      two-week double-blind placebo controlled medication trial with MPH (Ritalin, 0.5mg/kg/day).&#xD;
      During these two weeks, neuropsychological and behavioral assessments of the child are&#xD;
      performed at the clinic to evaluate the cognitive performance of the child while on&#xD;
      medication and placebo. Parents are invited to answer questionnaires about the behavior of&#xD;
      their child and about family history of mental disorders, as well as prenatal and perinatal&#xD;
      risk factors. Finally, the participating child, both parents, and siblings are invited to&#xD;
      provide a blood or saliva sample for genetic analysis.&#xD;
