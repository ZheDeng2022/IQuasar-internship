      The project will investigate the use of a novel technique, transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia and patients with&#xD;
      depression. tDCS involves the application of an extremely weak continuous electrical current&#xD;
      to the brain through the placement of anode and a cathode on the scalp. The electrical&#xD;
      current is generally completely imperceptible after initial period of tingling which takes&#xD;
      about 30 seconds. Stimulation under the anode appears to increase brain activity where as&#xD;
      stimulation under the cathode has the opposite effect. This research plan involves two&#xD;
      clinical trials:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A study using tDCS to treat both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.&#xD;
           The negative symptoms of schizophrenia such as lack of motivation and energy appear to&#xD;
           arise due to a lack of activity in frontal brain areas. Positive symptoms such as&#xD;
           hallucinations and confused thoughts may arise through over activity of brain areas more&#xD;
           on the side and towards the back of the brain called the temporal cortex. We plan to&#xD;
           apply tDCS such that it can simultaneously increased activity in these frontal brain&#xD;
           areas and reduce activity over temporal cortex. We will compare active stimulation to a&#xD;
           placebo condition which involves turning the stimulator off after 30 seconds. The&#xD;
           capacity to target multiple symptom clusters is unique with this type of brain&#xD;
           stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The study using tDCS in treatment resistant depression builds on a work with&#xD;
           transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS techniques in depression seem to work which&#xD;
           increased left frontal brain activity or decrease right frontal brain activity. tDCS&#xD;
           will be used to do the same thing with the anode used to increase left-sided brain&#xD;
           activity and the cathode used to simultaneously decreased right-sided brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      tDCS is potentially a better tolerated procedure than TMS and does not appear to have the&#xD;
      same risk of seizure induction. Importantly, the equipment is quite inexpensive and this may&#xD;
      prove to be an extremely safe and effective low-cost treatment for psychiatric disorders in&#xD;
      Third World countries.&#xD;

      TREATMENT OF MAJOR DEPRESSION USING TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression and tDCS Major depression is a disorder with major clinical and economic&#xD;
      significance locally and internationally. It is a disorder of high prevalence and results in&#xD;
      substantial disease burden and health-care costs. Critically, a significant percentage of&#xD;
      patients, usually estimated at around 30%, fail to respond to standard treatments (Fitzgerald&#xD;
      2003). Techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are being&#xD;
      investigated widely for the treatment of this disorder with considerable success in recent&#xD;
      years (Fitzgerald, Benitez et al. 2006)(Hasey 2001). However, TMS equipment is expensive and&#xD;
      requires specialist application. Additionally, TMS is associated with some side-effects.&#xD;
      Given that depression occurs in all cultures and countries, there would be considerable value&#xD;
      in developing a low-cost, non-invasive technique that can be applied in a wide variety of&#xD;
      settings, including in the Third World.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RTMS based treatments for depression are based on an understanding that there are&#xD;
      abnormalities in activity in frontal brain regions in this disorder (George, Ketter et al.&#xD;
      1994; Fitzgerald, Brown et al. 2003; Speer, Kimbrell et al. 2000). High-frequency stimulation&#xD;
      which increases brain activity is usually applied to the left prefrontal cortex in a way that&#xD;
      increases activity, although previous literature is somewhat inconsistent. In contrast,&#xD;
      low-frequency stimulation which decreases brain activity is applied to the right prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex to reduce activity in this region. Both these techniques have therapeutic efficacy&#xD;
      (Fitzgerald, Brown et al. 2003). Recent studies, including those conducted by this research&#xD;
      group, suggest that a combination of these two approaches is also effective; potentially more&#xD;
      effective than either one used independently (Garcia-Toro, Salva et al. 2006; Fitzgerald,&#xD;
      2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a novel, non-invasive and non-convulsive&#xD;
      technique for altering brain function (Ardolino, Bossi et al. 2005). It involves the&#xD;
      application of a small current (usually 1 to 2 mA) between an anodal and cathodal electrode&#xD;
      placed on the scalp (Miranda, Lomarev et al. 2006). Typically, an increase in neuronal&#xD;
      excitability occurs under the anode, and a decrease under the cathode, probably through&#xD;
      respective depolarisation and hyperpolarisation of neurons (Miranda, Lomarev et al. 2006). It&#xD;
      has been shown to be safe in a number of experimental and clinical trials (Fregni, Boggio et&#xD;
      al. 2005; Fregni, Boggio et al. 2005; Fregni, Boggio et al. 2006; Fregni, Boggio et al. 2006;&#xD;
      Nitsche, Liebetanz et al. 2003; Lang, Nitsche et al. 2004; Boggio, Castro et al. 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the research with tDCS has investigated its use in modifying cognitive functions in&#xD;
      experimental neuropsychology. However there is an increasing use of this technique in&#xD;
      therapeutic trials for disorders such as chronic pain, tinnitus and motor impairment&#xD;
      post-stroke (Fregni, Boggio et al. 2005; Fregni, Boggio et al. 2006). Research has also begun&#xD;
      on tDCS in the treatment of depression (Nitsche 2002; Fregni, Boggio et al. 2006). In the&#xD;
      first of these studies patients were randomised to active or sham stimulation (Fregni, Boggio&#xD;
      et al. 2006). Anodal stimulation was applied to the left prefrontal cortex. This resulted in&#xD;
      statistically significant improvement in depressive symtomology, relative to the sham&#xD;
      condition. As the sensation produced by tDCS usually disappears completely after 30 seconds,&#xD;
      the sham used in this study involves turning the device on for 30 seconds and then turning it&#xD;
      off. A second study by the same group including 30 patients has been submitted for&#xD;
      publication. It also shows statistically significant antidepressant effects on the active&#xD;
      treatment group, relative to sham stimulation. Importantly, no substantial side-effects have&#xD;
      been reported in either of these two clinical trials (Fregni, Boggio et al. 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both of these two studies in depression have used anodal stimulation applied to the left&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex. The cathode was placed in a position over the left eye and was proposed&#xD;
      not to have contributed to the antidepressant efficacy of the stimulation. We propose a&#xD;
      slightly different protocol involving anodal stimulation to the left prefrontal cortex and&#xD;
      the placement of the cathode over the right prefrontal cortex. This should ensure activating&#xD;
      stimulation on the left and deactivating stimulation on the right quite similar to the&#xD;
      sequential bilateral rTMS techniques that we have been testing. There is no reason to presume&#xD;
      that this should be associated with any greater rate of side-effects, but may enhance&#xD;
      therapeutic efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Study Design: The proposed study will be a randomized, double blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled (i.e., sham tDCS), longitudinal, treatment outcome trial. Individuals with&#xD;
      depression will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment conditions. These will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Active 2mA transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS): in this condition, 1&#xD;
           stimulator will be used with anodal stimulation to the left prefrontal cortex and&#xD;
           cathodal stimulation to the right prefrontal cortex. The placement of anodal stimulation&#xD;
           is proposed to enhance activity in the left frontal cortex; and the cathode aims to&#xD;
           reduce activity in the right prefrontal cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sham treatment: the system will be set up as for condition one but the stimulated will&#xD;
           be turned off after 30 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 15 treatments will be administered to all participants over 3 weeks (one per&#xD;
      working day). Individuals will be randomized on a computer-generated list with the&#xD;
      information stored on a central computer such that only the treating physician will be aware&#xD;
      of the treatment allocation of the patients. It is anticipated that stratified randomization&#xD;
      of the sample according to potentially clinically significant variables such as age, sex,&#xD;
      illness and treatment duration would dramatically increase the required sample size and is&#xD;
      beyond the scope of this study. Therefore, we have chosen not to do so. Nonetheless, based on&#xD;
      descriptive statistics, multiple linear regression will be performed to adjust for&#xD;
      significant clinical predictors. Clinical raters and patients will be blind to the treatment&#xD;
      condition. The following primary hypotheses will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 1: Active tDCS will improve depressive symptomology to a significantly&#xD;
           greater degree than sham treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2: Active tDCS will be well tolerated and free of major side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: 50 patients with depression will be recruited to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be included if they: (1) Are competent to consent; (2) have a&#xD;
           diagnosis of Major Depression and are currently experiencing a Major Depressive Episode&#xD;
           as confirmed by the Structure Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV (SCID-IV); (3) are&#xD;
           treatment resistant, defined as a failure to achieve a clinical response, or an&#xD;
           inability to tolerate, an antidepressant trial of sufficient dose for at least 6 weeks;&#xD;
           and (4) are between the ages of 18 and 75. Concomitant medications including: (1)&#xD;
           benzodiazepines, (2) mood stabilizers (lithium, valproic acid) (3) antidepressants&#xD;
           (including serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants) and&#xD;
           anticholinergics will be allowed. Since carbamazepine has been shown to interfere with&#xD;
           the effects of anodal tDCS, potential participants taking it will not be suitable for&#xD;
           inclusion in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be excluded if they: (1) Have a DSM-IV history of substance abuse or&#xD;
           dependence in the last 6 months; (2) Have a concomitant major and unstable medical or&#xD;
           neurologic illness; (4) are currently taking carbamazepine; or, (3) are pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Finally, patients will be withdrawn from the study if they: (1) withdraw consent; (2)&#xD;
           experience significant clinical deterioration; (3) fail to tolerate the procedure; or,&#xD;
           (4) develop a serious adverse event. In the event that a patient is withdrawn or drops&#xD;
           out of the study, efforts will be made to obtain a final set of clinical, cognitive and&#xD;
           neurophysiological measures at the time of withdrawal for a last observation carried&#xD;
           forward analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site, Intensity and Frequency: Direct current will be transferred with a pair of saline&#xD;
      soaked sponge electrodes (contact area 5 x 7cm), and delivered by a specially developed,&#xD;
      battery driven constant current stimulator. The electrodes will be placed over F3 and F4&#xD;
      according to the 10-20 international system for EEG placement. This has been shown to be a&#xD;
      relatively accurate method of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) localisation by&#xD;
      neuronavigation methods (Herwig, Padberg et al. 2001), and has been used before in tDCS&#xD;
      studies targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Fregni, Boggio et al. 2005; Fregni,&#xD;
      Boggio et al. 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: tDCS has previously been used in multiple studies in areas such as post-stroke&#xD;
      rehabilitation, Parkinson's disease and depression, with no adverse sequelae noted (Fregni,&#xD;
      Boggio et al. 2005; Fregni, Boggio et al. 2005; Fregni, Boggio et al. 2006; Fregni, Boggio et&#xD;
      al. 2006)(Nitsche, Liebetanz et al. 2003; Lang, Nitsche et al. 2004; Boggio, Castro et al.&#xD;
      2006). The procedure produces a mild tingling sensation initially which has usually&#xD;
      completely resolved within 30 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sham Condition: Sham stimulation will be made using the same stimulation parameters and at&#xD;
      the site of active treatment, but the current will be turned off after 30 seconds. Typically,&#xD;
      tDCS induces an itching or tingling sensation for the first 30 seconds of its application,&#xD;
      which then fades, making this an appropriate method for blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Course: The primary study will be 3 weeks in duration. Therefore, participants will receive&#xD;
      15 treatments lasting twenty minutes, conducted daily on week days. Patients will be assessed&#xD;
      at baseline and 3 weeks and with an abbreviated assessment after the first 7 days of&#xD;
      treatment (MADRS only). Patients in the sham group will be offered open label active&#xD;
      treatment at the end. Patients who have responded to tDCS will also be followed up post&#xD;
      treatment with assessments at up to monthly intervals where possible to assess duration of&#xD;
      response. Patients who have achieved a significant response to tDCS may be offered a 'repeat'&#xD;
      treatment if requested following symptomatic relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms: Symptoms of depression will be assesed with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for&#xD;
      Depression (HAMD). Other outcome measures will include the Montgomery-Asberg Depression&#xD;
      Rating Scale (MADRS), Beck Depression Questionnaire (BDI), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale&#xD;
      (BPRS) and an interview to record the subjective experiences of tDCS and any adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognition: The primary outcome measures will be performance on the forwards and backwards&#xD;
      digit span (assessment of verbal working memory) and block spatial span (spatial working&#xD;
      memory) tests. In addition, other aspects of prefrontal cognitive functioning will be&#xD;
      assessed using the N-back task, Tower of London planning task, FAS verbal fluency task and&#xD;
      the trail making task (A &amp;B). These additional task are included to assess whether treatment&#xD;
      with rTMS results in specific changes to working memory or broader domains of prefrontal&#xD;
      cognitive functioning. In addition, baseline assessment of premorbid intellectual functioning&#xD;
      will be conducted using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - 3rd edition (WAIS-III).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroencephalography: Where possible (based on laboratory availability) EEG will be&#xD;
      recorded before and after tDCS to assess the effect of tDCS on alpha, beta, delta, theta and&#xD;
      gamma power bands using a standard 64 channel Neuroscan EEG system used in many studies by&#xD;
      our group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis We will use a series of repeated measures ANOVA models to assess change in&#xD;
      depressive and cogntive symptoms over time between the groups. There is no data on which to&#xD;
      base a smaple size calculation: we have planned a larger sample than that used in most rTMS&#xD;
      and tDCS trials and will conduct an interim analysis after the recruitment of 20 patients to&#xD;
      re-estimate the sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THE TREATMENT OF WORKING MEMORY AND NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA WITH&#xD;
      TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schizophrenia and tDCS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a debilitating disease which affects approximately 1% of the&#xD;
      population. Measured only in an economic sense, the cost to the Australian government is&#xD;
      estimated at 2.25 billion Australian dollars per annum [1]. A significant proportion of the&#xD;
      burden carried by individuals with schizophrenia stems from negative symptoms such as social&#xD;
      withdrawal and impaired executive functioning. Current treatments for schizophrenia,&#xD;
      including new atypical antipsychotic agents, while effective in treating some positive&#xD;
      symptoms of schizophrenia, have demonstrated only limited efficacy in treating negative&#xD;
      symptoms. There is a need for a new therapeutic option for people with schizophrenia which&#xD;
      can treat these aspects of their illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a novel, non-invasive and non-convulsive&#xD;
      technique for altering brain function. It involves the application of a small current&#xD;
      (usually 1 to 2 mA) between an anodal and cathodal electrode which are placed on the scalp.&#xD;
      Typically, an increase in neuronal excitability occurs under the anode, and a decrease under&#xD;
      the cathode, probably through depolarisation and hyperpolarisation of neurons, respectively&#xD;
      [2]. It has been shown to be safe in a number of experimental and clinical trials [3] and&#xD;
      therapeutic benefits have been found in using it in the treatment of depression, pain&#xD;
      disorders, tinnitus and motor impairment post stroke [4, 5]. In depression, one study has&#xD;
      shown therapeutic effects compared to sham stimulation and the same group have a second&#xD;
      positive study of 40 patients currently under review. This clearly shows antidepressant&#xD;
      effects of tDCS greater than sham and no side effects. In fact, side effects in previous&#xD;
      trials have been limited to a mild transient sensation of itching or tingling underneath the&#xD;
      site of the electrodes [4]. Previous studies have shown that transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (TMS) [6, 7], another technique of neuromodulation, may be effective in treating&#xD;
      positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. However TMS at the high frequencies required&#xD;
      to increase brain activity can be physically uncomfortable due to the induction of scalp&#xD;
      muscle twitching and is associated with potential seizure induction. tDCS is considerably&#xD;
      cheaper than TMS, at approximately one tenth of the cost, and is associated with fewer side&#xD;
      effect so may have a role to play in alleviating some of the disease burden for people who&#xD;
      have schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Negative symptoms, prefrontal cortex and short term memory&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of studies have found an association between negative symptoms including blunted&#xD;
      affect and executive functioning cognitive deficits and reduced activation in prefrontal&#xD;
      areas, particularly the left prefrontal cortex. [8-14]. Biltaeral dorsolateral left&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex dysfunction has been associated with short term memory deficits in&#xD;
      schizophrenia [15]. Application of tDCS to the left prefrontal cortex has been shown to&#xD;
      improve short term memory [16]. As such, treatment with tDCS would appear to have the&#xD;
      potential to improve short term memory deficits in individuals with schizophrenia, and it&#xD;
      also may have a positive impact on their negative symptom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Study Design: The proposed study will be a randomized, double blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled (i.e., sham tDCS), longitudinal, treatment outcome trial. Individuals with&#xD;
      SCZ will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment conditions. These will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Bilateral 2mA transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS): in this condition, 2&#xD;
           stimulators will be used with anodal stimulation to the prefrontal cortex and cathodal&#xD;
           stimulation to temporoparietal cortex (TP3 EEG site). The placement of anodal&#xD;
           stimulation is proposed to enhance activity in bilateral frontal cortex and potentially&#xD;
           improve negative and cognitive symptoms. Bilateral rTMS designed to reduce cortical&#xD;
           activity appears to improve negative symptoms [17].&#xD;
&#xD;
           The cathodes, which should reduced cortical activity, are being placed over&#xD;
           temporoparietal cortex: this site is proposed to be hyper-active in positive symptoms of&#xD;
           schizophrenia including hallucinations and possibly delusions and thought disorder&#xD;
           [18-22]. rTMS than reduces activity (analogous to cathodal stimulation) has been shown&#xD;
           to reduce these symptoms, especially hallucinations (for example [1, 23, 24]).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thus, with these electrode arrangements, we anticipate the potential treatment of both&#xD;
           positive and cognitive / negative symptoms simultaneously. This would not be possible&#xD;
           with other brain stimulation techniques that only target one site (e.g. rTMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sham treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 15 treatments will be administered to all participants over 3 weeks (one per&#xD;
      working day). Individuals will be randomized on a computer-generated list with the&#xD;
      information stored on a central computer such that only the treating physician will be aware&#xD;
      of the treatment allocation of the patients. It is anticipated that stratified randomization&#xD;
      of the sample according to potentially clinically significant variables such as age, sex,&#xD;
      illness and treatment duration would dramatically increase the required sample size and is&#xD;
      beyond the scope of this study. Therefore, we have chosen not to do so. Nonetheless, based on&#xD;
      descriptive statistics, multiple linear regression will be performed to adjust for&#xD;
      significant clinical predictors. Clinical raters and patients will be blind to the treatment&#xD;
      condition. The following primary hypotheses will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypotheses 1: Bilateral tDCS will improve working memory in subjects with schizophrenia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2: Bilateral tDCS will reduce negative symptoms in subjects with&#xD;
           schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 3: Bilateral tDCS will reduce positive symptoms in subjects with&#xD;
           schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: 50 patients with SCZ will be recruited to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be included if they: (1) Are voluntary and competent to consent; (2)&#xD;
           have a diagnosis of Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder as confirmed by the&#xD;
           Structure Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV (SCID-IV) (3) have persistent positive and&#xD;
           negative symptoms despite having trialled, or being currently medicated, with&#xD;
           antipsychotic medication; and (4) are between the ages of 18 and 65. Concomitant&#xD;
           medications including: (1) benzodiazepines, (2) mood stabilizers (lithium, valproic&#xD;
           acid) (3) antidepressants (including serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic&#xD;
           antidepressants) and anticholinergics will be allowed. Since carbamazepine has been&#xD;
           shown to interfere with the effects of anodal tDCS, potential participants taking it&#xD;
           will not be suitable for inclusion in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be excluded if they: (1) Have a DSM-IV history of substance abuse or&#xD;
           dependence in the last 6 months; (2) Have a concomitant major and unstable medical or&#xD;
           neurologic illness or have had a history of seizures; (4) are currently taking&#xD;
           carbamazepine; or, (3) are pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Finally, patients will be withdrawn from the study if they: (1) withdraw consent; (2)&#xD;
           experience significant clinical deterioration; (3) fail to tolerate the procedure; or,&#xD;
           (4) develop a serious adverse event (e.g., seizure activity, active suicidal ideation).&#xD;
           In the event that a patient is withdrawn or drops out of the study, efforts will be made&#xD;
           to obtain a final set of clinical, cognitive and neurophysiological measures at the time&#xD;
           of withdrawal for a last observation carried forward analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No restriction on inclusion will be made based on baseline WM performance. This will allow us&#xD;
      to study a broad range of the spectrum of WM performance as well as the effects of tDCS on&#xD;
      performance that is potentially normal as well as impaired. Data available for memory&#xD;
      impairment in general suggests that ~80% of patients with SCZ will perform below the median&#xD;
      within a sample of patients and controls [25] suggesting it is likely that in an unselected&#xD;
      sample of patients with SCZ, we are highly likely to see a significant majority with WM&#xD;
      performance below the mean for control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site, Intensity and Frequency: Direct current will be transferred with a pair of saline&#xD;
      soaked sponge electrodes (contact area 5 x 7cm), and delivered by a specially developed,&#xD;
      battery driven constant current stimulator. The anode electrode will be placed over F3&#xD;
      according to the 10-20 international system for EEG placement. This has been shown to be a&#xD;
      relatively accurate method of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) localisation by&#xD;
      neuronavigation methods [26], and has been used before in tDCS studies targeting the&#xD;
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [4, 16]. The cathodal electrode will be placed over the left&#xD;
      temporal area (TP3 EEG site). Twenty minutes of 2mA stimulation will be applied in a regime&#xD;
      previously shown to enhance working memory in a population with Parkinson's disease at a&#xD;
      level of 2mA [4]. The same procedure will also be applied on the right side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: tDCS has previously been used in multiple studies in areas such as post-stroke&#xD;
      rehabilitation, Parkinson's disease and depression, with no adverse sequelae noted. [4, 5,&#xD;
      16, 27]. The procedure produces a mild tingling sensation initially which has usually&#xD;
      completely resolved within 30 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sham Condition: Sham stimulation will be made using the same stimulation parameters and at&#xD;
      the site of active treatment, but the current will be turned off after 30 seconds. Typically,&#xD;
      tDCS induces an itching or tingling sensation for the first 30 seconds of its application,&#xD;
      which then fades, making this an appropriate method for blinding [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Course: The primary study will be 3 weeks in duration. Therefore, participants will receive&#xD;
      15 treatments lasting twenty minutes, conducted daily on week days. Patients will be assessed&#xD;
      at baseline and 3 weeks and with an abbreviated assessment after the first 7 days of&#xD;
      treatment (PANSS only). Patients in the sham group will be offered open label active&#xD;
      treatment at the end. Patients who have responded to tDCS will also be followed up post&#xD;
      treatment with assessments at up to monthly intervals where possible to assess duration of&#xD;
      response. Patients who have achieved a significant response to tDCS may be offered a 'repeat'&#xD;
      treatment if requested following symptomatic relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognition: The primary outcome measures will be performance on the forwards and backwards&#xD;
      digit span (assessment of verbal working memory) and block spatial span (spatial working&#xD;
      memory) tests. In addition, other aspects of prefrontal cognitive functioning will be&#xD;
      assessed using the N-back task, Tower of London planning task, FAS verbal fluency task and&#xD;
      the trail making task (A &amp;B). These additional task are included to assess whether treatment&#xD;
      with rTMS results in specific changes to working memory or broader domains of prefrontal&#xD;
      cognitive functioning. In addition, baseline assessment of premorbid intellectual functioning&#xD;
      will be conducted using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - 3rd edition (WAIS-III)([28]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms: Symptoms of schizophrenia will be assesed with the Positive and Negative Symptom&#xD;
      Scale (PANSS) [29]. In addition, as prefrontal tDCS may well modify negative symptoms, these&#xD;
      will be assessed in more detail with the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS)&#xD;
      [30]. We will allow for the capacity to control for effects on mood of prefrontal rTMS by&#xD;
      assessing depression with the Calgary Depression Scale [31].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroencephalography: Where possible (based on laboratory availability) EEG will be&#xD;
      recorded before and after tDCS to assess the effect of tDCS on alpha, beta, delta, theta and&#xD;
      gamma power bands using a standard 64 channel Neuroscan EEG system used in many studies by&#xD;
      our group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis We will use a series of repeated measures ANOVA models to assess change in positive,&#xD;
      negative and cogntive symptoms over time between the groups. There is no data on which to&#xD;
      base a smaple size calculation: we have planned a larger sample than that used in most rTMS&#xD;
      and tDCS trials and will conduct an interim analysis after the recruitment of 20 patients to&#xD;
      re-estimate the sample size.&#xD;
