  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I clinical trial examining the safety, feasibility, and toxicity of&#xD;
      gemcitabine and erlotinib when given in combination with capecitabine in adult patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced unresectable or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be administered at Moffitt on an outpatient basis and consists gemcitabine&#xD;
      once per week for 3 weeks, followed by a week off treatment. Erlotinib (tablet) taken by&#xD;
      mouth continuously starting with day one of cycle 1 with capecitabine taken twice per day on&#xD;
      days 1-14 of each cycle followed by a 2 week off treatment rest period. An accelerated&#xD;
      dose-escalation scheme will be employed with 4 planned dose levels. Whenever patients have&#xD;
      been enrolled at a given dose with at most 1 DLT, the protocol will be stopped and the dose&#xD;
      will be called the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Patients will be treated at the recommended&#xD;
      phase II dose (RPTD) to confirm tolerability at that dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue for 6 cycles&#xD;
      or until disease progression and patients may continue on the study regimen unless they&#xD;
      experience an adverse event that meets the criteria for a dose limiting toxicity.&#xD;

      This is a phase I clinical trial examining the safety, feasibility, and toxicity of&#xD;
      gemcitabine and erlotinib when given in combination with capecitabine in adult patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced unresectable or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This combination of&#xD;
      drugs has never been used before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening tests will consists of demographics, a medical history, and physical exam, vital&#xD;
      signs, height, weight, performance status, blood counts, chemistries, and clotting. There&#xD;
      will also be an electrocardiogram (EKG), tumor measurement (computed tomography [CT Scan] or&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or positron emission tomography CT [PET-CT]), cancer antigen&#xD;
      (CA 19-9), and a serum pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential). Tumor&#xD;
      measurements are also performed after cycle 2, 4, and 6 (study end).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis and consists of both intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      medication and tablets taken by mouth. The gemcitabine will be administered at Moffitt once&#xD;
      per week for 3 weeks, followed by a week off treatment. One tablet of erlotinib will be taken&#xD;
      by mouth continuously starting with day one of cycle 1 while capecitabine will be taken twice&#xD;
      per day on days 1-14 of each cycle followed by a 2 week off treatment rest period. This set&#xD;
      of treatments is called a cycle. One full cycle of treatment will last 28 days and a total of&#xD;
      6 cycles of treatments are planned. Before each cycle we will repeat the blood counts and a&#xD;
      brief physical exam (vital signs) will be recorded weekly during the first 3 weeks of the 28&#xD;
      day cycle of treatment (when receiving Gemcitabine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An accelerated dose-escalation scheme will be employed with 4 planned dose levels. Patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled at the lowest dosage level, if no patients have unacceptable toxicity, the&#xD;
      dose will be escalated and additional patients enrolled. If one of the patients at a given&#xD;
      dose level experiences a dose limiting toxicity (DLT), more patients will be treated at that&#xD;
      dose level. When 2 patients have DLTs at the same dose, the dose will be deescalated to the&#xD;
      previous dose and additional patients will be enrolled. After de-escalation begins, whenever&#xD;
      patients have been enrolled at a given dose with at most 1 DLT, the protocol will be stopped&#xD;
      and the dose will be called the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Patients will be treated at the&#xD;
      recommended phase II dose (RPTD) to confirm tolerability at that dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue for 6 cycles&#xD;
      or until disease progression. Patients may continue on the study regimen unless they&#xD;
      experience an adverse event that meets the criteria for a dose limiting toxicity.&#xD;

          -  Previously untreated with chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. Prior 5-fluorouracil&#xD;
             (5-FU) or capecitabine treatment is allowed if: 1) it was given as part of a combined&#xD;
             modality chemoradiation regimen and 2) no greater than 30% of bone marrow was included&#xD;
             in the field and 3) the treatment free interval has been &gt; 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be measured in&#xD;
             at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;20 mm with conventional&#xD;

                  normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT), less than or equal to 5 X institutional ULN in patients with&#xD;
                  liver metastasis&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. creatinine, less than or equal to 1.5 X institutional ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. creatinine clearance, &gt; 30 ml/min (Cockcroft-Gault method)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to initiation of&#xD;
             therapy (female patients of childbearing potential).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior chemotherapy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the metastatic setting are not&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chemoradiation within the last 6 weeks prior to registration are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy or severe reactions to gemcitabine, capecitabine, or tyrosine kinase&#xD;
             inhibitors are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  May not be receiving any other investigational agents or received investigational&#xD;
             agents within the 28 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor&#xD;
             prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurological dysfunction that&#xD;
             would confound the evaluation of neurological and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior malignancy in the last 3 years, except basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell, or&#xD;
             in-situ cervical cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG PS 3-4&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because gemcitabine and capecitabine are&#xD;
             Class D agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when&#xD;
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Therefore, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
             positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the&#xD;
             study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with erlotinib or other agents&#xD;
             administered during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min (Cockcroft-Gault method)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that require ongoing (chronic) treatment with medications metabolized by&#xD;
             CYP3A4 (saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole,&#xD;
             nefazodone, clarithromycin, atazanavir, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenytoin,&#xD;
             carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's Wort) who cannot be switched to alternate&#xD;
             medications that are not metabolized by CYP3A4 are excluded.&#xD;
