  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single dose, open-label, 2-panel (Parts A and B) PET study investigating the degree&#xD;
      of occupancy of dopamine 2 receptors (D2_RO) in the human brain after single oral doses of&#xD;
      BL-1020 or Perphenazine (Trilafon®, hereafter called Perphenazine) in healthy male subjects.&#xD;
      In Part A the D2_RO is investigated for the study compound BL-1020 and in Part B the D2_RO of&#xD;
      BL-1020 is compared to the D2_RO of Perphenazine, a reference compound.&#xD;
