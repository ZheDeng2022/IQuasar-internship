    <textblock>
      This study will look at the impact of ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) on the progression of disease&#xD;
      in people with CMT1A as compared to volunteers receiving a placebo. This study will assess&#xD;
      whether is it futile to proceed with a larger, longer-term, placebo-controlled study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT), or inherited peripheral neuropathies, are among the most&#xD;
      frequent heritable disorders, affecting approximately 1 in 2500 people. The most frequent&#xD;
      genetic form of CMT is CMT1A. CMT1A is caused by a 1.4 Mb duplication within chromosome&#xD;
      17p11.2 in the region containing the PMP22 gene. Most subjects with CMT1A have a &quot;typical&quot;&#xD;
      phenotype characterized by onset in childhood or early adulthood, distal weakness, sensory&#xD;
      loss, foot deformities and absent reflexes. How increased expression of PMP22 causes these&#xD;
      disabilities is unknown but is currently being investigated in both animal and tissue culture&#xD;
      systems. In this study, researchers will evaluate whether ascorbic acid (Vitamin C),&#xD;
      administered orally, slows clinical progression of CMT1A and affects the PMP22 mRNA levels of&#xD;
      myelinated peripheral nerve fibers obtained from biopsies of glabrous skin.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has CMT1A, defined by the duplication on chromosome 17p11.2 performed by&#xD;
             either Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis or Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) by&#xD;
             a CLIA certified laboratory, OR the subject has a first or second degree relative with&#xD;
             a documented duplication performed by the above methods AND the subject has uniform&#xD;
             motor conduction slowing of the median or ulnar nerve between 16 and 30 m/s.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is between 13 and 70 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject, if 18 years or older, has signed the Informed Consent Form and agrees to&#xD;
             follow the stipulations of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the subject is less than 18, his or her parents or guardians have signed the&#xD;
             Informed Consent Form and agree to follow the stipulations of the protocol. The&#xD;
             subject has also signed a written assent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A known neuropathy from another source (For example, diabetes, drug induced, alcohol,&#xD;
             etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has ever received Vincristine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a known allergy to ascorbic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has ever had kidney stones.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a known history of G6PD deficit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a history of hemochromatosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject suffers from a serious illness or medical condition that is not stabilized&#xD;
             or that could require hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a high ascorbic acid level at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject, in the opinion of the investigator, is unlikely to comply with the study&#xD;
             protocol or is unsuitable for any other reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject participates to another clinical trial or is still within a washout period&#xD;
             of a previous clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is taking neurotoxic medications.&#xD;
