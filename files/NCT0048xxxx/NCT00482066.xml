  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether abatacept can prevent relapse in patients&#xD;
      with ANCA associated vasculitis(AAV). This is a randomised double blinded placebo controlled&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drugs that are normally used to treat patients with AAV are quite effective, but up to&#xD;
      20% of patients relapse within 18 months. The drugs used can also have significant side&#xD;
      effects. Abatacept, also known as CTLA4Ig, acts by blocking vital costimulatory signals&#xD;
      required for T lymphocytes to be activated. As ANCA associated vasculitis is believed to be&#xD;
      an autoimmune condition and dependent on autoreactive T cells, there is some reason to&#xD;
      believe this drug would be effective. Abatacept has already received a license by the FDA for&#xD;
      use in Rheumatoid arthritis where it has proven to be effective even in patients unresponsive&#xD;
      to Etanercept (TNF blockade).&#xD;
&#xD;
      120 patients with AAV will be invited to take part in this study, from hospitals in the UK&#xD;
      and Europe. The patients will receive standard therapy with methotrexate and steroids as well&#xD;
      as 12 months of abatacept or placebo. They will be followed for a further 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the relapse rate over 24 months, in patients&#xD;
      with acute AAV, presenting at first diagnosis or relapse, in the two arms of the study.&#xD;
