      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the burden and characteristics of rotavirus-associated hospitalizations&#xD;
           among children under five years of age of northern Israel&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify potential risk factors of rotavirus infections associated with&#xD;
           hospitalizations among Jewish and Arab children younger than five years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A two-year prospective study and a nested case control study will be carried&#xD;
      out Collection of data: Questionnaires will be filled in with demographic characteristics of&#xD;
      patients and data on the clinical manifestation of the diarrheal episode leading to&#xD;
      hospitalization. Stool specimens will be systematically collected from all children&#xD;
      hospitalized because of diarrheal diseases and examined for rotavirus and for bacterial and&#xD;
      protozoan enteropathogens. Positive samples for rotavirus will be tested for G and P&#xD;
      genotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the nested case control study additional data will be obtained from parents' interviews&#xD;
      on variables such as: parents' education, parents' age, parents' occupation, no. of siblings,&#xD;
      age of siblings, breastfeeding etc. to identify potential risk factors for rotavirus diarrhea&#xD;
      necessitating hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Methods of descriptive statistics / epidemiology will be applied to determine&#xD;
      the characteristics of the burden of rotavirus-associated hospitalizations (the distribution&#xD;
      of diarrhea associated hospitalizations by etiology, rates of rotavirus diarrheal diseases in&#xD;
      Jewish and Arab children, age specific rates of rotavirus infections, the percentage of&#xD;
      hospitalizations due to rotavirus diarrhea by month, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the nested case control study, univariate analysis will be first performed using Student&#xD;
      t test for continuous variables and chi square test for categorical variables to study the&#xD;
      statistical significance of predictive factors of rotavirus diarrheal diseases necessitating&#xD;
      hospitalization. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression models will be performed to&#xD;
      study the independent effect of each variable. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI will be computed&#xD;
      for each variable. Two tailed p &lt; 0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Vaccination against rotavirus is the most appropriate mean for prevention and&#xD;
      control of rotavirus infections. Israel is highly endemic for diarrheal diseases but limited&#xD;
      data exist on the burden &amp; epidemiology of rotavirus diarrheal diseases. Such data are&#xD;
      essential to assess the relevance of potential future vaccination against&#xD;
      rotavirus-associated gastroenteritis in Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the burden and characteristics of rotavirus-associated hospitalizations&#xD;
           among children under five years of age of northern Israel&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify potential risk factors of rotavirus infections associated with&#xD;
           hospitalizations among Jewish and Arab children younger than five years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A two-year prospective study and a nested case control study will be carried&#xD;
      out Study population: About 45000 children aged less than five years, residing in the&#xD;
      catchment areas of three pediatric wards of sentinel hospitals (Laniado - Netanya, Carmel -&#xD;
      Haifa &amp; Hillel Yaffe -Hadera) will be under daily surveillance for hospitalizations due to&#xD;
      rotavirus diarrheal diseases for two years. The catchment area of the 3 hospitals has a good&#xD;
      representation of both Jewish and Arab pediatric population. During the study period we&#xD;
      expect 400 hospitalizations due to diarrheal diseases and 80 hospitalizations due to&#xD;
      rotavirus gastroenteritis annually, in each of the three hospitals (i.e. 480 cases of&#xD;
      rotavirus- diarrheal disease in the two year study). 100 subjects hospitalized because of&#xD;
      rotavirus associated diarrhea and 100 controls matched by age, gender and origin will be&#xD;
      recruited for the nested case-control study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of data: Questionnaires will be filled in with demographic characteristics of&#xD;
      patients and data on the clinical manifestation of the diarrheal episode leading to&#xD;
      hospitalization. Stool specimens will be systematically collected from all children&#xD;
      hospitalized because of diarrheal diseases and examined for rotavirus and for bacterial and&#xD;
      protozoan enteropathogens. Positive samples for rotavirus will be tested for G and P&#xD;
      genotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the nested case control study additional data will be obtained from parents' interviews&#xD;
      on variables such as: parents' education, parents' age, parents' occupation, no. of siblings,&#xD;
      age of siblings, breastfeeding etc. to identify potential risk factors for rotavirus diarrhea&#xD;
