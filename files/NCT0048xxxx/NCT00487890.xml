      The purpose is to identify modifiable factors in older adults associated with functional&#xD;
      decline following major non-emergent surgery. The hypothesis of this proposal is that poor&#xD;
      preoperative exercise tolerance and physical performance, potentially modifiable factors, are&#xD;
      crucial in predicting functional decline and disability following surgery. When completed,&#xD;
      this study will reveal detailed information on the incidence and risk factors for functional&#xD;
      decline in older adults following surgery. It will direct future research targeting&#xD;
      interventions in older adults at highest risk for functional decline following surgery,&#xD;
      thereby decreasing the incidence of premature disability.&#xD;

      This prospective cohort study will follow 400 patients undergoing major non-emergent&#xD;
      abdominal or cardiothoracic surgery at the University of Washington Medical Center. Patients&#xD;
      65 and older will be recruited following introduction of the study by a health-care provider.&#xD;
      The provider will give the patient a study pamphlet and letter outlining the study. Patients&#xD;
      who express interest in the study will meet with a Research Coordinator. The Coordinator will&#xD;
      describe the study, answer all questions, and have the patient review and provide written&#xD;
      informed consent. The Mini-cog, a validated brief dementia screen with high sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity, will be used to determine if patients have a potential cognitive impairment.&#xD;
      Participants who recall all 3 words correctly or draw a normal clock will be considered&#xD;
      cognitively intact and able to provide consent and to participate in the study. Participants&#xD;
      who are unable to recall any words or who draw an abnormal clock will be ineligible for the&#xD;
      study and classified as having a potential cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting patients will be asked questions about their medical history and health status.&#xD;
      The Research Coordinator will only ask questions that are relevant to the patient's medical&#xD;
      care. The 5-item version of the Geriatric Depression Scale will assess patients for active&#xD;
      depression. This short version has been validated and found to be highly sensitive and&#xD;
      specific for diagnosing depression. Patients will also be asked to complete the Duke Activity&#xD;
      Status Index and the Health Assessment Questionnaire. These questions will take 10-15&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to perform physical tasks. These tasks will include a physical&#xD;
      performance measure. Patients will only be asked to complete tasks that they are comfortable&#xD;
      performing. The physical performance measures include 1) a timed 10-ft walk at normal pace,&#xD;
      2) a timed test of repetitive chair stands, 3) a hierarchial balance task, and 4) testing of&#xD;
      grip strength. In the timed walk, patients are asked to walk at normal pace for 10 feet. This&#xD;
      task is completed twice with the average of the times calculated. In the timed test of 5&#xD;
      repetitive chair stands, patients are asked to fold their arms across their chest and to rise&#xD;
      from the seated position 5 times as quickly as possible. To assess balance, patients are&#xD;
      asked to stand with their feet side-by-side, followed by semi-tandem, and tandem and to hold&#xD;
      each position for 10 seconds. Scores are allotted based upon how far each participant is able&#xD;
      to progress. To test grip strength, a handheld dynamometer will be used. Using an isometric&#xD;
      dynamometer, the best score of the 3 squeezes from the dominant hand will be the value&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to complete the EQ-5D, SF-36 and Health Assessment Questionnaires at 1&#xD;
      week, 1 month, 3 months and 12 months following their surgery as well as the CNAQ Appetite&#xD;
      Questionnaire but only at the 1 month, 3 month, and 1 year follow up intervals. The Research&#xD;
      Coordinator will contact them by phone to complete these questionnaires. If the patient is&#xD;
      still in the hospital at the University of Washington 1 week following their surgery, the&#xD;
      Research Coordinator will meet with them to complete the questionnaires.&#xD;
