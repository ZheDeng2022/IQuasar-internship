      The current trial, BNIT-BR-002, will evaluate the safety and biological activity of a fixed&#xD;
      dose of MVA-BN®-HER2, with and without Herceptin, following 1st- or 2nd-line chemotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with Her-2-positive metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intent of vaccination is to induce anti-Her-2 immune responses, both antibody and T cell,&#xD;
      that will then attack the Her-2 expressing tumors, and may induce tumor regression or slow&#xD;
      progression of disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MVA-BN®-HER2 is a candidate breast cancer immunotherapy product comprised of a highly&#xD;
      attenuated non-replicating vaccinia virus, MVA-BN®, engineered to encode a modified form of&#xD;
      the Her-2 protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MVA-BN® is a well-characterized, clonal strain of modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) being&#xD;
      developed as a smallpox vaccine, suitable for use in high-risk (e.g., immunocompromised)&#xD;
      individuals. MVA-BN®-derived vectors encoding heterologous antigens are being developed for&#xD;
      use as vaccines for infectious diseases such as HIV, and for the treatment of cancer. A large&#xD;
      database exists from safety evaluations in animals and in humans for MVA-BN®, and&#xD;
      MVA-BN®-derived vectors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Her-2 is overexpressed in 20-30% of human breast cancers. It is an oncogene/growth factor&#xD;
      receptor critical for malignant phenotype of Her-2 expressing tumors. It is an immunogenic&#xD;
      target, and immune responses to this protein have been shown to mediate potent anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity in multiple animal models. Means to stimulate anti-Her-2 reactivity are now being&#xD;
      studied clinically. Sponsor, collaborators, and others have used both Protein and DNA vaccine&#xD;
      forms of Her-2, and a safety database is developed and no significant adverse events have&#xD;
      resulted from Her-2 directed vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MVA-BN®-HER2 encodes a modified form of the Her-2 protein, hereinafter referred to as HER2.&#xD;
      HER2 contains the extracellular domain of Her-2 but lacks the intracellular, cell signaling&#xD;
      domain. In addition, HER2 includes two universal T-cell epitopes from tetanus toxin to&#xD;
      facilitate the stimulation of an immune response to Her-2, a self-protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current trial, BNIT-BR-002, will evaluate the safety and biological activity of a fixed&#xD;
      dose of MVA-BN®-HER2, with and without Herceptin, following 1st- or 2nd-line chemotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic breast cancers which overexpress Her-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive 3 subcutaneous vaccinations at 3 week intervals and have tumor followed&#xD;
      by CT/MRI imaging and blood drawn for immune function analysis.&#xD;
