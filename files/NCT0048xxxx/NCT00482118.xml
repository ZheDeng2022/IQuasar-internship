      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women in Xuan Wei County, China, are almost all non-smokers, yet they have the highest&#xD;
           lung cancer rate in that country.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-smoking women in Xuan Wei who use smoky coal for cooking and heating homes can&#xD;
           inhale 10 times higher levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH, compounds formed&#xD;
           in many burning organic substances, including smoky coal) than someone who smokes 20&#xD;
           cigarettes a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the health effects of smoky coal in Xuan Wei and Fu Yuan counties in China's&#xD;
           Yun Nan Province&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine how different levels of exposure to smoky coal and other types of fuel affect&#xD;
           the amount of smoky coal emissions that are absorbed into the body&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine genetic risk factors for lung cancer in the study population and determine how&#xD;
           they interact with smoky coal and PAH exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women from Xuan Wei and Fu Yuan counties between 18 and 79 years of age who have lung&#xD;
           cancer and do or do not use smoky coal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women from Xuan Wei and Fu Yuan counties between 18 and 79 years of age who do not have&#xD;
           lung cancer and do or do not use smoky coal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Exposure assessment study for users of smoky coal - 150 households&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of air badges, monitors, and dermal badges to determine subjects' exposure to smoky coal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of blood, urine, cheek cell and sputum samples to measure the amount of smoky coal&#xD;
      emissions absorbed into the body and evaluate the types of biologic changes they cause&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interview subjects about their health and family history, occupational exposures, lifestyle&#xD;
      factors (e.g., tobacco smoking and diet), and inherited differences in genes&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Case-control study - 1,000 women&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of blood, urine, cheek cell and sputum samples to measure how amount of smoky coal&#xD;
      emissions absorbed into the body and evaluate types of biologic changes they cause&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interview subjects about their health and family history, occupational exposures, lifestyle&#xD;
      factors (e.g., tobacco smoking and diet), and inherited differences in genes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gene analysis to determine if a genetic variation is associated with an increased or&#xD;
      decreased risk of health effects from smoky coal exposure&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Females in Xuan Wei County are almost all non-smokers, yet they have the highest lung cancer&#xD;
      rate in China. Non-smoking women in Xuan Wei who use smoky coal in their home can inhale ten&#xD;
      times higher levels of PAHs than a 20 cigarette per day active smoker, and air concentrations&#xD;
      approach levels experienced by workers on the top-side of coke ovens. Several lines of&#xD;
      research have provided strong support that the excess lung cancer in this region is caused&#xD;
      primarily by PAHs derived from smoky coal exposure. As such, this region of China provides&#xD;
      one of the best opportunities in the world to carry out a model study of gene-environment&#xD;
      interactions in lung cancer. We have designed a hospital-based case-control study of 500 lung&#xD;
      cancer cases and 500 controls among non-smoking women, with controls to be selected through a&#xD;
      randomized recruitment design to achieve balance for the main effects of smoky coal exposure&#xD;
      and ultimately greater power to detect interactions. The study will be carried out over a&#xD;
      three-year period in Xuan Wei and Fu Yuan Counties in Yun Nan Province, China. In addition,&#xD;
      we will be carrying out an exposure assessment study (n=150 households) to evaluate air and&#xD;
      dermal exposure to PAHs from smoky coal use in order to model PAH exposure experienced by&#xD;
      subjects in the case-control study. We will collect buccal cell, sputum, blood, and urine&#xD;
      samples from all subjects. The primary goal of the study is to characterize genetic risk&#xD;
      factors at the DNA level for lung cancer in this population and determine how they interact&#xD;
      with smoky coal and PAH exposure. In addition, the hospital-based design will enable us to&#xD;
      collect venous blood samples and cryopreserve lymphocytes, which will allow us to carry out&#xD;
      state-of-the-art functional susceptibility assays such as testing ability to repair&#xD;
      PAH-damaged DNA and apoptotic capacity, and to measure integrative markers of genomic&#xD;
      stability such as telomere length and oxidative damage in mitochondrial DNA. These types of&#xD;
      assays have never been conducted in this population and hold great promise to provide&#xD;
      insights into cancer risk that will compliment those obtained by genotyping. This study will&#xD;
      provide an important complement to and contrast with both DCEG and extramural studies of&#xD;
      tobacco smoking and lung cancer, where unraveling the genetic component is challenging in&#xD;
      part because hundreds of tobacco carcinogens in various combinations likely contribute.&#xD;

        residents of Xuan Wei or Fu Yuan Counties aged 18 to 79 will be eligible for recruitment&#xD;
        into the study. Diagnosed conditions known to be unrelated to smoky coal exposure or air&#xD;
        pollution will be eligible for inclusion into the study. Potential controls diagnosed&#xD;
