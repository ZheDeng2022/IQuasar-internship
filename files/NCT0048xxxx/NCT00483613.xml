      -  Daily stress can worsens the clinical course of lupus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objective: to determine the efficacy of the stress management therapy in a group of&#xD;
           patients with lupus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  45 patients with lupus and high daily stress participated in this clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two groups resulted: a control group (CG) that received the usual care and a therapy&#xD;
           group (TG) that received a cognitive behavioral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The therapy consisted of ten consecutive weekly sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The measured variables were psychological, clinical, immunological and quality of life.&#xD;
           At the basal moment and after 3, 9 and 15 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical analysis showed a significant reduction in the levels of depression, anxiety&#xD;
           and daily stress in the therapy group, compared to the usual care group, a significant&#xD;
           improvement in quality of life, improvements in the reported symptoms (cardiovascular,&#xD;
           respiratory, cutaneous and musculoskeletal.&#xD;

      Stress, especially daily stress, worsens the lupus symptoms perceived by the patients. Our&#xD;
      objective was to determine the efficacy of the Meichenbaum stress management therapy for&#xD;
      dealing with high daily stress in a group of patients with lupus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We designed a randomized clinical trial in which 45 patients with lupus and daily stress&#xD;
      participated. The patients were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: a) a&#xD;
      control group (CG) that received the usual care and b) a therapy group (TG) that received a&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral type therapy, performed by a group of 3 psychologists. Both groups were&#xD;
      similar with regard to their sociodemographic, clinical, immunological, psychological aspects&#xD;
      at the basal moment. The therapy consisted of ten consecutive weekly sessions. Psychological&#xD;
      and emotional, clinical, immunological variables and quality of life were evaluated at the&#xD;
      basal moment and after 3, 9 and 15 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The between-groups analysis showed a significant reduction in the levels of depression,&#xD;
      anxiety and daily stress in the TG, compared to the CG, throughout the entire follow-up&#xD;
      period, as well as a significant improvement in quality of life. The results also showed&#xD;
      improvements in the reported symptoms (cardiovascular, respiratory, cutaneous and&#xD;
      musculoskeletal) in the patients from the TG, who showed significant differences with regard&#xD;
      to their basal level and in comparison with CG patients. This study shows the efficacy of the&#xD;
      Meichenbaum stress management therapy in patients with lupus and high daily stress, as it&#xD;
      significantly reduces the incidence of psychological disorders related to suffering from&#xD;
      lupus, and it significantly improves and maintains their quality of life, in spite of the&#xD;
      absence of a significant reduction in the illness activity index.&#xD;
