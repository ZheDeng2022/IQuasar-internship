      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the impact of PCV7 vaccination on NP carriage rate of vaccine serotypes and&#xD;
      serotype distribution&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the impact of PCV7 vaccination on NP carriage of antibiotic resistant pneumococci&#xD;
      and serotype distribution.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Under the Social Welfare Vaccination Program, the Taipei City Government will vaccinate&#xD;
      approximately 5,000 children residing in the city of Taipei between 2 and 5 years of age&#xD;
      during the months of November 2006 to April 2007 with one dose of PCV7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To gather baseline data on serotype distribution and antibiotic resistance of nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      (NP) carriage isolates in this population and measure vaccine impact on NP carriage, the&#xD;
      Taipei city government requires the evaluation of the vaccination program through the&#xD;
      detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae NP carriage rate pre and post vaccination in a&#xD;
      convenience sample of approximately 1000 children. This number complies with the Taipei city&#xD;
      government request for the inclusion of 250 children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of bacterial otitis media, pneumonia, sepsis,&#xD;
      bacteraemia, and meningitis among infants worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main reservoir of pneumococci is the human nasopharynx. The mean age of first acquisition&#xD;
      is 6 months and carriage rates peak in the preschool age group. The organisms have pilli on&#xD;
      their surface to assist in adhering to nasopharyngeal mucosal receptors. Streptococcus&#xD;
      pneumoniae is part of the normal flora in colonized individuals, but the organism has the&#xD;
      ability to cause disease by invading neighboring tissues, and potentially spreading into the&#xD;
      bloodstream and other sites, causing invasive pneumococcal disease, such as bacteremia,&#xD;
      sepsis and meningitis. The rate of NP carriage for Streptococcus pneumoniae in Taiwan&#xD;
      (1998-99) was estimated to be 19.9 % overall for children 1-14 years and 27.1 % for those 2-5&#xD;
      years. A more recent study by Lauderdale et al. found a carriage rate of 41 % in children&#xD;
      attending a kindergarten program in Taiwan where a 5 year old was diagnosed with&#xD;
      streptococcus meningitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevnar速 has shown a high degree of efficacy in the prevention of invasive pneumococcal&#xD;
      disease in children. In addition, PCV7 has been shown to decrease NP carriage of serotypes&#xD;
      included in the vaccine (VST). Since NP carriage is a prerequisite for transmission of&#xD;
      Streptococcus pneumoniae, decrease in NP carriage of VSTs in children has resulted in&#xD;
      decreased transmission to their contacts and an indirect effect (herd effect) on invasive&#xD;
      pneumococcal disease. Since the majority of antibiotic resistant strains are VST, PCV7&#xD;
      immunization has decreased antibiotic resistance in invasive pneumococcal disease for both&#xD;
      those immunized and their contacts. However, after PCV7 vaccination overall pneumococcal NP&#xD;
      carriage rates do not change, since Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes not included in the&#xD;
      vaccine (NVST) replace the VSTs. Although in the nasopharynx there is an almost complete&#xD;
      replacement by NVST, these serotypes may have less ability to cause invasive disease, since&#xD;
      disease with NVST has been observed but to a much lower magnitude than disease prior to PCV7&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the expected outcome of a successful PCV7 vaccination program on NP carriage is a&#xD;
      decrease in carriage of VST with an increase in NVST and thus, a stable overall Streptococcus&#xD;
      pneumoniae carriage rate.&#xD;
