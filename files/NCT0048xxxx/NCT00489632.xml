      Overall Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this cross-sectional psychosocial study is to examine&#xD;
      illness-related factors, family context factors, and child resiliency as predictors or&#xD;
      correlates of child adjustment to leukemia treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1(a): To examine illness-related factors (i.e., child's health and physical functioning and&#xD;
      severity of the child's illness) as predictors of child psychological adjustment to leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1(b): To examine relapse status as a grouping variable affecting child psychological&#xD;
      adjustment to leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1(c): To examine stage of treatment as a grouping variable affecting child psychological&#xD;
      adjustment to leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To examine family context factors (i.e., family psychosocial risk and parental emotional&#xD;
      distress) as correlates of child psychosocial adjustment to leukemia treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To examine child resiliency as a predictor of child psychological adjustment to leukemia&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One secondary objective of the study is to examine parental distress as a moderator&#xD;
           affecting parental report of child adjustment to leukemia as compared to the child's&#xD;
           self-report of adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Another secondary objective of the study is to develop a model by which the relative&#xD;
           contribution of each predictor variable (as determined by analyses of primary&#xD;
           objectives) as well as their interrelatedness can be understood in relation to child&#xD;
           psychosocial adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A third secondary objective of the study is to examine demographic variables as&#xD;
           covariates in the main analyses. These variables include: age, grade, site, gender,&#xD;
           ethnicity, type of leukemia, staging, time spent in treatment, age at diagnosis, and&#xD;
           whether the child is undergoing standard or experimental treatment.&#xD;

      Parental Consent/Child Assent for Child Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you choose to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete a total of 2 or 3&#xD;
      questionnaires (depending on your age). Each questionnaire will be completed only once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are between 6-7 years old, you will be given 2 questionnaires asking you about your&#xD;
      physical health and illness, and your personal strengths. These questionnaires will take you&#xD;
      about 30-45 minutes to finish. If you are between 8-18 years old, you will be given 3&#xD;
      questionnaires that will ask you about your physical health and illness, your personal&#xD;
      strengths, and your emotional adjustment to the disease. These 3 questionnaires will take you&#xD;
      about 30-45 minutes in total to finish. A research assistant will help you with the&#xD;
      questionnaires, if you need help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are given the questionnaires while you are at the hospital and you cannot complete&#xD;
      them before you leave, you will be given a stamped envelope to mail the forms back to the&#xD;
      study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After your questionnaires are finished, a member of the research team might look at your&#xD;
      medical chart if they need more information about your treatment or the status of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parent Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you choose to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete a total of 5&#xD;
      questionnaires. These questionnaires ask information about your child's emotional adjustment&#xD;
      to the disease, your child's physical health and illness, your child's personal strengths,&#xD;
      your emotional distress, and the overall functioning of your family. Each questionnaire will&#xD;
      be completed only once. It will take about 45-60 minutes to complete all 5 questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Staff Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you choose to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire that&#xD;
      asks for information about the patient's illness. It will take about 3-5 minutes to complete&#xD;
      this one-time survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. About 220 people (100 children, 100 parents, and 20 medical&#xD;
      staff) will take part in this multicenter study. About 130 will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson&#xD;
      (60 children, 60 parents, and 10 medical staff members).&#xD;
