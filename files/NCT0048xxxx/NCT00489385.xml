  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine if Albumin-linked interferon (Albinterferon alfa-2b) every 2 weeks&#xD;
      is safe and tolerated by patients infected by both hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This is a new medication developed for HCV. It may help the&#xD;
      immune system fight infections, especially those caused by viruses. Albinterferon alfa-2b&#xD;
      appears quite similar to other interferons, in side effects and action in controlling HCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients ages 18 and older who are infected with HCV genotype 1, are HIV positive, are&#xD;
      infected with HCV, and have evidence of HCV-induced liver disease; and who are not pregnant&#xD;
      or breast feeding may be eligible for this study. Many visits to NIH over a 76-week period&#xD;
      are required. There will be collection of blood and urine, pregnancy test, and tests of HCV&#xD;
      in the blood. A liver biopsy is required before start of the study if patients have not had&#xD;
      one within 1 year. Another is done at the end of 72 weeks. An eye exam is done before start&#xD;
      of the study and repeated later. An optional procedure called automated pheresis is done at&#xD;
      the study beginning. Researchers can study patients' immunity to control HCV. Blood is drawn&#xD;
      through a needle in an arm vein and spun in a machine to separate the desired blood&#xD;
      component. Remaining blood is returned to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive Albinterferon alfa-2b at a dose of 900 mcg every 2 weeks for 48 weeks,&#xD;
      by injection under the skin. Ribavirin is given at 1,000 mg or 1,200 mg by mouth twice daily,&#xD;
      depending on a patient's weight. Side effects of Albinterferon alfa-2b are fatigue, headache,&#xD;
      joint and muscle pain, and sleeplessness. The major side effect of ribavirin is anemia.&#xD;
      Visits ranging from week 3 to 44 will determine the safety of Albinterferon alfa-2b and&#xD;
      ribavirin and to see effects on reducing the HCV viral load. For weeks 48, 52, 56, 64, 72,&#xD;
      and 76, patients will return for a clinic visit and blood tests. At week 72, an abdominal&#xD;
      ultrasound and liver biopsy are done. Week 76 includes discussion of biopsy results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C infection occurs in one-third of all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected&#xD;
      individuals. Liver disease has become more significant among subjects coinfected with HIV and&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus (HCV). Several studies have shown that coinfected individuals develop&#xD;
      earlier and more severe liver disease. Pegylated interferon alpha with ribavirin (RBV) has&#xD;
      become the therapy of choice for HCV among people with HCV alone. However, pegylated&#xD;
      interferon with RBV therapy for HIV/HCV coinfected subjects results in only modest cure&#xD;
      rates. This is an open-label, non-randomized prospective trial to assess safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of Alb-IFN (interferon alpha genetically fused to human serum albumin) 900 mcg&#xD;
      every 2 weeks (Q2w) with daily RBV among HIV/HCV coinfected individuals. Twenty-five subjects&#xD;
      who are infected with both HIV and HCV and who also have evidence of chronic hepatitis, but&#xD;
      who are na ve to anti-HCV treatment, will receive Alb-IFN 900 mcg Q2w together with a&#xD;
      standard daily dose of RBV for 48 weeks. These subjects will be monitored for Alb-IFN serum&#xD;
      concentration level, HCV viral load, HIV viral load, and CD4 counts, and will undergo a&#xD;
      baseline liver biopsy and another optional liver biopsy at the end of 72 weeks. The results&#xD;
      of the study will enable us to better delineate the efficacy of Alb-IFN in suppressing the&#xD;
      hepatitis C virus in HIV/HCV coinfected subjects. This will be important given the current&#xD;
      low cure rate of HCV among HIV coinfected individuals.&#xD;
