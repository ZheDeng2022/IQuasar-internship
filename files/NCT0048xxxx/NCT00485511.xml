  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disorder in humans which results in&#xD;
      the loss of motor neurons. It is caused by reduced levels of the survival motor neuron (SMN)&#xD;
      protein as a result of loss or mutation of the SMN1 gene. SMN protein is encoded by two&#xD;
      genes, SMN1 and SMN2, which essentially differ by an single nucleotide in exon 7. As a&#xD;
      result, the majority of the transcript from SMN2 lacks exon 7. According to clinical&#xD;
      severity, SMA was classified to three types, including type I, type II, and type III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs capable of modifying the transcription pattern of SMN2 to increase the full-length of&#xD;
      SMN mRNA expression and the amount of SMN protein may have therapeutic effects for SMA&#xD;
      patients. In order to test this hypothesis, we used EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines&#xD;
      derived from the different types of SMA patients to screen the effect of various drugs on&#xD;
      SMN2 gene expression. Hydroxyurea (HU) was found to be effective among the drugs we tested.&#xD;
      HU is an effective therapeutic agent for patients with thalassemia and sickle cell disease&#xD;
      which the toxicity is minimal and is well-tolerated and safely used in children. We had&#xD;
      undergone a small-scaled 33 SMA patients randomized pilot trial (HU treatment for 8 weeks and&#xD;
      then follow up drug-free 8 weeks) to evaluate the effect of HU in SMA patients and we got a&#xD;
      promising preliminary data. We found that HU could significantly increase in the manual&#xD;
      muscle testing scores at 4 weeks, and full-length SMN mRNA level in the 30mg/kg/day subgroup&#xD;
      at 8 weeks relative to baseline, and it is safe under the dose 30mg/kg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we plan to enroll 60 type II and III SMA patients and conduct a single-center,&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective trial of two-year duration to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of HU.The primary end points are the changes in full-length&#xD;
      SMN expression, SMN protein, motor function and lung function in SMA patients. We also design&#xD;
      a safety monitoring system to investigate the adverse effects and to assure the patients'&#xD;
      safety. We hope we can find and prove the efficacy and safety of HU in SMA patients and set&#xD;
      up a evaluating model for multi-center trials in the future.&#xD;

          -  The subjects (if age &gt; 20 years old) or their parents (if subject age &lt; 20 years old)&#xD;
             shall agree with the trial and have signed the informed consents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subjects shall not have hematological diseases, other severe systemic diseases and&#xD;
             congenital anomalies except for SMA.&#xD;
