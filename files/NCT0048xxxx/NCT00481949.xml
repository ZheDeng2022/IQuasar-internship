    <textblock>
      Monitoring oesophageal pH provides a definitive diagnosis of patients with gastro-oesophageal&#xD;
      reflux disease (GORD), especially those in whom the association between reflux and symptoms&#xD;
      is uncertain and those under consideration for anti-reflux surgery. Standard ambulatory&#xD;
      investigation is normally performed by naso-oesophageal catheter however this is associated&#xD;
      with considerable discomfort and in turn altered behaviour which reduces reflux provoking&#xD;
      activities. Furthermore results of catheter based ambulatory pH studies are compromised by&#xD;
      the high variability of acid exposure in patients with suspected GORD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prolonging pH measurements by the catheter-free Bravo™ system from 24 to 48 and 96hrs&#xD;
      significantly improves the consistency (reliability) and reproducibility of diagnoses based&#xD;
      on oesophageal acid exposure, as well as the ability to associate acid reflux to symptom&#xD;
      episodes. This improves diagnosis especially in those with intermittent symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However pH monitoring does not provide a direct assessment of the underlying pathophysiology.&#xD;
      Incompetence of the oesophago-gastric junction (OGJ) related to disruption of its structure&#xD;
      and function is considered to be the most important cause of GORD. A more relevant assessment&#xD;
      of the reflux barrier may be its distensibility (i.e. the ease with which the OGJ is opened&#xD;
      to allow retrograde passage of gastric contents); however this is not assessed by current&#xD;
      clinical investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endo-FLIP (Crospon Medical Devices) is a new tool which assesses OGJ structure and function,&#xD;
      and appears to provide relevant information regarding its distensibility and competence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study applies to using Endo-Flip to record OGJ distensibility and Bravo to record acid&#xD;
      exposure and symptom association in patients with reflux symptoms. The variability of pH&#xD;
      measurements and symptoms and diagnostic accuracy will be assessed over 96hrs. Endo-FLIP&#xD;
      results will then be compared against Bravo. The outcome of post investigation therapy will&#xD;
      then be compared with Endo-Flip and Bravo results to assess if baseline testing can predict&#xD;
      the outcome of acid suppression therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There is a positive, continuous association between OGJ distensibility measured by&#xD;
           Endo-FLIP on % acid exposure assessed by prolonged Bravo pH monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The results of Endo-FLIP and prolonged Bravo predict treatment outcome of a trial of&#xD;
           proton pump inhibitor therapy&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre study of patients (n=60) referred for investigation of reflux&#xD;
      symptoms. Each patient is investigated by Endo-FLIP™, endoscopy, and 96 hour Bravo™ pH&#xD;
      monitoring off acid suppressant medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After calibration the Endo-FLIP catheter will be inserted orally or nasally until the&#xD;
      liquid-filled compliant bag at the distal segment of the catheter (which houses 16 impedance&#xD;
      sensors) straddles the OGJ. Stepwise bag distensions of 10, 20 and 30 ml will then be&#xD;
      conducted and the associated intra-bag pressure measured. The Endo-FLIP display will allow&#xD;
      real-time imaging of OGJ intra-luminal geometry during distension. Intra-bag pressure and CSA&#xD;
      at the impedance planimetry segment best localized within the OGJ will be reported as mean ±&#xD;
      SEM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An endoscopy will then be performed to confirm the position of the squamo-columnar junction&#xD;
      (SCJ). Images will be taken of the SCJ using standard white light and narrow band imaging.&#xD;
      Then 2 x 2 biopsies from the SCJ and 2 cm proximally will be taken. In conclusion, the Bravo®&#xD;
      delivery system will be passed orally with the patient lying in the left lateral decubitus&#xD;
      position and the capsule will be deployed 6 cm proximal to the SCJ after 1 minute of suction&#xD;
      to stabilize the position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 2 measurements for 48 hours (separated by a battery change) the patient will return the&#xD;
      receiver for the final download and analysis. In addition to pH measurement and symptom&#xD;
      documentation during the 96hr period, pepsin lateral flow tests (Technostics, Hull, UK) will&#xD;
      be performed by collecting expectorated saliva on returning to the lab on day 2 and day 4.&#xD;
      Patients will also be provided with two further kits to be used if and when they experience&#xD;
      symptoms during the 4 day study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome assessment of oesophageal acid exposure will be percent time pH&lt;4 over&#xD;
      the measurement period (e.g. 24, 48 or 96h). Other parameters that will be analysed are the&#xD;
      number of reflux events and the association of these events with symptoms recorded on the&#xD;
      Bravo™ receiver. The presence or absence of pepsin in expectorated saliva will also be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will complete a quality of life assessment (SF-36). Symptom severity will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline and at follow-up and will be documented by validated questionnaires&#xD;
      (Eraflux) before and after resumption of routine acid reducing therapy. Those that undergo&#xD;
      anti-reflux surgery will also be followed up at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LOS distensibility measurements using Endo-FLIP will also be collected in those diagnosed&#xD;
      with achalasia on manometry in order to be used as reference values for the Bravo study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient symptoms will be reviewed at baseline off treatment and again after six weeks of&#xD;
      returning back onto their standard acid reducing medication. Patients referred for&#xD;
      anti-reflux surgery will be reviewed 3 and 6 months after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study of 60 consecutive patients referred for the investigations&#xD;
      typical reflux symptoms (power calculations to allow comparison of 24hr vs. 48hr pH testing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bravo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Retrospective analysis: Formal statistical analysis of the pH and symptom database that&#xD;
           was collected prospectively over the last 4 years (contains &gt;200 Bravo pH studies). This&#xD;
           will establish the correlation between pH results from 24, 48 and 96hr monitoring with&#xD;
           clinical variables (e.g. severity of reflux symptoms, symptom association) and outcome&#xD;
           (e.g. response to PPI, response to fundoplication).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prospective analysis: The day-to-day variability of pH measurements will be calculated.&#xD;
           Patients will be classified by acid exposure (abnormal: &gt;4.2% time pH&lt;4) and symptom&#xD;
           index (positive SI: &gt;50% association of reflux events and any symptom) during each 24hr&#xD;
           and 48hr test period. The reproducibility and accuracy of 24hr vs. 48hr pH testing will&#xD;
           be assessed with 96hr results as the reference standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endo-Flip: Stepwise bag distensions of 10, 20 and 30 ml will be conducted and the associated&#xD;
      intra-bag pressure measured. The Endo-FLIP display will allow real-time imaging of OGJ&#xD;
      intraluminal geometry during distension. The primary outcome assessment of OGJ distensibility&#xD;
      will be the intra-bag pressure and cross-sectional area at the impedance planimetry segment&#xD;
      best localized within the LOS as mean ± SEM for each consecutive volume distension. The&#xD;
      correlation of OGJ distensibility with oesophageal acid exposure will then be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The correlation and interaction between OGJ distensibility, acid exposure, reflux-symptom&#xD;
      association and symptom characteristics (e.g. severity and predominant symptom) at baseline&#xD;
      and on treatment will be assessed by co-variant regression analysis.&#xD;
