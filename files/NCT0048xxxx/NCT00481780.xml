    <textblock>
      Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is a minimally invasive technique for treatment&#xD;
      of superficial femoropopliteal artery (SFA) obstructions or occlusions in patients with&#xD;
      intermittent claudication as well as critical limb ischemia. Initial technical success rates&#xD;
      of above 95% can be achieved and acceptably low rates of complications are consistently&#xD;
      reported in the literature. There is a direct relation between treated vessel length and&#xD;
      patency rates. One year patency of lesions longer than 10cm has only been 22% at one-year&#xD;
      follow up. This major drawback limits a widespread applicability of PTA, and the indication&#xD;
      of PTA particularly in patients with intermittent claudication is discussed&#xD;
      controversially.With the introduction of endovascular stents, the problems of elastic recoil&#xD;
      and residual stenoses due to arterial dissection could be resolved and initial reports of&#xD;
      stenting for the treatment of occlusive atherosclerotic disease of the SFA showed promising&#xD;
      results with primary and secondary patency rates of 87% to 90% after 18 months. However,&#xD;
      subsequent studies demonstrated that exaggerated neo-intimal hyperplasia in the stented&#xD;
      segment frequently leads to instent restenosis. This condition will be of greater importance&#xD;
      with increasing number of stent implantation procedures during the last years. The concept of&#xD;
      cutting balloon seems appealing for this indication, as the balloon-mounted microtomes&#xD;
      guarantee smooth lumen gain within the stent, without the risk of vessel wall perforation.&#xD;
      Initial reports of the use of the cutting balloon for the treatment of occlusive&#xD;
      atherosclerotic disease of the SFA show promising results, indicating that the problems of&#xD;
      elastic recoil and residual stenoses due to arterial dissection might be resolved. The&#xD;
      cutting balloon has four tiny microtomes (&lt; 0.1mm height) on the outside, which cut the&#xD;
      fibrous plaque during expansion of the balloon. Consequently the problem of elastic recoil is&#xD;
      ideally addressed, additionally less trauma is exercised on the vessel wall during dilatation&#xD;
      of the balloon. This might be achieved by a reduction of vessel wall trauma, vessel wall&#xD;
      inflammation and consequently reduced neointimal formation. Although the indications for&#xD;
      CB-PTA in the SFA includes significant residual stenosis or in-stent restenosis, there are&#xD;
      currently no published randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing PTA vs. cutting balloon&#xD;
      angioplasty (CB-PTA) for any specific condition. This lack of data led us to initiate a RCT&#xD;
      comparing primary PTA vs. CB-PTA for treatment of in-stent restenoses in patients with&#xD;
      intermittent claudication or critical limb ischemia with TASC category A-B in the&#xD;
      femoropopliteal artery .&#xD;

      Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is a minimally invasive technique for treatment&#xD;
      of superficial femoropopliteal artery (SFA) obstructions or occlusions in patients with&#xD;
      intermittent claudication as well as critical limb ischemia. Initial technical success rates&#xD;

&#xD;
      With the introduction of endovascular stents, the problems of elastic recoil and residual&#xD;
      stenoses due to arterial dissection could be resolved and initial reports of stenting for the&#xD;
      treatment of occlusive atherosclerotic disease of the SFA showed promising results with&#xD;

      studies demonstrated that exaggerated neo-intimal hyperplasia in the stented segment&#xD;
      frequently leads to instent restenosis. This condition will be of greater importance with&#xD;
      increasing number of stent implantation procedures during the last years. Repeated PTA of&#xD;
      instent restenosis is performed for revascularisation in these patients, but the gold&#xD;
      standard for treatment of instent restenosis is unknown and the rate of recurrence after&#xD;
      repeat treatment of instent restenosis remains high. The concept of cutting balloon seems&#xD;
      appealing for this indication, as the balloon-mounted microtomes guarantee smooth lumen gain&#xD;
      within the stent, without the risk of vessel wall perforation (due to the protecting effect&#xD;
      of the stent as the outer limit for the microtomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial reports of the use of the cutting balloon for the treatment of occlusive&#xD;
      atherosclerotic disease of the SFA show promising results, indicating that the problems of&#xD;
      elastic recoil and residual stenoses due to arterial dissection might be resolved. The&#xD;
      cutting balloon has four tiny microtomes (&lt; 0.1mm height) on the outside, which cut the&#xD;
      fibrous plaque during expansion of the balloon. Consequently the problem of elastic recoil is&#xD;
      ideally addressed, additionally less trauma is exercised on the vessel wall during dilatation&#xD;
      of the balloon. This might be achieved by a reduction of vessel wall trauma, vessel wall&#xD;
      inflammation and consequently reduced neointimal formation. The cutting balloon can be used&#xD;
      for pre-dilatation with diameters slightly less than the target vessel diameter, but still&#xD;
      cuts the fibrous plaque, the desired target vessel diameter is then achieved by final touch&#xD;
      up dilatation with a standard angioplasty balloon. In the coronary arteries the cutting&#xD;
      balloon has been used in randomized studies comparing CB-PTCA to PTCA, as well as in trials&#xD;
      for the treatment of in-stent restenosis. All of these trials demonstrated the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the cutting balloon, only larger randomized trials failed to proof superiority to&#xD;
      conventional PTCA. Data in the peripheral arteries are at least scarce. Although the&#xD;
      indications for CB-PTA in the SFA includes significant residual stenosis or in-stent&#xD;
      restenosis, there are currently no published randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing PTA&#xD;
      vs. cutting balloon angioplasty (CB-PTA) for any specific condition. This lack of data led us&#xD;
      to initiate a RCT comparing primary PTA vs. CB-PTA for treatment of in-stent restenoses in&#xD;
      patients with intermittent claudication or critical limb ischemia with TASC category A-B in&#xD;
      the femoropopliteal artery . The primary endpoint is the occurrence of restenosis as an&#xD;
      ultrasonographic reduction of the vessel lumen diameter &gt;50% within 6 months after&#xD;
      endovascular treatment. In addition, the course of postintervention inflammation as indicated&#xD;
      by serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA) and fibrinogen will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN, INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA. Patients with in-stent restenosis&#xD;
      (ultrasonographic stenosis &gt; 50% of the vessel lumen diameter) after prior PTA and Stent&#xD;
      placement of the SFA will be enrolled to this single-center prospective RCT. The protocol has&#xD;
      to be approved by the institutional ethics committee and all patients have to provide written&#xD;
      informed consent before enrollment. Entry criteria include symptomatic peripheral artery&#xD;
      disease with intermittent claudication (Fontaine stage IIa or b), or critical limb ischemia&#xD;
      related to a recurrent stenosis in a previously stented segment of up to 20 cm length.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria history of intolerance of anti-platelet therapy, or adverse reaction to&#xD;
      heparin, bleeding diathesis, creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dL, hemodialysis, active bacterial infection,&#xD;
      and allergy to contrast media, pregnancy and disability to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW-UP. ABI testing, treadmill exercise, and Duplex-sonography of the treated vessels will&#xD;
      be performed in all patients at 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment. A peak systolic velocity&#xD;
      of ≥ 2.4 was considered indicative of a &gt;50% narrowing and was defined as indicative of a&#xD;
      restenosis10. Reintervention or surgical bypass at the treated segment are also defined as a&#xD;
      restenosis and loss of primary patency. An improvement of at least one Fontaine category&#xD;
      above baseline is used to define clinical success in association with maintenance of at least&#xD;
      a 0.15 increase in exercise ABI from the preprocedure level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COMPLICATIONS are classified as either major or minor (as described in Appendix A). Major&#xD;
      complications are e.g. bleedings at the puncture side with hematoma and a decrease of serum&#xD;
      hemoglobin more than 2 g/dl, loss of stent in the artery , vessel rupture, amputation,&#xD;
      macroembolisation with need for further revascularisation and life threatening bleeding&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY ENDPOINTS. The primary study endpoint is the occurrence of a &gt;50% restenosis at the&#xD;
      treated segment at 6 months post-intervention as determined by duplex ultrasound (in-segment&#xD;
      restenosis). Secondary objectives are primary technical success rates (residual stenosis &lt;30%&#xD;
      without need for secondary stent implantation, primary assisted and secondary patency,&#xD;
      clinical patency, target vessel and target lesion revascularization, and cardiovascular&#xD;
      adverse events at 1, 3, and 6 months after the procedure. Furthermore, the course of&#xD;
      inflammatory parameters will be assessed.&#xD;
