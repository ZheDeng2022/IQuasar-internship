  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study collects information to maintain a database on patients with low-grade ovarian or&#xD;
      peritoneal tumors. Collecting information about the type of cancer and treatment, as well as&#xD;
      details about follow-up care, may help researchers learn and better understand these tumor&#xD;
      types and help develop better treatments for them.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To collect, both prospectively and retrospectively, data on disease characterization,&#xD;
      treatment, and outcomes for approximately 1600 female patients with low-grade ovarian and&#xD;
      peritoneal tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To organize clinical information in order to support multifaceted queries of patient&#xD;
      characteristics, treatment, and disease outcome data and to facilitate correlation of these&#xD;
      characteristics with patient outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To have a single data repository, kept on a secure platform that will integrate clinical&#xD;
      information and research findings and serve as a secure archive for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To obtain and store human tumor samples in the form of blocks or slides for the purpose of&#xD;
      establishing a tumor bank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' medical records are reviewed for retrospective and prospective data collection.&#xD;
      Patients may also have residual tissue samples collected and stored.&#xD;
