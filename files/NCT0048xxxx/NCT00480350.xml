  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV infection is a growing problem in Israel with over 4000 known patients who are either&#xD;
      infected with the virus or have developed AIDS. Patients are usually followed for years until&#xD;
      they develop an increase in their viral load (HIV-1 RNA) or their CD4 + cells decline. At&#xD;
      this point, patients are usually treated with Highly Active, Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART).&#xD;
      The mainstay of response to such treatment is the lowering of viral load and increase in CD4+&#xD;
      cells. Food supplements for HIV patients have been given in several studies, with&#xD;
      controversial results. A meta-analysis published recently [1] assessed whether micronutrient&#xD;
      supplements are effective in reducing morbidity and mortality in adults and children with HIV&#xD;
      infection. They recommended supporting the current WHO recommendations to promote and support&#xD;
      adequate dietary intake of micronutrients wherever possible. We expect to enroll 140 subjects&#xD;
      in this randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Seventy subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      in the rice-supplement arm and 70 subjects in the control group, which will receive&#xD;
      supplemental, flavored dextrose to their current medical treatment. The treatment duration is&#xD;
      24 weeks with follow-up at 36 weeks from enrollment. The target population is HIV-1 infected&#xD;
      individuals who may be either on anti-retroviral therapy or not on therapy. Subjects must be&#xD;
      with either CD4+ cells are &lt;500 cells/mm3, or HIV plasma RNA level is &gt; 5000 copies/ml. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of food supplementation versus a&#xD;
      flavored-dextrose supplement with respect to increment of patient CD4+ cell count from&#xD;
      baseline at 24 weeks, or virological response defined as lowering of plasma HIV-1 RNA and&#xD;
      immunologic response.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with documented HIV-1 infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female ages &gt; 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have given informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may either receive or not receive antiretroviral therapy at the time of&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Plasma HIV-1 RNA higher than 5000 copies/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient CD4+ cell count less than 500 cells/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who can comply with protocol requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients incapable of oral intake&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are allergic to rice&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active drug abuse which, in the opinion of the investigator, is expected to interfere&#xD;
             with the subject's ability to adhere to the study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active, clinically-significant disease or life-threatening disease that would&#xD;
             compromise the subject's safety or outcome of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical or psychiatric condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, could&#xD;
             compromise the subject's safety or adherence to the trial protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have started their anti-HIV treatment within less than 3 months from&#xD;
             inclusion in the study. However, patients who have changed anti-HIV medication but&#xD;
             have initiated therapy more than 3 months before inclusion will be eligible for the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients known to suffer from diabetes mellitus&#xD;
