    <textblock>
      High Resolution Manometry (HRM) is a new advance in oesophageal measurement that permits the&#xD;
      acquisition of pressure data through the entire length of the oesophagus over time via&#xD;
      closely spaced sensors that continuously record the motor activity of the oesophagus. This&#xD;
      allows not only contractile pressure to be measured, but also the coordination&#xD;
      (proximal-distal) of contractions and the development of effective intra-bolus pressure (the&#xD;
      force that drives bolus movement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that (1) there will be a progressive increase in peristaltic pressure&#xD;
      and decrease in velocity as the subjects move from the upright, through the supine to the&#xD;
      upside down position and (2) the increase in pressure will be most evident in the&#xD;
      mid-oesophagus at the transition zone between the striated and the smooth muscle&#xD;
      contractions.&#xD;

      Introduction High Resolution Manometry (HRM) is an advance in oesophageal measurement that&#xD;
      permits the acquisition of pressure data through the entire length of the oesophagus over&#xD;
      time via closely spaced sensors that continuously record the motor activity of the&#xD;
      oesophagus. This information can then be analysed either as conventional line plots or as a&#xD;
      spatiotemporal plot, a compact, visually intuitive presentation of oesophageal pressure&#xD;
      activity.1 This process has been quantified and verified in 75 normal volunteers.2 Increasing&#xD;
      evidence suggests that HRM is a more sensitive and accurate means of assessing oesophageal&#xD;
      function compared to conventional manometry.1 3 Compared to conventional manometry, HRM&#xD;
      increases the accuracy with which the success of bolus transport can be predicted.1 This is&#xD;
      important because oesophageal symptoms are more closely linked to impaired bolus transport&#xD;
      than conventional pressure measurements per se.4&#xD;
&#xD;
      The additional information provided by HRM and the presentation of data as a spatiotemporal&#xD;
      plot enable investigators to study the pressure activity in the oesophagus during normal&#xD;
      eating behaviour for the first time. This study will assess the effects of position, bolus&#xD;
      volume and consistency (liquid, solid). In addition, pressure activity during a standardized&#xD;
      test meal will be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the oesophageal response due to these 'physiologic challenges' is likely to be&#xD;
      of clinical importance because most patients complain of swallowing problems, regurgitation&#xD;
      or chest pain during such events and in the postprandial period. This is in contrast to&#xD;
      standard manometry protocols that include the intake only of individual water, viscous fluid&#xD;
      (e.g. yoghurt) or small, solid bolus swallows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy controls will be studies to provide normal data. Patients referred for investigation&#xD;
      of oesophageal symptoms will be studied to assess whether physiologic challenge increases the&#xD;
      ability to differentiate this group from normal controls, explain patient symptoms and&#xD;
      increase diagnostic yield.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effects of Position It is well known that transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations&#xD;
      (TLOSRs) and reflux events are suppressed in the supine position in both healthy volunteers&#xD;
      and in patients with mild-moderate reflux disease.7 The effects of position on oesophageal&#xD;
      peristalsis and lower oesophageal sphincter pressure assessed by conventional manometry have&#xD;
      been less consistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently HRM and video-fluoroscopy has been applied to study the effect of position and bolus&#xD;
      consistency on oesophageal function.8 No effect of position on LOS pressure was found in&#xD;
      these thin, healthy volunteers. In contrast peristaltic pressure increased and velocity&#xD;
      decreased as the subject moved from the upright to the supine position. Similarly,&#xD;
      peristaltic pressure increased and velocity decreased progressively as the subject took dry,&#xD;
      water and solid swallows.8 These observations confirm combined manometry and impedance&#xD;
      studies that show oesophageal function is not stereotyped but responds to the workload&#xD;
      required for bolus transport. 5 67&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although findings are consistent for a given individual, variation in peristaltic contractile&#xD;
      pressure is high and the correlation between peristaltic pressure and the success of bolus&#xD;
      transport in healthy volunteers and patients is weak. Rather, preliminary observations by Fox&#xD;
      et al. suggest that successful bolus transport, especially for solids, may depend more on&#xD;
      effective coordination between proximal (striated) and mid-distal (smooth muscle)&#xD;
      contractions than increased peristaltic pressure. In particular the prompt response of the&#xD;
      mid-oesophageal segment appears to be linked to successful bolus transport through the&#xD;
      oesophagus.8&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swallowed material can be transported successfully through the oesophagus in the upside down&#xD;
      position. With the use of HRM, a detailed analysis of oesophageal peristalsis and bolus&#xD;
      transport from the pharynx to the stomach is possible. We propose to explore the effect of 3&#xD;
      different positions (upright, supine and 60o head down) on the swallow of liquid and viscous&#xD;
      material in healthy volunteers. Use of the extreme head down position provides a classical&#xD;
      physiologic challenge that will highlight the oesophageal response to increased work against&#xD;
      gravity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further events that increase oesophageal workload include the rapid intake of large volumes&#xD;
      of fluid (i.e. free drinking) and the intake of solid food (i.e. test meal). Following the&#xD;
      studies of position on oesophageal function, we will then assess the effect of drinking a&#xD;
      standardized fluid load by multiple repeated swallows and intake of a standardized test meal&#xD;
      on oesophageal and lower oesophageal sphincter function. Observations will be continued for&#xD;
      20minutes after ingestion to assess also oesophago-gastric function in the postprandial&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis The driving force developed by oesophageal motor function 'increases'&#xD;
      progressively with workload (e.g. increasing inclination, solid food) in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #1: This 'increase in driving force' will be more apparent and consistent as an&#xD;
      increased in coordination of peristaltic contractions and development of intra-bolus pressure&#xD;
      (i.e. endpoints assessed only by HRM) than effects on contractile pressure (i.e.; endpoints&#xD;
      assessed also by conventional manometry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated swallowing during drinking suppresses oesophageal contractility. Hypothesis #2:&#xD;
      Intermittent, coordinated and powerful peristaltic waves will be observed during a test meal&#xD;
      and failure of this activity will result in raised intra-bolus pressure and symptoms&#xD;
      (dysphagia, regurgitation, chest pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #3: Observations during and after a test meal will increase diagnostic yield for&#xD;
      rumination and reflux related symptoms during stationary studies.&#xD;
