    <textblock>
      The Purpose of this trial is to evaluate the use of a cross-over trial design in an&#xD;
      osteoarthritis population. We will determine the inter- and intra-subject variability in&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (OA) endpoints and evaluate if efficacy can be detected by measuring OA&#xD;
      endpoints following treatment with 2 different types of analgesics in a crossover study of&#xD;
      this design.&#xD;

      Methodology study to evaluate the use of a cross over design and gait analysis. The study was&#xD;
      terminated by mutual consent with the study site at a meeting on the 1 April 2009, because of&#xD;
      slow recruitment due to a high screen fail rate. The study was not stopped for safety&#xD;
      reasons.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis Index Pain Subscale Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire, which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis (OA of the hip and/or knee). The index consists of 24 questions (5 pain, 2 stiffness, and 17 physical function). The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to OA of to be replaced/replaced index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. The WOMAC pain subscale score for each question ranges from 0 (minimum) to 4 (maximum), higher scores signifies worse pain. Pain subscale total score ranges from 0 to 20, with higher scores indicating worse pain.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis Index Physical Function Subscale Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire, which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis (OA of the hip and/or knee). Physical function refers to participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. The WOMAC physical function subscale is a 17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in in the study joint during past 48 hours. The WOMAC physical function subscale score for each question ranges from 0 (minimum) to 4 (maximum), higher scores signifies worse physical function. Physical function subscale scores range from 0 to 68, where higher scores indicated more difficulty in performing daily activities.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis Index Stiffness Subscale Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire, which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis (OA of the hip and/or knee). Stiffness was defined as a sensation of decreased ease of movement in study joint. The WOMAC stiffness subscale is a 2-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of stiffness experienced due to OA in the in the study joint during the past 48 hours. The WOMAC stiffness subscale score for each question ranges from 0 (minimum) to 4 (maximum), higher scores signifies worse stiffness. The stiffness subscale score ranges from 0 to 8, where higher scores indicated worse stiffness.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire, which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis (OA of the hip and/or knee). The WOMAC composite index was the sum of 24 individual questions regarding subscales of pain, stiffness and physical function (for each item score range: 0 [minimum] to 4 [maximum], higher score indicating worse study joint condition). Total score was sum of the 3 subscale scores, giving a possible overall score range of 0 (minimum) to 96 (maximum). Higher score indicating the worse level of pain, stiffness and physical function.</description>

    <description>The PGAAC is self-administered measure in which participants answered the following question: &quot;considering all the ways the OA in your signal knee affects you, how are you doing today?&quot;. Participants rated their condition using the following scale: 1= very good (no symptoms and no limitation of normal activities); 2= good (mild symptoms and no limitation of normal activities); 3= fair (moderate symptoms and limitation of some normal activities); 4= poor (severe symptoms and inability to carry out most normal activities); 5= very poor (very severe symptoms which are intolerable and inability to carry out all normal activities).

        <description>WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire, which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis (OA of the hip and/or knee). The index consists of 24 questions (5 pain, 2 stiffness, and 17 physical function). The WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to OA of to be replaced/replaced index joint (knee or hip) during past 48 hours. The WOMAC pain subscale score for each question ranges from 0 (minimum) to 4 (maximum), higher scores signifies worse pain. Pain subscale total score ranges from 0 to 20, with higher scores indicating worse pain.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis Index Physical Function Subscale Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>WOMAC: Self-administered, disease-specific questionnaire, which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain, stiffness and physical function in participants with osteoarthritis (OA of the hip and/or knee). Physical function refers to participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. The WOMAC physical function subscale is a 17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in in the study joint during past 48 hours. The WOMAC physical function subscale score for each question ranges from 0 (minimum) to 4 (maximum), higher scores signifies worse physical function. Physical function subscale scores range from 0 to 68, where higher scores indicated more difficulty in performing daily activities.</description>
