  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been found that many breast cancers are hormone dependent and that hormonal therapy by&#xD;
      estrogen suppression such as ovarian ablation, tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitor has proven&#xD;
      beneficial in both adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings. Zoladex, a kind of luitinizing hormone&#xD;
      releasing hormone analogue, can offer efficient estrogen suppression as well. It can induce&#xD;
      reversible amenorrhea and the clinical effect is similar to ovarian ablation. Some studies&#xD;
      have demonstrated the efficacy of zoladex in treating pre and perimenopausal hormone&#xD;
      dependent breast cancer in both adjuvant and metastatic settings. Few data is available on&#xD;
      Zoladex in neoadjuvant treatment for breast cancer In our departments, neoadjuvant CEF&#xD;
      regimen is of general practice, and a preliminary study is designed to investigate whether&#xD;
      adding Zoladex into neoadjuvant CEF could further improve results in hormone responsive&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
