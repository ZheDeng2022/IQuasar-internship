      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a solvent used in many medical and industrial processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TCE is a carcinogen (causes cancer) in rats, but its carcinogenicity in humans is&#xD;
           unclear. There is some evidence of increased liver and kidney cancers and of an&#xD;
           association with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in studies of workers exposed to TCE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The carcinogenicity and regulation of TCE is a matter of continuing debate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if TCE exposure is associated with higher levels of genetic aberrations in&#xD;
           certain white blood cells called lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if TCE exposure affects lymphocyte subsets and levels of certain hormones&#xD;
           called cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility: Workers exposed to two different levels of exposure to TCE and unexposed workers&#xD;
      in Guangdong Province, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  45 workers exposed to more than 25 parts per million (ppm) TCE, 30 workers exposed to&#xD;
           from 10 to less than 25 ppm TCE and 45 unexposed workers will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects wear small instruments at work that measure chemicals in the air for 1 or 2&#xD;
           days during the 2-week study period. Exposed workers also wear several small skin&#xD;
           patches on one of the two days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects provide blood and urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects answer a questionnaire about work, smoking and drinking, use of medicines,&#xD;
           medical history, general health, hobbies, and exposure to radiation and exposure to&#xD;
           various substances at home.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trichloroethylene (TCE) is an industrial solvent used in degreasing, dry cleaning, and&#xD;
      numerous other medical and industrial processes. It is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant&#xD;
      of drinking water and is present in many EPA Superfund sites. TCE is a rodent carcinogen but&#xD;
      its carcinogenicity in humans is unclear. There is some evidence for an elevation in liver&#xD;
      and kidney cancers and somewhat more convincing evidence of an association with non-Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphoma (NHL) in epidemiological studies of occupationally exposed cohorts. Overall, the&#xD;
      carcinogenicity of TCE and its regulation is a matter of continuing debate despite an&#xD;
      extensive database of in vitro and in vivo animal studies and several cohort and case-control&#xD;
      studies. IARC categorizes TCE as a probable human carcinogen. In order to address questions&#xD;
      about TCE's potential carcinogenicity and mechanism of action in humans, we propose to&#xD;
      conduct a cross-sectional study of early biologic effect biomarkers of genotoxicity and&#xD;
      immunotoxicity in 45 workers exposed to greater than 25 ppm TCE, 30 workers exposed to 10-25&#xD;
      ppm TCE, and 45 unexposed controls in Guangdong Province, China. We will assess TCE exposure&#xD;
      level quantitatively, collect other exposure information through a questionnaire, collect&#xD;
      biological samples, and assay a series of biomarkers of susceptibility, intermediate and&#xD;
      early biologic effects. Our primary goal is to determine if TCE exposure increases&#xD;
      chromosomal aberrations in peripheral lymphocytes, with a secondary goal of determining if&#xD;
      TCE alters levels of key cytokines in plasma and changes lymphocyte subset ratios. In&#xD;
      addition, our collaborators at UC Berkeley will apply a new generation of cytogenetic and&#xD;
      molecular techniques to study TCE's ability to cause specific types of chromosomal&#xD;
      aberrations that have been associated with NHL and related hematological malignancies as well&#xD;
      as the impact of TCE on mRNA expression and the proteome. The work will compliment previous&#xD;
      and ongoing OEEB studies of populations exposed to TCE and has the potential to make an&#xD;
      important contribution to what little is known about the early biologic effects of TCE in&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;

        We carried out a cross-sectional study of workers currently exposed to TCE in the six study&#xD;
        factories with TCE cleaning operations and unexposed controls. Control workers were&#xD;
        enrolled from two clothes manufacturing factories, one food production factory and a&#xD;
        hospital that did not use TCE and were in the same geographic region as the factories that&#xD;
        used TCE. Exclusion criteria for both TCE-exposed and control workers were history of&#xD;
        cancer, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, as well as previous occupations with notable&#xD;
        exposure to benzene, butadiene, styrene and/or ionizing radiation.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A total of 45 workers exposed to greater than 25 ppm TCE, 30 workers exposed from 10 to&#xD;
        less than 25 ppm TCE, and 45 unexposed workers will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will identify 45 workers from 3 factories who are exposed to greater than 25 ppm TCE.&#xD;
        Our colleagues at the Guangdong NPCC will visit potential study factories and carry out air&#xD;
        measurements for TCE, epichlorhydrin, methylene chloride, perchloroethylene and benzene.&#xD;
        Factories will be selected that use only TCE for degreasing processes, have minimal&#xD;
        co-exposures present in the same part of the workplace where TCE is used, and have used a&#xD;
        stable manufacturing process for the past five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Workers will be chosen who work in part of the factory with TCE exposure, have worked for&#xD;
        at least one year in the factory doing the same job in the same part of the manufacturing&#xD;
        process, and have not been exposed to other genotoxic, hematotoxic, or immunotoxic&#xD;
        compounds in any workplace. We will enroll 45 controls, who have no history of occupational&#xD;
        exposure to TCE or to any other genotoxic, hematotoxic or immunotoxic chemicals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
