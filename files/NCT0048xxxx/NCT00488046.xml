  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past decade, avian influenza (AI) has become a major health concern. The development&#xD;
      of a safe and effective vaccine against H5N1 infection is important. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to determine the safety of a new AI vaccine in healthy adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization, the current pandemic risk associated with avian&#xD;
      influenza H5N1 infection is serious, as an increasing number of humans are infected.&#xD;
      Currently, H5N1 influenza transmission occurs in humans when they are exposed through direct&#xD;
      contact to infected poultry or surfaces and objects contaminated by infected poultry feces. A&#xD;
      pandemic occurs when a new influenza subtype emerges that infects humans, causes serious&#xD;
      illness, and spreads easily among humans. The development of a safe and effective vaccine is&#xD;
      necessary, should a pandemic occur. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of a live, attenuated A1 virus vaccine, H5N1 (6-2) AA ca Recombinant (A/Hong&#xD;
      Kong/213/2003 x A/AnnArbor/6/60 ca).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will last approximately 16 weeks. Participation in this study includes a hospital&#xD;
      stay in an isolation unit at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. All participants will&#xD;
      receive two doses of vaccine in nasal spray form, at study entry and sometime between 4 and 8&#xD;
      weeks after initial vaccination. Participants will be admitted to the isolation unit 2 days&#xD;
      prior to each vaccination. A targeted physical exam will occur daily following each&#xD;
      vaccination until discharge. Participants will not be discharged until nasal washes are&#xD;
      negative. Vital signs measurement will be done at least twice daily for the duration of the&#xD;
      inpatient stay. A follow-up outpatient visit will occur approximately 4 weeks following each&#xD;
      vaccination. Blood and urine collection will occur at selected timepoints throughout the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
