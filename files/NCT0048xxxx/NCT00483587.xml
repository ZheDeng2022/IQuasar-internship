      Rationale: A safety and dose defining study in which the investigators hypothesize that in&#xD;
      patients with acute coronary syndrome without ST-elevation (NSTEMI) treatment with heme&#xD;
      arginate results in better clinical outcome by inducing the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: 1) Is induction of HO-1 and its degradation products, especially bilirubin, safe&#xD;
      in patients with an acute coronary syndrome without ST-elevation; 2) What is the optimal&#xD;
      effective dose to administer in patients with NSTEMI; 3) Are HO-1 and its degradation&#xD;
      products endogenously activated in patients with acute coronary syndrome; 4) Does treatment&#xD;
      with heme arginate result in a less cardiac damage; 5) Which other cardioprotecting pathways&#xD;
      are activated by administration of heme arginate?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Male and female patients with confirmed acute coronary syndrome without&#xD;
      ST-elevation, between 18 - 80 yr old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: 10 patients receive a single administration of heme arginate (3 mg/kg),&#xD;
      administered intravenously in 15 minutes directly after admission; 10 patients receive two&#xD;
      administrations of heme arginate (3 mg/kg) on day 0 and 1; 10 patients receive three&#xD;
      administrations of heme arginate (3 mg/kg) on day 0, 1 and 2 after admission, administered&#xD;
      intravenously in 15 minutes. To determine endogenous levels of HO-1 and time course of HO-1&#xD;
      activation after NSTEMI, blood is drawn and the same assays are performed in 15 patients with&#xD;
      NSTEMI. As controls for the blood tests, blood is drawn and the same assays are performed in&#xD;
      15 patients with non-typical angina pectoris in whom no cardiac disease could be detected&#xD;
      from the investigators out-patient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is the incidence rate of adverse events&#xD;
      between the three treated groups. This includes hemodynamic monitoring, rhythm monitoring and&#xD;
      biochemical and hematological difference between the three treated groups. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints are the differences from baseline between heme arginate treated groups in activity&#xD;
      of the HO-1 pathway, including, but not limited to, HO-1 activity, free heme, bilirubin&#xD;
      (direct and indirect) levels, serum ferritin, and carbon monoxide (CO). Furthermore,&#xD;
      differences between heme arginate treated groups on NTproBNP, CK-MB and Troponin T and&#xD;
      difference between heme arginate treated subjects in LVEF measured by echocardiography, 3 and&#xD;
      7 days and 6 months after NSTEMI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The interventional part of this study is a single centre safety and dose defining pilot study&#xD;
      in which patients are allocated to heme arginate infusion for 1 day (hem-1d), heme arginate&#xD;
      infusion for 2 days, or heme arginate infusion during 3 days (hem-3d) in consecutive order.&#xD;
      So, the three patient groups consist of three intervention groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based upon the pharmacokinetic data in porphyria patients (3 mg/kg/day for 4-7 days), the&#xD;
      investigators rationalize that 3 fixed doses of heme arginate will be the optimal dose to&#xD;
      counter attack the acute phase after NSTEMI. Longer infusion of heme arginate seems at this&#xD;
      moment not rational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will first administer in 10 patients 1 dose of heme arginate (hem-1d, day&#xD;
      0) to assess safety. If safety is assured in the hem-1d group, 10 patients will receive two&#xD;
      days of heme arginate infusion (day 0 and 1). After this group is completed and safety is&#xD;
      assured, the third group (n = 10) will receive heme arginate infusion in three consecutive&#xD;
      days after NSTEMI (day 0, 1 and 2 after admission).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heme arginate is considered safe in NSTEMI patients if no adverse events occur in the&#xD;
      consecutive groups. To assess safety during the course of the study the following possible&#xD;
      events are monitored:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  New onset of myocardial infarction with ST-elevation (STEMI);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac decompensation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sustained ventricular arrhythmia requiring defibrillation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All cause death;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drop of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) of more than 20 mmHg (MAP is defined as 2 x&#xD;
           diastolic blood pressure + 1 x systolic blood pressure divided by 3 (MAP = 2 x Pdias +&#xD;
           Psys / 3));&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eosinophilia (&gt; 0.5 x 109/l) in combination with fever and/or rash and/or shivering or&#xD;
           anaphylactic shock;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine above 300 µmol/l);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ASAT or ALAT are elevated to at least 3 times the upper limit of normal;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe hematological abnormalities, defined as thrombocytopenia &lt; 40 x 109/l,&#xD;
           leucocytopenia &lt; 2.0 x 109/l, or hemolytic anemia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) elevated to at least 3 times the upper&#xD;
           limit of normal;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe bleeding, defined as requiring blood transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event one of the above mentioned effects occur, the investigators will report this to&#xD;
      the METC and deliberate before continuing the study. If, after deliberation with the METC,&#xD;
      heme arginate turns out not to be safe in NSTEMI patients, the inclusion of patients will be&#xD;
      terminated immediately and all patients who already received heme arginate will be followed&#xD;
      thoroughly. The investigator will take care that all subjects are kept informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of each group the METC will be informed about the progress of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of allocation, all patients will receive care as usual according to&#xD;
      national/international guidelines 79, 80.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with NSTEMI, admitted to the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), are asked&#xD;
      to participate in the study and will sign informed consent. After signing consent, blood is&#xD;
      drawn via venipuncture for baseline data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, and 180 after NSTEMI blood is drawn for additional measurements.&#xD;
      Echocardiography is performed to determine left ventricular function, including left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), after 3 days, 7 days and 180 days. To assess the&#xD;
      possible anti-hypertensive component of heme arginate treatment, 24 hour ambulatory blood&#xD;
      pressure recordings will be conducted at day 7 and 6 months after NSTEMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following components of the heme pathway will be determined: free heme, hemoglobin,&#xD;
      ferritin, carbon monoxide, heme oxygenase (HO)-1, biliverdin, and direct and non direct&#xD;
      bilirubin. To monitor safety, the investigators will evaluate liver enzymes (ALAT, ASAT,&#xD;
      γ-GT, AP, LDH), clotting times (INR, APTT, PT), electrolytes (Na, K, Cl, Mg) and furthermore&#xD;
      regular hematology (Hb, Ht, thrombocytes) and chemistry (Blood Urea Nitrogen, Creatinine, CK,&#xD;
      CK-MB, Troponin T, Brain Natriuretic Peptide, VEGF and Erythropoietin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will also be asked for blood to assess DNA polymorphisms affecting HO-1&#xD;
      activity, such as HO-1 polymorphisms, and for assessment of quality of endothelial progenitor&#xD;
      cells (EPCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total number included patients into the interventional part of this study will be 30&#xD;
      patients. Follow-up is completed 6 months after inclusion of the last patient. The&#xD;
      investigators estimate inclusion will take approximately 6 months. The study duration&#xD;
      therefore comes to a total of at least 12 months. The maximal duration of the study will be&#xD;
      18 months, including analysis of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, two groups of patients will be asked in the non-interventional part of this&#xD;
      study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The investigators hypothesize that due to the acute coronary syndrome HO-1 is activated,&#xD;
           but at too low levels to have clinical benefit. To determine the time course for HO-1&#xD;
           activity and its degradation products after NSTEMI, the investigators will draw blood&#xD;
           and perform all the same assays in 15 patients with NSTEMI as described above. It is not&#xD;
           possible to use the same assays executed in the interventional part of this study, for&#xD;
           heme arginate infusion will interfere with the outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. As healthy controls for the blood tests and to gain insight in normal levels of HO-1&#xD;
           activity, the investigators will draw blood and do the same baseline assays in 15&#xD;
           patients with non-typical angina pectoris in whom no cardiac disease could be detected&#xD;
           from our out-patient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these patients will be asked to participate in the non-intervention part of this study,&#xD;
      receive a separate information letter and will sign an informed consent form. If consent is&#xD;
      given, blood is drawn via venipuncture.&#xD;
