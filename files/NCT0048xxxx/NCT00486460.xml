  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive disease with an extremely poor prognosis. It is the forth&#xD;
      leading cause of cancer-related fatalities, with an estimated one-year and five-year survival&#xD;
      rate of 21% and 5%, respectively. Despite recent progress, the median survival time is 6-10&#xD;
      months for patients with locally advanced disease and 3-6 months for metastatic disease (1).&#xD;
      The anti-metabolite gemcitabine has become the standard chemotherapy for locally advanced and&#xD;
      metastatic pancreatic cancer, after demonstrating an improved rate of clinical benefit&#xD;
      response and an overall survival advantage over 5-FU (2). In addition to its clinical&#xD;
      effectiveness gemcitabine has a manageable toxicity profile, making it an attractive agent to&#xD;
      investigate in combination with newer agents. Series of phase III trials were conducted&#xD;
      examining the efficacy of the combination of gemcitabine and a second cytotoxic agent,&#xD;
      including 5-FU, cisplatin, oxaliplatin and irinotecan. These gemcitabine doublets&#xD;
      demonstrated no survival advantage over single-agent gemcitabine (3-6). However, the&#xD;
      rationale for continuing to study gemcitabine-based combinations remains compelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is a natural compound derived from the rhizome of Curcuma Longa,&#xD;
      an East Indian plant, commonly called turmeric. It has been shown to possess potent&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties, for which it has a long history of dietary&#xD;
      use as a food additive. Curcumin has also a potent anti-proliferative effects against a&#xD;
      variety of cancer cell lines in vitro, which stem from its ability to modulate many&#xD;
      intracellular signal transduction pathways (7). Human phase I-II studies found curcumin to be&#xD;
      safe, and indicated no dose-limiting toxicity when taken by mouth at doses up to 10 g/day (8,&#xD;
      9). This data, together with the dismal therapeutic options available for pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      patients, suggest that curcumin warrants investigation in this setting. Investigators from MD&#xD;
      Anderson Cancer Center and Rambam Medical Center in Haifa, have recently initiated,&#xD;
      separately, a phase II study of single agent Curcumin in patients with pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the lessons learned from cancer research in recent decades is that combination&#xD;
      strategies can provide dramatic improvement in a therapy's safety and efficacy over&#xD;
      mono-therapeutic regiments, especially if the combined drugs differ in their mode of action.&#xD;
      In a recent paper that was accepted for publication we demonstrated, in vitro, the mechanism,&#xD;
      clinical importance and implications of a novel combinatorial therapy, of celecoxib and&#xD;
      curcumin, that was discovered in our lab, in inhibiting the growth of several pancreatic cell&#xD;
      lines. P-34 (expressing high levels of COX -2), MiaPaca (Expressing low levels of COX-2) and&#xD;
      Panc-1 (no expression of COX -2) cell lines were exposed to different concentrations of&#xD;
      celecoxib (0-40µM), curcumin (0-20µM) and their combination. In P-34 cells, curcumin&#xD;
      synergistically potentiated the inhibitory effect of celecoxib on cell growth. The growth&#xD;
      inhibition was associated with inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These experiments further demonstrate, for the first time, that the combination effect is&#xD;
      correlated with synergistic augmentation of apoptosis and involves down-regulation of COX-2&#xD;
      protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study evaluates gemcitabine in combination with curcumin and celecoxib for&#xD;
      patients with pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
