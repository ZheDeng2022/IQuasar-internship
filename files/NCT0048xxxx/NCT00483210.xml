      Resistance to the hypoglycemic action of insulin develops within 7 days of bedrest in young,&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. We propose that the same event occurs in elderly individuals confined to&#xD;
      bed, that alterations in lipid metabolism are, at least in part, responsible for the insulin&#xD;
      resistance associated with bedrest, and that the accumulation of intracellular triglyceride&#xD;
      (TG) in liver and muscle will play a role in impairing insulin action. Further, we propose&#xD;
      that the PPARα (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Alpha) agonist fenofibrate will&#xD;
      increase tissue fatty acid disposal by activating mitochondrial oxidative capacity, thereby&#xD;
      improving insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will investigate a series of specific hypotheses designed to examine the role of altered&#xD;
      lipid metabolism in the development of insulin-resistance associated with bedrest. Further,&#xD;
      since inactivity is likely a principal factor in the development of insulin resistance in the&#xD;
      elderly, the response to the inactivity imposed by bedrest represents an acceleration of the&#xD;
      normal development of insulin resistance in elderly individuals. Therefore, the results of&#xD;
      this study will also be pertinent to the understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the&#xD;
      natural development of insulin resistance in free-living elderly.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The accumulation of intracellular lipid reflects a dysregulation of tissue fatty acid&#xD;
      metabolism involving abnormal relationships between tissue fatty acid uptake and oxidation.&#xD;
      It has been postulated that such dysregulation of lipid metabolism causes insulin resistance&#xD;
      as a direct consequence of the accumulated intracellular triglyceride (TG), or that the&#xD;
      increased intracellular TG reflects an increase in active products of fatty acids, such as&#xD;
      diacylglycerol, that inhibit the insulin signaling pathway. We recently found that both&#xD;
      muscle and liver intracellular TG concentrations were elevated in more than one-half of&#xD;
      otherwise healthy elderly individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that an increase in tissue lipids in the elderly reflects altered tissue lipid&#xD;
      metabolism that puts them at high risk for the development of insulin resistance with&#xD;
      bedrest. Further, we propose that the PPARα (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor&#xD;
      Alpha) agonist fenofibrate will increase tissue fatty acid disposal by activating&#xD;
      mitochondrial oxidative capacity, thereby improving insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will examine the role of alterations in lipid metabolism in the development of insulin&#xD;
      resistance that occurs with bedrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A total of 40 elderly subjects ranging in age from 60-85 will be studied. Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of two groups: 1) 10 days of bedrest or 2) 10 days of bedrest plus&#xD;
      fenofibrate. Each of the subjects will complete a 5- day diet stabilization period and have a&#xD;
      metabolic infusion study on day 5, followed by 10 days of bedrest and a metabolic study on&#xD;
      day 18. This will be followed by a 3 week rehabilitation program. Pre-test and post bedrest&#xD;
      measurements include body composition by DEXA, intracellular TG measurements by MRS, strength&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will provide insight into the mechanisms responsible for the development of&#xD;
      insulin resistance with inactivity and strategies for ameliorating this response.&#xD;
