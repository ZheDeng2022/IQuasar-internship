      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if RadiaPlexRx Hydrogel can reduce the development of grade 2 or higher&#xD;
      radiation dermatitis in breast cancer from adjuvant radiation when compared to a&#xD;
      petroleum-based gel (Aquaphor) commonly used as best supportive care.&#xD;

      The Study Gels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      RadiaPlexRx (requires a prescription) and Aquaphor (over-the-counter) are both gels that are&#xD;
      designed to treat irradiated (received radiation) breast skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These 2 gels contain different ingredients that may make one gel better than the other to&#xD;
      treat irradiated breast skin. RadiaPlexRx contains hyaluronic acid (an ingredient found&#xD;
      naturally in skin), aloe vera, and other ingredients that help the skin heal. Aquaphor is&#xD;
      made of mostly petroleum that helps protect the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application of Study Gels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you decide to participate in this study, the following steps will be taken:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be given detailed instructions on how to apply both of the gels. You should not&#xD;
           apply other gels or lotions on the areas of skin where you will be instructed to apply&#xD;
           the study gels, unless you are instructed to do so by the treating doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive a supply of both gels (in tubes) with enough to last for the length of&#xD;
           your treatment. You will know which gel is which, but each gel will be labeled with&#xD;
           &quot;outer&quot; or &quot;inner&quot; so that you will know which gel to use on which side. You should not&#xD;
           tell your treating doctor which side of the breast skin is being treated with which gel&#xD;
           so that a fair comparison of the gels can be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will apply 1 gel to the outer side of the irradiated breast skin and the other gel&#xD;
           to the inner side of the irradiated breast skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you experience any kind of allergic reaction (such as a rash) to the study gels, you&#xD;
           should notify the study doctor or study staff immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule for Study Gels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will need to follow the schedule for applying the gels as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will need to apply both gels starting 1 day before the start of radiation&#xD;
           treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will then need to apply both gels for 6 weeks during radiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the study period (1 day before the start of radiation treatment, during 6 weeks&#xD;
           of radiation treatment), you will need to apply both gels 3 times (in the morning,&#xD;
           afternoon, and evening just before going to sleep) each day at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the days that you receive radiation treatment, you will be asked to apply the&#xD;
           gels immediately after you receive your radiation treatment. This will count as 1 of the&#xD;
           3 daily gel applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have the following tests done during your clinic visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three (3) sets of photos of your breast skin will be taken (before radiation starts and&#xD;
           during Weeks 3 and 6 of radiation therapy treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During Weeks 1 through 6, you will go to the clinic to have your skin checked by your&#xD;
           treating physician to learn the effects of each gel on your symptoms. .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will need to return any empty tubes of study gel so that new tubes can be given if&#xD;
           you will need more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the treating doctor sees that the irradiated breast skin reacts poorly (does not improve&#xD;
      or gets worse) or you experience any intolerable side effects, you will be taken off this&#xD;
      study. Otherwise, the total time on this study is about 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -During your last week of radiation therapy treatment you will be asked to fill out a&#xD;
      questionnaire about how you felt about each gel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. RadiaPlexRx and Aquaphor are both FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available. Up to 92 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled&#xD;
      at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
