      • To examine the influence of acute glycaemia (normoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia) on gastric&#xD;
      emptying kinetics in patients with type 1 diabetes and non diabetic subjects when treated&#xD;
      with subcutaneous (SC) injections of pramlintide.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postprandial increases in plasma glucose concentrations are mainly determined by the degree&#xD;
      of postprandial suppression of endogenous glucose production and the rate of appearance of&#xD;
      the ingested glucose. The latter is predominantly determined by the amount of glucose taken&#xD;
      up by the splanchnic bed. Because nutrient absorption depends on gastric nutrient delivery,&#xD;
      gastric emptying rate is a key determinant of the early rise of plasma glucose&#xD;
      postprandially. At mealtime, the faster the stomach empties the more rapid the rise in plasma&#xD;
      glucose. Yet, plasma glucose concentration is a determinant of gastric emptying rate. In&#xD;
      non-diabetic subjects, as plasma glucose rises and approaches the upper limit of the normal&#xD;
      range (~140 mg/dl), gastric emptying slows. This likely represents a physiological brake&#xD;
      mechanism to limit excess delivery of nutrients, thus avoiding excessive appearance of&#xD;
      glucose in plasma. In diabetes, abnormally accelerated gastric emptying as well as delayed&#xD;
      gastric emptying have been reported. These conflicting data may be explained by differences&#xD;
      of ambient glycaemia. In most of these studies undertaken in diabetic subjects these patients&#xD;
      were severely hyperglycaemic, thus the reported delayed gastric emptying may be explained by&#xD;
      the effect of hyperglycaemia on gastric motility. Indeed, a small number of studies&#xD;
      controlled for ambient glycaemia found acceleration of gastric emptying in diabetes and&#xD;
      suggest that diabetes manifests with a maladaptive acceleration of gastric emptying likely&#xD;
      contributing to excessive postprandial plasma glucose excursions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amylin analog pramlintide is a potential new therapeutic that elicits a potent glucose&#xD;
      lowering effect in the postprandial period thought to be due to both a suppression of plasma&#xD;
      glucagon and a delay of gastric emptying. It is not clear, however, to what extent the&#xD;
      pramlintide-induced delay of gastric emptying offsets a potential maladaptive acceleration of&#xD;
      gastric emptying in diabetes patients studied under controlled glycemic conditions. In&#xD;
      theory, every drug that reduces hyperglycaemia should accelerate gastric emptying and,&#xD;
      thereby, minimize its potential effect on postprandial hyperglycaemia. Thus, the drug-induced&#xD;
      effect of amylin on gastric motility may be of great advantage by offset the effects of&#xD;
      glycemic induced acceleration on gastric emptying.&#xD;
