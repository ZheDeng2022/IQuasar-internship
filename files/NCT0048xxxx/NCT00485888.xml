    <textblock>
      To add to our understanding of the relationship between blushing, symptom severity and&#xD;
      potential mechanisms that underlie blushing in patients with SP, we propose comparing SP&#xD;
      patients' vascular responses to topical m-N pre and post treatment with S-citalopram or&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S-citalopram (an SSRI) has been widely used in the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders as&#xD;
      it has shown efficacy in these patients (Lepola et al., 2003; Stahl et al., 2003; Burke et&#xD;
      al., 2002; Davidson et al., 2002; Wade et al., 2002). In comparison to placebo, S-citalopram&#xD;
      has been shown to be effective and well tolerated in those with short and long term SP (Lader&#xD;
      et al 2004; Montgomery et al., 2003; Kasper et al., 2002). As indicated, responses to the&#xD;
      blushing exposure will be assessed prior to and following treatment with S-citalopram or&#xD;
      placebo and at one month following the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levels of prostaglandin will be compared between groups and will also be correlated with&#xD;
      symptom severity in the clinical groups. Effective psychological interventions that reduced&#xD;
      the fear of blushing in individuals with social phobia did not lead to a reduction in actual&#xD;
      blushing during a social test (Mulkens et al., 2001). As such, it is expected that the&#xD;
      patients' perception of amount of blushing will change following treatment. In addition, we&#xD;
      are undertaking an investigation as to whether nican topical administration will change&#xD;
      following treatment to match the pattern seen in healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of S-citalopram 10 to 20 mg once daily (QD) in&#xD;
      the treatment of social phobia and to determine if treatment outcome is related changes in&#xD;
      intensity of the vasodilatory response to 10 mM topical m-N. This is a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind flexible-dose study evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      S-citalopram 10 to 20 mg and placebo in outpatient subjects diagnosed with SP. At the&#xD;
      screening visit those who are eligible will enter a randomized trial with S-citalopram 10 to&#xD;
      20 mg and placebo. The study will begin with a single week of S-citalopram 10 mg.&#xD;
      Subsequently, capsules will be administered in a flexible dose fashion and patients will be&#xD;
      followed up weekly (biweekly after week 6) and at the clinician's discretion. After the first&#xD;
      week the patients' dosage will be increased up to a maximum of 20 mg daily. This dose will&#xD;
      remain fixed after 8 weeks of treatment until week 16.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of S-citalopram 10 to 20 mg once daily (QD) in&#xD;
      the treatment of social phobia and to determine if treatment outcome is related changes in&#xD;
      intensity of the vasodilatory response to 10 mM topical m-N.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Out-patients (n = 36) with a primary diagnosis of Social Phobia using DSM-IV criteria&#xD;
      (300.02), with or without other comorbid secondary illnesses, who meet all other&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria are eligible to enter the study. We have chosen to assign 36&#xD;
      completed subjects as the number of desired completers. Given a drop out rate of 20%, 44&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double-blind flexible-dose study evaluating the efficacy, safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of S-citalopram 10 to 20 mg and placebo in outpatient subjects diagnosed with&#xD;
      SP. At the screening visit those who are eligible will enter a randomized trial with&#xD;
      S-citalopram 10 to 20 mg and placebo. The study will begin with a single week of S-citalopram&#xD;
      10mg. Subsequently, capsules will be administered in a flexible dose fashion and patients&#xD;
      will be followed up weekly (biweekly after week 6) and at the clinicians discretion. After&#xD;
      the first week the patients' dosage will be increased up to a maximum of 20 mg daily. This&#xD;
      dose will remain fixed after 8 weeks of treatment until week 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voluntary discontinuation by a subject&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are free to discontinue their participation in the study at any time, without&#xD;
      prejudice to further treatment. Subjects who discontinue from the study should always be&#xD;
      asked about the reason(s) for their discontinuation and the presence of any adverse events.&#xD;
      If possible, they should be seen and assessed by an investigator. Adverse events will be&#xD;
      followed up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once treatment phase is initiated and 30 days following the conclusion of the trial, subjects&#xD;
      will be questioned on any adverse events related to administration of S-citalopram. At the&#xD;
      final visit, 30 days after the conclusion of the trial, patients will be given a full&#xD;
      physical examination. Adverse experiences will be documented in response to a non-leading&#xD;
      question such as, &quot;Have you felt different in any way since starting the new treatment or&#xD;
      since the last visit?&quot; In addition, all adverse experiences observed by the investigator or&#xD;
      volunteered spontaneously by the patient will be recorded. Any serious adverse events (SAE)&#xD;
      will be reported to H. Lundbeck A/S contact person within 24 hours of becoming aware of them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Events meets at least one of the following indicators:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Death&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Life threatening&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In patient hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Persistent or significant disability/ incapacity&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Congenital anomaly/birth defect&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Judged medically important&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy parameter&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In individuals with SP, changes in intensity of the vasodilatory response to 10 mM topical&#xD;
      m-N will be measured in association with symptomatic improvement following treatment with&#xD;
      S-citalopram 10 to 20 mg. The end point of the study period is Week 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary efficacy parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are as follows and the end point of the study period is Week 16:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mean change from baseline on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS); Hamilton Anxiety&#xD;
           Scale (HAM-A), Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN); Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI); Social&#xD;
           Phobia Scale (SPS) at final visit; and the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mean change from baseline on fear of blushing scales: Blushing, Trembling, and Sweating&#xD;
           Questionnaire (BTS-Q) and Propensity Scale (BPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Decreased levels of prostaglandin D2 will be observed in association with the findings&#xD;
           of decreased m-N -induced flushing in the SP population. Any significant differences in&#xD;
           levels of prostaglandin D2 and its metabolite between the three groups (treatment group&#xD;
           and the controls) will disappear with symptom improvement in the SP group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Potential changes in peripheral serotonin synthesis from tryptophan will be altered such&#xD;
           that changes in levels of plasma serotonin will be correlated with outcome and flushing&#xD;
           response in SP subject who received treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Mean change from baseline on the Sheehan Disability Scale (work, social life and family&#xD;
           life domains), Euroquol (quality of life) and the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form-36&#xD;
           (SF-36), ), Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double-blind flexible-dose study evaluating the efficacy, safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of S-citalopram 10 to 20 mg and placebo in outpatient subjects diagnosed with&#xD;
      SP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After providing written informed consent at the screening visit, the patient will undergo all&#xD;
      tests indicated to determine suitability for the study. Patients meeting all&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will then be assigned to receive S-citalopram (N = 18) or&#xD;
      placebo (N = 18). The initial dose of S-citalopram will be 10mg. After week one, patients&#xD;
      will be managed on a dose of 10mg daily to a maximum of 20mg. The dose may be adjusted for&#xD;
      the first 8 weeks and then kept stable for duration of the rest of the study. Patients will&#xD;
      be seen weekly from week one to 6 and biweekly until week 16, and if necessary, telephone&#xD;
      contact will be initiated by the Investigator or study coordinator between visits to assess&#xD;
      the patient's response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure for Assessing Blushing/Vasodilation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to application of each m-N patch, a 5 mm diameter circle of relatively hairless,&#xD;
      unblemished skin will be masked off with hypoallergenic medical tape. This area will be found&#xD;
      on both the subjects' inner forearm and face (center of cheekbone - below the outside corner&#xD;
      of the eye). Initially, a five-minute baseline laser Doppler measurement will be taken.&#xD;
      Subsequently, the 10 mM m-N patch will be applied over the skin area on the forearm or face&#xD;
      for one minute and then removed. This is followed by a 20-minute period during which blood&#xD;
      flow will be measured continuously over both the face and arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vasodilatation will be measured by using a Moor Instruments moorLAB laser Doppler&#xD;
      spectroscope adjusted to measure changes in cutaneous blood flow. The Laser Doppler flow&#xD;
      meter takes real time measurements of local tissue blood flow by reflecting light off a&#xD;
      moving object such as a red blood cell. Each measurement will then be assigned an arbitrary&#xD;
      unit (Flux) which is a parameter based on the summed intensity of reflections recorded by the&#xD;
      instrument (Moor Instruments Limited, 1998). Flux will be sampled 40 times per second and&#xD;
      transferred to a personal computer for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, blood flow (flux) data will be averaged into 30-second bins and analyses will&#xD;
      be undertaken using non-linear curve fitting using the software program Prism (Graphpad&#xD;
      software). The flux at any time t [F(t)] will be fitted to a curve with parameters F(0), the&#xD;
      baseline flux, F, the maximal plateau change in flux, µ, the maximal rate of change, and L,&#xD;
      the lag time between applying the test patch and vasodilatation occurring (Equation 1). Runs&#xD;
      which do not produce a significant reaction (this being defined as at least one block of 5&#xD;
      consecutive 30 second time periods being significantly (Student's t-test; P &lt; 0.05) above&#xD;
      baseline blood flow) will be assigned a F value of zero; the µ and L parameters can not be&#xD;
      calculated in these circumstances).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximate half maximal dose (EC50) values will be calculated using non-linear curve fitting&#xD;
      to a standard sigmoidal dose response curve using the median F values derived from each dose&#xD;
      of m-N.&#xD;
