      Providing extended pain relief without the use of indwelling catheters is the basis for&#xD;
      developing SKY0402. A formulation of bupivacaine, given as a single injection after surgery,&#xD;
      that could provide adequate, continuous, and extended pain relief would greatly simplify&#xD;
      postoperative pain management, reduce the need for repeated administration, and minimize&#xD;
      break-through episodes of pain.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Healthy adult Caucasian men or non-pregnant, non-lactating women between 18 and 40&#xD;
             years of age, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Healthy as judged by responsible physician with no clinically significant abnormality&#xD;
             identified on the medical and laboratory evaluation, including 12-lead ECG and vital&#xD;
             signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Non-smoker in the previous 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Body weight greater than or equal to 50 kg and BMI within the range 19-29 kg/m2,&#xD;
             inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. At screening and Run-in period each ECG should have:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Consistent sinus rhythm, (i.e. if greater than or equal to 2 ECGs are not sinusal&#xD;
                  at different time points the volunteer should not be included),&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No clinically significant conduction disorder,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PR between 120 and 230 ms,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  HR less than or equal to 100 beats/min and greater than or equal to 40 beats/min,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  QRS &lt; 120 ms,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  QT intervals that can be consistently analysed,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  QTcB less than or equal to 430 ms for males,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  QTcB less than or equal to 450 ms for females&#xD;
&#xD;
             If there are outlying values in the ECGs, the consistency of these values should be&#xD;
             confirmed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If HR is between 40 and 44 bpm (inclusive) in 2 ECGs (of one triplicate) on more&#xD;
                  than one time point during Run-in, subject should not be selected. Conversely,&#xD;
                  this means that if HR is between 40 and 44 bpm at screening and/or on just one&#xD;
                  time-point-triplicate during Run-in, the volunteer can be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If HR &lt; 40 bpm on a single occasion at screening or in Run-in period, subject&#xD;
                  should not be selected,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If PR interval is consistently out-of-range (&lt; 120 or &gt; 230 ms) during Run-in&#xD;
                  period, i.e. in 2 out of 3 ECGs at one time point or in one ECG at more than one&#xD;
                  time point, the cardiologist needs to perform a manual measurement of this value.&#xD;
                  If the manual measurement confirms that PR is out-of-range, the volunteer must&#xD;
                  not be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If QRS is consistently &gt;120 ms during run-in period, i.e. in 2 ECGs of a&#xD;
                  triplicate or in 2 ECGs from 2 different time-points, the cardiologist needs to&#xD;
                  perform a manual measurement of this value. If the manual measurement confirms&#xD;
                  the QRS is out-of-range, the volunteer must not be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If QTcB is out of range (QTcB &gt;430 ms for males or &gt;450 ms for females, or&#xD;
                  repeated demonstration of a QTcB interval &gt;440 ms for females) even on a single&#xD;
                  occasion, it should be checked whether the heart rate is constant. If the HR is&#xD;
                  not constant and if the increase in QTcB is clearly due to hysteresis (e.g. on&#xD;
                  the immediate repeated ECG with consistent HR the QTcB is back to normal), then&#xD;
                  the volunteer can be selected. If the HR is constant and the QTcB is still&#xD;
                  out-of-range, the cardiologist needs to perform a manual measurement and&#xD;
                  calculation of the QTcB. If the QTcB is normal on manual measurement, the&#xD;
                  volunteer can be selected. If the QTcB is abnormal on manual measurement without&#xD;
                  acceptable cause, the volunteer must not be selected, even if the QTcB is&#xD;
                  outlying on one single ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
             The final decision to include / not include a volunteer based on protocol ECG criteria&#xD;
             lies with the cardiologist assessing the Run-in ECGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The subject is able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions,&#xD;
             and protocol-stated restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. A female subject may be entered into the study if she is:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Post-menopausal female defined as being amenorrhoeic for greater than 2 years&#xD;
                  with an appropriate clinical profile, e.g. appropriate age and history of&#xD;
                  vasomotor symptoms. However; if indicated, this should be confirmed by estradiol&#xD;
                  and FSH levels consistent with menopause (according to local laboratory ranges).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pre-menopausal females with a documented hysterectomy (medical report&#xD;
                  verification) and/or bilateral oophorectomy. In the case of oophorectomy alone,&#xD;
                  only acceptable when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by&#xD;
                  follow up hormone level assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Females of childbearing potential must use one of the following methods of&#xD;
                  contraception:&#xD;
