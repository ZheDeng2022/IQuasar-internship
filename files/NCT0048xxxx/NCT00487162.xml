  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery induces a stress effect on the body partially through a catabolic energy state. In&#xD;
      turn, glucose levels may rise to levels which have been associated with major morbidity&#xD;
      (Golden, 1999) and mortality (Ouattara, 2005). An increasing body of evidence suggests that&#xD;
      intensive insulin therapy for tight control of blood glucose levels in certain surgical and&#xD;
      critical care patient populations may improve mortality and selected morbidity outcomes when&#xD;
      compared to those patients receiving conventional insulin therapy and blood glucose&#xD;
      management. More specifically, poor intra-operative blood glucose control is associated with&#xD;
      worse outcome after cardiac surgery. Intensive insulin therapy with tight blood glucose&#xD;
      control in surgical patients while in the ICU may reduce morbidity and mortality. Such&#xD;
      outcome improvements would clearly provide benefits to patients, providers and payers. To&#xD;
      date, there is scant research examining whether intensive insulin therapy for tight control&#xD;
      of blood glucose in the perioperative period can alter outcomes for the non cardiac surgery&#xD;
      population. The purpose of this study is to determine whether intensive insulin therapy for&#xD;
      tight control of blood glucose in the perioperative period in non cardiac major surgery&#xD;
      patients is associated with altered morbidity and mortality rates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intensive insulin therapy to control blood glucose levels reduces morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      intensive care unit patients and in cardiac surgical patients but its role in patients&#xD;
      undergoing non-emergent non-cardiac surgery is unknown. Benefits of glucose control may&#xD;
      result from prevention of immune system dysfunction, reduction in systemic inflammation, and&#xD;
      protection of endothelium and mitochondrial structure and function, all of which are known to&#xD;
      be altered by high stress states such as that induced by surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective, randomized, controlled study of adult patients admitted to our operating&#xD;
      suite for non-emergent non-cardiac surgery, we propose to correlate in-hospital morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality with blood glucose levels of patients who are expected to have moderate to high&#xD;
      levels of physiologic stress as a result of their pre-existing medical conditions or as a&#xD;
      result of the proposed surgical procedure. Specifically, patients who are deemed to be&#xD;
      American Society of Anesthesiologists Risk Classification 1-3 or higher, or patients&#xD;
      undergoing intermediate and high risk procedures shall be considered to have moderate to high&#xD;
      physiologic stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of intermediate / high risk procedures shall be according to the American&#xD;
      College of Cardiology / American Heart Association 2002 Guidelines for Perioperative&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Evaluation for Noncardiac Surgery as outlined in Table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;

        -  Anticipated prolonged surgical procedures associated with large fluid shifts and/or&#xD;

           Further preoperative cardiac testing is not generally required. Intermediate (Reported&#xD;
           cardiac risk generally &lt;5%)&#xD;

      Prior to entering the operating suite for surgery, patients will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive either intensive insulin treatment or conventional insulin treatment. Treatment&#xD;
      assignment will be performed using sealed envelopes, and patients stratified according to&#xD;

      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients scheduled for non emergent surgery under either general or regional anesthesia&#xD;
           deemed to have moderate to high physiologic stress&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Male and female subjects over the age of 18 with or without a diagnosis of diabetes&#xD;
           mellitus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be able to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitively impaired&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-English or Spanish speaking with no relative present who is fluent in reading and&#xD;
           comprehending English or Spanish.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Female patients of child bearing age who have a positive pregnancy test on admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients, whole blood hemoglobin A1C and glucose levels will be drawn prior to&#xD;
      induction of anesthesia. Additional whole blood glucose levels will be drawn at the time of&#xD;
      induction of anesthesia, at skin incision, hourly throughout the operation, at emergence from&#xD;
      anesthesia, every hour up to three hours after the completion of surgery, and then once per&#xD;
      day until the patient is discharged from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intensive treatment group, continuous insulin infusion (50 IU of Novolin R [Novo&#xD;
      Nordisk]) in 50mL of 0.9% saline via infusion pump will be started when the blood glucose&#xD;
      level exceeds 110 mg/dL and will be adjusted to maintain the blood glucose level between 80&#xD;
      and 110 mg/dL. Adjustments will be made according to the University Hospital's ICU Adult&#xD;
      Insulin Infusion Protocol. When the blood glucose level falls below 80 mg/dL, the insulin&#xD;
      infusion will be tapered and discontinued. For patients going to the ICU after surgery,&#xD;
      insulin infusions will be continued according to the University Hospital's ICU Adult Insulin&#xD;
      Infusion Protocol under the direction of the ICU staff. For patients not being to the ICU&#xD;
      after surgery, insulin infusions will be tapered to off after the final hourly blood glucose&#xD;
      determination at three hours after the completion of surgery. The University Hospital's Blood&#xD;
      Glucose Management Order Set for Medical and Surgical Patients will then be adopted for&#xD;
      continued glucose management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the conventional treatment group, continuous insulin infusion will be started when the&#xD;
      blood glucose level exceeds 200 mg/dL and will be adjusted to maintain the blood glucose&#xD;
      level between 180 and 200 mg/dL. Adjustments will be made according to a modified ICU Adult&#xD;
      Insulin Infusion Protocol. When the blood glucose level falls below 180mg/dL, the insulin&#xD;
      infusion will be tapered and discontinued. For patients transferred to an ICU after surgery,&#xD;
      insulin infusions will be continued according to the University Hospital's ICU Adult Insulin&#xD;
      Infusion Protocol under the direction of the ICU staff. For patients not being transferred to&#xD;
      an ICU after surgery, insulin infusions will be tapered to off after the final hourly blood&#xD;
      glucose determination at three hours after the completion of surgery. The University&#xD;
      Hospital's Blood Glucose Management Order Set for Medical and Surgical Patients will then be&#xD;
      adopted for continued glucose management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How will the study be analyzed?&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, data on demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients (see Table 1)&#xD;
      will be obtained. Blood will be systematically sampled and whole blood glucose levels&#xD;
      determined as described above. All blood glucose values will be tabulated from baseline&#xD;
      through end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research associate blinded to the treatment groups will determine morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      by reviewing the patient's medical record upon discharge from the hospital and recording the&#xD;
      occurrence of morbidity and mortality by the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Post-operative surgical wound infection - a clinical condition requiring antibiotic&#xD;
           treatment beyond the UH Surgical Infection Prevention (SIP) protocol and / or subsequent&#xD;
           wound drainage / debridement&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Systemic infection - presence of bacteremia or prolonged (i.e. greater than 10 days) use&#xD;
           of antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Myocardial Injury - postoperative EKG changes that reveal new Q waves or S-T segment&#xD;
           elevations greater than 1mm in any lead(s) or serum troponin levels that exceed….&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Malignant arrhythmia - asystole, ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation requiring&#xD;
           cardiopulmonary resuscitation, antiarrhythmia therapy, or defibrillator implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Respiratory Injury - mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours, reintubation, or&#xD;
           planned tracheostomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Neurological Injury - focal brain injury with permanent functional deficit, irreversible&#xD;
           encephalopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Renal Injury - a level of serum creatinine twice that present on admission to the&#xD;
           hospital or acute renal failure requiring dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Hepatic Injury - bilirubin level of &gt;3mg per deciliter&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Venous Thromboembolism - deposition of thrombus in peripheral or central veins as&#xD;
           determined by Doppler ultrasonography, angiography or computed tomography.&#xD;
