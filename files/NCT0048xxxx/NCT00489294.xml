  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Syntropin (a human growth&#xD;
      hormone) and to determine the serum concentration of IGF-1 after Syntropin injection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Syntropin will be administered by subcutaneous injection. Eligible patients will receive a&#xD;
      subcutaneous injection of octreodite (to suppress endogenous growth hormone secretion) 12&#xD;
      hours before, immediately prior to, and 12 hours after the scheduled injection of growth&#xD;
      hormone.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Male and female subjects between the ages of 18 and 45 years (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent to participate in the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  No clinically significant abnormal findings on the physical examination, medical&#xD;
             history, electrocardiogram, or clinical laboratory results during screening.&#xD;

             limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of clinically significant gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, neurologic,&#xD;

             cardiovascular disease or any other condition which, in the opinion of the Principle&#xD;
             Investigator, would jeopardize the safety of the subject or impact the validity of the&#xD;
             study results.&#xD;
&#xD;

             dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in a clinical trial within 30 days prior to study initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
