  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to common CVD diseases associated from obesity, medical providers are in a position to&#xD;
      provide assistance. However, less than 10% of all patients receive any weight loss advice&#xD;
      from physicians. Perceived barriers to weight loss counseling include lack of self-control of&#xD;
      their patients and belief that recommendation is futile, lack of medical training in&#xD;
      nutrition, exercise, and obesity management, and lack of insurance reimbursement. Though many&#xD;
      barriers are prevalent, research has demonstrated a positive effect with medical advice on&#xD;
      the number of obese individuals attempting to lose weight. Analyzing data from the 1996&#xD;
      Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, researchers found, when advised to lose weight by&#xD;
      a physician, 78% of overweight patients reported attempting to lose weight. However, if their&#xD;
      physician did not discuss weight loss, only 33% of patients within the same BMI category&#xD;
      attempted to do so 7. From this information, physicians or allied health staff that provide&#xD;
      brief counseling (5-10 minute) along with medical technology that provides basic nutrition&#xD;
      assessment might have a positive impact on the number CVD patients that are obese attempting&#xD;
      to lose weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: Will a medical specialty clinic focused on cardiovascular medicine successfully&#xD;
      be able to implement the MedGem device for assessment of basic nutritional needs along with&#xD;
      providing &quot;brief&quot; patient education into the medical practice without a house dietitian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can medical staff and/or support staff provide REE assessments (15-minutes) and brief&#xD;
           patient education (5-15 minutes) as part of the clinic's operations?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Will a third-party payer compensate the Medical Specialty Clinic for the diagnostic&#xD;
           procedure CPT Code 94690 for obese patients diagnosed with hypertension (401.1-9,&#xD;
           402.10-11, &amp; 402.90-91), hypercholesterolemia (272.1), and/or hyperlipdemia (272.2)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does self-efficacy increase from REE assessments?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do patients adopt healthy eating (Calorie Reduction and Fat Reduction)following REE&#xD;
           assessments?&#xD;
