  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed determine whether use of creatine monohydrate, a dietary supplement,&#xD;
      can increase skeletal muscle mass and strength and improve the response to progressive&#xD;
      resistance exercise training in people with HIV infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of creatine&#xD;
      monohydrate, a dietary supplement, on skeletal muscle size and function (i.e., strength,&#xD;
      energy metabolism, work capacity, fatigue); whole-body exercise performance; and body&#xD;
      composition. This study is also designed to determine whether creatine supplementation&#xD;
      augments the functional benefit derived from progressive resistance exercise. The safety of&#xD;
      creatine supplementation in people with HIV infection will also be evaluated. Forty&#xD;
      HIV-positive subjects will be randomly assigned, on a 1:1 basis, to receive creatine&#xD;
      monohydrate or placebo for a period of 14 days, followed by a 12-week program of supervised&#xD;
      progressive resistance exercise training during which administration of creatine monohydrate&#xD;
      or placebo will continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of muscle strength, size, composition, energetics and fatigue, as well as body&#xD;
      weight and composition and serum biochemistries, will be made at baseline, after two weeks of&#xD;
      treatment with creatine or placebo (before PRT), and again after 12 weeks of PRT (study week&#xD;
      14). Safety will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically stable, sedentary HIV-positive adults who are on optimized antiretroviral&#xD;
             regimens and plan to remain so during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women on hormone replacement therapy and women using hormonal contraceptives&#xD;
             must have been on stable regimens for the preceding 6 months and plan to continue on&#xD;
             such treatment throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dl or clinical evidence of renal disease or prior kidney&#xD;
             transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatine kinase (CK) &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin &lt; 8.5 g/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST, ALT, or LDH &gt; 5 X ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled diarrhea (&gt; 6 stools per day)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Impaired oral intake&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistent nausea or vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Untreated hypogonadism&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pharmacologic use of growth hormone, testosterone, oxandrolone, nandrolone decanoate,&#xD;
             oxymetholone, or other oral, injectable, or transdermal anabolic steroids,&#xD;
             androstenedione, or dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) within the preceding 6 months&#xD;
             (subjects with documented hypogonadism on stable testosterone replacement, defined as&#xD;
             a dose &lt; 300 mg q2 weeks for the preceding 6 months, will be allowed to enroll)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of glucocorticoids, megestrol acetate, creatine monohydrate, cytokine inhibitors&#xD;
             (thalidomide, pentoxifylline, ketotifen), drugs known to adversely affect renal&#xD;
             function, cytokines, parenteral or tube feeding, or initiation of treatment for a&#xD;
             systemic infection within 30 days prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of angina, coronary heart disease, or congestive heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current pregnancy or lactation or plans to become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because vegetarians are known to have lower intramuscular concentrations of creatine&#xD;
             and therefore may experience a much greater relative increase in muscle creatine&#xD;
             levels, we will exclude such individuals from this study.&#xD;
