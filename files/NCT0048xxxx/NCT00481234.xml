      cardiovascular events and death. Hemodynamic variables are controlled by the autonomic&#xD;

      Hypotension and bradycardia following induction of anesthesia may result in insufficient&#xD;
      organ perfusion. Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease are at high risk of&#xD;
      perioperative cardiovascular events and death. Hemodynamic variables are controlled by the&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system reflected by Heart Rate Variability (HRV). Several authors&#xD;
      demonstrated depressed long-term HRV in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      Depressed 24 hours HRV proved to be highly predictive for cardiovascular morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality Recently, short-term analysis was demonstrated to be a reliable tool to predict&#xD;
      hypotension after spinal anesthesia. No data are available, however, with respect to&#xD;
      preoperative HRV values and incidence of postoperative cardiovascular events. To investigate&#xD;
      the prognostic value of HRV in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease. Hypothesise&#xD;
      i) differences in pre-operative HRV are present in patients with underlying cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, ii) depressed preoperative HRV indicates high risk of post-operative cardiac&#xD;
      ischemia, iii) depressed preoperative HRV is associated with longer postoperative hospital&#xD;
      stay and adverse cardiac events after hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, patients are assigned to one of two groups depending on the presence or absence of&#xD;
      postoperative cardiac ischemia; second, a predictive model will be built to confirm our&#xD;
      findings prospectively in another group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: 100 patients (ASA physical status class II - IV) scheduled for general anesthesia.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:evidence of high perioperative cardiovascular risk based on the Revised&#xD;
      Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI &gt;3).Exclusion criteria: lack of sinus rhythm, emergency cases,&#xD;
      postoperative admission to an intensive care unit and age under 18 years. Time and frequency&#xD;
      domain parameters of HRV will be recorded at the day of surgery before induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia. Cardiovascular events and outcome will be analyzed.&#xD;
