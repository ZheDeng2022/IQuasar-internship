      Post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As casualties of motor vehicle accidents, criminal acts or terrorism are arriving to the ER,&#xD;
      it is almost impossible to conclude who will overcome his psychiatric trauma and will be able&#xD;
      to return to his normal life course and who will be thrown out of his promising life&#xD;
      trajectory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current attempts to identify those who are at the greatest risk are still unsatisfactory,&#xD;
      which comprise a therapeutic dilemma, since the interventions used to ameliorate and prevent&#xD;
      the occurrence of PTSD in a high-risk patient, might be counter-productive and even&#xD;
      precipitate the emergence of PTSD in lower-risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since PTSD is closely related to the &quot;Fight, Flight or Freeze&quot; reaction, it has much to do&#xD;
      with the autonomic nervous system and the major stress hormone, cortisol. Despite many&#xD;
      studies demonstrating the involvement of those factors in the development of PTSD, various&#xD;
      attempts to profile the direction of the association between PTSD and cortisol abnormalities&#xD;
      have yielded conflicting results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of a novel method of assessing the excretion of cortisol using residues in&#xD;
      the human hair shaft, has allowed an unprecedented evaluation of its activity over a&#xD;
      prolonged period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using this novel method of cortisol assessment, the investigators aim to identify biomarkers&#xD;
      that will be able to aid in the prediction of PTSD development ahead of symptoms emergence,&#xD;
      and will enhance the understanding of the physiological mechanism involved and etiology of&#xD;
      this disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) stems from an event that is perceived as a threat to&#xD;
      the physical and psychological integrity of the individual. Despite evidence pointing at&#xD;
      predisposing or protective factors, it is extremely difficult to predict who will develop&#xD;
      PTSD after exposure to a traumatic event. However, it is of a paramount importance to predict&#xD;
      such a clinical course, in order to intervene at an early stage and facilitate research that&#xD;
      may lead to prevention of the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As certain features of PTSD closely resemble the response of the adrenergic system via the&#xD;
      fight or flight mechanism, substantial effort was made to understand the role of the&#xD;
      hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in the&#xD;
      development and maintenance of this disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various studies demonstrated conflicting findings, both in the trend of the level of cortisol&#xD;
      and in the timing of the endocrinological anomaly. Additional study assessed the effect of&#xD;
      HPA axis suppression by dexamethasone on anxiety-related symptoms in healthy volunteers&#xD;
      subjected to a stress test. Those participants whose HPA axis was inhibited, presented a&#xD;
      significant increase in anxiety symptoms, compared to a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variability and lack of stability are the main disadvantages of current methods quantifying&#xD;
      systemic cortisol levels via measurements in the plasma, urine and saliva. These shortcomings&#xD;
      undermine the effort to understand the role of the HPA axis in PTSD. Variable timing of the&#xD;
      tests, as well as the stress involved in psychiatric examination and phlebotomy, are also&#xD;
      major confounders in such an effort. Recently, the introduction of a novel test of hair&#xD;
      cortisol concentration (HCC) has enabled retrospective quantification of cortisol levels, and&#xD;
      thus the HPA axis activity, over a prolonged period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As hair grows, unbounded cortisol is incorporated into the hair shaft in a manner that&#xD;
      correlates with the amount of unbounded plasma cortisol at that time period. Since scalp hair&#xD;
      grows at a fairly constant rate of 1cm per month, especially in the posterior vertex area,&#xD;
      analysis of 3cm would reflect the average level of unbounded cortisol throughout the previous&#xD;
      3 months. Several studies in animals and humans have established the test's stability over&#xD;
      time, thus proving that the test reliably reflects major changes in the HPA axis. Studies&#xD;
      evaluating this novel test in the field of mental health demonstrated variations of cortisol&#xD;
      levels in a number of clinical populations: increased hair cortisol levels were demonstrated&#xD;
      for a 6 month period in depressed patients compared to controls; communities exposed to the&#xD;
      horrors of war in Uganda had elevated cortisol levels compared to Ugandan communities not&#xD;
      living in war zones; among patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), there were lower&#xD;
      hair cortisol levels in comparison with a control population, despite similar cortisol saliva&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the advantage of a reliable measurement of unbound plasma cortisol levels over&#xD;
      time, this novel test is also easy to perform, easy to store and causes minimal inconvenience&#xD;
      to the patient with no actual risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of this novel method of testing for cortisol level over prolong periods of time&#xD;
      enables us to study the course of the HPA axis in relation to stressors: the baseline status,&#xD;
      the immediate aftermath and the continuous effects of the traumatic event on the axis. Such&#xD;
      valuable information can aid in the ongoing debate, whether the baseline function of the HPA&#xD;
      axis is a core predisposing factor or, in fact, a secondary causality of the traumatic event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Achieving better understanding of the complex interplay between those biological mechanisms&#xD;
      and the formation of PTSD might enable the targeting of high-risk population after traumatic&#xD;
      exposure with pharmacological and psychological interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis Main Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hair cortisol level previous to the trauma will correlate with PTSD development.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ratio between hair cortisol levels prior to trauma to saliva cortisol level following&#xD;
           the traumatic event will correlate with PTSD development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Saliva cortisol level immediately after trauma will correlate with PTSD development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Hair cortisol level one month post trauma will correlate with PTSD development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Ratio between saliva cortisol levels to saliva alpha-amylase level (both taken at ER&#xD;
           immediately after trauma) will correlate with PTSD development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patients with a difference between hair cortisol levels 3 months prior to the traumatic&#xD;
           event and levels during the 3 months following it, are more prone to developing PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Methods Prospective observational study, performed at Meir Medical Center, Kfar Saba,&#xD;
      Israel and Shalvata Mental Health Center, Hod Hasharon, Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 men and women arriving at Meir medical center Emergency department, as a result of a&#xD;
      traumatic civil event, will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will fill out demographic and medical history questionnaires, and a structured&#xD;
      psychiatric interview (M.I.N.I) will be performed to exclude any active psychiatric disorder.&#xD;
      If none of the exclusion criteria met, several procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sampling hair from the posterior vortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sampling blood cortisol and saliva cortisol and alpha-amylase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Documenting pulse at the time of admission to the ER and 6 hours following the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Filling a number of questionnaires: SLE (stressful life events); BDI (Beck Depression&#xD;
           Scale); MADRSS (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale); STAI (State &amp; Trait Anxiety&#xD;
           Inventory); VAS-A, VAS-D; PDEQ (Peritraumatic Dissociation Experience Questionnaire);&#xD;
           SASRQ (Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychiatric follow-up will be performed at 4 time points, in relation to the traumatic event:&#xD;
      After 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months. During each assessment, the following&#xD;
      procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sampling hair from the posterior vortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Filling out a number of questionnaires: BDI, MADRSS, STAI, VAS-A, VAS-D, CAPS&#xD;
           (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale), PSS (PTSD Symptoms Scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance of potential study findings The proposed study will provide novel information on&#xD;
      the role of the HPA axis in the development of PTSD. By answering this old, unresolved&#xD;
      question the investigators will achieve an understanding of the neurobiological mechanism and&#xD;
      may be able to predict the development of the disorder at an early, sub-clinical stage. The&#xD;
      results of the study will also contribute to the understanding and rationale of the&#xD;
      possibility of steroid treatment following an acute traumatic event.&#xD;
