  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior to surgery, gynecologists and urogynecologists have routinely prescribed preoperative&#xD;
      mechanical bowel preparations in attempts to decrease the risk of infection, while also&#xD;
      providing easier bowel manipulation and better visualization during surgery. However, many of&#xD;
      these proposed benefits have never been proven, and usage of bowel preparations amongst&#xD;
      surgeons remains highly variable. In both the general surgery and gynecology literature,&#xD;
      researchers have begun to question the need for the vigorous preparations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aside from surgical visualization, urogynecologists have additional concerns about how bowel&#xD;
      preparations may impact postoperative bowel function given up to half of women with pelvic&#xD;
      floor disorders have baseline constipation and straining is known to impact surgical&#xD;
      recovery. Many studies have addressed various postoperative fiber and laxative preparations&#xD;
      in attempts to improve postoperative bowel-related symptomatology, but none have specifically&#xD;
      looked at preoperative bowel preparations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine if mechanical bowel preparation prior to minimally invasive&#xD;
      sacral colpopexy affects patients' postoperative recovery, specifically related to bowel&#xD;
      symptomatology; operative or post-operative complications; surgeons' perceptions of surgical&#xD;
      difficulty directly attributed to the bowel; and post-operative return of normal bowel&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

    <description>Bowel symptomatology and bowel-related discomfort will be assessed with the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptom Questionnaire (PAC-SYM), a 12-item questionnaire covering three domains: abdominal, rectal, and stool.</description>

    <measure>Surgeon perception of bowel preparation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Immediately after completing the surgical case, surgeons will complete a 13-item surgeon questionnaire assessing degree of surgical difficulty and how it relates to the bowel. Operative time and consultations will also be recorded as objective measures of surgical difficulty.</description>

    <measure>Return of normal bowel function</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A seven-day bowel diary will be obtained at baseline and in the first week after surgery. This log will include daily assessment of bowel frequency, type of bowel movement using the validated Bristol stool scale, degree of straining, and used of narcotics or laxatives.</description>

    <measure>Perioperative complications</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Complications occurring in both groups will be recorded. These include, but are not limited to infections, bowel obstructions, visceral organ injuries, and readmissions.</description>
