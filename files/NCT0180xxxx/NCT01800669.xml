  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that by adding a patient screening and physician alerting&#xD;
      module to a computer-based decision support system, the investigators can improve the&#xD;
      detection and management of legal issues that may affect children's health. this randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial will place the module in two clinics using the CHICA decision support system&#xD;
      and compare the rate of detection and resolution of medical-legal issues in those clinics&#xD;
      compared to two clinics using the CHICA system without the medical-legal module.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Social determinants of health are the circumstances in which people are born, live, work and&#xD;
      age; as well as the systems that are put in place to deal with illness and disability.&#xD;
      Dramatic differences in health are closely related to degrees of social and economic&#xD;
      disadvantage. For example, poverty-induced hardships such as food insecurity, utility&#xD;
      shut-offs and substandard housing all have the potential to negatively impact health. In the&#xD;
      United States, there exist many laws and policies designed to address such issues. For&#xD;
      example, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) seeks to address food&#xD;
      insecurity by providing a means for financially eligible recipients to access nutritious&#xD;
      food. When an individual is wrongly denied SNAP benefits, legal remedies are available.&#xD;
      Access to legal aid, much like access to nutritious food, is often limited by social and&#xD;
      economic disadvantage. It has been demonstrated that most legal problems experienced by&#xD;
      low-income individuals remain unresolved, with fewer than one in five being addressed with&#xD;
      the help of a lawyer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A child's health status may be negatively affected when he or she does not receive the&#xD;
      benefit of laws designed to address such social determinates of health. Unhealthy housing may&#xD;
      lead to an increased risk of preventable injury or, in the case of dangerous molds, asthma.&#xD;
      An excessively cold environment brought on by a utility shut-off may also trigger childhood&#xD;
      asthma, or result in a family's decision to trade-off food for heat. Poor nutrition may&#xD;
      contribute to any number of deficiencies impacting a child's health. Laws addressing such&#xD;
      issues include those that require landlords to mitigate dangerous rental housing conditions,&#xD;
      those that protect access to utilities in certain circumstances, and those that protect&#xD;
      against unlawful denials of food-benefit programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical-legal Partnerships bring health care providers together with lawyers to address&#xD;
      social and legal needs, such as those described above, which may result in poor health&#xD;
      outcomes. Such partnerships across the nation provide direct legal advice and assistance to&#xD;
      patients, create internal systems that improve health care delivery, and promote change at a&#xD;
      policy level beyond discrete systems. This study has been designed to expand upon the current&#xD;
      medical-legal partnership concept and mitigate health disparities by creating an innovative&#xD;
      system that dramatically increases the identification of medical-legal issues in pediatric&#xD;
      clinics, improves the delivery of appropriate physician counseling and streamlines access to&#xD;
      legal resources when legal remedies are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to intelligently insert a medical-legal issue screening tool and&#xD;
      tailored decision support protocol into the regular health care delivery process of our&#xD;
      existing computerized clinical decision support system (CDSS), the Child Health Improvement&#xD;
      through Computer Automation (CHICA) system. In short, a series of screening questions&#xD;
      regarding common legal issues that have the potential to negatively impact child health will&#xD;
      be included on a pre-screener form for all patients â‰¤36 months of age. This form will be&#xD;
      printed on paper and completed by the presenting caregiver in the waiting room. Answers to&#xD;
      the questions will then be scanned into the CHICA system prior to the physician encounter and&#xD;
      analyzed along with previously existing medical record information to generate the content&#xD;
      for a tailored physician worksheet and handouts. Together, these documents will help guide&#xD;
      physicians through the process of confirming identified medical-legal issues and providing&#xD;
      the most appropriate interventions in terms of education and/or referrals to a medical-legal&#xD;
      expert. This process as a whole will help physicians to accurately identify such issues and&#xD;
      immediately address them in an appropriate and sensitive way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that our innovative use of the CHICA computerized decision&#xD;
      support system to identify and address medical-legal issues in a consistent, appropriate and&#xD;
      effective way will help diminish the barriers that physicians often cite when questioned&#xD;
      about identifying medical-legal issues and taking steps to help address them. For example,&#xD;
      the investigators anticipate that our utilization of waiting room time to administer the&#xD;
      initial pre-screener questions will help minimize concerns about time constraints, and&#xD;
      CHICA's generation of highly-tailored worksheets that direct physicians through the process&#xD;
      of dealing with positive screens will help address physician concerns about lack of education&#xD;
      or experience with medical-legal issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To summarize, the investigators intend first to expand and modify the CHICA system to assist&#xD;
      pediatricians with the identification and management of four common medical-legal problems&#xD;
      (homelessness, unsafe rental home conditions, inadequate access to necessary utilities and&#xD;
      food insecurity) that have the potential to adversely impact child health (AIM 1). The&#xD;
      investigators will then evaluate the effect of the CHICA medical-legal module on the&#xD;
      identification and mitigation of medical-legal problems in four pediatric practices by&#xD;
      evaluating rates of medical-legal issue identification via pre/post chart abstraction, and&#xD;
      evaluating actions taken by physicians and patient caregivers (as reported in caregiver&#xD;
      interviews) to mitigate identified medical-legal issues (AIM 2). Next, the investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate physician and patient caregiver satisfaction with the CHICA medical-legal module by&#xD;
      evaluating physician comfort with medical-legal issue identification and acceptance of the&#xD;
      CHICA medical-legal module via physician survey, and evaluating patient caregiver perceptions&#xD;
      (as reported in caregiver interviews) about physicians' handling of medical-legal issues and&#xD;
      the CHICA medical-legal module process (AIM 3). Lastly, the investigators will evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of the CHICA medical-legal module on healthcare utilization by comparing the overall&#xD;
      utilization of Medicaid patients in our intervention population to Medicaid patients in our&#xD;
      control population over the course of 18 months (AIM 4).&#xD;
