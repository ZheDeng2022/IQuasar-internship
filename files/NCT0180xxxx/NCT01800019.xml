      The objectives of this trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine among HIV+ individuals whether varenicline or NRT is more effective at&#xD;
           helping individuals remain abstinent from smoking tobacco.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine among HIV+ individuals whether varenicline or NRT has the lowest&#xD;
           side-effect profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine if the HIV tailored Quit Smoking Counselling Intervention, plus smoking&#xD;
           cessation drug therapy, improves smoking cessation rates compared to smoking cessation&#xD;
           drug therapy alone with usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine whether the use of varenicline/NRT is safe in HIV+ patients who exhibit&#xD;
      depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      That varenicline will result in higher quit smoking rates and that NRT will result in a lower&#xD;
      side effect profile. Further, the HIV tailored quit smoking intervention will result in&#xD;
      higher rates of smoking cessation over and above the pharmacological treatment alone. And&#xD;
      finally, varenicline will be safe to use for HIV + individuals who exhibit depressive&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;

    <description>The primary study end-point will be seven-day self-reported abstinence, and four week continuous abstinence rates at week 48, confirmed by expired carbon monoxide levels measured using a piCO+ Smokerlyzer (Smoke free defined as exhaled CO &lt; 10 ppm). Study participants who are lost to follow-up (e.g., study drop-outs and those unavailable for follow-up) will be considered as smokers for the purposes of outcome analyses.</description>

    <measure>Smoking cessation treatment integrity and patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Study Medication: Adherence to NRT and varenicline will be assessed by participant self-reported adherence to medication at each study visit.&#xD;
Counseling Intervention: Each clinic site will have an HIV clinic health care provider who will be trained in administering the standardized HIV quit smoking intervention.&#xD;
Program Satisfaction Form will be completed by all study participants at the end of the study. At post-quit dates, treatment adherence will be assessed by a self-report measure of the amount of NRT or varenicline taken, number of cigarettes smoked in the previous 7 days, and marked changes in mood.&#xD;
Study coordinator will assess rates of discontinuation of varenicline or NRT. Participants who discontinue varenicline or NRT will still be followed according to the original schedule.</description>

Dose: 7mg - 42mg depending on # of cigarettes smoked per day at study baseline, and withdrawal symptoms.&#xD;
Mode of Administration: Transdermal Patch&#xD;
Duration of Treatment: up to 24 Weeks&#xD;
Additionally, participants will be provided with a supply of short-acting nicotine gum in order to supplement their long acting NRT patch regimen.&#xD;
Individuals who smoke their first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking are advised to use the 2 mg NRT gum. Participants who smoke their first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking will be advised to use the 4 mg NRT gum. Both NRT gum dosages will be recommended for use on an ad lib basis to address cravings and/or withdrawal symptoms, up to a maximum of 12 pieces of NRT gum per day.</description>
