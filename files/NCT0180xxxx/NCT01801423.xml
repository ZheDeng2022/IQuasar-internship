      Given large absolute numbers of individuals with sickle cell disease in Nigeria, hydroxyurea&#xD;
      therapy for all individuals with sickle cell disease may not be initially feasible; however,&#xD;
      a targeted strategy of hydroxyurea use for primary prevention of strokes is an alternative to&#xD;
      the standard therapy (observation) for high-risk individuals. The investigators propose a&#xD;
      feasibility study, Sickle Cell Disease - Stroke Prevention in Nigeria (SPIN) Trial, to&#xD;
      determine whether hydroxyurea can be used for primary prevention of strokes in Nigerian&#xD;
      children with sickle cell anemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common genetic disease in the world. Approximately&#xD;
      150,000 Nigerian children are born each year with SCD, making it the country with the largest&#xD;
      burden of sickle cell disease in the world. SCD is the most common cause of stroke in&#xD;
      children and results in considerable morbidity in affected children. The current primary&#xD;
      prevention approach of regular monthly blood transfusion therapy of children at high risk of&#xD;
      stroke (identified by elevated transcranial Doppler measurements) is not feasible in a low&#xD;
      income country such as Nigeria due to scarcity of supply, cost, and high rate of blood borne&#xD;
      infections. In the United States, hydroxyurea (HU) is standard therapy for adults with SCD&#xD;
      and may be a reasonable prevention alternative to regular blood transfusion for treatment of&#xD;
      primary stroke in high-risk children. Given large absolute numbers of individuals with SCD in&#xD;
      Nigeria, HU therapy for all individuals with SCD may not be initially feasible; however, a&#xD;
      targeted strategy of HU use for primary prevention of strokes is an alternative to the&#xD;
      standard therapy (observation) for high-risk individuals. Study investigators therefore&#xD;
      propose a feasibility study to determine the acceptability of HU for primary prevention of&#xD;
      strokes in Nigerian children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) in preparation for a National&#xD;
      Institute of Health (NIH) sponsored Phase III Trial. Investigators will establish a safety&#xD;
      protocol for using HU in a clinical trial setting and complete the necessary preparations for&#xD;
      a definitive phase III trial. To accomplish these aims study investigators have assembled a&#xD;
      strong multidisciplinary team representing Vanderbilt University and two premier in-country&#xD;
      institutions: Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, Nigeria, and Friends in Global Health-Nigeria.&#xD;
      Completion of a definitive trial will not only benefit children with SCA in sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa, where the majority of children with SCA live in the world, but could provide&#xD;
      reasonable evidence for an alternative to blood transfusion therapy for the primary&#xD;
      prevention of strokes in the US. To our knowledge this would be the first stroke prevention&#xD;
      trial in Nigeria and could establish a precedent to expand to secondary stroke prevention for&#xD;
      children and adults with SCA, as regrettably, no therapy is available to prevent recurrent&#xD;
      stroke in these high-risk patients in resource-poor nations.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hydroxyurea Safety protocol for Children with Sickle Cell Anemia</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Study investigators will evaluate the use of a standard safety protocol, non-dose escalating, for hydroxyurea in children with sickle cell anemia using a protocol similar to the recently completed National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Baby HUG study, published in Lancet.(1) Study investigators expect the proportion of serious adverse reactions, as well as hydroxyurea-related morbidity and mortality, to be very small compared to the benefits. Study investigators will compare the frequency of severe adverse events and hydroxyurea toxicity related events that are associated with hospitalization in those receiving hydroxyurea (n= 60) to those who had normal transcranial Doppler measurements (n= 210) over the course of one year.</description>

    <description>During the course of the current study, study investigators will prepare a manual of operations and case report forms for the proposed trial. Investigators will also solidify working relationships with our colleagues and collaborators at Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital in Kano, Nigeria; and develop and organize all committees, collaborators and study procedures necessary for initiation of a successful, definitive, Phase III Trial.</description>

    <description>Study investigators propose to enroll 60 children with SCA and an elevated TCD measurement between 5 and 12 years of age in this one arm feasibility study of hydroxyurea therapy, with follow-up of at least 12 months per subject. The study intervention will include HU to begin at ~ 20 mg/kg/day(range 17.5 - 26 mg/kg/day). No dose escalation will occur. Given the success of the first year of enrollment and the favorable response of TCD measurement after 3 months on HU therapy, the study investigators have participants as an internal pilot. The definitive phase III trial will now compare low dose HU therapy to the result of no treatment arm from the STOP Trial.</description>

    <description>Hydroxyurea will be prescribed as an investigational therapy by the treating physician. Recommended guidelines for titration of hydroxyurea to maximal tolerated dose are below. The study intervention will include hydroxyurea to begin at ~20 mg/kg/day (range 17.5 - 26 mg/kg/day). No dose escalation will occur as this dose was shown to have some efficacy in infants with SCA and was associated with rare myelosuppression.(1)</description>
