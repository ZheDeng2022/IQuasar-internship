      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial. Phase I clinical trials test the feasibility&#xD;
      and safety of an investigational technique or drug. This study will try to define an&#xD;
      appropriate dose of the investigational drug indocyanine green (ICG) in combination with near&#xD;
      infrared (NIR) imaging to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that this drug,&#xD;
      ICG, is approved by the FDA for other imaging uses, but not for lymphatic mapping using NIR&#xD;
      light. Its use for following lymphatic pathways from tumors in the human body is still being&#xD;
      studied and research doctors are trying to find out more about it. It also means that the FDA&#xD;
      has not approved ICG mapping for your type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICG is a dye and is approved for testing liver function and measuring blood flow from the&#xD;
      heart. This drug has been used in studies to map lymphatic pathways in lung cancer and breast&#xD;
      cancer and information from those other research studies suggests that this dye may help to&#xD;
      identify lymph nodes associated with your esophageal tumor in this research study. ICG can be&#xD;
      detected within the body using special near-infrared light cameras. In this research study,&#xD;
      the investigators are looking at how easily ICG can get to the first lymph node (called the&#xD;
      sentinel lymph node or SLN) associated with your esophageal tumor and whether the&#xD;
      investigators can see the path of the ICG and the respective SLN using a near infrared&#xD;
      camera.&#xD;

      If you are willing to participate in this study you will be asked to undergo a review of your&#xD;
      medical history to confirm that you are eligible. If this review shows that you are eligible&#xD;
      you will begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not&#xD;
      be able to participate in the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your primary surgeon will coordinate the date and time of surgery with you, and the hospital&#xD;
      will confirm this schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of surgery, a dose of ICG mixed with normal saline, a solution of salt and water,&#xD;
      will be administered in four small injections immediately around your tumor. You will receive&#xD;
      approximately half a teaspoon of the normal saline/ICG solution. You will be under general&#xD;
      anesthesia. Pictures of the ICG solution will be taken with the NIR camera and the&#xD;
      progression of the dye, as it makes its way along the lymphatic channel from the location of&#xD;
      your tumor to the SLN, will be monitored. After five to fifteen minutes, the surgeon will&#xD;
      continue with your procedure, removing the lymph nodes according to standard or care. The&#xD;
      surgeon will discuss this with you ahead of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As each lymph node is removed, we will take a picture of it to see if the ICG dye has entered&#xD;
      and colored that node.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the removal of your lymph nodes, your surgeon will complete the operation and you&#xD;
      will continue to be monitored for 30 minutes for any rare but possible side effects (allergic&#xD;
      reactions) to the ICG. You will then be removed from the study. With the exception of the&#xD;
      administration of the ICG and photography with the NIR camera, there will be no changes from&#xD;
      the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following your surgery, we will collect the final pathology results from your procedure.&#xD;
      Because we are only looking at determining the feasibility of this technique using NIR&#xD;
      imaging, we do not wish to follow you for any period of time following the procedure. If you&#xD;
      experience a rare but possible side effect from the ICG, normal saline, or NIR light, we will&#xD;
      continue to monitor you until the condition is resolved.&#xD;
