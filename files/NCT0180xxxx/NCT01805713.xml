    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive genetic disease in Caucasians. It&#xD;
      results in lung disease that affects quality of life and causes early death. Lung damage from&#xD;
      CF starts in infancy and continues over time. Lung damage can negatively affect how the lung&#xD;
      functions. It would be ideal to measure lung damage in CF patients in three instances: (1)&#xD;
      During the first year of life after diagnosis by state newborn screening programs, (2) In&#xD;
      children and adults over long periods of time (years), and (3) During times of illness&#xD;
      (pulmonary exacerbation), to allow for better treatment and therapy to prevent loss of lung&#xD;
      function. The lung is made of elastin, collagen and cartilage. When the lung is damaged by&#xD;
      CF, these components break down into pieces that can be measured in urine, sputum and blood.&#xD;
      These products may represent markers of lung injury. We believe that the levels of these&#xD;
      markers will be increased over time in CF patients and even higher in patients who are sick&#xD;
      with lung symptoms. The goal of my research is to measure the amount of lung breakdown&#xD;
      products in urine, sputum and blood in infants, children and adults with CF during times when&#xD;
      well and also during times of illness. I also hope to use new technologies involving the&#xD;
      study of proteins and metabolites in samples like sputum, urine and blood to help provide new&#xD;
      information regarding CF lung disease. These studies will help us to better treat CF lung&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, observational cohort study of two CF populations (and appropriate&#xD;
      control populations):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants with CF Diagnosed by Newborn Screen: The purpose of this prospective cohort study is&#xD;
      to measure concentrations of biomarkers of lung injury in urine, blood and bronchial alveolar&#xD;
      lavage fluid (BALF) from CF infants. We plan to characterize these concentrations during the&#xD;
      first two years of life with the goal of determining if their profiles alone or in&#xD;
      combination are potentially useful biomarkers of early lung disease in CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each CF infant enrolled has blood, urine and BALF samples, along with an oropharyngeal swab&#xD;
      (throat culture) in conjunction with infant lung function testing at approximately 6 months&#xD;
      of age and again at one year. Our CF Center performs infant Pulmonary Function Tests (PFT's),&#xD;
      throat culture and a blood draw as part of routine care at 6 months and at one year of age,&#xD;
      so the bronchoscopy and urine collection are obtained for research purposes only. Urine is&#xD;
      collected quarterly during routine outpatient clinic visits to the CF Center (4 samples&#xD;
      total/year for two years) which is also for research purposes only. During the second year of&#xD;
      the study, urine, blood and throat swab sample collection plus lung function testing continue&#xD;
      as per year one. In the event of a hospitalization for pulmonary exacerbation, blood and&#xD;
      urine samples are obtained at three time points during hospitalization and BALF samples are&#xD;
      obtained via bronchoscopy upon admission. An oropharyngeal culture is also obtained upon&#xD;
      admission. Subsequent hospitalizations for pulmonary exacerbation are recorded with the same&#xD;
      samples collected as described above. In the event of an outpatient exacerbation requiring&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy, the patient will be asked to provide a urine sample at the onset of&#xD;
      exacerbation. Normal CF treatment or care is not altered in any way by participation in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We collect urine only from age-matched healthy infants as a control group for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with CF â‰¥ 8 Years of Age: The purpose of this prospective cohort study is to measure&#xD;
      concentrations of biomarkers of lung injury in urine, blood and sputum from CF patients. This&#xD;
      is an observational study that does not involve a specific treatment or intervention. We plan&#xD;
      to characterize these concentrations during two years of both clinically stable time points&#xD;
      as well during hospitalizations and outpatient treatments for pulmonary exacerbations. The&#xD;
      study goal is determining if these profiles alone or in combination are potentially useful&#xD;
      biomarkers of early lung disease in CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants (CF Exacerbation Group and CF Non-Exacerbation Group) are asked to&#xD;
      provide urine, blood and sputum samples, as well as pulmonary function tests, during their&#xD;
      regularly scheduled quarterly CF Clinic visits over the study period. Quarterly lung function&#xD;
      testing is standard of care for all CF patients. For those patients in the CF Exacerbation&#xD;
      group, subjects are asked to provide three urine, blood and sputum samples as well as three&#xD;
      sets of pulmonary function before during and after an inpatient hospitalization for a&#xD;
      pulmonary exacerbation. We incorporate PFT's, and labs done as part of their hospital&#xD;
      admission whenever possible, to avoid duplicate testing. All hospitalized patients will&#xD;
      receive their routine, standard-of-care therapies including airway clearance, nutritional&#xD;
      support, IV antibiotics and other pulmonary medications. Treatment or care is not be altered&#xD;
      in any way by participation in this study. If a patient in the CF Non-Exacerbation Group&#xD;
      experiences a pulmonary exacerbation during the study period, samples will be obtained as&#xD;
      described for the CF Exacerbation Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a control group comparison we collect sputum and urine only from volunteers &gt; 8 years of&#xD;
      age who do not have CF.&#xD;
