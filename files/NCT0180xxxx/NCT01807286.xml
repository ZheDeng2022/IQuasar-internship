    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of&#xD;
      pomalidomide that can be given in combination with melphalan and dexamethasone that can be&#xD;
      given to patients with AL amyloidosis. The safety of this drug combination will also be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pomalidomide is designed to change the body's immune system. It may also interfere with the&#xD;
      development of tiny blood vessels that help support tumor growth. This may decrease the&#xD;
      growth of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melphalan is designed to damage the DNA (genetic material) of cells, which may cause cancer&#xD;
      cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that is similar to a natural hormone made by your body.&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is often given to Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients in combination with other&#xD;
      chemotherapy to treat cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Phase I/II Study terminated early during Phase I portion without continuation to&#xD;
      Phase II.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of pomalidomide, based on when you join this study. Up to 4 dose levels of pomalidomide&#xD;
      will be tested for the Phase I portion of this study. Up to 30 participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      at each dose level in the Phase I portion, and up to 24 participants will be enrolled in&#xD;
      Phase II. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group&#xD;
      will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were&#xD;
      seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of pomalidomide is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in the Phase II portion, you will receive pomalidomide at the highest&#xD;
      dose that was tolerated in the Phase I portion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose level of dexamethasone and melphalan. If&#xD;
      intolerable side effects are seen at the lowest dose level, then the melphalan dose will be&#xD;
      lowered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 2 cycles of therapy, you may be referred to a transplant specialist, if you are&#xD;
      eligible for a stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take pomalidomide pills by mouth on Days 1-21 of each cycle. You should take each&#xD;
      dose of pomalidomide at about the same time every day. Swallow the pomalidomide capsules&#xD;
      whole with water at the same time each day. Pomalidomide should be taken without food (at&#xD;
      least 2 hours before or 2 hours after a meal). Do not break, chew, or open the capsules. If&#xD;
      you miss a dose of pomalidomide, take it as soon as you remember on the same day. If you miss&#xD;
      taking your dose for the entire day, take your regular dose the next scheduled day (DO NOT&#xD;
      take double your regular dose to make up for the missed dose). You should tell the study&#xD;
      doctor and/or nurse right away about any missed doses of pomalidomide. If you take more than&#xD;
      the prescribed dose of pomalidomide, you should seek emergency medical care, if needed, and&#xD;
      contact the study staff right away. You will need to return any unused pomalidomide and empty&#xD;
      bottles to the clinic at each study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also be given a study drug diary. Each time you take pomalidomide, melphalan or&#xD;
      dexamethasone at home, you should write down the date, time, and how many capsules or tablets&#xD;
      you took. You should bring the diary in with you at each study visit for the study doctor to&#xD;
      review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1-4 of each cycle, you will take melphalan pills by mouth one time each day. You&#xD;
      should take melphalan in the morning at least 2 hours before or after a meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take dexamethasone pills on Days 1-4 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the&#xD;
      study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks. You will receive a&#xD;
      blood thinner to prevent blood clots. The study doctor will decide what type of blood thinner&#xD;
      you will receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take pomalidomide pills by mouth on Days 1-28 of each cycle during the maintenance&#xD;
      phase. You should take each dose of pomalidomide at about the same time every day. Swallow&#xD;
      the pomalidomide capsules whole with water, at the same time each day. Do not break, chew, or&#xD;
      open the capsules. If you miss a dose of pomalidomide, take it as soon as you remember on the&#xD;
      same day. If you miss taking your dose for the entire day, take your regular dose the next&#xD;
      scheduled day (DO NOT take double your regular dose to make up for the missed dose). You&#xD;
      should tell the study doctor and/or nurse right away about any missed doses of pomalidomide.&#xD;
      If you take more than the prescribed dose of pomalidomide, you should seek emergency medical&#xD;
      care, if needed, and contact the study staff right away. You will need to return any unused&#xD;
      pomalidomide and empty bottles to the clinic at each study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also be given a study drug diary. Each time you take pomalidomide, melphalan, or&#xD;
      dexamethasone at home, you should write down the date, time, and how many capsules or tablets&#xD;
      you took. You should bring the diary in with you at each study visit for the study doctor to&#xD;
      review.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Male patients must agree to use an adequate method of contraception for the duration&#xD;
             of the study since the effects of PMD on the developing human fetus are unknown. If a&#xD;
             female partner of a male subject taking Pomalidomide becomes pregnant, the male&#xD;
             subject taking Pomalidomide should notify the Investigator immediately. The pregnant&#xD;
             female partner should notify their healthcare provider. Female patients must be either&#xD;

&#xD;
         17. Able to take aspirin (81 or 325 mg) daily as prophylactic anticoagulation (patients&#xD;
             intolerant to ASA may use warfarin or low molecular weight heparin).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. All study participants must be registered into the mandatory POMALYST REMSTM program,&#xD;
             and be willing and able to comply with the requirements of the POMALYST REMSTM&#xD;
             program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who are receiving any concurrent investigational agent with known or&#xD;
             suspected activity against amyloidosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Peripheral neuropathy Grade 2 or higher, as defined by National Cancer Institute&#xD;
             Common Terminology Criteria (NCI CTC) version 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease including myocardial infarction within 6&#xD;
             months of enrollment, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure&#xD;
             uncontrolled angina, or clinically significant pericardial disease.&#xD;

          4. Stage III cardiac amyloidosis with NT-proBNP&gt; 8000 ng/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Amyloid-specific syndrome, such as carpal tunnel syndrome or skin purpura as the only&#xD;
             evidence of disease. The finding of vascular amyloid only in a bone marrow biopsy&#xD;
             specimen or in a plasmacytoma is not indicative of systemic amyloidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Presence of non-AL amyloidosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Clinically overt multiple myeloma with definite lytic bone lesions.&#xD;

             hormonal therapy for at least three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Concurrent medical condition or disease, such as active systemic infection,&#xD;
             uncontrolled diabetes, or pulmonary disease, that is likely to interfere with study&#xD;
             procedures or results, or that in the opinion of the investigator would constitute a&#xD;
             hazard for participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Use of any investigational drugs within 30 days before initiation of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients on combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with&#xD;
             pomalidomide. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections&#xD;
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken&#xD;
             in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients with active hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C infection&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Known hypersensitivity to thalidomide or lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. The development of erythema nodosum if characterized by a desquamating rash while&#xD;
             taking thalidomide, pomalidomide or similar drugs.&#xD;
