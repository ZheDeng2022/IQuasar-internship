  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will allow to identify the prevalence of the SLC17A8 gene mutations in patients&#xD;
      suffering from deafness. This phenotype also corresponds to DFNA15 deafness caused by POU4F3&#xD;
      : mutations of this gene will be screened as well.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DFNA are characterized as progressive bilateral deafness. To date, 21 genes and 57 loci are&#xD;
      involved in these dominant deafness, with an unknown prevalence.A 22nd gene responsible of&#xD;
      the disease has been found. This SLC17A8 gene encodes for the VGLUT3 protein which is&#xD;
      specifically expressed in sensorial cells of the audition. VGlut3-/- mice present a deep&#xD;
      deafness due to a deficiency of neurotransmitter release, although sensorial cells and&#xD;
      neurons are intact. This kind of deafness is an ideal candidate for a genetic therapy because&#xD;
      of the cells integrity.Mutations of SLC17A8 gene have been found in 2 american families that&#xD;
      suffer from progressive deafness.The study aims to look for european families from the&#xD;
      Mediterranean basin, which carry SLC17A8 gene mutations, and may benefit in a medium-term&#xD;
      from genetic therapy. The study will allow to identify the prevalence of the SLC17A8 gene&#xD;
      mutations in patients suffering from deafness. This phenotype also corresponds to DFNA15&#xD;
      deafness caused by POU4F3 : mutations of this gene will be screened as well.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. suggestive neurosensory Deafness: The characteristics of the deafness will be&#xD;
                  determined from the data of the questionnaire, of the interrogation, the&#xD;
                  examination and results of the tonal audiometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  *Neurosensory deafness: Audiometrics measurement(difference between the tonal&#xD;
                  audiometric average loss for the frequencies 0,5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz in air&#xD;
                  conduction and in osseous conduction) &lt; 15 dB for each of both ears.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Bilateral symetric: difference between the audiometric thresholds of both&#xD;
                       ears &lt; or = 15 dB for at least two frequencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Light to severe: The degree of deafness is defined according to the&#xD;
                       following classification (moderate hearing loss calculated on the&#xD;
                       frequencies 500 Hz, 1, 2 and 4 kHz): light hearing deficiency from 20 to 40&#xD;
