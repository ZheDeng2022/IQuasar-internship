    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending dose study of&#xD;
      orally administered AVE8112 in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD). Sequential cohorts of&#xD;
      eight patients with PD will be administered ascending oral doses of AVE8112 (n=6) or placebo&#xD;
      (n=2) once a day for 14 days. Dosing for subsequent cohorts will only proceed, and the dose&#xD;
      level selected, after the safety and tolerability of the previous cohort has been reviewed.&#xD;
      Doses are planned to be 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 mg once a day for 14 days. These are planned&#xD;
      treatments, but doses may be modified based on safety review of previous cohort(s). In&#xD;
      addition, cohorts may be added to reconfirm a previously administered dose, and/or a&#xD;
      titration strategy may be employed to reach a desired dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed in clinic for 30 hours following the initial oral dose of AVE8112&#xD;
      or placebo. Subsequent dosing will occur on an outpatient basis. Patients will receive&#xD;
      telephone calls on Days 3 and 10 to monitor for adverse events (AEs) and concomitant&#xD;
      medications, and will also be assessed in the clinic on Study Days 7 (outpatient), 14&#xD;
      (outpatient), and 28 (± 3 days) (Follow-up visit). Safety assessments will include physical&#xD;
      examinations, vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory evaluations, Movement Disorder Society&#xD;
      Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), and Columbia Suicide Severity Rating&#xD;
      Scale (C-SSRS). Pharmacodynamic assessment will include the Parkinson's Disease Cognitive&#xD;
      Rating Scale (PD-CRS).&#xD;
