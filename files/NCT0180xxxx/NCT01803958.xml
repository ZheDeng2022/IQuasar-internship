      This study was designed and developed in the Emilia Romania research and innovation program&#xD;
      (PRI ER). The study does not have commercial sponsors and comes under the independent studies&#xD;
      provided for by Ministerial Decree 17.12.2005. The PRI ER program will guarantee a&#xD;
      contribution to the study for the first three years of recruitment through the regional&#xD;
      Innovation Fund, to cover the costs of coordination and data management sustained by the&#xD;
      Coordinating Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives The study proposes to evaluate whether partial hypofractionated and&#xD;
      accelerated irradiation of the sole surgical cavity, in patients suffering from breast cancer&#xD;
      with low risk of local recurrence and who undergo conservative surgery, is not inferior to&#xD;
      postoperative irradiation with conventional fractionation of the entire breast as regards&#xD;
      local control (incidence of ipsilateral recurrences as prime event).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives Comparison of the global survivals, freedom from locoregional&#xD;
      recurrences (with exception for contralateral tumors and second tumors), distant relapse-free&#xD;
      (except for local or regional relapses or in the contralateral breast) in patients treated&#xD;
      with conventional radiotherapy and accelerated partial radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate whether accelerated partial irradiation offers cosmetic results, acute toxicity&#xD;
      comparable with conventional irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible connection with other national and international studies Similar studies which&#xD;
      nonetheless evaluate different methods of partial irradiation are currently underway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Multicenter phase III controlled randomized, unblinded study of non-inferiority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of cases Recruitment of 3302 patients is planned. Target Population of the Study Women&#xD;
      aged = &gt; 49, ECOG 0-2, undergoing conservative breast surgery for invasive breast cancer, pT&#xD;
      1-2 (&lt; 3 cm in diameter) pN0-N1 M0, unifocal, resection margins histologically negative (³ 2&#xD;
      mm) at first intervention or after subsequent widening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the recruitment and of the subsequent follow-up A recruitment of 8 years is&#xD;
      planned and a follow-up period of 5 years for an overall duration of the study of 13 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomized to receive one of the following treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial arm 38.5 Gy total in 10 fractions (3.85 Gy per fraction), twice a day with an interval&#xD;
      of at least 6 hours between the two fractions, for five consecutive working days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control arm 50.0 Gy in 25 fractions (2 Gy per fraction), once a day for 5 days in the week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints Primary: survival free of local ipsilateral recurrence as prime event Secondary:&#xD;
      global survival, locoregional recurrence-free, distant recurrence-free, acute and late&#xD;
      toxicity (RTOG) and cosmetic result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation and Follow-Up Program Controls are planned during the radiotherapy, at the end of&#xD;
      treatment, at 6 weeks, 3-6-12 months from the end of the radiotherapy and then once a year&#xD;
      until the end of 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Partial irradiation will be considered not inferior to the standard irradiation&#xD;
      if the top extreme of the HR confidence interval at 95% (to endpoint) does not exceed the&#xD;
      established value of 1.5 The study was sized in relation to the rate of local ipsilateral&#xD;
      breast recurrences as prime event at 5 years and assuming that this rate in the standard&#xD;
      treatment group is 4%, accepting as maximum Hazard Ratio inferior to 1.5 and error a and b&#xD;
      equal respectively to 0.05 and 0.10 and test at an endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survivals will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The hazard ratio (HR) will be&#xD;
      calculated using the Cox model and its confidence interval at 95% will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Aspects and Informed Consent For participation in the study an informed consent is&#xD;
      planned appropriately drawn up and submitted to the approval of the Ethics Committees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical study will be carried out according to the ethical principles of the Helsinki&#xD;
      Declaration, the GCP guidelines, the Italian laws and regulatory activities for carrying out&#xD;
      clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before formal commencement of the study its approval/sole opinion by the reference Ethics&#xD;
      Committee of the proposing group is stipulated. The individual investigators of the different&#xD;
      participating institutions are directly responsible for the submission for approval of the&#xD;
      protocol by their Ethics Committees.&#xD;
