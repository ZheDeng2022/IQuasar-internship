  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study includes a randomized clinical trial of a peer health education&#xD;
      intervention and a 12-month longitudinal study. The sample will include Black Men who have&#xD;
      Sex with Men (MSM) who will be randomized into an experimental or control condition and then&#xD;
      asked to recruit peer and risk network members for HIV testing over a 3 month period. Some of&#xD;
      the network members who are recruited for voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) will enroll&#xD;
      into the longitudinal study for assessments only. Both index and network participants will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline, 6, and 12-months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the proposed study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Train Black MSM (index participants in the experimental condition) to conduct peer&#xD;
           health education, to promote VCT and HIV risk reduction among social network members,&#xD;
           and to recruit social network members for VCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine changes in HIV risk behaviors and VCT among index participants and their network&#xD;
           members in the experimental intervention as compared to those in the control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine mediating effects of social environments (networks, social norms) on HIV risk&#xD;
           behaviors and VCT, among indexes and network members.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Examine mediating effects of individual level factors (substance use and depression) on&#xD;
           HIV risk behaviors and VCT among indexes and network members.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this funded research is to conduct a randomized controlled trial of&#xD;
      an experimental behavioral intervention that will train African American men who have sex&#xD;
      with men (AA MSM) to 1) conduct peer health education, 2) to promote HIV risk reduction among&#xD;
      their social network members, 3) promote HIV voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) among&#xD;
      their social network members and 4) recruit social network members for VCT. Index&#xD;
      participants are African American/Black men who have sex with men (MSM) who are randomized to&#xD;
      either a peer education intervention or comparison condition. After the baseline is complete,&#xD;
      index participants refer social network members (i.e. network participants) to the research&#xD;
      clinic for HIV antibody testing. In addition, a subset of network participants participate in&#xD;
      the longitudinal portion of the study.&#xD;
