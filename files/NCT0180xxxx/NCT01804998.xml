    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic sentinel lymph node biopsy and stomach preserving surgery in early gastric&#xD;
      cancer is less invasive method which can increase quality of life. For last two years,&#xD;
      multicenter quality control study (Phase II) has been performed in Korea and tolerable&#xD;
      results were observed. Based on these results, multicenter phase III trial is required to&#xD;
      validate the clinical role of laparoscopic sentinel lymph node biopsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The final analyses include the modified intention to treatment analysis (full analysis set)&#xD;
      and Per Protocol analysis (including patients who underwent assigned surgery without&#xD;
      agreement withdrawal).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Injection of tracer and sentinel basin dissection&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tracer: Tc 99m HSA (Human serum albumin, 2ml, 0.1mCi/ml) + ICG (indocyanine green,&#xD;
                2ml, 5mg/ml)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Endoscopic injection of tracer on 4 sites around gastric cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Identification of sentinel basin using laparoscopic probe (Neoprobe)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Laparoscopic sentinel basin dissection and identification of sentinel node at back&#xD;
                table&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Surgical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If positive sentinel nodes were diagnosed in frozen section, conventional&#xD;
                gastrectomy is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If micrometastasis or isolate tumor cells in sentinel basin lymph nodes were&#xD;
                diagnosed in the permanent pathology, re-operation of conventional gastrectomy is&#xD;
                not performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  However, re-operation of converntional gastrectomy should be performed in case of&#xD;
                macrometastasis, deep and lateral margin positive, more than pT2 lesion in the&#xD;
                permanent pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. H.pylori eradication - There was no clear evidence that H.pylori eradication reduced&#xD;
           development of metachronous gastric cancer. H.pylori eradication was planned to perform&#xD;
           according to physician's decision or patient's need. However, recently, the effect of&#xD;
           H.pylori eradication in development of metachronous gastric cancer was published in NEJM&#xD;
           (Choi et al. 2018). Therefore, from now on, H. pylori eradication will be recommended to&#xD;
           enrolled patients with H.pylori.&#xD;

    <description>Survey for quality of life will be performed regularly for three years after surgery. Measurement tool is the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ) C30 and STO22. In EORTC QLQ C30, there are 1 global health status scale, 5 functonal scales, and 9 symptom scales/items. EORTC QLQ STO22 includes 5 symptom scales and 4 single items. Each scale and item ranges 0 to 100. Higher score of global health status and functinoal scales indicate better quality of life and lower score of symptom scales indicates better quality of life. There is no summed score in these questionnaires.</description>
