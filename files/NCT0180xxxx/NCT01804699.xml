  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited condition that may&#xD;
      cause life threatening irregular heart rhythms that often manifest as unexpected cardiac&#xD;
      arrest or sudden death in early adulthood. The condition is difficult to diagnose and often&#xD;
      is not noticed until a family member suffers a cardiac arrest or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Canadian National ARVC registry will collect data from Inherited Heart Rhythm Clinics&#xD;
      across Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the natural history of ARVC (short/intermediate term), including risk of&#xD;
           symptomatic arrhythmias and sudden death, for patients with the phenotype and those gene&#xD;
           positive patients without phenotype evidence of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To understand risk factors for sudden death/appropriate ICD use in ARVC, including test&#xD;
           characteristics/performance and their relationship to outcomes (ECG, Holter, signal&#xD;
           averaged ECG, loop recorders, imaging, voltage mapping, T wave alternans, cardiac biopsy&#xD;
           and biomarkers).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To establish a phenotype genotype correlation, including comparison of patients with&#xD;
           disease causing mutations, variants of unknown significance (VUS) and Task Force&#xD;
           Criteria (TFC) positive, gene negative patients&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a familial condition characterized&#xD;
      by onset of life threatening ventricular arrhythmias in early adulthood, presenting with&#xD;
      ventricular tachycardia, cardiac arrest or sudden death1. The disease is diagnosed with a&#xD;
      wide range of tests that focus on imaging the right ventricle and assessing for ambient&#xD;
      arrhythmia or abnormal electrical substrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These factors are collated into a score that forms the ARVC Task Force Criteria, known to be&#xD;
      specific but not sensitive 2, 3. These criteria have been revised in 2010, introducing a&#xD;
      broader and more quantitative approach to diagnosis including genetic testing results,&#xD;
      intended to enhance sensitivity without reducing specificity 4. An online tool for Task Force&#xD;
      Criteria calculation has been developed by the Principal Investigator that enables&#xD;
      calculation in real time, with export to PDF and excel format, free for public use&#xD;
      (http://qstatistic.com/pdg/public.php?rep=arvc_cri).These criteria take into account&#xD;
      electrocardiographic and imaging findings, along with tissue analysis and family history.&#xD;
      They account for findings from genetic testing, confounded in part by the unknown&#xD;
      significance of a positive genetic test in the absence of a phenotype in a disease with&#xD;
      variable penetrance and expressivity 2, 4-12. The disease is predominantly caused by defects&#xD;
      in cell-cell adhesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECT APPROVAL PROCESS: For new projects and further analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      New projects and proposals for the Canadian National ARVC Registry will be reviewed on a&#xD;
      case-by-case basis by the Steering Committee. The following items must be included with each&#xD;
      new proposal:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Project description with necessary background, hypotheses and methodology/protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A comprehensive list of funding source(s) with a detailed budget&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Local Research Ethics Board (REB) approval&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT RECRUITMENT &amp; SCREENING PROCESS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients will be approached to participate in the Registry in specialty clinics who are&#xD;
           involved in the Registry across Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Once informed consent is obtained ARVC affected patients will undergo baseline data&#xD;
           collection including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Collection of standard clinical testing for ARVC (if affected patient) according to&#xD;
                local clinical practice i.e. MRI, ECG etc. Family members will undergo screening as&#xD;
                deemed necessary by the local investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Baseline clinical history&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Family history and exercise history&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. A family pedigree will be constructed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. An online tool for pedigree construction has been developed by the Principal&#xD;
                Investigator Dr. Andrew Krahn that enables creation of pedigrees in real time as&#xD;
                well as the linking of patients in a genetics database, with export to PDF format,&#xD;
                (demonstration version at https://ocrr.ca/pdg/i.php?loc=dmo, contact&#xD;
                kgibbs@providencehealth.bc.ca for access)&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Patients will be enrolled in the database as prevalent cases that were previously&#xD;
                identified, or incident cases&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Other testing if applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Genetic Information (if applicable). Once informed consent has been obtained patients&#xD;
           will undergo baseline data collection and will be invited to participate in the optional&#xD;
           DNA biobanking arm of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Genetic Screening for ARVC is a standard clinical evaluation for individuals with ARVC&#xD;
           as well as their 1st degree family members this will be done clinically and sent to&#xD;
           commercial laboratories as per the standard at each of the enrolling centres&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If the participant consents to the biobanking arm of the study an additional blood&#xD;
           sample (Please see the ARVC Lab Manual for details) will be collected at baseline and&#xD;
           stored for subsequent analysis. These analyses may include measurement of serum Troponin&#xD;
           T, NT-pro-BNP, C-reactive protein and other biomarkers to determine their association&#xD;
           with the progression of disease; both in terms of cardiac structure (i.e. change in&#xD;
           right ventricular volume) and electrical substrate (i.e. number of ICD shocks) over&#xD;
           time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients will be required to provide written informed consent to participate in the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The local Research Ethics Board (REB) must approve all informed consent documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All demographic information, clinical testing and genetic results will be entered into a&#xD;
           password-protected database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core Data Set (required):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The core data set consists of baseline and follow-up clinical testing that will establish&#xD;
      participant eligibility according to 2010 Revised Task Force Criteria. The core data set will&#xD;
      include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Resting ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Signal averaged ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Transthoracic echocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Treadmill exercise test&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 24 hour Holter monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Cardiac MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional test results (if clinically indicated):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following comprises a typical list of additional test results that may be collected if&#xD;
      available. These test results can be collected if they are clinically indicated for the&#xD;
      participant(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Right ventricular angiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Right ventricular biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Right ventricular voltage map&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Ability to induce ventricular tachycardia at Electrophysiologic testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Transesophageal echocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. T wave alternans&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Cardiac CT scan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic Testing and Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Optional blood drawn for banking at PHRI will be processed at each local site and&#xD;
           shipped in Cryovials for banking at PHRI in Hamilton, Ontario. Specimen(s) collected&#xD;
           (i.e. blood, saliva, DNA) will be processed locally before shipping to PHRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood drawn for standard clinical ARVC genetic testing at commercial laboratories in&#xD;
           Canada (For example: in Ontario both SickKids Department of Paediatric Laboratory&#xD;
           Medicine and CHEO Molecular Genetics Diagnostic Laboratory perform ARVC testing) can be&#xD;
           packaged and shipped according to each of the local sites labs independent&#xD;
           specifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Genetic testing results will be entered into a secure, password-protected database.&#xD;
           These results are further de-identified with a code list so that there is no linkage to&#xD;
           clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits for the Registry will occur on an annual basis with the following testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Resting ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Signal averaged ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 24 hour Holter Monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Clinical History&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Screening for any new cardiac symptoms, such as: syncope, palpitations, cardiac arrest,&#xD;
           ICD implant, ICD therapy and sudden death&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical follow-up data will be collected according to standard local practice. It is ideal&#xD;
      to reassess participants clinically, however if this is not feasible for some reason - a&#xD;
      telephone interview can be conducted to assess any new clinical findings or new events that&#xD;
      have taken place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the site wishes to conduct a telephone follow up - the following clinical testing is still&#xD;
      required for the annual follow up visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Resting ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Signal averaged ECG if possible&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 24 hour Holter Monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECGs and Holter tracings can be obtained from remote areas and the findings entered into the&#xD;
      database for annual follow up purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-Year Reassessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 years participation in the study, participants will be reassessed based on the 2010&#xD;
      task force criteria. This includes the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Resting ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Signal averaged ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Transthoracic echocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Treadmill exercise test&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 24 hour Holter monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Cardiac MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Clinical History&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Screening for any new cardiac symptoms, such as: syncope, palpitations, cardiac arrest,&#xD;
           ICD implant, ICD therapy and sudden death&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no obligation to enter data beyond the 3 year mark, however sites are&#xD;
      encouraged to continue follow up for participants indefinitely. The Registry is open-ended&#xD;
      and with local REB approval participant's follow up data can continue to be entered as long&#xD;
      as it is declared in the letter of information originally given to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data points for collection are present in the internet based database (see online demo at&#xD;
      https://www.qstatistic.com/arvc/demo ). The database is hosted on the University of British&#xD;
      Columbia Research Institute Vancouver British Columbia. The research institute is in&#xD;
      compliance with national Canadian PIPEDA privacy guidelines. Data will be entered directly&#xD;
      into the e-CRFs for electronic submission to a server located at UBC Research&#xD;
      Institute,Vancouver BC and will not collect any personal identifiers (password protected&#xD;
      internet based system).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal identifiers will not be collected and subject confidentiality will be further&#xD;
      ensured in addition to maintaining de-identification by utilizing subject identification code&#xD;
      numbers to correspond to data in the computerized files. Original files containing patient&#xD;
      information will remain on file with the participating Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual subject medical information obtained as a result of this trial is considered&#xD;
      confidential and disclosure to third parties is prohibited except for the following reason;&#xD;
      medical information may be given to the subject's personal physician or to other appropriate&#xD;
      medical personnel responsible for the subject's welfare. The eCRF (electronic clinical&#xD;
      research form) system works best in the Internet browser Firefox©. This Internet browser can&#xD;
      be downloaded from www.mozilla.org.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to the eCRFs will be issued once the site has local Ethics approval. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, principles laid down in the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as defined by the International&#xD;
      Conference on Harmonization (ICH), where applicable, and all other local regulatory&#xD;
      requirements. Before study initiation, the enrolling site Investigator must have written and&#xD;
      dated approval/favorable opinion from the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics&#xD;
      Committee (IRB/IEC) for the protocol, and consent form.&#xD;
