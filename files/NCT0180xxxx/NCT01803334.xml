  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study looking at patient's satisfaction with incision site and location after&#xD;
      undergoing minimally invasive gynecologic surgery. (Laparoscopy) The study group will have&#xD;
      the anticipated incision marked with a washable marker on their abdomen. The control group&#xD;
      will have preoperative counselling as usual. After surgery, will assess patient's&#xD;
      satisfaction with the incision scar.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial examining the impact of marking the&#xD;
      patient abdomen at the time of the preoperative visit on patient's satisfaction with scar&#xD;
      appearance and symptoms, and pain at the incision site after undergoing minimally invasive&#xD;
      gynecologic surgery for benign conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that preoperative marking and instruction about incision expectations will&#xD;
      improve patient's postoperative satisfaction with scar appearance and symptoms as well as&#xD;
      decrease incision site pain compared to traditional preoperative counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that will undergo laparoscopic surgical intervention will be identified. The patient&#xD;
      will be randomized into two groups: preoperative marking the abdomen versus conventional&#xD;
      preoperative counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is randomized to the marking the abdomen group (study group) she will then&#xD;
      have the anticipated incision needed to place the trocars during her surgery marked on her&#xD;
      abdomen by the surgeon attending physician involved in the patient care during the&#xD;
      preoperative counseling visit. If she is randomized to the control group, then she will&#xD;
      undergo traditional preoperative counseling by the same team without marking the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completed the surgery, information regarding type of surgery, reason for the procedure,&#xD;
      estimated blood loss, surgical length, complications, location and size of abdominal&#xD;
      incisions made on the patient's abdomen will be collected. Then at the 6 weeks post op visit,&#xD;
      patient's satisfaction with the incision scar will be evaluated with a validated patient scar&#xD;
      assessment questionnaire form and by one 5 point Likert scale question used in previous&#xD;
      studies. The pain at rest at the incision site will be evaluated by a Visual Analog Pain&#xD;
      Scale (VAS). Patients will also be asked to evaluate their generalized pain using a modified&#xD;
      McGill Present Pain Intensity Scale.&#xD;
