    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted the study in 4 teaching hospitals and 2 non-teaching hospitals of&#xD;
      Shaanxi Province. Surgeons, clinical pharmacists and nurses took part in patient collection,&#xD;
      information registration, protocol performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recruited 1200 patients with inguinal hernia undergoing inguinal&#xD;
      hernioplasty in the six hospitals from January 2010 to July 2011. The patients were randomly&#xD;
      allocated into control group, cefazolin group and levofloxacin group, with digital meter&#xD;
      method , 400 in each group. The data such as age, sex, case number, length of hospital stay,&#xD;
      antibiotic usage, post-operative infection, infection site, bacterial culture were filled in&#xD;
      self-designed forms on computer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All of the patients received tension-free inguinal hernia repair with a mesh plug. The&#xD;
      surgical-site infection (SSI) was diagnosed according to the criteria of the Centers for&#xD;
      Disease Control and Prevention [5-6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      We chose cefazolin sodium and levofloxacin sodium chloride injection as peri-operative&#xD;
      antibiotics. Cefazolin sodium is an effective antibiotic with a short plasma elimination&#xD;
      half-life against gram-positive cocci (GPC) except for enterococci and meticillin-resistant&#xD;
      staphylococci. It is recommended as one of the prior antibacterial agents used for clearing&#xD;
      cuts and preventing infection in many countries including China. Levofloxacin sodium chloride&#xD;
      injection has a wide anti-bacterial spectrum composed of gram-negative bacteria and&#xD;
      gram-positive anaerobic bacteria including anaerobic bacteria. It can remain a high&#xD;
      concentration in urine, so it is recommended as an attractive antibiotic for urinary tract&#xD;
      operation [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group, we gave normal saline as placebo by intravenous drip infusion for 30-60&#xD;
      min before operation. Cefazolin group and levofloxacin group received intravenous&#xD;
      administration of cefazolin sodium 1000 mg and levofloxacin sodium chloride injection 200 mg,&#xD;
      respectively, for 30-60 min before operation.&#xD;
