  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ocular blood flow has been consistently demonstrated to be altered in glaucoma patients when&#xD;
      compared to otherwise healthy individuals. Numerous Doppler studies have shown a decrease in&#xD;
      flow velocities in the retrobulbar arteries in what appears to be related to the degree of&#xD;
      the glaucomatous disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anatomic pathway of the several arteries into the eye is intricately complicate, with at&#xD;
      least one of them (the central retina artery) penetrating the optic nerve before entering the&#xD;
      eye and supplying the innermost structures of the globe. As the optic nerve is surrounded by&#xD;
      a layer of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which is in continuity with the rest of the central&#xD;
      nervous system, this central retinal artery has also to cross this CSF containing&#xD;
      compartment. Because of the intrinsic pressure this CSF - corresponding to the intracranial&#xD;
      pressure at the orbital level - the possibility exists that this pressure around the optic&#xD;
      disc could affect the blood flow of the arteries that go through it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will try to detect if a correlation exists between the optic nerve sheath&#xD;
      diameter and the blood flow in the retrobulbar vessels of glaucoma patients.&#xD;

      1. Visual field testing will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Structural analysis of the retinal nerve fiber layer (through confocal microscopy)will&#xD;
           be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Color Doppler Imaging of the retrobulbar vessels will be performed. Peak and end&#xD;
           diastolic velocities, resistivity index will be calculated from the Doppler waveform.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. B-scan ultrasound of the optic nerve sheath diameter will be performed. the measure will&#xD;
           take place at 3mm behind the globe.&#xD;
