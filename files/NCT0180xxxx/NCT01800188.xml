    <textblock>
      Disturbed glucose metabolism is a common feature of patients with end-stage renal disease&#xD;
      (ESRD). Several hormones responsible of a stable blood glucose including insulin, glucagon,&#xD;
      and the gastrointestinal insulinotropic hormones Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) and&#xD;
      Glucose-dependent Insulinotropic Peptide (GIP) are elevated in patients with ESRD. These&#xD;
      hormones are all medium sized peptides which theoretically makes them removable during high&#xD;
      efficient hemodialysis. A significant removal could have consequences for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with diabetes and ESRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether insulin, glucagon, GLP-1 and GIP are&#xD;
      cleared during high efficient hemodialysis and hemodiafiltration. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that a significant amount of these hormones is removed during hemodialysis and to&#xD;
      a larger extend during hemodiafiltration.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disturbed glucose metabolism is a common feature of patients with end-stage renal disease&#xD;
      (ESRD). Furthermore, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in the ESRD population is high&#xD;
      resulting in a marked increased morbidity and mortality. Several hormones responsible of a&#xD;
      stable blood glucose including insulin, glucagon, and the gastrointestinal insulinotropic&#xD;
      hormones Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) and Glucose-dependent Insulinotropic Peptide (GIP)&#xD;
      are elevated and dysregulated in patients with ESRD. Newly developed antidiabetic medications&#xD;
      such as the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4 inhibitors) increase the concentrations&#xD;
      of these hormones making the effect of these treatments difficult to predict in patients with&#xD;
      ESRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the history of hemodialysis the treatment has been refined to increase the removal of&#xD;
      the various substances that accumulate when the kidney function declines. The focus has&#xD;
      primary been on the removal of smaller molecules such as creatinine and urea, but in recent&#xD;
      decades the focus has moved to medium-sized molecules (molecular weight of 300 to 12,000 Da)&#xD;
      which are suspected of causing various uremic complications such as amyloidosis and&#xD;
      neuropathy. The dialysis technique has therefore been optimized such that relatively large&#xD;
      molecules are removed, but the dialysis filter does not distinguish between wanted and&#xD;
      unwanted substances. Thus, in contrast to the functioning kidney there is a risk of removing&#xD;
      important molecules including hormones, which are essential for maintaining a normal glucose&#xD;
      metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin, glucagon and the incretin hormones, GLP-1 and GIP are all peptides with a molecular&#xD;
      weight of 3300 to 5800 Da. This means that they theoretically have a size where they can be&#xD;
      removed under hemodialysis with so-called high-flux filters and by hemodiafiltration, both of&#xD;
      which are common standards of care for patients with ESRD. It has been shown that insulin is&#xD;
      removed in significant quantities during a hemodialysis, but this is probably due to&#xD;
      adsorption to the filter and not filtration. Whether glucagon and the incretin hormones are&#xD;
      eliminated by high effective hemodialysis and hemodiafiltration is never investigated.&#xD;
      Previous studies have primarily observed unchanged glucagon and GIP concentrations in the&#xD;
      blood after conventional hemodialysis. One study showed a 30% decrease in GIP concentration&#xD;
      after hemodialysis, but the detected change probably reflects altered metabolism due to the&#xD;
      treatment as the dialysis technique at the time was too inefficient to remove peptides&#xD;
      significantly. Assays for the analysis of incretin hormones have also become considerably&#xD;
      more specific and now differentiate between the active hormones and their inactive&#xD;
      intermediate metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years there has been a growing development of drugs that increase the endogenous&#xD;
      produced incretin hormones. Linagliptin, launched in 2011, is the only one that is approved&#xD;
      for patients with ESRD since it is not cleared renally and therefore does not require a&#xD;
      change in dosage. However, the elimination of incretin hormones in dialysis patients is&#xD;
      sparingly studied both during and between dialysis treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will determine the effect of high efficient dialysis treatment on a number of&#xD;
      hormones regulating the blood glucose. Significant elimination of these hormones during&#xD;
      dialysis can have therapeutic implications for the treatment of dialysis patients with&#xD;
      incretin based therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether several blood glucose-regulating hormones&#xD;
      and their metabolites are removed during hemodialysis and hemodiafiltration in patients with&#xD;
      dialysis-dependent renal insufficiency. The hypothesis is that the dialysis treatment results&#xD;
      in a significant removal, thereby reducing the plasma concentration of each hormone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 patients with ESRD undergoing either chronic hemodialysis or chronic hemodiafiltration&#xD;
      will be included. The study will be carried out on two separate days which are planned two&#xD;
      days after their previous dialysis. On the two study days each participant will be treated&#xD;
      with a 4 hour hemodialysis or hemodiafiltration. Besides the dialysis modality (hemodialysis&#xD;
      and hemodiafiltration) the two study days will be alike.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be examined in the morning in a 10 hour fasting state (including&#xD;
      smoking) without any alcohol consumption within the last 24 hours and strenuous physical&#xD;
      activity within the last 2 hours. Weight, Height, blood pressure and pulse will be measured&#xD;
      and the dialysis access is prepared. An initial blood sample will be analyzed immediately for&#xD;
      sodium, bicarbonate and ionized calcium and the dialysate of the dialyzer will be adjusted to&#xD;
      match the measured concentrations as close as possible. The ultrafiltration will be set&#xD;
      according to the patients dry weight and no sodium or ultrafiltration profiles will be&#xD;
      allowed. The blood flow will be held constant not exceeding the half of the flow of the&#xD;
      arteriovenous fistula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant at each study day will receive the dialysis fasting for one hour after which&#xD;
      a standardized liquid meal with 1.5 mg Paracetamol added will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the dialysis blood samples will be measured repeatedly and analyzed for insulin,&#xD;
      glucagon, GLP-1 and GIP. Blood samples will be drawn both before and after the dialysis&#xD;
      filter to calculate the clearance and samples from the spend dialysate are collected to&#xD;
      determine the amount of adsorption of the hormones to the dialysis filter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo an optional third examination day receiving the standardized meal test&#xD;
      without dialysis. Blood samples are collected at the same time intervals as during the&#xD;
      examination days with dialysis.&#xD;
