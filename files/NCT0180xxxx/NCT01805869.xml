      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The third molars (wisdom teeth) normally grow in during late adolescence or early&#xD;
      adulthood. Many people need or choose to have these teeth removed with oral surgery.&#xD;
      Normally, the removed teeth and tissue are thrown away as medical waste. However, oral health&#xD;
      researchers want to collect the teeth and tissue for research. They also want to encourage&#xD;
      dentists at the National Institutes of Health to improve their skills in oral surgery. This&#xD;
      study will collect the teeth and tissue of people who need to have oral surgery to remove&#xD;
      their wisdom teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide continued dental skills training for dentists at the National Institutes of&#xD;
           Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect teeth and tissue samples following wisdom tooth removal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 16 and 50 who need to have their wisdom teeth removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will involve a minimum of three visits. There will be a screening visit, a&#xD;
           surgery visit, and at least one follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. A full dental&#xD;
           exam with x-rays will be given to evaluate the need for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the second visit, participants will have oral surgery to remove their wisdom teeth.&#xD;
           The teeth and tissue removed during the surgery will be collected for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive drugs to control the pain after surgery. They will also be&#xD;
           able to contact a dentist if there are any problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Between 7 and 21 days after surgery, participants will have a followup visit to check&#xD;
           the healing. If they are having no problems, this will be the last visit. If there are&#xD;
           any postsurgery issues, they will be scheduled for additional visits as needed.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this protocol is to evaluate and provide treatment for subjects who have a&#xD;
      clinical indication for the routine extraction of dental third molar wisdom teeth with the&#xD;
      aim to allow investigators to maintain their expertise in dental clinical care, gain&#xD;
      additional knowledge about oral health and to utilize surgical waste collected from these&#xD;
      patients for research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will enroll a convenience sample of 10000 subjects ages greater than or equal to&#xD;
      16-50 in need of clinically indicated, routine extraction of third molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an evaluation, treatment and training protocol. Subjects will receive standard&#xD;
      evaluation and treatment for clinically indicated, routine extraction of third molars.&#xD;
      Subjects will report to the NIDCR dental clinic for at least three visits. The first visit&#xD;
      will be a screening evaluation to determine the clinical need for third molar extraction and&#xD;
      protocol eligibility. Eligible subjects will return for a second visit for third molar&#xD;
      extraction. Oral specimens removed during the standard procedure of third molar extraction&#xD;
      will be distributed for research. A third visit will be scheduled approximately one week&#xD;
      after surgery for a post-operative clinical evaluation. Data collection will include&#xD;
      demographics, pain management, medication regimen and adverse events to examine its effect on&#xD;
      clinical outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no research planned under this protocol. However, data is collected for purposes of&#xD;
      research and clinical quality assurance. If trends emerge that warrant further exploration,&#xD;
      outcome measures will be described when IRB approval or determination of exemption is&#xD;
      requested to carry out the project.&#xD;

             need) for third molar extraction as determined by medical, dental, and radiographic&#xD;
             evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to allow for the collection of waste tissue (e.g., teeth, alveolar bone,&#xD;

             status I or II&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to have third molar extraction as determined by NIDCR surgeon/dentist, due to&#xD;
             medical conditions (beyond ASA I or II), complexity of the surgery, or history that&#xD;
             precludes safe outpatient conscious sedation. These clinical decisions will be based&#xD;
             on the risks and benefits related to the surgery.&#xD;
