      Background- In recurrent urinary tract infections (RUTIs) usual prophylactic antibiotic&#xD;
      regimes do not change the long term risk of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective- D-Mannose is a sugar, it sticks to E. coli bacteria, the aim of the study was to&#xD;
      evaluate its efficacy in the treatment and prophylaxis of recurrent UTIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design, setting and participants- : In this crossover trial female patient were eligible for&#xD;
      the study if they had recurrent UTIs, that is three ore more episodes during the preceding 12&#xD;
      months. Suitable patients were randomly assigned to antibiotic treatment with&#xD;
      trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or to a regimen of oral D Mannose for 24 weeks, and received&#xD;
      the other intervention in the second phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurements and statistical analysis- The time to recurrence of UTI, bladder pain&#xD;
      (VAS p) and urinary urgency (VAS u) were evaluated at the end of antibiotic therapy and at&#xD;
      the and of 24 weeks fo D Mannose. The results for quantitative variables were expressed as&#xD;
      mean values and SD as they were all normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test). T-test for&#xD;
      paired data was used to analyze differences of time of recurrence, VAS pain, Vas urgency and&#xD;
      number of voidings between treatment. Data analysis was performed with STATA statistical&#xD;
      package (release 11,1, 2010, Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA).&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common infectious diseases,&#xD;
      with a substantial financial burden to society. In Europe data on the presence of various&#xD;
      types of UTIs indicate a high impact on quality of life of people affected, it is important&#xD;
      the impact of urinary tract infections on the economy in general and on the health system in&#xD;
      particular. In the U.S. urinary tract infections account for more than 7 million doctor&#xD;
      visits each year, including more than 2 million visits for cystitis. The bacterium E. coli,&#xD;
      which is the source of 90% of urinary tract infections, shows an incredible ability to&#xD;
      survive in the human body, and is able to change rapidly to survive antibiotics. An infection&#xD;
      of the urinary tract must be stopped before it begins to migrate to the kidneys, where it can&#xD;
      cause serious infections. Women with frequent reinfections have a rate of 0.13 to 0.22 UTIs&#xD;
      per month (1.6 to 2.6 infections per year). For premenopausal, healthy, and active females,&#xD;
      recurrent UTIs are a major healthcare concern. Recurrent urinary tract infection (RUTI) is&#xD;
      defined as three episodes of urinary tract infection (UTI) with 3 positive urine cultures in&#xD;
      the previous 12 months or two episodes in the last six months. The usual present strategies&#xD;
      employing a prophylactic antibiotic regime to prevent recurrent UTIs include long-term&#xD;
      low-dose prophylactic antimicrobial treatment or postcoital antibiotic treatment. However, it&#xD;
      seems that these strategies do not alter the long-term risk of recurrence. Patients with&#xD;
      frequent UTIs who take prophylactic antimicrobial agents for extended periods decrease their&#xD;
      infections during prophylaxis, but the rate of infection returns to pre-treatment rates when&#xD;
      prophylaxis is stopped . Long-term antibiotics do not appear to positively affect the&#xD;
      patient's basic susceptibility to infections. The cell wall of E. coli bacteria has tiny&#xD;
      finger-like projections that contain complex molecules called lectins on their surface. These&#xD;
      lectins act as a cellular glue that binds the bacteria to the bladder wall so they cannot be&#xD;
      easily rinsed out by urination . In this pilot study the aim was to evaluate if oral D&#xD;
      Mannose could be used as a safe and effective treatment and as a prophylactic measure for&#xD;
      recurrent UTIs in adult women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS AND METHODS Suitable female patients with recurrent urinary tract infections who&#xD;
      were visited at the outpatient Clinic of our Urology Department were eligible for study. The&#xD;
      work has been conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki of&#xD;
      World Medical Association. Patients were enrolled in the study after treatment for the most&#xD;
      recent urinary tract infection if they had positive urinary cultures at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant entering the trial was assigned to one of the following treatments in a&#xD;
      random sequence:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A regimen of five-day antibiotic therapy with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160 mg/800&#xD;
           mg twice a day. Then 1 week of antibiotic every 4 weeks for the following 23 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A regimen of oral D Mannose 1 gr. 3 times a day, every 8 hours for 2 weeks, and&#xD;
           subsequently 1 gr. twice a day for 22 weeks. D-Mannose has the best activity when urine&#xD;
           has neutral pH, therefore patients were instructed to measure urinary pH using dipsticks&#xD;
           and use oral sodium bicarbonate 250 mg b.i.d.or potassium citrate 1 gr. b.i.d. as&#xD;
           alkalinizing agents if pH was &lt;7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly assigned to antibiotic treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or&#xD;
      to a regimen of oral D Mannose for 24 weeks, and received the other intervention in the&#xD;
      second phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAS score for bladder pain (VASp) and for urgency (VASu) was evaluated before starting D&#xD;
      Mannose and at 24 weeks. The 24 hour number of voidings was obtained filling a voiding diary&#xD;
      before and at the end of treatment with D Mannose. Cure was defined as the resolution of&#xD;
      symptoms and no post-treatment bacteriuria at the 24 week follow-up visit. Cure with&#xD;
      recurrence was defined as having resolution of symptoms with negative cultures at 12 week&#xD;
      followed by significant UTI with bacteriuria before 24 weeks. Failure was defined as having&#xD;
      persistent symptoms and significant bacteriuria before 24 weeks. The cure rate was determined&#xD;
      for patients who met infection criteria, returned for the follow-up visits and had been&#xD;
      treated with an antimicrobial for recurrent urinary tract infection occurring twice or more&#xD;
      times during the 6 months preceding the 24 weeks course of daily oral D Mannose. The time to&#xD;
      recurrence of UTI, VAS pain and VAS urgency were evaluated at the end of antibiotic therapy&#xD;
      and at the end of 24 week treatment with oral D Mannose. Statistical Analysis- The results&#xD;
      for quantitative variables were expressed as mean values and SD as they were all normally&#xD;
      distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test). T-test for paired data was used to analyze differences of&#xD;
      time of recurrence, VAS pain, Vas urgency and number of voidings between treatment. Data&#xD;
      analysis was performed with STATA statistical package (release 11,1, 2010, Stata Corporation,&#xD;
      College Station, Texas, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISCUSSION- The approach in the management of recurrent urinary tract infections is usually&#xD;
      to treat adequately an episode of infection and after the completion should document complete&#xD;
      eradication with a urine culture; if infection reoccurs or persists then imaging is required.&#xD;
      In the management of recurrent UTIs in women it is a common practice to fight the resistance&#xD;
      of the bacterium E. coli by varying the type of antibiotics, or increasing the dose and&#xD;
      duration of therapy. However, in doing so the bacteria become even more resistant to broad&#xD;
      spectrum antibiotics. Moreover, the resistance of the bacterium would not increase if the&#xD;
      infection was due to a new E. coli contamination of the faeces or to sexual contact. What&#xD;
      actually appears to occur is the survival of a part of the old colony of bacteria in the&#xD;
      urinary tract, they remain latent and are reactivated by various favourable conditions, the&#xD;
      relentless recurrences are therefore not considered as reinfection. It could be learnt a lot&#xD;
      from patients and from research done on the causes of repeated urinary tract infections,&#xD;
      especially due to the bacterium E. coli. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) strains may&#xD;
      contain virulence factors that allow the bacteria to penetrate into the transitional cells&#xD;
      and form quiescent intracellular reservoirs (QIRs). Establishment of QIRs throughout the&#xD;
      underlying transitional epithelium may predispose an individual to an increased likelihood of&#xD;
      recurrence and may account for some of the frequent same-strain recurrences that are seen&#xD;
      clinically despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. A difficult aspect of treating urinary&#xD;
      tract infections in women is the high likelihood of recurrence. In a series of trials a group&#xD;
      of susceptible women averaged 2.6 infections per patient per year despite the apparent&#xD;
      effectiveness of short-term therapy. While long-term prophylaxis was relatively effective in&#xD;
      that series, resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole by urinary pathogens increased to&#xD;
      19% in a 5-year period. Although there is debate regarding the duration of antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy, emergence of drug-resistant organisms has to be considered with prolonged antibiotic&#xD;
      use, even in healthy women with uncomplicated UTIs. A number of triggers lead to the&#xD;
      reactivation of dormant E.coli already in the bladder, or the release of E.coli pods from&#xD;
      behind biofilms in the bladder. When a first UTI is caused by E. coli, the risk of a second&#xD;
      infection within 6 months is greater than when a first infection is cause by another&#xD;
      uropathogen. Although E. coli was the most frequently isolated microorganism in our group of&#xD;
      patients, the limited number of patients studied could not confirm this assumption. The&#xD;
      chemical structure of D-Mannose causes it to stick to E. coli bacteria, maybe even more&#xD;
      tenaciously than E. coli adheres to human cells. Although the mechanism of how it works is&#xD;
      complicated, theoretically, if enough D-mannose is present in the urine, it binds to the&#xD;
      bacteria and prevents them from attaching to the urinary tract lining. Our clinical&#xD;
      experience shows that D Mannose represents a useful choice to address the problem of&#xD;
      recurrent UTIs. The time required to develop a new infection, or for the re-emergence of the&#xD;
      bacterial reservoir, as can be assumed from new data, is significantly longer with a&#xD;
      prolonged course of oral D Mannose than with antibiotic treatment, even when these are used&#xD;
      for long periods at a low dose, or in cycles. We actually know mannose has no bactericidal&#xD;
      properties, and it might well be that the dosage and duration of therapy have to be&#xD;
      individualized according to bacterial growth and replication speed in the bladder and urinary&#xD;
      tract. The major part of mannose ingested is eliminated with urine and works by binding to&#xD;
      bacteria concentrated in infected urine and attempting to perpetuate infection by binding to&#xD;
      mannose receptors of urothelial bladder cells, this mechanism being the one involved in most&#xD;
      cases of recurrences. In most cases recurrences are wrongly regarded as re-infections: it is&#xD;
      highly likely that bactericidal molecules not possessing the same properties cannot produce&#xD;
      the same consistent effect, that is the elimination of more and more loads of bacteria with&#xD;
      urine, &quot;alive&quot; albeit inactivated, motionless, devoid of pathogenic potential due to mannose&#xD;
      linked to them.&#xD;
