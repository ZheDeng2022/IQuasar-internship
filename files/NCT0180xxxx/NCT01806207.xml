    <textblock>
      This was a study that compared Durolane injections to saline injections in the treatment of&#xD;
      unilateral osteoarthritis of the knee. The patients were randomly assigned one of the two&#xD;
      treatments unaware of which treatment they received. The study was conducted at 13 centers in&#xD;
      Germany, the United Kingdom and Sweden. Patients were followed for six weeks after study&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
