      The main goal of this study is to improve the outcome of children and adolescents with&#xD;
      standard risk (SR) first relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Furthermore, goal is to set&#xD;
      up a large international study group platform allowing for optimization of standard treatment&#xD;
      strategies and integration of new agents.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ALL is the most frequent malignancy in childhood and has favourable event-free and overall&#xD;
      survival rates. About 15% of patients suffer relapse. At relapse prognosis is much inferior&#xD;
      (about 50% survival) leukemic clones exhibit much more resistance to conventional&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Patients with relapse require treatment intensification and different&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies. At relapse, new targeted agents can provide the chance for better&#xD;
      cure rates and need to be investigated in prospective controlled trials before they may be&#xD;
      even eligible for frontline treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IntReALL SR 2010 trial is designed to achieve 2 major aims: Establishment of the best&#xD;
      available standard chemotherapy treatment. This is addressed with the randomization of the 2&#xD;
      best developed strategies for treatment of childhood relapsed ALL, the German ALL-REZ BFM&#xD;
      2002 Protocol with the Protocol II IDA arm, and the British ALL-R3 protocol with the&#xD;
      mitoxantrone arm. This randomization allows confirming the feasibility of both protocols in a&#xD;
      large variety of different countries and study groups with different frontline therapy&#xD;
      strategies. As result from this trial a common standard chemotherapy for childhood relapsed&#xD;
      ALL will be developed which can serve as backbone for investigation of the most attractive&#xD;
      targeted new agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2nd aim is the investigation of the efficacy and tolerability of the humanized CD22&#xD;
      directed monoclonal antibody Epratuzumab, manufactured and provided by the company&#xD;
      Immunomedics, US. The drug will be randomly added to the respective consolidation&#xD;
      chemotherapy, using EFS as primary endpoint. Epratuzumab has been developed in adult&#xD;
      rheumatology indications and in B-cell malignancies. A phase I and early phase II combination&#xD;
      trial in childhood relapse ALL has been conducted and published by the Children's Oncology&#xD;
      Group (COG), and results of an extended phase II trial have been recently presented at the&#xD;
      ASH meeting (12/2011). The drug showed a very favourable safety profile as single drug and in&#xD;
      combination with multidrug chemotherapy. Activity was moderate, the recent trial showed a&#xD;
      significantly better elimination of minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients achieving a&#xD;
      2nd complete remission. This finding supports the strategy to use Epratuzumab in combination&#xD;
      with consolidation chemotherapy after induction in patients having reduced the leukemia&#xD;
      burden in the bone marrow to at least below 25%, most of them will be in 2nd complete&#xD;
      remission. Epratuzumab will be given weekly at the established dose. Pharmacokinetics will be&#xD;
      investigated in a reduced number of patients. The further treatment will be conventional&#xD;
      intensive chemotherapy and maintenance therapy in patients with good MRD response after&#xD;
      induction, or with allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (SCT) in those with insufficient MRD&#xD;
      response. SCT will be considered as standard treatment element and will not lead to censoring&#xD;
      of the patients of considered as endpoint. Epratuzumab is not licensed so far and the trial&#xD;
      may add to the approval process in case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific advice for the trial has been requested at the FDA and the EMA. Both institutions&#xD;
      have responded supportively. Concerns and recommendations of FDA and EMA have been addressed&#xD;
      in the protocol and the corresponding statistical analysis plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IntReALL SR 2010 trial will be financed within the FP7 project IntReALL 2010 supported by&#xD;
      the European Commission. Within the project next to the SR trial a strategy for high Risk&#xD;
      (HR) patients will be addressed, the establishment of harmonized diagnostic procedures, an&#xD;
      international tumour bank and a comprehensive biologic/scientific programme will be set up, a&#xD;
      web-based Good Clinical Practice (GCP) conform database will be established, a comprehensive&#xD;
      statistical strategy for both trials are established, and drug development in this indication&#xD;
      will be promoted and organized from side of the disease experts in cooperation with the&#xD;
      established academic structures ITCC (Innovative Therapies for Children with Cancer), the&#xD;
      ENCCA project (European Network for Cancer in Children and Adolescents) and SIOPe&#xD;
      (International Society for Pediatric Oncology Europe), the central authorities (EMA, FDA) and&#xD;
      Industry. Parent organisation and former patients are integrated into and accompany the&#xD;
      process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main aims of the IntReALL FP7 project are to establish a therapeutic platform for children&#xD;
      with relapsed ALL in Europe and beyond and to give them access to the most promising new&#xD;
      agents under academic control and free from commercial interests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized evidence for efficacy and tolerability of new drugs are demanded by competent&#xD;
      authorities. These trials are conducted beyond the mostly palliative patient group eligible&#xD;
      for phase I/II trials in curative indications. Treatment protocols for with curative&#xD;
      indications need to be conducted in the best interests of the patients, ideally with an&#xD;
      academic sponsor. The design should be driven by medical and scientific evidence and not by&#xD;
      commercial interests as is the case in industry sponsored trials. This concept was&#xD;
      acknowledged by the European Commission selecting the project for funding from many other&#xD;
      powerful applications.&#xD;
