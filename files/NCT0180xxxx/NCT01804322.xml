    <textblock>
      Epilepsy requires long-term drug treatment and is frequently associated with other clinical&#xD;
      conditions. Combinations of antiepileptic drugs and other compounds are fairly common and&#xD;
      increase with age. Adverse drug reactions and drug interactions are expected and may affect&#xD;
      compliance, particularly in patients not receiving adequate information. Primary objective of&#xD;
      the study is to verify if a comprehensive and standardized educational plan is followed by a&#xD;
      significant reduction of the number of adult patients with epilepsy and comorbidity&#xD;
      presenting clinically relevant adverse treatment effects. Secondary objectives include&#xD;
      effects on number of adverse treatment events, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), direct&#xD;
      medical costs, and patient's compliance. The study is a randomized, controlled, open-label,&#xD;
      pragmatic trial. Included are consecutive adult outpatients with 1+ concurrent clinical&#xD;
      conditions on chronic treatment and at least one clinically relevant treatment-related&#xD;
      adverse event and/or clinically relevant drug interaction. Eligible patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive a comprehensive and standardized educational plan (experimental arm) or&#xD;
      to usual care, ie management of adverse event/drug interaction as done in clinical practice&#xD;
      (control arm). The experimental plan consists in discussing with patient and caregiver the&#xD;
      cause and nature of adverse event/drug interaction, the tolerability profile of each drug,&#xD;
      the clinical manifestations associated with current drug interaction(s), contraindications of&#xD;
      potentially interfering over-the-counter drugs, indications and benefits of suggested&#xD;
      treatment changes, and withdrawal of potentially interfering, contraindicated or ineffective&#xD;
      drugs. All patients will be seen at one, three and six months after admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: The number of patients free from clinically relevant adverse treatment&#xD;
      events and/or drug interactions in each treatment arm at end of study is expected to be&#xD;
      higher in patients assigned to comprehensive and standardized educational plan compared to&#xD;
      usual care (primary outcome). Patients on the experimental plan are also expected to be more&#xD;
      commonly free from relevant adverse events and/or drug interactions at each intermediate&#xD;
      visit, to present a lower number of adverse treatment events, to imply lower costs for&#xD;
      medical contacts, hospital admissions, and drugs, to present better HRQOL scores, and to&#xD;
      present less weekly treatment omissions.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY The primary objective of the study is to verify whether or not a&#xD;
      comprehensive and standardized educational plan is followed by a significant reduction of the&#xD;
      number of adult patients with epilepsy and comorbidity presenting clinically relevant adverse&#xD;
      treatment effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include the effects of the following comprehensive and standardized&#xD;
      educational plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction of the total number of adverse treatment events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction of the number of medical contacts&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement of the health-related quality of the patient's life (HRQOL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction of the direct costs of the health care assistance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement of the patient's compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis to be tested is that a comprehensive and standardized educational plan is&#xD;
      superior to the present modalities adopted to manage treatment safety in clinical practice&#xD;
      for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It raises the level of attention towards the putative adverse effects of the drugs&#xD;
           currently taken and the possible drug interactions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It helps identifying any clinically relevant event at onset to prevent the occurrence of&#xD;
           symptoms or signs leading to medical contact and hospital admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It educates the patient to live with the treatment schedule representing the best&#xD;
           compromise in terms of safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Study design. This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, pragmatic trial. Study&#xD;
      population. Patients eligible for inclusion are identified among those consecutively seen in&#xD;
      the outpatient services of the participating units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention. Patients fulfilling the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive a comprehensive and standardized educational plan (experimental arm) or to usual&#xD;
      care, ie the management of the adverse event/drug interaction as usually done in clinical&#xD;
      practice and in keeping with each unit's modalities (control arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comprehensive and standardized educational plan consists in the discussion with the&#xD;
      patient and, if available, the caregiver of each of the following points (of which a written&#xD;
      summary will be made available:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cause and nature of the adverse event and/or drug interaction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The tolerability profile of each drug present in the schedule, illustrated as a simple&#xD;
           list including the commonest adverse events presented in decreasing order of frequency&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The clinical manifestations (if any) associated with the current drug interaction(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any contraindication to the use of over-the-counter drugs potentially interfering with&#xD;
           the current treatment schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The reasons for and the potential benefits of the suggested treatment change&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An encouragement to withdraw any potentially interfering or contraindicated drug or&#xD;
           compounds not unequivocally found to be efficacious for that specific case&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study conduction. After signing the informed consent form, eligible patients will be&#xD;
      immediately randomized to receive the comprehensive and standardized educational plan or to&#xD;
      usual care. Patients assigned to the experimental arm will be given an appointment for a&#xD;
      one-hour private meeting to discuss all the items included in the comprehensive educational&#xD;
      plan. The patients assigned to the control arm will be managed as done in the context of&#xD;
      usual care in that same ambulatory visit. All patients will be seen at one, three and six&#xD;
      months after admission and whenever indicated for the management of the individual case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes. These include one primary and a number of secondary outcomes. The primary outcome&#xD;
      is defined by the number of patients free from clinically relevant adverse treatment events&#xD;
      and/or the number of drug interactions in each treatment arm at end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of patients free from clinically relevant adverse treatment events and/or&#xD;
           drug interactions in each treatment arm at each intermediate visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The mean and median number of adverse treatment events in each treatment arm, at each&#xD;
           intermediate visit and at end of study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The monetary costs of medical contacts, hospital admissions, and drugs; the one-hour&#xD;
           meetings with patients assigned to the experimental arm will be included in the costs.&#xD;
           Costs will be calculated by the healthcare economy service of Mario Negri Institute&#xD;
           according to current national values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total HRQOL summary score changes (comparing last follow-up to admission visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of patients with at least weekly omissions of the assigned treatment schedules&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization. A centralized randomization procedure will be adopted. Randomization will be&#xD;
      performed by accessing to a user-friendly, protected centralized database, which will proceed&#xD;
      to the assignment to the experimental or control arm after verification of the&#xD;
      appropriateness of the inclusion/exclusion criteria. To control for center-related&#xD;
      confounding, a separate randomization list will be made available for each center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding (masking). For the purposes of the study, treating and evaluating physicians will be&#xD;
      represented by different persons. Given the diversity between the two management policies,&#xD;
      neither the patients nor the caring physicians involved in administering interventions will&#xD;
      be blind to the assigned arm. An attempt will be made to blind physicians assessing outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. The data will be analyzed using the SPSS-13 package for PC. The&#xD;
      statistical analysis plan will include descriptive statistics to compare the baseline&#xD;
      characteristics of the two populations and the distribution of the treatment schedules, the&#xD;
      number and type of adverse events (present at baseline or occurring during follow-up), and&#xD;
      the proposed changes, along with the cost items (medical contacts, hospitalizations, drug&#xD;
      costs) and the HRQOL scores. For descriptive statistics, the chi-square test, the Student's t&#xD;
      test, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) or equivalent non parametric tests will be used as&#xD;
      appropriate. The chi-square test will be also used to test the number of patients free from&#xD;
      relevant adverse events at end of study (primary end-point) and at each intermediate visit.&#xD;
      The analysis of the primary end-point is based on the intention-to-treat analysis and&#xD;
      includes all randomized patients. Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to compare the&#xD;
      difference between the two treatment arms in the mean change in the number of adverse events,&#xD;
      the number of omitted drug doses, the total monetary costs, and the total HRQOL scores at&#xD;
      each follow-up visit (where applicable) and at study end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timing. The duration of the entire study is 24 months with the following distribution:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Months 1-3: Protocol approval by the local units' ethics committees and preparation of&#xD;
           the electronic database&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Months 4-15: Patients' enrolment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Months 16-21: Completion of follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Months 22-24: Data analysis and scientific report An interim assessment of the&#xD;
           recruitment rate will be performed at the end of month 12 to decide whether or not the&#xD;
           enrolment can be completed as expected. If needed, a request will be made to postpone&#xD;
           patients' enrolment to the end of month 21 and the study completion of the end of month&#xD;
           30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects. Each eligible patient will be properly informed about the study aims, the&#xD;
      use of the diaries, and the requirements to be met at each visit. A summary sheet outlining&#xD;
      the study objectives and conduct will be given to the patient and will be part of the written&#xD;
      informed consent form. The patient will be also instructed about the possibility to withdraw&#xD;
      from the study for any plausible reason without any interference with the management of&#xD;
      his/her disease as done in clinical practice. The confidentiality of the data collected for&#xD;
      the study purposes will be granted by giving access (through nominal username and password)&#xD;
      only to persons officially involved in the study conduction. The data will be managed without&#xD;
      disclosing the patients' identity.&#xD;
