  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is being conducted to study whether eating certain snacks will reduce&#xD;
      your desire to eat and for a longer period of time compared to other snacks. The&#xD;
      investigators are testing 2 different snacks. Study #1 will involve eating 2 different&#xD;
      seed-like snacks or water. Study #2 will involve eating pita bread with jam, bread with jam&#xD;
      or water. The test snack is higher in protein and/or fibre compared to the reference product.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy adults will be recruited to participate in a randomized, controlled, crossover study&#xD;
      to investigate whether or not eating snacks made with buckwheat would increase satiety and&#xD;
      reduce their energy intake when compared to a comparable snack. Water was included as a&#xD;
      non-caloric control. The study consisted of 3 visits and participants would receive a&#xD;
      different treatment at each visit. Visits were scheduled at least 7 days apart. Visual analog&#xD;
      scales will be used to assess appetite related sensations at 7 time points, fasting, 30&#xD;
      minutes after consuming the snack and then at 30 minute intervals for 180 minutes.&#xD;
      Participants will be provided with a lunch and the amount of food consumed will be weighed. I&#xD;
      addition, participants will be asked to maintain a food record for the remainder of the day.&#xD;

    <measure>Total Area Under the Curve (AUC) for Hunger, Fullness, Desire to Eat and Prospective Consumption Using Visual Analog Scales (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>VAS administered pre-snack and then every 30 minutes after the first bite up to 180 minutes for a total of 7 time points.</time_frame>
    <description>Appetite assessment was measured using a VAS questionnaire administered pre-snack and every 30 minutes post snack up to 180 minutes, for a total of 7 time points. The questionnaire included 4 questions (1) How hungry are you? (2) How full are you? (3) How strong is your desire to eat? (4) How much do you think you want to eat right now? Each question was followed by a 10 cm line anchored at the left and right ends by the opposing statements &quot;not at all&quot; and &quot;extremely&quot; for questions 1 and 2, &quot;very weak &quot; and &quot;very strong&quot; for question 3, and &quot;nothing at all&quot; and &quot;a very large amount&quot; for question 4. Participants provided their response to each question by marking a perpendicular line on the 10-cm line to indicate their answer. Scores were determined by measuring the distance in centimeters from the left anchor to the perpendicular line drawn by the participant. VAS scores over time were graphed and AUC was calculated using the trapezoid method.</description>

    <measure>Number of Calories Consumed Post-snack Until Bedtime</measure>
    <time_frame>time between snack consumption and bedtime (12 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were provided with a food diary to record the amount and type of each food and beverage consumed for the remainder of the day. Energy consumed at lunch and the remainder of the day were quantified from food consumed at lunch and the food diary using Food Processor Nutrient Analysis Software.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Gastrointestinal Side Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>24h</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked if they noticed any gastrointestinal side effects after having eaten the study food and the results were recorded.</description>

    <description>Likability of the study products was assessed using a 5-point hedonic scale (1 = dislike extremely; 2 = dislike very moderately; 3 = neither like or dislike; 4 = like moderately; 5 = like extremely) for appearance, aroma, flavour, taste, texture and overall liking.</description>

        <title>Total Area Under the Curve (AUC) for Hunger, Fullness, Desire to Eat and Prospective Consumption Using Visual Analog Scales (VAS)</title>
        <description>Appetite assessment was measured using a VAS questionnaire administered pre-snack and every 30 minutes post snack up to 180 minutes, for a total of 7 time points. The questionnaire included 4 questions (1) How hungry are you? (2) How full are you? (3) How strong is your desire to eat? (4) How much do you think you want to eat right now? Each question was followed by a 10 cm line anchored at the left and right ends by the opposing statements &quot;not at all&quot; and &quot;extremely&quot; for questions 1 and 2, &quot;very weak &quot; and &quot;very strong&quot; for question 3, and &quot;nothing at all&quot; and &quot;a very large amount&quot; for question 4. Participants provided their response to each question by marking a perpendicular line on the 10-cm line to indicate their answer. Scores were determined by measuring the distance in centimeters from the left anchor to the perpendicular line drawn by the participant. VAS scores over time were graphed and AUC was calculated using the trapezoid method.</description>

The experimental snack #1 is a gluten-free high protein snack comprised of a 30g serving of buckwheat groats. The placebo comparator reference product is a gluten-free snack with similar energy density, but 1/2 the protein as snack #1, comprised of a 32g serving of corn nuts. The placebo comparator non-caloric control is water.</description>

The experimental snack #2 is a gluten-free high protein and high fibre snack comprised of a 50g serving of buckwheat and pinto bean flour pita bread. The placebo comparator reference product is a gluten-free snack with similar energy density but less protein and fiber than snack #2, comprised of a 50g serving of rice bread. The placebo comparator non-caloric control is water.</description>
