  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects taking ipilimumab, as an immediate or&#xD;
      delayed treatment, following completion of sipuleucel-T (SipT) treatment, has on patients and&#xD;
      their prostate cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label randomized multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial combining SipT with&#xD;
      ipilimumab in patients with chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration resistant prostate&#xD;
      cancer (CRPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated with standard SipT (Q2wks x 3). Patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      one of two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1 (Immediate Treatment): Ipilimumab Q3wks x 4 started 1 day following the final dose of&#xD;
      SipT (Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2 (Delayed Treatment): Ipilimumab Q3wks x 4 started 3 weeks following the final dose of&#xD;
      SipT (Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this ipilimumab treatment, patients will then be followed monthly for 3 months and&#xD;
      then quarterly until disease progression. The definition of unacceptable toxicity is grade 3&#xD;
      or higher treatment-related toxicities (NCI CTCAE v4) excluding immune-related adverse events&#xD;
      (irAEs). The study will assess for the immunogenicity and clinical activity of sequential&#xD;
      sipuleucel-T treatment followed by ipilimumab. Patients who experience an initial clinical&#xD;
      response to ipilimumab followed by subsequent disease progression will be offered reinduction&#xD;
      treatment with ipilimumab.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically confirmed, metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma (positive bone scan&#xD;
             and/or measurable disease on CT scan and/or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Progressive disease after androgen deprivation, as defined by Prostate Cancer Clinical&#xD;
             Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2) and/or RECIST criteria. Patients must have disease&#xD;
             progression by one or both of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For patients with measurable disease, progression is defined as at least a 20%&#xD;
                  increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions or the&#xD;
                  appearance of one or more new lesions, as per RECIST criteria version 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For patients with no measurable disease, a positive bone scan and elevated&#xD;
                  prostate specific antigen (PSA) will be required. PSA evidence for progressive&#xD;
                  prostate cancer consists of a PSA level of at least 2 ng/milliliter (mL), which&#xD;
                  has risen on at least 2 successive occasions, at least 1 week apart. If the&#xD;
                  confirmatory PSA value is not greater than the screening PSA value, then an&#xD;
                  additional test for rising PSA will be required to document progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If no prior orchiectomy has been performed, patients must remain on luteinizing&#xD;
                  hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist or antagonist (e.g. degarelix) therapy.&#xD;
                  Patients who are receiving an antiandrogen as part of primary androgen ablation&#xD;
                  must demonstrate disease progression following discontinuation of the&#xD;
                  antiandrogen, defined as two consecutive rising PSA values, obtained at least two&#xD;
                  weeks apart, or documented osseous or soft tissue progression. At least one of&#xD;
                  the PSA values must be obtained at least four weeks (flutamide) or six weeks&#xD;
                  (bicalutamide or nilutamide) after discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Laboratory requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/μL&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  PSA ≥ 2 ng/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/μL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than or&#xD;
                  equal to 2.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min by the Cockcroft Gault equation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Testosterone less than or equal to 50 ng/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 - 1 and life expectancy&#xD;
             ≥ 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. At least 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients receiving any other hormonal therapy, including any dose of megestrol acetate&#xD;
             (Megace), Proscar (finasteride), any herbal product known to decrease PSA levels (e.g.&#xD;
             Saw Palmetto, PC-SPES), or any systemic corticosteroid, must discontinue the agent for&#xD;
             at least four weeks prior to study treatment. Progressive disease as defined above&#xD;
             must be documented after discontinuation of any hormonal therapy (with the exception&#xD;
             of a LHRH agonist).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Prior radiation therapy must be completed ≥ 4 weeks prior to enrollment and the&#xD;
             patient must have recovered from all toxicity. Prior radiopharmaceuticals (strontium,&#xD;
             samarium) must be completed ≥ 8 weeks prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Because of the unknown potential risk to a gamete and/or developing embryo from these&#xD;
             investigational therapies, patients must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier&#xD;
             method for males) for the duration of study participation, and for three months after&#xD;
             discontinuing therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior chemotherapy for prostate cancer, with the exception of neoadjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy, because of the potential effect of chemotherapy on the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior sipuleucel-T treatment or investigational immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prostate cancer pain requiring regularly scheduled narcotics.&#xD;
