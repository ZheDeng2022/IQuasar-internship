      Esophageal carcinoma is an aggressive disease with a poor prognosis. Surgical resection with&#xD;
      radical lymphadenectomy remains the basic method of management of this malignancy. Lymph node&#xD;
      metastasis is one of the most important factors in predicting the prognosis of patients with&#xD;
      esophageal carcinoma, but the extent of lymph node dissection is still in debate, and there&#xD;
      is no statistical evidence based on large scale prospective randomized trials with regard to&#xD;
      the issue that which is the optimal extent of lymphadenectomy for esophageal cancer. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to test two different extents of lymphadenectomy&#xD;
      (Cervical-thoracic-upper abdominal three-field lymphadenectomy and Thoracic-upper abdominal&#xD;
      two -field lymphadenectomy) in middle or lower third intrathoracic esophageal cancer. This&#xD;
      research is being done to see whether one extent of lymphadenectomy is superior than the&#xD;
      other with better long-term outcome and acceptable postoperative short-term outcome or not.&#xD;

      Background :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal carcinoma is an aggressive disease with a poor prognosis. Surgical resection with&#xD;
      radical lymphadenectomy remains the basic method of management of this malignancy. The&#xD;
      international Society for Diseases of the Esophagus has classified the extent of&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy as standard, extended, total, and three-field lymphadenectomy. However, lymph&#xD;
      node metastases can be present as regional metastasis, skip metastasis and distant&#xD;
      metastasis, the optimal extent of lymphadenectomy remains controversial by now. Three-filed&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy was criticized for higher surgical risks, but have the merits of removing all&#xD;
      potential positive nodes and reducing the local recurrence. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      conduct a large scale prospective randomized Phase â…¢ clinical trial to test that based on the&#xD;
      long-term outcomes(overall survival and disease free survival )and postoperative short-term&#xD;
      outcomes(mortality, morbidity),whether one extent of lymphadenectomy is superior than the&#xD;
      other approach or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare overall survival after three-field lymphadenectomy and two-field&#xD;
           lymphadenectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare locoregional recurrence, disease free survival after three-field&#xD;
           lymphadenectomy and two-field lymphadenectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare postoperative morbidity and mortality in the two groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Prospective randomized controlled Setting: Fudan University Cancer Center, Shanghai,&#xD;
      China. Patients and methods : All patients with biopsy proven carcinoma of the middle or&#xD;
      lower third of the esophagus presenting to our hospital will be considered for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staging investigations will be standard and will include&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Computed Tomography (CT) scans in all patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Esophagogastroscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Barium swallow&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Endoscopic Ultrasonography (EUS) wherever possible&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. PET-CT scan wherever possible&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization, by the sealed envelope method, took place on the morning of planed surgery&#xD;
      day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surgeries will be performed under general anesthesia with epidural analgesia. The surgery&#xD;
      will be either performed by or under the direct supervision of consultant thoracic surgeons&#xD;
      with experience in esophageal surgery. Operative time, blood loss, blood product replacement&#xD;
      and all intraoperative details will be recorded in the proforma. Patients will be shifted&#xD;
      postoperatively to the intensive care unit (ICU) for observation and subsequently to the&#xD;
      recovery or high dependency ward once stabilized. Postoperative details including period of&#xD;
      postoperative ventilation, hemorrhage, pulmonary and cardiac complications, arrhythmias,&#xD;
      thoracic duct leak, anastomotic leak, wound infection and recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis&#xD;
      or palsy will be recorded. Postoperative mortality will be defined as 30-day mortality plus&#xD;
      death before discharge after surgery. The total duration of ICU stay and hospital stay will&#xD;
      also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up three monthly for the first two years and six monthly for the&#xD;
      third to fifth years and annually thereafter. A detailed history and clinical examination and&#xD;
      CT scan, barium swallow and ultrasound will be done routinely on every follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management: All collected data will be entered into a statistical software package for&#xD;
      subsequent analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main research variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point: Overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Disease free survival in the two arms&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Locoregional recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Postoperative morbidity and mortality&#xD;
