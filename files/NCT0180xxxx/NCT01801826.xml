      myoscience Inc. (Redwood City, CA) has developed a device for a novel, minimally invasive&#xD;
      facial rejuvenation procedure designed to soften hyperdynamic facial lines. The myoscience&#xD;
      Cryo-Touch IV device uses well-established principles of cryobiology to cause localized&#xD;
      reduction in muscle activity resulting in a reversible reduction in facial animation and the&#xD;
      appearance of facial lines. The device operates on well-established cryobiology principles;&#xD;
      that localized exposure to controlled low temperature conditions can alter tissue function.&#xD;
      The therapy treats targeted motor nerves with low temperatures via a cold probe in the form&#xD;
      of an assembly of small diameter needles, creating a highly localized treatment zone around&#xD;
      the probe. The thermal algorithm is designed to produce a reversible loss of nerve conduction&#xD;
      resulting in a temporary decrease in muscle contractility. Prior studies of Cryo-Touch,&#xD;
      Cryo-Touch II and Cryo-Touch III have provided strong evidence of effectiveness and safety&#xD;
      for applications in this indication. The goal of the study described herein is to show the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of this approach using the Cryo-Touch IV device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of facial rhytids or wrinkles is a natural part of the aging process,&#xD;
      resulting from the thinning of the dermis and epidermis due to a loss of elastic fibers and&#xD;
      collagen and subcutaneous fat loss. Contributors to the formation of facial rhytids include&#xD;
      exposure to ultraviolet light (sunlight) and gravity, as well as habitual facial expressions&#xD;
      which cause lines to occur in specific facial regions as the skin loses elasticity. In some&#xD;
      cases, hyperdynamic activity of underlying facial muscles leads to the development of furrows&#xD;
      in the glabella and frontalis areas. Activity of the facial muscles causes hyperdynamic lines&#xD;
      independent of the aging process and this can also be undesirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With an aging population, the demand for facial rejuvenation techniques has increased. A&#xD;
      range of treatment options have been developed to provide reduction in facial lines,&#xD;
      including topical medications, neuromuscular inhibiting injections, laser treatments,&#xD;
      cosmetic fillers, and surgical facelifts. Those options targeted specifically at hyperdynamic&#xD;
      furrows include botulinum toxin injection, injectable fillers, and surgical resection of&#xD;
      facial muscles or division of motor nerves. Although botulinum toxin injections have become a&#xD;
      popular approach to reduction of glabellar lines by providing partial chemical denervation of&#xD;
      the glabellar muscle complex, safety concerns exist related to the use of this toxin.&#xD;
      Injectable fillers do not mitigate the underlying muscular activity which produces the facial&#xD;
      furrows. Surgical strategies are limited by the risks and complications typically associated&#xD;
      with surgery, including bleeding, bruising, scarring, and infection. A non-surgical,&#xD;
      minimally invasive approach to elimination of facial hyperdynamic lines which avoids the use&#xD;
      of chemical toxins is desirable.&#xD;
