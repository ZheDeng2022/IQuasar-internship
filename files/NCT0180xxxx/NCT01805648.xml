    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rhTPO in the maintenance&#xD;
      treatment of ITP, to explore the appropriate dosing interval of the maintenance treatment of&#xD;
      rhTPO .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The eligible subjects with ITP firstly will receive a pre-treatment of rhTPO 300 IU/Kg once&#xD;
      daily up to 14 days. The subjects with two consecutive platelet counts above 50×10^9/L in the&#xD;
      pre-treatment period will begin to receive maintenance treatment of rhTPO 300 IU/Kg for 12&#xD;
      weeks. In the period of maintenance treatment, starting dosing interval of rhTPO is every&#xD;
      other day followed by the interval adjustments for keeping platelet counts between 30&#xD;
      ×10^9/L～100 ×10^9/L. Subsequently, subjects will stop treatment of rhTPO and be followed up&#xD;
      for 4 weeks after maintenance treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms will be evaluated before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet transfusion will be administered to subjects with active bleeding symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity will be monitored continuously during the entire study. Safety will be assessed by&#xD;
      adverse events and laboratory tests.&#xD;

When two consecutive platelet counts is above 50×10^9/L, the subjects will be begin to receive maintenance treatment of rhTPO 300 IU/Kg. In the period of maintenance treatment, starting dosing interval of rhTPO is every other day followed by the interval adjustments for keeping platelet counts between 30×10^9/L～100×10^9/L.</description>
