      1. Research Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients: Patients 18 years of age or older who are referred to our adult cardiovascular&#xD;
           Echocardiograms: Patients will have a focused echocardiogram performed in the&#xD;
           Cardiovascular Clinic at rest and immediately after symptom limited treadmill stress.&#xD;
           Echocardiograms will be obtained in the left lateral decubitus position with an iE33&#xD;
           (Philips, The Netherlands) machine equipped with a broadband S5-1 transducer (frequency&#xD;
           transmitted 1.7MHz, received 3.4 MHz). Parasternal long- and short axis views will be&#xD;
           obtained at the basal (tips of the mitral valve visualized), midventricular (papillary&#xD;
           muscles visualized) and apical levels (just proximal to the level of end-systolic LV&#xD;
           luminal obliteration, with the transducer positioned 1 or 2 intercostal spaces more&#xD;
           caudal to allow the LV to be viewed as circular as possible). Additionally, three&#xD;
           standard apical views (4-chamber, 2-chamber, and 3-chamber) will be obtained. To&#xD;
           optimize speckle tracking, images will be acquired at as high as a frame rate as&#xD;
           possible (50-90 frames/s) and every effort will be made for the endocardial and&#xD;
           epicardial border to be visualized throughout the cardiac cycle. Pulsed wave Doppler&#xD;
           will be acquired at the level of the mitral valve leaflet tips, and at the pulmonary&#xD;
           vein as seen from the apical 4-chamber view. A color Doppler M-mode image including the&#xD;
           LV apex and the open mitral valve will be obtained with the upper Nyquist limit set to&#xD;
           45cm/sec. Tissue Doppler velocities will be acquired at the medial and lateral mitral&#xD;
           annulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Echocardiogram Analysis: All data analysis will be performed by an investigator masked&#xD;
           to the patient's history and peak VO2 and 6 minute walk results. LV end-systolic and&#xD;
           end-diastolic volumes and ejection fraction will be determined by manual tracing of the&#xD;
           end-systolic and end-diastolic endocardial borders using apical 4- and 2-chamber views,&#xD;
           employing Simpson's biplane method. Pulsed wave Doppler at the level of the mitral valve&#xD;
           leaflet tips will be used to determine peak early (E) and atrial (A) filling velocities,&#xD;
           and deceleration time (DT). Tissue Doppler will be used to determine peak early (E')&#xD;
           velocity of the medial and lateral mitral annulus. The LV apical color M Mode image will&#xD;
           be used to determine the propagation velocity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Speckle Tracking Analysis: Analyses will be performed using QLAB advanced quantification&#xD;
           software version 7.1 (Philips, The Netherlands). Short axis and long axis images will be&#xD;
           automatically divided into six segments. Automated tracking of myocardial speckles will&#xD;
           be reviewed and manually adjusted as minimally as possible. The tracking quality of each&#xD;
           segment will be visually evaluated and if tracking is felt to be inaccurate, strain&#xD;
           analysis of that segment will not be included. Speckle tracking analysis provides peak&#xD;
           and time to peak measures of circumferential, radial and longitudinal strain in 18 LV&#xD;
           segments. Additionally, speckle tracing analysis provides peak and time to peak measures&#xD;
           of bulk, endocardial and epicardial twist in the basal, mid, and apical LV regions. If&#xD;
           less than 2/3 of the components for a computed variable are available, than that&#xD;
           computed variable will not be included in the relevant analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Graded exercise testing for assessment of peak oxygen consumption (Stress Protocol): We&#xD;
           will use a Naughton-Balke treadmill protocol where the speed will be kept at 3.0 mph and&#xD;
           the grade will be increased 2.5% every 2 minutes- a modified protocol using 2.0 mph will&#xD;
           be adopted for slow walkers. A valid test will be defined according to the ATS/ACCP&#xD;
           statement on cardiopulmonary exercise testing as meeting at least one of the following&#xD;
           criteria: Plateau in VO2, heart rate (HR) within 10 beats/min of age-predicted maximal&#xD;
           HR, respiratory exchange ratio &gt; 1.10, exhaustion defined as RPE of 9-10 on the Borg&#xD;
           CR-10 scale, or achievement of predicted maximal work rate. Patients will be verbally&#xD;
           encouraged before and during the test, to give a maximal effort with the goal of&#xD;
           achieving physiological limitation. Criteria for exercise termination will include:&#xD;
           chest pain suggestive of ischemia, ischemic ECG changes, complex ectopy, second or third&#xD;
           degree heart block, fall in systolic blood pressure &gt;20mmHg from highest value during&#xD;
           the test, hypertension (&gt;250 mmHg systolic; &gt;120 diastolic), severe desaturation: SpO2 &lt;&#xD;
           80% when accompanied by symptoms and signs of severe hypoxemia, sudden pallor, loss of&#xD;
           coordination, mental confusion, dizziness or faintness, signs of respiratory failure. In&#xD;
           situations in which the test is prematurely terminated the patient will be observed&#xD;
           until they are stable and physiologic variables have returned to baseline conditions. If&#xD;
           necessary and based on the criteria of the physician, admission to the hospital may be&#xD;
           warranted. Resuscitation (i.e. crash cart) equipment will be available in the laboratory&#xD;
           for such occurrences.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Quantification of peak oxygen consumption: Oxygen consumption will be measured using a&#xD;
           portable Cosmed K4b2. The Cosmed K4b2 weighs 1.5 kg, including the battery and specially&#xD;
           designed harness and has been validated against Douglas bags during steady-state&#xD;
           exercise. The mass of this device will be added to total body mass in calculating peak&#xD;
           oxygen consumption in ml/kg/min. Oxygen consumption will be measured breath-by-breath&#xD;
           and subsequently averaged over 10-second periods. Participants will be asked not to talk&#xD;
           during testing and will be instructed to use hand signals to communicate with the&#xD;
           research assistants. Heart rate will be measured simultaneously during all tasks using a&#xD;
           Polar heart rate monitor (Model RS100, Polar Electro Inc.). As of October 2015&#xD;
           functional capacity will be evaluated with 6 minute walk test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Possible Discomforts and Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The major risk being undertaken in this study is cardiopulmonary exercise testing. In&#xD;
           general, maximal symptom-limited exercise testing is a relatively safe procedure. In a&#xD;
           survey of 1,375 clinical exercise testing facilities, the risk of dying during the&#xD;
           cardiopulmonary exercise test was 0.5 per 10,000 tests. It is important to understand&#xD;
           that exercise is performed outside of a clinic setting on a regular basis without&#xD;
           supervision. We will take every measure possible to limit the risk of exercise to study&#xD;
           participants. We will conduct a thorough medical examination and review the resting ECG&#xD;
           prior to exercise. Those patients with contraindication to exercise testing will not&#xD;
           exercise and will not continue in this study. Additionally, we will continuously monitor&#xD;
           12-lead ECGs during exercise to check for signs of myocardial ischemia. A fully equipped&#xD;
           crash cart is available if an event were to occur. All treadmill testing will be&#xD;
           conducted under the supervision of a physician and/or appropriately trained nurse&#xD;
           practitioners. The nurse practitioner will be trained and certified in exercise testing.&#xD;
           All testing supervisors have a thorough knowledge of normal and abnormal exercise&#xD;
           responses and are certified in cardiac life support. They will be able to recognize an&#xD;
           abnormal rhythm and ST depression on an electrocardiogram. All sites have on-call access&#xD;
           to a study physician and contact numbers for emergency services. Institutional and&#xD;
           community EMS services will be activated if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Possible Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no possible benefits to the health of the patient during study. Discoveries made&#xD;
      during the investigation could potentially benefit the study participants or other patients&#xD;
      with cardiovascular disease in the future.&#xD;
