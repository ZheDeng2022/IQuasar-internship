  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aims of this clinical study are to find out the maximum dose that can be given&#xD;
      safely to patients, the potential side effects of the drug and how they can be managed. The&#xD;
      study will also look at what happens to Anti-CD19 (DI-B4) inside the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DI-B4 is a type of drug called an Anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody which is being used to stop&#xD;
      the growth and kill cancerous immune cells by targeting the B-cell marker (CD-19) expressed&#xD;
      on their surface. This drug has not been given to patients before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DI-B4 will be given weekly by intravenous infusion for four weeks. The study is in two parts.&#xD;
      In Part 1, small groups of patients will be treated at increasing doses to find the highest&#xD;
      safest dose and best dose for part 2 of the study. Approximately 16-20 patients will be&#xD;
      treated in this part. In Part 2, the dose identified in Part 1 will be given to approximately&#xD;
      20 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients recruited to the study will receive four weeks (cycles) of treatment. They will&#xD;
      attend an end of therapy visit eight weeks after their last dose of DI-B4, and attend&#xD;
      follow-up visits up to eighteen months after their first dose of DI-B4. Information on the&#xD;
      overall and progression free survival will be collected for a period up to eighteen months&#xD;
      after the final patient is treated on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have blood and urine samples taken each week during treatment amongst other&#xD;
      clinical tests. CT scans will be performed at the start of the study, at eight weeks post&#xD;
      treatment and six months after the study start. Bone marrow biopsies and FDG-PET scans will&#xD;
      only be taken if needed. Research blood samples will also be taken to look at what happens to&#xD;
      the drug inside the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to explain that patients will have advanced cancer so it is unlikely that&#xD;
      patients will benefit directly from taking part but the study may help improve future&#xD;
      treatment of cancer.&#xD;

      Patients with relapsed or refractory CD19 positive indolent B-cell lymphoma, Waldenström&#xD;
      Macroglobulinaemia or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia will be entered into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the vast majority of patients, B-cell non Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
      leukaemia are incurable using existing therapeutic approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although anti-CD20 directed therapy has improved outcomes, more than fifty percent of&#xD;
      patients still relapse following treatment or are refractory to it and therefore additional&#xD;
      novel non-cross resistant therapies are urgently required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DI-B4 is a humanised, low-fucosylated anti-CD19 Immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      with potent antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) but minimal complement&#xD;
      dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). The target antigen, CD19, is the canonical B-cell marker that&#xD;
      is expressed on all B-cells including the malignant B-cells in NHL, CLL and acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The CD19 antigen is therefore an attractive B-cell lineage&#xD;
      specific target for monoclonal antibody therapy. DI-B4 is expected to act through the&#xD;
      depletion of normal and malignant CD19 positive cells, primarily via ADCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-centre, Phase I, dose escalation/dose expansion study. For the first three&#xD;
      cohorts, an intra-patient dose escalation scheme will be followed unless a DLT is observed.&#xD;
      From Cohort 4 onwards, a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation schedule of DI-B4 will be continued&#xD;
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined, up to a maximum dose of 1000mg.&#xD;

        treatment and follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Indolent B-cell lymphoma patients only: Patient has either at least one measurable&#xD;
        lesion by CT scan (defined as &gt;1.5 cm in one axis) or in the case of Waldenström's&#xD;

        5. Patients with transformed lymphoma from a pre-existing indolent lymphoma. Patients with&#xD;
        a previous history of transformation, but on this disease episode have a biopsy proven&#xD;
        indolent recurrence may be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patients receiving corticosteroids, except where the patient has been on a stable dose&#xD;
        for the preceding seven days. Doses of prednisolone or equivalent &gt;10 mg daily are not&#xD;
        permitted whilst on the study, doses up to 20mg can be taken any time prior to Cycle 1, Day&#xD;
        1&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Concurrent congestive heart failure, prior history of class III/ IV cardiac disease (New&#xD;
        York Heart Association [NYHA]), history of unstable angina pectoris or myocardial&#xD;

&#xD;
        8. Ability to become pregnant (or already pregnant or lactating). However, those female&#xD;
        patients who have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test before enrolment and agree to&#xD;
        use two highly effective forms of contraception (oral, injected or implanted hormonal&#xD;
