    <textblock>
      Recurrent UTI is a very bothersome and a popular problem in the urogynecology clinical&#xD;
      practice. According to the International Urogynecological Association (IUGA)/International&#xD;
      Continence Society (ICS) joint report on the terminology for female pelvic floor dysfunction,&#xD;
      recurrent UTI is defined as at least three symptomatic and medically diagnosed UTI in the&#xD;
      previous 12 months. The previous UTI(s) should have resolved prior to a further UTI being&#xD;
      diagnosed. Recurrent UTI is one of the most common diagnoses for female pelvic floor&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with recurrent UTI might also have bladder irritative symptoms. Previous studies&#xD;
      have revealed that patients with recurrent UTI have elevated urinary NGF, suggesting chronic&#xD;
      inflammation is present in the bladder of these patients after resolution of UTI. The&#xD;
      investigators preliminary results showed that chronic inflammation, urothelial cell apoptosis&#xD;
      and impairment of barrier function of urothelial cells could be the underlying&#xD;
      pathophysiology of recurrent UTI in women. Chronic inflammation might reside in the bladder&#xD;
      wall after resolution of UTI, which might also cause urothelial dysfunction and defective&#xD;
      barrier function and UTI will be easy to recur in these patients. This evidence provides a&#xD;
      new focus for clinical management and future research of recurrent urinary tract infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these knowledge, the investigators hypothesized that chronic inflammation might&#xD;
      reside in the bladder wall, which might also cause urothelial dysfunction and defective&#xD;
      barrier function. UTI might be easy to recur in these patients with residual chronic bladder&#xD;
      inflammation. If the investigators can determine complete resolution of the chronic&#xD;
      inflammation after acute cystitis episode, it is possible to inhibit recurrent cystitis&#xD;
      through treating the inflammation with anti-inflammatory agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a small secreted protein which induces the differentiation and&#xD;
      survival of particular target neurons. NGF has been implicated as a chemical mediator of&#xD;
      pathology-induced changes in C-fiber afferent nerve excitability and reflex bladder activity.&#xD;
      The levels of neurotrophic factors including NGF increase in the bladder after spinal cord&#xD;
      injury (SCI) and increased levels of NGF have been detected in the lumbosacral spinal cord&#xD;
      and dorsal root ganglion of rats after SCI. Chronic administration of NGF into the bladder of&#xD;
      rats induces bladder hyperactivity and increases the firing frequency of dissociated bladder&#xD;
      afferent neurons. Increased levels of urinary NGF have also been detected in BOO patients&#xD;
      exhibiting overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms. Increased bladder tissue NGF was noted in&#xD;
      patients with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS). Recent research has&#xD;
      focused on the urinary NGF levels in detecting OAB and IC/PBS in lower urinary tract&#xD;
      dysfunction (LUTD). Evidences have shown that urinary proteins such as NGF and prostaglandin&#xD;
      E2 levels increase in patients with OAB, sensory urgency and detrusor overactivity (DO).&#xD;
      Patients with OAB-dry and OAB-wet have significantly higher urinary NGF levels compared to&#xD;
      the control group and patients with increased bladder sensation. The urinary NGF levels&#xD;
      increase physiologically with small scale in the normal subjects at urge to void but increase&#xD;
      pathologically with large scale in OAB patients at small bladder volume and at urgency&#xD;
      sensation. The urinary NGF levels decrease after antimuscarinic therapy and further decrease&#xD;
      after detrusor botulinum toxin injections in refractory OAB. Put together, the urinary NGF&#xD;
      levels seem to be a potential biomarker for diagnosis of OAB and the underlying chronic&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several urological diseases including bacterial cystitis, lower ureteral stone and urothelial&#xD;
      cell carcinoma may develop storage symptoms mimicking OAB or IC/PBS. The urinary NGF levels&#xD;
      are also elevated in these disorders. In the previous study the investigators found that UTI&#xD;
      may increase NGF production in urine associated with urinary tract stones. Patients with&#xD;
      resolution of UTI but also with persistent OAB may have high urinary NGF levels. These&#xD;
      results provide evidence that urinary NGF is a product of inflammation in the urinary tract.&#xD;
      Therefore, urinary NGF may be considered as a second-line product following urothelial damage&#xD;
      or changes of urothelial environment that initiate the sensory nerve excitation and cause&#xD;
      bladder hypersensitivity or DO. Measuring urinary NGF is a non-invasive tool to assess&#xD;
      chronic inflammatory status and for longitudinal comparison of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is essential to know whether the urinary NGF levels can also increase at acute cystitis&#xD;
      episode and the production has a relation with the associated storage symptoms in different&#xD;
      stage after antibiotics treatment. This study is designed to measure the urinary NGF levels&#xD;
      in patients with acute cystitis and different stages after antibiotics treatment. If the&#xD;
      urinary NGF levels have association with the underlying inflammation in the bladder wall, the&#xD;
      investigators might use it as a biomarker to determine the status of resolution of the&#xD;
      inflammation and provide physicians to decide how long should the investigators treat&#xD;
      patients with acute cystitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll 30 female patients with the first time UTI and 30 female patients with&#xD;
      recurrent UTI (at least two previous UTI episodes in the latest 12 months) but have a recent&#xD;
      acute episode. Ten age-matched women (30 to 50 years old) without any prior history of UTI or&#xD;
      urinary tract pathology will be invited to serve as the controls. Urine samples will be&#xD;
      collected in the patients at baseline, 7 days after antibiotics treatment, and 2 weeks, 4&#xD;
      weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks after the UTI episode. Urinalysis will be performed at each&#xD;
      visit and urine culture will be performed at baseline and at the 2 weeks and 3 months visits.&#xD;
      Urine samples at baseline and 3 months will be collected from the controls for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients should be proven to have UTI by detecting pyuria in urinalysis (WBC&gt;10 per high&#xD;
      power field) and had a positive urine culture result. In addition, a kidney, ureter, and&#xD;
      bladder (KUB) film, and renal sonography will be performed to exclude to possibility of&#xD;
      urolithiasis or other urinary tract pathology. The one-day voiding diary will be requested to&#xD;
      record at each visit to determine the functional bladder capacity (FBC) and frequency&#xD;
      episodes per day. Bladder symptoms will be recorded by Overactive Bladder Symptom Score&#xD;
      (OABSS) and visual analog scale of pain (VAS). In addition, uroflowmetry, including maximum&#xD;
      flow rate (Qmax), voided volume and postvoid residual volume (PVR) will also be measured at&#xD;
      visit 2. Urine samples at baseline and each visit after treatment will be collected at a&#xD;
      comfortably full bladder and sent for NGF measurements. Antibiotics (Cephalexin 500mg Q6H)&#xD;
      for 1 to 2 weeks will be started at the baseline until the urinalysis proven negative and&#xD;
      urine culture turned to be negative. Then antimicrobial agent (Baktar 800mg h.s.) or&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory agent (Celecoxib 200mg QD) will be randomly prescribed for UTI prophylaxis&#xD;
      for 3 months after complete resolution of acute cystitis. All patients will be followed-up&#xD;
      for up to one year to monitor whether they have occurrence of recurrent UTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All urine samples will be collected with a full bladder and natural voiding. Measurement of&#xD;
      urinary NGF levels will be performed by the ELISA method. Urine samples are not diluted.&#xD;
      Voided urine is put on ice immediately and centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min at 4 ◦C. The&#xD;
      supernatant is separated into aliquots in 1.5 mL tubes and preserved in a -80 ◦C freezer. At&#xD;
      the same time, 3 mL of urine is taken to measure urinary creatinine levels. Urinary NGF&#xD;
      concentration is determined using the Emax ImmunoAssay System (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin,&#xD;
      USA) with a specific and highly sensitive ELISA kit, which has a minimum sensitivity of 7.8&#xD;
      pg/mL. The amount of NGF in urine samples fall below the detection limits of NGF assay was&#xD;
      extracted from an NGF standard curve. All samples will be run in triplicate, urinary NGF&#xD;
      levels without a consistent value in three measures will be repeated and the values will be&#xD;
      averaged. The total urinary NGF levels are further normalized by the concentration of urinary&#xD;
      creatinine (NGF/Cr level). The NGF/Cr levels are compared among all subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed by a paired t-test for paired data in consecutive time&#xD;
      points. Mann-Whitney test will be used for non-parametric analysis between different&#xD;
      subgroups. A P-value of less than 0.05 is considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that patients with recurrent UTI may have persistently&#xD;
      elevated urinary NGF levels compared with those with the first time UTI. The urinary NGF&#xD;
      levels will remain elevated in patients who have persistent OAB symptoms after acute cystitis&#xD;
      episode and might be persistently higher than the controls after 3 months. Patients treated&#xD;
      with anti-inflammatory agent might have lower urinary NGF levels at 3 months visit compared&#xD;
      to those taking antimicrobials. The incidence of recurrent UTI in the following one year&#xD;
      might be more in the patients treating with antimicrobials than those treating with&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory agents.&#xD;
