  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common and debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder&#xD;
      in which an acute fear response to a traumatic event does not abate. This failure to recover&#xD;
      from trauma is thought to be due at least in part to a deficit in learning not to fear&#xD;
      situations and stimuli previously associated with the trauma (i.e., specifically due to a&#xD;
      failure of extinction recall). Pavlovian fear conditioning can be simulated and measured&#xD;
      experimentally in humans using a 2-day fear conditioning paradigm developed by our group,&#xD;
      wherein conditioning and extinction learning phases are conducted on Day 1, and extinction&#xD;
      recall is tested on Day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) evidence indicates that PTSD is&#xD;
      associated with hyper-responsivity of the insular cortex and hyporesponsivity of the&#xD;
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) during exposure to fear-inducing stimuli, consistent&#xD;
      with altered excitability of brain regions mediating fear conditioning and extinction. As the&#xD;
      brain's principal inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA exerts a prominent role in modulating&#xD;
      neuronal excitability. Interestingly, there are reports that adjunctive treatment with&#xD;
      GABA-enhancing antiepileptics is efficacious in PTSD. There is also evidence, albeit&#xD;
      inconsistent, that lower serum GABA levels predict a more chronic course of the illness.&#xD;
      However, it is unclear whether serum levels accurately reflect brain GABA, which may&#xD;
      contribute to inconsistency of serum findings. Moreover, it is possible that GABA alterations&#xD;
      may vary in their presence, nature and significance across brain regions implicated in PTSD.&#xD;
      The proposed study will examine the relationship of PTSD symptoms and behavioral fear&#xD;
      conditioning deficits with regional brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) using proton&#xD;
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have the following aims and hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether GABA alterations are associated with the categorical diagnosis of&#xD;
           PTSD and not merely exposure to trauma. It is hypothesized that PTSD will be associated&#xD;
           with higher GABA in VMPFC and lower GABA in the right insula.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether GABA levels are significantly associated with dimensional measures&#xD;
           of PTSD symptom severity and individual symptom dimensions. It is predicted that higher&#xD;
           GABA in the VMPFC and lower GABA in the right anterior insula will be associated with&#xD;
           greater total symptom severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether GABA in VMPFC and right anterior insula are significantly&#xD;
           associated with measures of extinction recall failure and anxiety sensitivity in PTSD.&#xD;
           It is hypothesized that VMPFC GABA will be positively correlated with skin conductance&#xD;
           response to a conditioned stimulus that had previously been extinguished and insula GABA&#xD;
           will be negatively correlated with anxiety sensitivity.&#xD;
