    <textblock>
      Ultrasonography has become increasingly used in many medical specialties over the last&#xD;
      decades as smaller and less expensive ultrasound equipment has become available. Although&#xD;
      ultrasound imaging traditionally is considered safe, its use is highly operator dependent&#xD;
      (EFSUMB 2010). The lack of sufficient operator skills can lead to diagnostic errors that&#xD;
      eventually compromise patient safety due to unnecessary tests or interventions (Moore &amp; Copel&#xD;
      2011). A recent report from the British National Health Service (NHS) analyzed maternity&#xD;
      claims reported to the NHS over the past decade and identified antenatal fetal ultrasound&#xD;
      investigations as one of the four major risk areas in obstetric care (NHS 2012). This study&#xD;
      therefore aims to explore the effects of simulation-based ultrasound training on patient&#xD;
      comfort levels and the need for re-examination by a second physician due to diagnostic&#xD;
      uncertainty.&#xD;

      Background Ultrasonography has become increasingly used in many medical specialties over the&#xD;
      last decades as smaller and less expensive ultrasound equipment has become available.&#xD;
      Although ultrasound imaging traditionally is considered safe, its use is highly operator&#xD;
      dependent (EFSUMB 2010). The lack of sufficient operator skills can lead to diagnostic errors&#xD;
      that eventually compromise patient safety due to unnecessary tests or interventions (Moore &amp;&#xD;
      Copel 2011). A recent report from the British National Health Service (NHS) analyzed&#xD;
      maternity claims reported to the NHS over the past decade and identified antenatal fetal&#xD;
      ultrasound investigations as one of the four major risk areas in obstetric care (NHS 2012).&#xD;
      Traditional ultrasound training is challenged with long learning curves and lack of&#xD;
      standardization of competency-based training (Salvesen et al. 2010). Given the long learning&#xD;
      curve characterizing traditional clinical training (Jang et al. 2010), proficiency in terms&#xD;
      of independence and acceptable diagnostic accuracy may not occur during the first many months&#xD;
      of training. Thus, some residents may not be sufficiently trained to manage independent&#xD;
      ultrasound examinations expected from them safely. Accelerating learning curves is therefore&#xD;
      essential from a patient safety perspective and for patient discomfort during intimate&#xD;
      examinations such as transvaginal ultrasound scans. However, it may also be important from an&#xD;
      organizational viewpoint as insufficiently trained residents may not be as effective in&#xD;
      managing patients as those, who are trained until proficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulation-based training has become increasingly used in several medical domains because it&#xD;
      provides a safe environment to practice. Virtual Reality (VR) simulation has previously been&#xD;
      shown to improve technical performance and shorten operation time in laparoscopic surgery&#xD;
      (Larsen et al. 2009) and this type of training may therefore be useful as an adjunct to&#xD;
      supervised clinical ultrasound practice. In previous studies of the effect of VR simulation,&#xD;
      control groups have been assigned 'traditional training', which often means 'no training'.&#xD;
      Consequently, it is not known if VR simulation - including ultrasound simulation - is&#xD;
      superior to optimal clinical training using real patients. Furthermore, no studies have&#xD;
      explored the effects of ultrasound simulation on patient related outcomes such as diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy, patient discomfort and their perception of safety during the ultrasound&#xD;
      examinations. The effects on an organizational level such as the use of time per ultrasound&#xD;
      examination, the need for re-examination by a senior clinician or the need for ambulatory&#xD;
      control due to diagnostic uncertainty are also unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, we aim to explore the following research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) What are the effects of simulation-based training compared to traditional training in a&#xD;
      group of OB/GYN residents without prior ultrasound experience, on the following outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients' discomfort levels and perception of safety immediately after a transvaginal&#xD;
           ultrasound examination in a gynecological care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Need for re-examination of the patients by a clinical supervisor after the initial&#xD;
           examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Number of ambulatory controls needed due to diagnostic uncertainty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setup In a randomized observer-blinded study, the effects of simulation-based&#xD;
      ultrasound training compared to traditional training are examined from April 1st 2013 to&#xD;
      January 31st 2014. Flowchart of study design is shown in Figure 3. Ethical approval is&#xD;
      obtained from the Regional Ethical Committee of the Capital Region. The study is conducted in&#xD;
      accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and in accordance with the CONSORT statement&#xD;
      (www.consort-statement.org).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants All OB/GYN departments in eastern Denmark (Zealand) are contacted by e-mail and&#xD;
      invited to participate in the study (N=7). Inclusion criteria require that participants 1)&#xD;
      are medical graduates and 2) provide written informed consent. Exclusion criteria are 1) any&#xD;
      formal ultrasound training or 2) previous independent use of ultrasound. The estimated number&#xD;
      of eligible residents from each of the seven departments is eight during the 12 months of the&#xD;
      study, giving a total of 56 potential participants, provided a participation rate of 100%.&#xD;
      All participants are surveyed regarding age, years of post-graduate clinical practice,&#xD;
      gender, handedness, and experience with video-gaming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization The Clinical Trials Unit, Rigshospitalet, independently performs simple&#xD;
      randomization of participants by computer to either intervention group (simulation training)&#xD;
      or control group (clinical training only). The allocation of participants is concealed to the&#xD;
      primary investigator until all data is loaded to a database for statistical processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Simulation programme. Participants in the intervention group receive simulation&#xD;
      training using two types of ultrasound simulators (see Figure 4 for flowchart of the&#xD;
      simulation programme). A short theoretical introduction to pelvic ultrasound is presented&#xD;
      before simulation training begins. Theoretical reading material concerning early pregnancy&#xD;
      complications is provided all participants prior to simulation training. A final theoretical&#xD;
      test is provided to assess knowledge about equipment, ultrasound safety, anatomical landmarks&#xD;
      and basic pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Content of simulation training. A low-fidelity simulator (BluePhantom), which allows&#xD;
      participants to introduce the probe and familiarize themselves with the ultrasound equipment,&#xD;
      is used for the initial training. Participants train for 30 minutes on this simulator before&#xD;
      moving on to a high-fidelity Virtual-Reality (VR) simulator (Scantrainer, Medaphor). The VR&#xD;
      simulator provides images obtained from real patients and haptic feedback from the ultrasound&#xD;
      probe. The basic gynecologic and advanced gynecologic modules are selected for training&#xD;
      purposes. The selection of modules is based on a previous pilot study, in which 10 OB/GYN&#xD;
      residents rated the usefulness of each of the modules on the VR simulator. Only modules that&#xD;
      are rated as four or five out of five in usefulness are included in the training programme.&#xD;
      When all modules are passed on the VR simulator, the participants receive 30 minutes of&#xD;
      training on the low-fidelity simulator (BluePhantom) to allow participants to review the&#xD;
      functions, they just trained, using real ultrasound equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instructor-feedback during simulations. The participants receive 30 minutes of introduction&#xD;
      to the VR simulator and are allowed another two times 10 minutes of instructor-feedback at a&#xD;
      time of their choice (Ã˜stergaard et al. 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Participants randomized to the control group receive traditional clinical&#xD;
      introduction locally in the departments. This may include observation and supervised practice&#xD;
      and the different types of clinical training provided by each department are gathered through&#xD;
      the department's head of education and registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up and outcome All participants will be followed for six months. Patients eligible for&#xD;
      participation are those who are having a pelvic ultrasound examination performed, are able to&#xD;
      understand and read Danish, and willing to provide informed consent. Consenting patients are&#xD;
      surveyed after the pelvic ultrasound examination regarding discomfort levels and perception&#xD;
      of safety during the ultrasound examination. Both questions are answered using 10-point&#xD;
      Likert scales. The need for re-examination by a supervising clinician, and need for&#xD;
      ambulatory control including reason (e.g. diagnostic uncertainty, routine control according&#xD;
      to department or national guidelines etc.) is registered by the nurse on call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation A meaningful reduction in the need for a second re-examination by a&#xD;
      senior clinician could be a 33% assuming a standard deviation of eight scans. Thus, a total&#xD;
      sample size of 46 participants is needed using a two-sided alpha of 0.05 and a power of 0.90.&#xD;
