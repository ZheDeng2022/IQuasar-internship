      Part 1: A pilot study in patients with homozygous S (HbSS) or hemoglobin S with beta zero&#xD;
      thalassemia(HbS-βo thalassemia), with the aim of examining the effect of intravenous NAC&#xD;
      treatment on plasma VWF parameters and measures of redox and RBC function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: A pilot study in patients with sickle cell disease admitted to the hospital in&#xD;
      vaso-occlusive crisis to determine the effects of NAC infusions on plasma VWF parameters and&#xD;
      measures of redox and RBC function, and on measures of pain and hospital length of stay.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two primary processes dominate the complications associated with sickle cell disease (SCD):&#xD;
      vasoocclusion and hemolysis. The plasma and vessel wall adhesive protein von Willebrand&#xD;
      factor (VWF) is thought to be involved in both of these processes, so strategies aimed at&#xD;
      reducing its secretion or reactivity, which could decrease complications in patients with&#xD;
      SCD, are being tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on prior studies, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment may decrease VWF activity in&#xD;
      patients with SCD and may be a useful adjunctive treatment in this disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 enrolls stable outpatients with homozygous S (HbSS) or hemoglobin S with beta zero&#xD;
      thalassemia (HbS-βo thalassemia), with the aim of examining the effect of NAC treatment on&#xD;
      VWF parameters, measures of oxidation and RBC fragments. Patients receive IV NAC first at 150&#xD;
      mg/kg over 8 hours and if tolerated, at a later date at 300 mg/kg over 8 hours in the&#xD;
      University of Washington Clinical Research Center. Blood is collected for laboratory&#xD;
      assessment. Subjects are later offered enrollment in an oral phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2, patients with a history of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) are approached in the&#xD;
      outpatient setting to discuss the study. When admitted for VOC, subjects receive NAC as an IV&#xD;
      infusion75 mg/kg every 6 hours for up to 5 days. Blood for laboratory assays are collected&#xD;
      each morning and pain assessment is performed prior to and following each NAC infusion.&#xD;
