  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2838232 is a novel human immune virus (HIV) maturation inhibitor being developed for the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic HIV infection. This study is the first administration of GSK2838232 in&#xD;
      humans to establish the initial safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile following&#xD;
      single doses of GSK2838232 and to evaluate the effect of food and ritonavir (RTV) on&#xD;
      GSK2838232 in healthy subjects. There will be 2 cohorts in this study. In Cohort 1,&#xD;
      approximately 8 healthy subjects will be enrolled (6 active and 2 placebo) at each dose&#xD;
      visit. There will be four dosing sessions for each subject with subjects randomized to&#xD;
      receive placebo in a random sequence. In Cohort 2, approximately 8 healthy subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled (6 active doses and 2 placebo doses at each dose visit). Cohort 2 will have four&#xD;
      dosing sessions for each subject with subjects randomized to receive placebo in a random&#xD;
      sequence.&#xD;
