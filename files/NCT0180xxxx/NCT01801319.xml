      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind cross-over trial evaluating the safety,&#xD;
      efficacy, daily functioning, and health-related quality of life of Subcallosal Cingulate&#xD;
      Gyrus Deep Brain Stimulation (SCG DBS) for participants with Treatment-Resistant Depression&#xD;
      (TRD). A total of 40 eligible participants will be randomized to four treatment sequences (10&#xD;
      participants per sequence). Each participant will be treated over a 6-month period with&#xD;
      active or sham stimulation in which both the participants and the attending psychiatrists&#xD;
      will be blinded to treatment allocation.&#xD;
