      Pathophysiology of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is yet unclear and gender differences at&#xD;
      baseline and a specific treatment have not been indicated. The investigators already&#xD;
      demonstrated the positive impact of phosphodiesterase type 5A (PDE5A) inhibition in men. The&#xD;
      investigators' study aims to characterize DCM, measuring molecular and neuroendocrine&#xD;
      assessment to relate to intramyocardial metabolism and cardiac kinetic. The investigators&#xD;
      will perform a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study enrolling 164 diabetic&#xD;
      patients (females and males) with DCM, to evaluate gender responses to 6 months of PDE5A&#xD;
      inhibitors (PDE5Ai). The investigators' study will describe gender differences in DCM&#xD;
      features. The proposed research will test whether PDE5Ai could become a new target for&#xD;
      antiremodeling drugs and to discover a molecular pathways affected by this class of drugs and&#xD;

      DCM is yet unclear and gender differences at baseline and a specific treatment have not been&#xD;
      indicated. The study aims to characterize DCM, measuring molecular and neuroendocrine&#xD;
      assessment to relate cardiac kinetic. The investigators will perform a randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, double-blind study enrolling 120 diabetic patients with DCM, to evaluate&#xD;
      gender responses to 5 months of PDE5Ai. The study will describe gender differences in DCM&#xD;
      features. The proposed research will test whether PDE5Ai could become a new target for&#xD;
      antiremodeling drugs and to discover a molecular pathways affected by this class of drugs and&#xD;
      a network of circulating markers for the early diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of DCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro studies have shown that phosphodiesterase 5 overexpression reduces cGMP levels and&#xD;
      exacerbates remodeling. The investigators already studied the effects of 3-months daily&#xD;
      Inhibition of cGMP hydrolysis through a phosphodiesterase 5A inhibitor (PDE5i) on cardiac&#xD;
      remodeling in a cohort of asymptomatic, middle-aged men with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).&#xD;
      CMR imaging revealed that diabetic cardiomyopathy in these patients produced an uncoupling in&#xD;
      left ventricular contraction between longitudinal strain, which is reduced, and cardiac axial&#xD;
      rotation, which is increased. Characterized DCM at early asymptomatic stages in men, we&#xD;
      identified two circulating markers, TGF-beta and MCP-1 increased and significantly related to&#xD;
      cardiac kinetic parameters. Then, the investigators found that long-term PDE5i restored&#xD;
      coupling by reducing torsion and improving strain. It also reduced the ratio of left&#xD;
      ventricular mass to end-diastolic volume that is increased in the presence of concentric&#xD;
      hypertrophy. Circulating markers TGF-beta and MCP-1, significantly decreased after PDE5i vs.&#xD;
      Placebo.These data suggest that phosphodiesterase 5 inhibition could work as an&#xD;
      antiremodeling drug by acting directly on cardiac tissue, independently of other secondary&#xD;
      vascular, endothelial, or metabolic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, these data need to be validated on a wide sample, for a longer duration of&#xD;
      treatment, and including women, because of their high vulnerability to diabetic damage with&#xD;
      preferential evolution in chronic heart failure, compared to males that frequently have&#xD;
      ischemic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T2DM is also considered a state of persistent inflammation that likely plays a role in&#xD;
      development cardiovascular disease. Some studies have suggested that inflammation may impair&#xD;
      the tissue repair process in diabetes, which appears delayed, unsupervised, and associated&#xD;
      with higher levels of circulating classical monocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interaction between angiogenic cells and the endothelium is still critical for&#xD;
      inflammatory cells to move and home in specific tissue sites in various pathological&#xD;
      conditions. The Tie2 receptor is highly enriched in the endothelium and actively signals&#xD;
      vascular quiescence. It is also expressed by in a unique subset of monocytes, Tie2-expressing&#xD;
      monocytes (TEMs), which have been considered crucial for tissue remodeling and repair. Tie2&#xD;
      is stimulated by angiopoietin-1 (Ang1), a protein secreted by peri-endothelial cells and&#xD;
      platelets. In the context of inflammation, a paralog of Ang1 called Ang2 competitively&#xD;
      inhibits Tie2, normal endothelialcell function depends in part on a tightly regulated balance&#xD;
      between Ang1 and Ang2. There is evidence of angiopoietin deregulation T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies demonstrate that PDE5 inhibitors, have cardioprotective effects in different&#xD;
      conditions, particularly in in diabetes. PDE5is reduce circulating inflammatory cytokines,&#xD;
      protect against tissue damage, exert an anti-inflammatory response, preserve endothelial cell&#xD;
      function and increase angiogenic mediators, including Ang1 in mouse models. The PDE5is also&#xD;
      improves metabolism and these effects are extended to adipose tissue function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another diabetic complication is Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN). DPN is characterized by loss&#xD;
      and degeneration of neurons, Schwann cells, and neuronal fibers resulting in slowing of nerve&#xD;
      conduction velocities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      cGMP is involved in the regulation of many neural functions, including neurotransmission,&#xD;
      long term potentiation, gene expression, and even neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration.&#xD;
      Hyperglycemia up-regulates PDE-5 in Schwann cells and reduces their proliferation and&#xD;
      migration. Schwann cells play an important role in regenerating the peripheral nervous system&#xD;
      by their capacity to proliferate, migrate, and secrete numerous factors that control nerve&#xD;
      regeneration. Decreased proliferation of Schwann cells has also been demonstrated in both&#xD;
      human and experimental models of diabetes. Therefore, reduction of cGMP levels by&#xD;
      hyperglycemia suppresses Schwann cell proliferation and migration. Elevation of cGMP by&#xD;
      blockage of PDE5 with sildenafil completely abolished and reverses the effect of&#xD;
      hyperglycemia on Schwann cells in mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These changes are accompanied by change in serum neurotropic factors that are witnesses of&#xD;
      active remodeling and regeneration at the neuronal level. Many studies in diabetic mice&#xD;
      demonstrated that cGMP induces Schwann cells to synthesize nerve growth factor (NGF),&#xD;
      neurotropic 3 (NT3) and BDNF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One third of diabetes patients suffers from diabetic nephropathy (DN), a leading cause of&#xD;
      end-stage renal disease. To date, effective treatment in halting or reversing the natural&#xD;
      progression of DN remains uncertain. The pathophysiology is multifactorial and the molecular&#xD;
      pathways involved are complex. Glomerular endothelial cell injury plays a major role in the&#xD;
      development and progression of diabetic kidney disease, that is considered the result of&#xD;
      converging hemodynamic and metabolic insults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In kidney PDE5 is expressed in the glomeruli, mesangial cells, cortical tubules, inner&#xD;
      medullary collecting duct and plays a critical role in the regulation of excretory function.&#xD;
      In diabetes, glomerular cGMP production is decreased, PDE5 activity is increased and changes&#xD;
      in the cGMP-NO pathway leads to a rise in intra-glomerular pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PDE5 inhibitors may have an active role in the management of DN by reducing&#xD;
      glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria and improving vascular inflammation and podocyte count in&#xD;
      experimental diabetes models. These findings, together with the modulation of inflammatory&#xD;
      and angiogenic mediators, and endothelial function in murine and human models, support the&#xD;
      use of PDE5i to prevent complications of the diabetic kidney. Intriguingly, sildenafil, a&#xD;
      potent PDE5i, was also associated with improved kidney function in patients with pulmonary&#xD;
      arterial hypertension and in type-2 diabetes (T2DM) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  there are gender differences in left ventricular myocardial remodeling of T2DM patients&#xD;
           detectable with tagged-CMR in terms of myocardial strain and ventricular torsion;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  gender-related features determine different cardiac response to PDE5i treatment detected&#xD;
           by changes in ventricular contractility (strain and torsion on tagged-CMR);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  neuroendocrine (e.g. natriuretic peptides), metabolic markers, chemokines , circulating&#xD;
           and cellular angiogenesis mediators might identify those asymptomatic patients at&#xD;
           greatest risk of developing the diabetic complications (cardiomyopathy, neuropathy,&#xD;
           nephropathy);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  neuroendocrine (e.g. natriuretic peptides), metabolic markers, chemokines , circulating&#xD;
           and cellular angiogenesis mediators able to predict response to treatment with PDE5i and&#xD;
           the evolution of diabetic complications;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  chronic treatment with PDE5i could restore or shut down neurological diabetic damage;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  chronic treatment with PDE5i could restore or shut down renal diabetic damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characterization of gender differences in DCM remodeling through a cluster of biomarkers&#xD;
      indicative of the stage of the disease and CMR quantification of kinetic parameters&#xD;
      (myocardial strain, ventricular torsion), fibrosis amount (T1-mapping technique).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantification of a cluster of biomarkers predictive of disease progression: metabolic and&#xD;
      neuroendocrine markers, pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory circulating chemokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of gender differences in the anti-remodeling effect of PDE5A inhibition in T2DM&#xD;
      patients The investigators will perform a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study&#xD;
      enrolling 120 patients (females and males) with T2DM and diabetic cardiomyopathy. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to treatment with PDE5Ai 20 mg / day or placebo for 5 consecutive months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes will be evaluated before and 1 and 5 months after therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular, endothelial and metabolic indices, and oxidative stress markers will be&#xD;
      evaluated in all patients and related to CMR cardiac kinetic and metabolic parameters and&#xD;
      fibrosis in order to identify:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  gender differences in kinetic parameters of left ventricle (end-diastolic volume,&#xD;
           end-systolic volume, stroke volume, wall motion score index, myocardial strain, torsion&#xD;
           angle, recoil rate with contraction dynamics);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  changes in myocardial fibrosis replacement amount (global contrast-enhanced T1&#xD;
           relaxation time, percentage of myocardial surface area, quantified by T1-mapping&#xD;
           technique);&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic procedures will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physical examination with measurement of anthropometric parameters (weight, waist&#xD;
           circumference, hip circumference) and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate);&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  quantification of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) subpopulations by flow&#xD;
           cytometry;&#xD;

           pinprick for to pain);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  presence / reduction / absence of deep tendon reflexes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  any motor deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any signs or symptoms consistent with diabetic neuropathy, to diagnosis confirm, these&#xD;
      patients will undergo to a standard nerve conduction study for the large-caliber fibers (by&#xD;
      registration of sensory potential stimulation from the sural, ulnar and radial nerve surface,&#xD;
      and motors potential stimulation from peroneal and ulnar nerve). Those with large fiber&#xD;
      neuropathy will be evaluate for small caliber fibers injuries with:&#xD;
