    <description>Participants in this group will undergo leukapheresis after standard of care surgical tumor resection. Leukapheresis will be used to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from which the dendritic cells (DC) will be obtained. Retrieved DC will be used as a vaccine once weekly on Weeks 1-4 within 3 weeks from end of leukapheresis. Participants will also receive Imiquimod, which will be applied one evening prior to DC dose for 8 hours then for 8 hours each of the next two evenings. Enrollment of participants in the Pilot group will be staggered until the second participant has no treatment limiting toxicities. For the first five subjects to be enrolled in the pilot, the administration of DC to each subject will be delayed until the prior subject has received the second administration of DC. Participants will also receive Lysate of tumor administered every 4 weeks + 3 days on Weeks 8, 12, 16 and 28 (+ / - 3 days).</description>
