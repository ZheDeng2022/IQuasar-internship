  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to investigate whether pharmacist provided counseling and&#xD;
      medication dispensing at the patient's bedside can provide better outcomes than the current&#xD;
      discharge process at Duke University Hospital. This study will be single-site, prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, cohort study. Patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and provide&#xD;
      consent will be included in this study.&#xD;

      Two Adult General Medicine Services, which do not have a rounding pharmacist (RPh), will be&#xD;
      identified by the investigators. Permission to approach the patients on each service will be&#xD;
      obtained from the attending physician of each respective General Medicine Service at the&#xD;
      beginning of each attending physician's time on service. The attending physician will be&#xD;
      asked to communicate to the study personnel of situations in which patients should not be&#xD;
      approached (i.e., patient has communicated disinterested in being approached about study&#xD;
      participation opportunities and/or, in the opinion of the attending physician, the patient&#xD;
      should not be approached).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who will be recruited from pre-specified medical services will be screened for&#xD;
      eligibility and, if deemed eligible, then will be approached by study personnel and asked if&#xD;
      they would like to enroll in this study. If the patient accepts, written informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained and the patient will enter the study. Patients will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either the intervention or control arm. Patients randomized to the intervention arm will&#xD;
      receive discharge medications and pharmacist-provided discharge medication counseling prior&#xD;
      to hospital discharge, and patients randomized to the control group will receive standard&#xD;
      discharge procedures and obtain discharge medications per their usual process. After the&#xD;
      patient has been enrolled in the study, study personnel will collect patient demographic data&#xD;
      for study purposes, utilizing patient medical records and/or patient interviews. At&#xD;
      discharge, patients will receive either the intervention or standard of care defined by the&#xD;
      arm of the study to which each patient has been randomly assigned. After discharge, a maximum&#xD;
      of seven attempts will be made via phone to contact all patients in both arms for follow up&#xD;
      at 30 (+/- 7) days after discharge. During the follow phone call, a blinded pharmacist will&#xD;
      conduct a structured interview to collect data for the study endpoints. The pharmacist&#xD;
      conducting the interview will have the most recent discharge medication list (the list the&#xD;
      patient received at his/her hospital discharge) from the patient's medication record to be&#xD;
      used for comparison to the information gathered from the patient's interview 30 days post&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Arm - After enrollment, a pharmacy technician not associated with the study will&#xD;
      collect information necessary to process and fill the patient's discharge prescriptions by&#xD;
      the Duke Outpatient Pharmacy. On the day of discharge, a pharmacist will perform a chart&#xD;
      review and medication reconciliation on all patients' discharge medications (for patients&#xD;
      randomized to the intervention arm). Any medication discrepancies will be addressed with the&#xD;
      patient's primary care team. At the time of discharge, the patient will receive his/her&#xD;
      discharge medications dispensed from the Duke Outpatient Pharmacy, along with medication&#xD;
      counseling by a licensed pharmacist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Arm - Patients will receive the standard discharge process provided by nurses and/or&#xD;
      physicians. Patients will obtain outpatient medications per usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Evaluation - After a patient has completed the phone follow up interview, two pharmacist&#xD;
      co-investigators who have not been involved in the inpatient care of the patients will review&#xD;
      the collected data to assess for adverse drug reactions and drug-drug interactions. When&#xD;
      there is a disagreement between the pharmacists concerning the occurrence of an adverse&#xD;
      reaction (including causality or severity), or a drug interaction (including severity), a&#xD;
      third pharmacist co-investigator who was not involved in the inpatient care of the patient&#xD;
      will review the patient's data to make a final decision concerning the disagreement. All&#xD;
      patients who complete the follow up survey will be evaluated in this manner.&#xD;
