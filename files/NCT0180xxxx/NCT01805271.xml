  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant number of patients relapse and eventually die, particularly if they were&#xD;
      initially diagnosed with large nodes involvement and/or T3/4 diseases. When analyses focus on&#xD;
      patients with ER+/Her2-negative breast cancer, with ≥4N+, 30% had relapsed at 5 years,&#xD;
      emphasizing the need for new drugs in this setting (PACS01 data, UNICANCER internal data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strong evidence suggests that cross-talk between the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase&#xD;
      (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and ER signaling is linked to hormone&#xD;
      resistance in breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, we plan to evaluate the benefit from adding everolimus to standard&#xD;
      endocrine treatments after three years of treatment for patient ER+/HER2- at high risk of&#xD;
      relapse due to high nodes involvement (≥4) and/or persistent node involvement after&#xD;
      neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genomic signatures have emerged during the last 10 years as a new and additive means to&#xD;
      evaluate more precisely long term prognosis, and in some instances the amount of benefit from&#xD;
      chemotherapy or endocrine therapy in the adjuvant setting. Therefore the UNIRAD study can be&#xD;
      proposed to patients with 1-3 positive lymph nodes at primary surgery and a high risk of&#xD;
      relapse with the EndoPredict test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a unique opportunity to prove the efficacy of everolimus in adjuvant setting.&#xD;
      The study could be practice changing in case of positive results and could allow improving&#xD;
      outcome of breast cancer patients presenting high risk of metastatic relapse.&#xD;
