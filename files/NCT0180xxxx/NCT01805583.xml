    <textblock>
      Evidence-based clinical treatments for common mental disorders, such as CBT and/or&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy, have resulted in significant and sustained improvement in clinical symptoms.&#xD;
      However, the individual-focused treatments rarely have sickness absence as a target of&#xD;
      intervention or evaluate work-related outcomes, such as return to work. A recent review of&#xD;
      the evidence for managing stress at work showed that individual interventions give effects on&#xD;
      mental health measures but did not impact absenteeism at work. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to examine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of two different rehabilitation models, one&#xD;
      based on psychotherapy and the other on workplace-interventions, when these are offered as&#xD;
      standalone interventions and in combination for patients with adjustment, anxiety and&#xD;
      depressive disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Common mental disorders, such as adjustment, anxiety and depressive disorders are highly&#xD;
      prevalent in the working population and are associated with impaired work functioning and&#xD;
      high sick leave rates. For mental health disorders, several established treatments exist,&#xD;
      such as Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), pharmacotherapy, and physical activity. However,&#xD;
      less evidence is available on which treatments that increase an individual's ability to&#xD;
      return to work (RTW) when he/she has a common mental disorder. In particular, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a psychotherapeutic intervention for RTW is largely unknown even though&#xD;
      these types of interventions are common and are recommended by the National Board of Health&#xD;
      and Welfare for common mental disorders in Sweden. The few studies in which psychotherapeutic&#xD;
      interventions (mostly CBT) have been evaluated indicate that these were equally or less&#xD;
      effective in enhancing RTW compared to other interventions. In the Swedish rehabilitation&#xD;
      guarantee, CBT-treatments are subsided based on the assumption that improved health status&#xD;
      will contribute to earlier RTW. However, the results from the first evaluations of the&#xD;
      rehabilitation guarantee point to the contrary. RTW was actually delayed for CBT for common&#xD;
      mental disorders compared to treatment as usual (TAU) (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, CBT manuals have been oriented towards reducing symptoms. Likewise, outcome&#xD;
      measures generally consist of symptom-based scales. In a recent study, a specific RTW&#xD;
      CBT-manual was developed including targeting return to a work context, resulting in earlier&#xD;
      RTW. Self-reported mental health symptoms were reduced to a similar extent as in regular CBT.&#xD;
      This implies a room for improvement in the CBT-manuals through orienting the treatment&#xD;
      towards specific areas of functioning, without a loss of symptom specific improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though CBT has proven effective for several mental conditions, little is known about why&#xD;
      the interventions lead to change or how the change came about. This is especially true when&#xD;
      it comes to RTW. There are various treatment intents with varying results, however, little or&#xD;
      nothing is known beyond subjective reasoning about the active processes in treatment,&#xD;
      mediators that might lead to reduced sickness absence. Moderators refer to characteristics&#xD;
      that influence the direction or magnitude of the relation between the intervention and&#xD;
      outcome. There are several studies discussing what factors might predict sickness absence.&#xD;
      However, to help us understand how a treatment works, for whom it works and under which&#xD;
      conditions, a more specific focus on mediators as well as moderators within a study for&#xD;
      reducing sick leave is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One construct that would appear useful in understanding and facilitating RTW when CBT is&#xD;
      implemented is self-efficacy. In short, self-efficacy is the belief that an individual has in&#xD;
      his/her capacity to perform a specific behavior successfully. When applied to RTW, people&#xD;
      with low self-efficacy would believe that they might fail to fulfill their work demands or&#xD;
      work role. These efficacy cognitions are expected to be prominently present among those with&#xD;
      mental health problems, as mental disorders often erode a positive self-concept by the very&#xD;
      nature of the disorder. Lagerveld et al have developed a self-efficacy questionnaire&#xD;
      specifically oriented to capture self-efficacy expectations regarding RTW and return-to-work&#xD;
      self-efficacy for sick listed employees with mental health problem. RTW-SE has been proven a&#xD;
      robust predictor of actual return to work, however if it also serves as a mediator of change&#xD;
      remains to be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another intervention model with some support for increased RTW is the inclusion of a&#xD;
      workplace intervention (WI) in a rehabilitation program. In a Dutch RCT, Blonk et al compared&#xD;
      CBT performed by trained therapists with treatment by &quot;labor experts&quot; who had had a brief&#xD;
      instruction in CBT principles, with controls. They found a significantly better RTW in the&#xD;
      labor expert group compared to CBT, which did not differ from the controls. In a Swedish&#xD;
      study, a manualized WI was evaluated and found significantly better compared to&#xD;
      (non-randomized) controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third method that is interesting in relation to RTW due to its primary focus on improved&#xD;
      function rather than symptom reduction is the CBT-method, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy&#xD;
      (ACT). According to the theoretical frame of ACT, psychological discomfort is the result of&#xD;
      experiential avoidance. Experiential avoidance implies attempts of avoiding painful thoughts,&#xD;
      emotions and physical sensations even when these attempts counteracts effective behavior in&#xD;
      terms of living in accordance with personal values. High levels of experiential avoidance&#xD;
      have been associated with psychopathology including depression, anxiety and low quality of&#xD;
      life. The clinical goal in ACT is to reduce experiential avoidance and instead enhance&#xD;
      psychological flexibility which implies the development of a broader and more flexible&#xD;
      behavior in accordance with personal values, also in the presence of negative stimuli.&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that a general measure of this psychological process predicts a&#xD;
      wide-range of work-related outcomes, from mental health and work attitudes to job performance&#xD;
      and absence rates. A side effect of living a more functional life is often that self-reported&#xD;
      psychological symptoms decline. According to ACT theory, psychological flexibility would be&#xD;
      the key process of change, however there is no data available in the present to support this&#xD;
      statement in relation to RTW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of sick leave is also influenced by many other factors such as&#xD;
      socio-demographic, medical, work-related and organizational factors, as well as by factors in&#xD;
      the health-care and legislative systems. Diagnosis such as burnout, depression and anxiety&#xD;
      disorders are associated with an increased risk of long-term sickness absence. Previous&#xD;
      sickness absence increases the risk for long-term sickness absence also after adjustment for&#xD;
      socio-demographic factors and self-reported health status. This may imply that short-term&#xD;
      sickness absence has social and health-related consequences beyond the effects of the ill&#xD;
      health it reflects. However, these findings may be further explored by taking severity of&#xD;
      diagnosis into account, and need to be evaluated in a comprehensive study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above summary on current knowledge, the primary aims of the present study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of two different interventions, ACT and a workplace intervention (WPI),&#xD;
      both as standalone treatments and combined, and compare these to TAU. The second aim is to&#xD;
      examine different variables that moderate program efficacy and mediates change in RTW for the&#xD;
      different interventions. The third aim is to evaluate cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General research questions in this project includes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of two different rehabilitation models, one&#xD;
           based on psychotherapy, ACT, and the other on workplace-interventions, WPI , when these&#xD;
           are offered as standalone interventions and in combination for patients with adjustment,&#xD;
           anxiety and depressive disorders?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examination of mediators and moderators that might explain differences in RTW for&#xD;
           individuals with common mental disorders participating in rehabilitation interventions?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does actual use of prescribed selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI) or&#xD;
           Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) increase RTW compared to non-use of&#xD;
           prescribed SSRI or SNRI among patients with adjustment, anxiety and depressive&#xD;
           disorders? Methods The study is an RCT with repeated measures and a mixed design.&#xD;
           Measures are taken at pre- and post-treatment and at 6, 12, 24 and 60 months follow-up.&#xD;
           Participants are recruited from the National Insurance Office (NIO) starting in February&#xD;
           2013. Individuals ages 18-60 living in the county of Stockholm with at least 50%&#xD;
           employment rate applying for sick pay due to common mental disorders are consecutively&#xD;
           invited to an diagnostic interview and assessment during the inclusion period.&#xD;
           Individuals that meet the inclusion criteria and gives informed consent are invited to&#xD;
           participate. A power analysis based on a study on the WPI by Björn Karlsson gives that&#xD;
           in order to get 80 % power, 72 participants is required in each group. 320 participants&#xD;
           will be randomized to one of 4 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ACT; The ACT intervention consists of 6 manual-based face-to-face sessions and&#xD;
           internet-based homework modules. The manual is based on the six core processes in the&#xD;
           ACT-model: acceptance, mindfulness, defusion, self as context, values and committed&#xD;
           action.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. WPI; This interventions aims at the facilitation of dialogue between the participant and&#xD;
           the workplace through a series of steps consisting of individual interviews with the&#xD;
           participant and his/her nearest supervisor and a so called &quot;convergence dialogue&#xD;
           meeting&quot; in order to agree upon short- and long-term solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. ACT + WPI; In this group, the participants will collaterally receive the ACT and the WPI&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Control group; Treatment as usual (TAU) which means that the participant continues in&#xD;
           ordinary health care and does not receive interventions other than the initial&#xD;
           assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Consists of the within-group variable Time with five measurement points: pre-, and post&#xD;
           treatment, 6, 12, 24 and 60 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Consists of the between-groups variable Treatment condition with four conditions as&#xD;
           described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Consists of the between-groups variable Use or non-use of prescribed SSRI or SNRI&#xD;
           reported by the patients in a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependent variables Primary outcome measure is RTW based on register data from the NIO,&#xD;
      self-reported data regarding short-term absence (periods of less than 14 days) and&#xD;
      self-reported work ability according to the Work Ability Index (WAI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures are symptom severity and general function. Depression is measured&#xD;
      with MADRS-S (Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale) and HAD - subscale Depression&#xD;
      (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), anxiety with HAD - subscale Anxiety, Burnout&#xD;
      symptoms with Karolinska Exhaustion Disorder Scale (KEDS). General function as measured by&#xD;
      the Work and Social Adjustment Scale and general satisfaction with life with the Satisfaction&#xD;
      with life scale (SWLS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures of mediators will be taken in connection with treatment sessions and include: the&#xD;
      Return To Work Self Efficacy scale (RTW-SE), The work-related acceptance and action&#xD;
      questionnaire (WAAQ) and Bull´s Eye Values Survey (BEVS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures of moderators include: demographic data, sick days in the past five years, pre&#xD;
      scores on self-rated symptoms (MADRS-S, HAD, KEDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses Efficacy will be assessed with Mixed models for repeated measures. Mixed&#xD;
      regression models are a powerful way to conduct an intent-to-treat analysis. Unlike normal&#xD;
      analysis of variance/analysis of covariance, these models use all available data from all&#xD;
      participants and take into account the obtained outcome and missing data. Mediational&#xD;
      analyses will be based on Baron &amp; Kenny´s requirements for testing mediation.&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness are based on a combination of cost-effectiveness analyses and&#xD;
      cost-utility-analyses according to the Manual for Assessment of Cost-effectiveness-analysis&#xD;
      in REHSAM based on contemporary guidelines in health economic science practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research provides an opportunity to better understand the process of RTW for individuals&#xD;
      on sick-absence due to common mental disorders. A theoretical understanding of the mechanisms&#xD;
      behind treatment change, which may differ for different subgroups, is important to ultimately&#xD;
      be able to maximize or change treatments for individuals on sick-leave. This study might&#xD;
      significantly contribute to answer real everyday questions that clinicians face as well as&#xD;
      policy makers and agencies working with the task to increase RTW and promote public health&#xD;
