      Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of a web tutorial based on case&#xD;
      vignettes as a complementary tool for teaching literature critical assessment to nursing&#xD;
      students, in terms of: 1) knowledge, 2) tutorial quality and acceptability and 3) students'&#xD;
      point of view on research participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Nursing second-year students from 3 universities in Paris (Paris Descartes&#xD;
      University, Paris Diderot University and Paris 13 Nord).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A randomized controlled trial will assess the teaching efficacy of a case vignettes&#xD;
      based tutorial compared to no tutorial. In order to preserve a minimal blinding of&#xD;
      participants, the comparator will be a basic passive teaching presentation on internet. The&#xD;
      students will be randomized in two parallel groups. They will be evaluated on a final case&#xD;
      vignette, and will be invited to follow the other intervention after evaluation. The&#xD;
      allocation of participants will be done by a computerized randomization list, the sequence&#xD;
      will be created by an independent statistician with a ratio 1: 1: 1. Since the students&#xD;
      follow courses in different nursing institutes for each university which may have different&#xD;
      teaching content and organization, the randomization will be stratified by nursing institute.&#xD;
      Allocation concealment will be provided because only the statistician will have access to the&#xD;
      randomization list. All the participants will receive an individual mail linking them to his&#xD;
      group dedicated website. In order to preserve a minimal blinding of participants, the&#xD;
      comparator will be a passive presentation and the participants will not be informed of the&#xD;
      intervention evaluated and will have the opportunity to follow the other intervention after&#xD;
      the evaluation. In parallel, both groups will follow normally their university courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: A case vignette is a clinical scenario based on clinical practice. It will ask&#xD;
      a clinical problem the student will have to answer by reading a research article on a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial. Then he will have to answer questions about this article which are&#xD;
      related to the major methodological points of a randomized trial. All these steps are&#xD;
      available on a secure website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The primary endpoint will be the student's knowledge of critical assessment of&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials. It will be measured by students' score on an evaluation case&#xD;
      vignette with multiple choice questionnaires. The secondary endpoints will be the quality&#xD;
      perception and acceptance of the tutorial and if the tutorial has modified their perception&#xD;
      of research participation. Responses will be ranged by a 5-point Likert scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential interests: This study takes place in the field of nursing universitary teaching.&#xD;
      Nursing students have entered recently the universitary education system which enhances the&#xD;
      nursing research, an emerging field in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope that this complementary teaching tool will enhance the knowledge and&#xD;
      participation of nurses in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size expected: 506 participants.&#xD;

      Statistical analysis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitatives variables will be presented with the number and percentage of participants and&#xD;
      of missing data for each outcome. Quantitative variables will be presented with the number&#xD;
      and percentage of participants, mean, standard deviation and range. Assymetrical variables&#xD;
      will be presented with the median and the interquartile range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative outcomes will be compared between groups with a Fisher test in a linear mixed&#xD;
      model. (the fixed effect will be the allocation group and the random effect will be the&#xD;
      nursing institute so as to take into account the similarity of the students for each&#xD;
      institute).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative outcomes will be compared using a mixed effect logistic regression model (the&#xD;
      fixed effect will be the allocation group and the random effect will be the nursing institute&#xD;
      so as to take into account the similarity of the students for each institute).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data analysis will be carried out as an 'intention-to treat analysis' in all randomized&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary outcome, missing data will be dealt with the multiple imputation method.&#xD;
      Sensibility analysis will be used to confirm the results for the primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-tailed tests will be applied at a standard level of 5%. The statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      performed with SAS 9.3 statistical software.&#xD;
