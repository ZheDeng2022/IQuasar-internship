      This double-blind, randomized trial aims to evaluate whether uninterrupted anti-platelet&#xD;
      therapy (clopidogrel) will increase the risk of bleeding associated with removal of polyp&#xD;
      during colonoscopy in patients with coronary artery disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clopidogrel is a potent anti-platelet agent that, when combines with aspirin, is essential in&#xD;
      treating acute myocardial infarction and preventing coronary stent thrombosis. However,&#xD;
      adding clopidogrel to aspirin has been shown to substantially increase the risk of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal bleeding by 70%. This increased bleeding risk is a particular concern for&#xD;
      patients requiring colonoscopy. The latter is a gold standard for screening colorectal&#xD;
      cancer. This endoscopic procedure is increasingly performed for patients on anti-platelet&#xD;
      drugs because coronary artery disease is associated with increased risk of colorectal&#xD;
      neoplasia. We have shown that over 30% of patients with coronary artery disease have&#xD;
      colorectal neoplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of patients on clopidogrel who undergo colonoscopy is a clinical dilemma.&#xD;
      Continuation of clopidogrel may increase the risk of bleeding associated with endoscopic&#xD;
      resection of polyps (post-polypectomy bleeding). This is a potentially serious complication&#xD;
      because post-polypectomy bleeding is often delayed, difficult to locate, and may provoke&#xD;
      acute coronary syndrome. Conversely, prolonged discontinuation of clopidogrel increases the&#xD;
      risk of recurrent myocardial infarction and coronary stent thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a lack of prospective data on the risk of post-polypectomy bleeding attributable to&#xD;
      clopidogrel. Current American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and British Society of&#xD;
      Gastroenterology Guidelines recommend withholding clopidogrel for 7 to 10 days in planned&#xD;
      high risk endoscopic procedures such as colonoscopic polypectomy. However, this guideline is&#xD;
      largely based on retrospective data and expert opinion. In fact, the anti-platelet effect of&#xD;
      clopidogrel lasts for about 5 days only. Coronary stent thrombosis has been reported as early&#xD;
      as 7 days after stopping clopidogrel. There remains a large gap in our knowledge on the risk&#xD;
      of bleeding in patients taking clopidogrel who undergo gastrointestinal endoscopic&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No randomized trials have assessed whether clopidogrel should be discontinued before&#xD;
      colonoscopy. This randomized trial aims to assess whether uninterrupted clopidogrel therapy&#xD;
      during colonoscopy will increase the risk of post-polypectomy bleeding. Irrespective of the&#xD;
      outcome, this trial will be the first to provide controlled data on the risk of&#xD;
      post-polypectomy bleeding with uninterrupted clopidogrel during colonoscopy. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      this important clinical question is not a priority of pharmaceutical companies because&#xD;
      clopidogrel will be off patent soon. The outcome of this industry-independent clinical trial&#xD;
      may encourage health authorities and international guideline committees to review their&#xD;
      recommendations on the management of anti-platelet therapy for high-risk endoscopic&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Uninterrupted clopidogrel therapy increases the risk of post-polypectomy bleeding&#xD;
      in patients undergoing elective colonoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim To investigate whether uninterrupted clopidogrel therapy before elective colonoscopy will&#xD;
      increase the risk of post-polypectomy bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial in which patients receiving&#xD;
      clopidogrel for coronary stents who require elective colonoscopy will be randomized to either&#xD;
      clopidogrel or its placebo for one week prior to the endoscopic procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopic Procedures Experienced colonoscopists will perform colonoscopy under conscious&#xD;
      sedation with midazolam and pethidine. Bowel preparation consists of polyethylene glycol&#xD;
      taken orally the evening and the morning before procedure together with a minimum of 2 liters&#xD;
      of clear fluids. The adequacy of bowel preparation will be documented (poor, fair, good, or&#xD;
      excellent). Colonoscopists will be instructed to remove all polyps during the colonoscopic&#xD;
      examination. The location and morphologic feature of each polyp will be recorded. The size is&#xD;
      measured using an open biopsy forceps (6 mm apart). Each lesion will be fixed in formalin and&#xD;
      sent to the pathologist for histologic evaluation. No prophylactic clips or detachable loops&#xD;
      will be applied if immediate bleeding is not observed after polypectomy. Intervention for&#xD;
      immediate post-polypectomy bleeding including injection therapy alone or in combination with&#xD;
      endoclip application, if any, will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up assessment All patients will resume their usual prescriptions of clopidogrel after&#xD;
      colonoscopy when oral intake is allowed. They will be monitored hourly for hemodynamic&#xD;
      instability and any delayed post-polypectomy bleeding for 24 hours. After discharge, a&#xD;
      designated research nurse will contact the patients by telephone on Day 2 and Day 7 for&#xD;
      symptoms of bleeding. On Day 30, they will return for a full blood count and symptoms of&#xD;
      delayed post-polypectomy bleeding. Emergency visits and hospital discharge summaries will be&#xD;
      scanned for up to 6 months after colonoscopy for recurrent cardiothrombotic events. A 24-hour&#xD;
      hotline will be provided for patients to report any adverse or serious events.&#xD;
