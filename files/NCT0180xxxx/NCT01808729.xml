  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to see if heritable alterations in the function, biology and&#xD;
      vascular repair capacity of vascular cells make a major contribution to the burden of&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (CAD), fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), and other vascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In more detail, FMD is a nonatherosclerotic vascular disease that primarily affects women&#xD;
      aged 20 to 60. It commonly affects the renal and carotid arteries but may involve almost&#xD;
      every artery in the body. At the cellular level, FMD is characterized by increased fibroblast&#xD;
      proliferation and collagen deposition. This study aims to define some of these cellular&#xD;
      problems by directly studying fibroblast cells from FMD patients and healthy control&#xD;
      subjects. Similarly, CAD is among the leading causes of death worldwide. However, a large&#xD;
      part of the risk for CAD is unexplained. It is thought that a major but undefined risk factor&#xD;
      may be gene (genomic) variations causing a change in vascular cell function. Here, we will&#xD;
      study important vascular cell types in patients with severe and early onset CAD in an attempt&#xD;
      to define these problems. Therefore, in summary, this study will look to define the various&#xD;
      cellular-level problems that occur in patients with both in CAD and FMD. These data will be&#xD;
      linked to DNA-level analyses to ultimately attempt to define the cause of these conditions.&#xD;

      The purpose of this project is to see if heritable alterations in the function, biology and&#xD;
      vascular repair capacity of vascular cells make a major contribution to the burden of&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (CAD), fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), and other vascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be referred for this study by their physician if he/she feels that the patient&#xD;
      qualifies for entry into the study based upon the Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria and is&#xD;
      expected by their physician to be a suitable candidate. This will include: 1) patients with&#xD;
      FMD and non-affected control subjects, 2) patients with early onset CAD in the absence of&#xD;
      significant CAD risk factors, or matching healthy controls those with ≥2 cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors and no CAD (those with angiographically 'normal' coronary arteries). Also, as an&#xD;
      extension of this study, patients with rare, undiagnosed or unusual forms of CAD (e.g.&#xD;
      unexplained dissection, fulminant calcification, aneurysms etc.) and appropriate controls,&#xD;
      will be recruited, particularly if there is a strong family pedigree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include collection of whole blood for subsequent DNA isolation and&#xD;
      sequencing, a plasma sample, and a skin biopsy. Blood will be handled in a standard fashion&#xD;
      to obtain DNA from leukocytes and plasma. These will be stored pending later batched&#xD;
      analysis. Once the skin biopsy tissue is collected, the tissue will be sent to the lab for&#xD;
      further processing. The initial step is that we will derive fibroblasts from the skin&#xD;
      biopsies. In brief, the biopsies are washed, cut into small fragments are distributed on a&#xD;
      culture dish with growth medium and incubated at 37°C. Over the next 4 - 6 weeks, fibroblasts&#xD;
      progressively grow and can be collected. We may then induce these fibroblasts to undergo&#xD;
      changes so that they become stem cells (called &quot;induced pluripotent stem cells&quot; or iPSCs).&#xD;
      Once we have made iPSCs, we can then make endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs), or in fact, many&#xD;
      other cell types. The cells can be frozen until analysis, or until experiments are done in&#xD;
      the future. All of the derived cells (fibroblasts, iPSCs and iPSC-ECs) generated under this&#xD;
      protocol will be kept indefinitely, and may be used for future studies into the causes and&#xD;
      other aspects of FMD or CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is not concerned with any clinical events after patient enrollment. Only clinical&#xD;
      events that have occurred prior to enrollment (e.g. prior myocardial infarction, stroke,&#xD;
      dissection) will be recorded. Once we have obtained these cells, detailed cellular and&#xD;
      molecular analyses will be performed to study the particular cellular defects that are&#xD;
      associated with these differing conditions. This data will be combined with the DNA- and&#xD;
      plasma-derived data in an attempt to define the underlying basis for these disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is not a treatment, no alternative treatment options apply. The subject can decide&#xD;
      not to participate in the trial. No benefit can be promised to any subject in this study. The&#xD;
      information gained may benefit others with the same condition.&#xD;
