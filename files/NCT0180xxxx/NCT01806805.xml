      Myoclonus Dystonia is a disease in which myoclonus distort the precision of movements and so&#xD;
      cause a handicap in the movements of the everyday life. Response to oral medications may be&#xD;
      incomplete and surgery may cause operating risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zonisamide is an antiepileptic drug which could bring a therapeutic profit in Myoclonus&#xD;
      Dystonia on the severity of the myoclonus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In &quot;dystonia&quot;, the involuntary abnormal movements cause a driving handicap and a change of&#xD;
      the quality of life. A particular shape of dystonia, the Myoclonus Dystonia, is characterized&#xD;
      by the ascendancy of myoclonias (abrupt and brief movements) associated with the abnormal&#xD;
      dystonia. Myoclonus is an additional source of handicap in the movements of the everyday&#xD;
      life, because they distort the precision of movements. Response to oral medications may be&#xD;
      incomplete and the tolerance poor, such that deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery is useful&#xD;
      for the major forms but it is also an invasive therapeutics which the operating risk is not&#xD;
      totally estimated in the absence of controlled study. Therefore, it is necessary to&#xD;
      investigate other pharmacological therapeutic tracks which present a good ratio profit /&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zonisamide is usually used in France in the epilepsy's treatment. It showed its efficiency in&#xD;
      the progressive myoclonus epilepsy, not only on the seizure but also on the myoclonia.&#xD;
      Therefore, it showed its efficiency on post-anoxic and propriospinal myoclonus. So, we make&#xD;
      the hypothesis that this medicine could bring a therapeutic profit in the Myoclonus Dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate the efficiency of the zonisamide on the severity of&#xD;
      myoclonus (UMRS) at those patients. The others outcomes are to estimate the impact of the&#xD;
      treatment on the myoclonus's neurophysiological characteristics, the dystonia's severity (BFM&#xD;
      score), the quality of life (SF-36 and CGI scores), but also to investigate the tolerance of&#xD;
      the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-period cross-over design to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect on severity of myoclonus in response to placebo or zonisamide (until 300&#xD;
      mg) in 32 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes an evaluation at the beginning and at the end of every period (4&#xD;
      evaluations at all). Each period includes a phase of titration (six weeks) followed by a&#xD;
      phase of fixed dose (three weeks). Those two periods are separated by a period of wash-out (3&#xD;
      weeks) preceded by a phase of progressive decrease of doses (two weeks).&#xD;

    <description>Zonegran / Placebo Zonisamide (Zonegran ®) and its placebo appear under the shape of virgin capsules of size 1. Each drug will be dispensed successively in a box containing blister packs of 14 capsules. For every period (A and B), box will contain 26 blister packs. A phase of progressive increase of doses by stages of 50 mg / week is planned before reaching the fixed dose of 300 in the daytime during 4 weeks. Then, a progressive diminution over two weeks is planned before the stop.</description>
