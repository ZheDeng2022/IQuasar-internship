  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For critically ill patients, it is important to know when to liberate them from mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation (the removal of breathing or endotracheal tube or extubation) and weaning (the&#xD;
      progressive decrease of the amount of support that a patient receives from the mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation). It is well recognized that prolonged ventilation and weaning harms patients and&#xD;
      introduces significant increased costs to the health care system. The investigators objective&#xD;
      is to improve the safety of removal of life support in critically ill patients by harnessing&#xD;
      information from two new technologies; NM3 and Nexus device. In particular, the investigators&#xD;
      are interested in the patterns of variation of respiratory and cardiac signals from the NM3&#xD;
      device, as well as monitor skin conductance with the Nexus device. The combination of these&#xD;
      measures has not yet been investigated to date, and could represent a novel set of measures&#xD;
      that can be used to help physicians better manage critically ill patients. The current&#xD;
      standard of care dictates that once a patient is considered as a candidate for withdrawal&#xD;
      from ventilation, a spontaneous breathing trial (SBTs) is performed, where the degree of&#xD;
      ventilator support is decreased, and their response is observed to help predict if they will&#xD;
      tolerate extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health is associated with a high degree of variation of physiologic parameters such as heart&#xD;
      rate and respiratory rate, and illness &amp; stress are associated with a loss of variability.&#xD;
      The analysis of variability of biological signals measures the degree of fluctuations present&#xD;
      over time. Previous studies have demonstrated that changes in variability (generally&#xD;
      decreases) are observed in illness states, and the degree of this change correlates with&#xD;
      illness severity. Several studies have reported that reduced heart or respiratory rate&#xD;
      variability (HRV or RRV) during SBTs is associated with extubation failure. Until recently,&#xD;
      variability analysis has traditionally been done only on heart rate (HRV), derived from&#xD;
      analyzing beat-to-beat intervals from the ubiquitous electrocardiogram (ECG). The&#xD;
      investigators aim to apply variability analysis to the respiratory and cardiac signals which&#xD;
      represent a rich novel set of muti-organ variability measures whose utility in managing&#xD;
      extubation and ventilator weaning has not been investigated to date.&#xD;
