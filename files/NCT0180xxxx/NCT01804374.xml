      This is a trial for patients affected by metastatic or relapsed osteosarcoma which progressed&#xD;
      after first or further line treatments. In this trial, all patients will be treated until&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity with sorafenib and everolimus. The treatment with&#xD;
      sorafenib and everolimus aimed to obtain a 50% rate of patients free from further progression&#xD;
      of the disease after 6 months from study entry.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients affected by metastatic or relapsed osteosarcoma which progressed after first or&#xD;
      further line treatments still have a poor outcome. Standard chemotherapy has limited activity&#xD;
      in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study in patient affected by relapsed unresectable osteosarcoma, sorafenib&#xD;
      alone demonstrated promising activity. In the preclinical setting, everolimus was able to&#xD;
      improve the activity of sorafenib. Sorafenib and everolimus, by hitting crucial pathways&#xD;
      which are essential for osteosarcoma cell proliferation and survival, with an entirely&#xD;
      different approach aimed to overcome the resistance to standard chemotherapy showed by&#xD;
      relapsed osteosarcoma. In this trial, all patients will be treated with sorafenib and&#xD;
      everolimus at the dosage of 800 mg and 5 mg per day, respectively. Both drugs have to be&#xD;
      taken orally. The treatment will be continued until progression or unacceptable toxicities.&#xD;
      The objective of the present trial is to obtain a 50% rate of patients alive and free from&#xD;
      progression of their disease 6 months after trial enrolment. The disease will be evaluated&#xD;
      every 2 months with a CT scan.&#xD;
