  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza infection in recipients of solid organ transplants recipients while on maintenance&#xD;
      immunosuppressant therapy is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Although&#xD;
      influenza vaccination is recommended in these high-risk patients, safety and immunogenicity&#xD;
      of commercially available different strengths of influenza vaccine have not been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study objective is to determine the safety and immunogenicity of Fluzone and&#xD;
      Fluzone High-Dose, with a secondary objective to determine the tolerability and efficacy of&#xD;
      two different strengths of trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV, flu vaccine). Both vaccines are&#xD;
      commercially available for use in the general population. Fluzone is approved for use in 6&#xD;
      months of age and older, and Fluzone High-Dose is approved for use in 65 years of age and&#xD;
      older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an exploratory, open-label, parallel group, observer blinded, prospective study. All&#xD;
      recipients of kidney, lung, heart transplants who attend for post-transplant follow-up, at&#xD;
      least 30-days after transplantation at Inova Fairfax Hospital Transplant Center will be&#xD;
      eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will be followed for three months (a total of 4 visits) following&#xD;
      enrollment and randomization: day 0 (enrollment) and follow-up visits at weeks 1, 4, 8, and&#xD;
      12.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A potential strategy to enhance immune responses to influenza vaccine in this patient&#xD;
      population could be to use different strengths of TIV. One of the pathways that can improve&#xD;
      the immunogenicity of inactivated vaccines is to increase the dose of influenza antigens&#xD;
      contained in the vaccine. Studies have demonstrated that increasing the dose of the influenza&#xD;
      virus hemagglutinin for each of the commonly encountered viral strains beyond the&#xD;
      conventional dose of 15 microgram for each strain is associated with dose-dependent increase&#xD;
      in serum antibody titers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influenza TIV is commercially available in two different strengths, Fluzone as well as&#xD;
      Fluzone High-Dose, and it is valuable because of variable immunogenic potency of different&#xD;
      strengths. Fluzone is approved for use in persons 6 months of age and older. High-dose&#xD;
      Fluzone is approved for use in persons 65 years of age and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this exploratory study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of these two commercially available different strengths of TIV in solid organ&#xD;
      transplant recipients (kidney, heart and lung) in the period after 30 days after transplant&#xD;
      procedure. We will evaluate the safety, tolerability (reactogenicity) and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      two different strengths of commercially available TIV in a single center, cluster&#xD;
      randomization, investigator blinded, study by enrolling patients in the post-transplant&#xD;
      clinic at Inova Fairfax Hospital from: August 1, 2013 - March 31, 2014; and August 1, 2014 to&#xD;
      March 31, 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol will remain active till December 31, 2016. All bio-specimens will be stored&#xD;
      till December 31, 2016.&#xD;
