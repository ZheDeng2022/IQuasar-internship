  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed study the investigators aim to evaluate the effect of the standard of care&#xD;
      dose (40mg) of MMC mixed with TC-3 gel (with sustained release mechanism on the drug) on low&#xD;
      risk recurrent NMIBC lesions and to compare our findings to instillation with the standard&#xD;
      mode of instillation- 40mg MMC in water in order to examine our hypothesis that MMC mixed&#xD;
      with TC-3 gel will have at least non-inferior and even superior results over the standard&#xD;
      instillation mode&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that this study is of importance of several aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. It evaluates a new mode of bladder instillation that may bypass the drawbacks of the&#xD;
           current instillation mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If proved effective this mode of treatment might save the need of TURBT performance and&#xD;
           serve as a new mode of tumor ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Even if proved partially effective this mode of treatment will diminish tumors size or&#xD;
           number thus enable a more limited TURBT procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. This mode of treatment will enable immediate medical attendance to the patient's tumor&#xD;
           recurrence without the waiting period (resulting from queues in the medical centers) for&#xD;
           TURBT, which might improve the patient's prognostic outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If this experimental treatment will prove to have a better ablative effect, this could&#xD;
           be translated to a better prophylactic effect of tumor recurrence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-muscle-Invasive Bladder cancer is mainly treated by tumor resection (Trans Urethral&#xD;
      Resection - TUR), followed by series of intravesical instillations of prophylactic&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic drugs as Mitomycin C (MMC) or BCG. This treatment approach is limited due to&#xD;
      rapid dilution the chemotheraputic drug by the incoming urine and clearance by urination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TheraCoat core technology is based on a reverse thermal biodegradable gel (TC-3) (low&#xD;
      viscosity at 5°C gel appearance at body temperature)for drug retention in the urinary&#xD;
      bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to instillation, the TC-3 hydrogel, in a liquid state, is mixed with MMC.TC-3 mixed&#xD;
      with MMC is instilled to the bladder by a catheter. Following gel insertion to the bladder,&#xD;
      the gel solidifies and forms a drug reservoir inside the bladder. Upon contact with urine the&#xD;
      gel dissolves and is cleared out from the bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravesical MMC instillation using TheraCoat gel is expected to increase treatment&#xD;
      efficiency due to prolongation of treatment duration and consequently improving bladder&#xD;
      exposure to MMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Protocol - Immediately following baseline cystoscopy and tumor diagnosis and&#xD;
      patient undergoes 6 weekly instillations followed by 2-4 weeks healing period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1st Follow-Up Visit (Pre-Scheduled TURBT Visit): The patient will undergo a second Cystoscopy&#xD;
      to compare to the Baseline status and after that a follow-up period: 3,6,9,12 months.&#xD;

    <description>Cystoscopic and pathological effect (evaluated during TUR-BT visit) of pre-TURBT intravesical instillations with 40 mg of MMC mixed with 60cc TC-3 Hydrogel on bladder lesion(s) of NMIBC patients. At To, which is the time of identification of a recurrent tumor by cystoscopy, the number, size and location of the lesions will be documented and photographed. Each tumor size will be evaluated by photographing a ureter catheter adjacent to the tumor. Since the ureter catheter diameter is a pre-known variable, the tumor diameter can be calculated using specific software developed for study purposes. Photography of the tumor with a pre-known diameter ureter catheter will be performed during the same cystoscopy as described above and will be evaluated by a central clinic for uniformity of measurements, and the results of these measurements will serve for the post study evaluation of the change in tumor diameter</description>
