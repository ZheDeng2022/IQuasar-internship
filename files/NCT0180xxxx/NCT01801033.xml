      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Hypothyroidism is a condition caused by the loss of function of the thyroid gland. The&#xD;
      thyroid gland produces two hormones, T4 and T3. These hormones control the metabolism and&#xD;
      function of many organs. Lack of energy, depression, and constipation are common symptoms of&#xD;
      hypothyroidism. T4 is converted into T3, the active form of thyroid hormone, by two enzymes&#xD;
      called deiodinases. People with hypothyroidism are treated with a synthetic T4 hormone, which&#xD;
      the enzymes convert to T3. This treatment is usually effective, but some people continue to&#xD;
      have symptoms even after treatment. Some researchers think that this may be caused by a&#xD;
      problem with the enzymes that convert T4 into T3. They want to look at how the enzymes&#xD;
      regulate the levels of T4 and T3 in the blood. They will do so by using a drug that blocks&#xD;
      the action of one of the two enzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To look at how thyroid hormone enzyme blocking affects hypothyroidism treatment medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have hypothyroidism and are on thyroid hormone&#xD;
      replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study consists of one screening visit, 9 days of inpatient hospital admission, and a&#xD;
           follow-up visit 2 weeks after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will&#xD;
           provide blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive balanced-diet meals to take home for the 2 days before they&#xD;
           enter the hospital. They will continue this diet while in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the inpatient stay, participants will be monitored with regular blood tests. They&#xD;
           will have the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continued thyroid hormone replacement for all 9 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug to block thyroid enzyme for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metabolism test, with room temperature changes, on days 1, 2, 5, 8, and 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of body fat on days 2, 5, and 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood glucose tests on days 1 and 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle contraction tests on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart imaging studies on days 2, 5, and 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional skeletal muscle and fat tissue biopsies on days 1 and 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be a follow-up visit 2 weeks after leaving the hospital. Participants will&#xD;
           have a final physical exam and provide blood samples.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Thyroid hormone action is an important regulator of the metabolism and the function of many&#xD;
      organs. The active form of thyroid hormone is T3, and its blood and tissue levels are the&#xD;
      result of the secretion of T3 and its precursor, thyroxine (T4), from the thyroid gland, of&#xD;
      the peripheral conversion of T4 into T3, and of the degradation of these hormones. In&#xD;
      hypothyroid patients (particularly patients who underwent total thyroidectomy), the levels of&#xD;
      T3 are entirely dependent on the exogenously administered T4 (Levothyroxine, L-T4) which is&#xD;
      converted to T3 or to the inactive form, rT3, by enzymes called deiodinases. This complex&#xD;
      system has only been partially studied in humans and very little is known about the&#xD;
      correlation between circulating levels of T3 and end-organ target tissue thyroid hormone&#xD;
      action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this protocol is to characterize the contribution of the two activating&#xD;
      deiodinases (type-1 and type-2) to the blood levels and biological effects of T3. To achieve&#xD;
      this goal we intend to study hypothyroid patients treated with adequate replacement of L-T4&#xD;
      therapy while simultaneously blocking the activity of the type-1 deiodinase with&#xD;
      propylthiouracil (PTU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty hypothyroid patients who underwent total thyroidectomy or are affected by&#xD;
      hypothyroidism and are on L-T4 therapy with normal TSH values will be recruited. After&#xD;
      enrollment in the study, the patients eligibility will be determined during an outpatient&#xD;
      visit. Patients will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for a 9-day period and will&#xD;
      receive PTU at a dose of 200 mg four times daily for seven days. During the hospitalization&#xD;
      for this research protocol, the following studies will be performed: serial blood sampling&#xD;
      for circulating thyroid hormones to obtain pharmacokinetic parameters of T3, lipids, glucose&#xD;
      and insulin; body composition; resting energy expenditure at room temperature and during&#xD;
      exposure to mild cold; echocardiogram and EKG; skeletal muscle strength measurement and&#xD;
      cardiac MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results obtained from this study will help in further characterizing the effects of&#xD;
      thyroid hormone on metabolism, and may lead to important information on how to optimize the&#xD;
      thyroid hormone replacement therapy for the treatment of hypothyroidism.&#xD;
