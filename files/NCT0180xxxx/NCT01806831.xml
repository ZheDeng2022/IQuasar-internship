      The laser areas treated with biocellulose sheet from coconut juice containing&#xD;
      anti-hyperpigmentation agent (&quot;biocellulose mask&quot;, &quot;Farhorm®&quot;) heal faster than vaseline&#xD;
      ointment which is a standard treatment.&#xD;

      Volar surface at upper arm (2X2 cm) on both sides were treated with semi ablative, 1,550 nm&#xD;
      Erbium: glass fractional laser. Biocellulose sheet from coconut juice containing&#xD;
      anti-hyperpigmentation agent (&quot;biocellulose mask&quot;,&quot;Farhorm®&quot;)was applied for 20 min on one&#xD;
      side and the other side was treated with vaseline ointment. The redness, skin hydration and&#xD;
      skin pigmentation were evaluated at that area before laser, immediately after laser and after&#xD;
      applying the treatment. These parameters were compared between treatment (area treated with&#xD;
      Biocellulose sheet from coconut juice containing anti-hyperpigmentation agent, &quot;biocellulose&#xD;
      mask&quot;, &quot;Farhorm®&quot;) and control (vaseline ointment).&#xD;
