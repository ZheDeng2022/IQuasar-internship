  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is common in males and may develop over the course of an individual's life.&#xD;
      This cancer is often discovered at the time of routine physical examinations and/or blood&#xD;
      work or on rectal examination. Once diagnosed, most patients do require some form of&#xD;
      treatment so that the prostate cancer does not progress to cause damage and/or shortened&#xD;
      lifespan. Occasionally, after patients receive treatment, the investigators have found that&#xD;
      an area of cancer remains within the prostate. Those patients with a large area of cancer&#xD;
      (i.e. seen on MRI image) appear to have a higher chance of remaining or recurrent prostate&#xD;
      cancer even after standard treatment. Thus, the investigators believe that the area of the&#xD;
      prostate gland occupied by a dense area of cancer may need more radiation therapy than normal&#xD;
      to remain cancer free.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard therapy currently in place in North America: Currently patients who are diagnosed&#xD;
      with prostate cancer have 3 common options: surgery, external beam radiation therapy (EBRT)&#xD;
      alone or internal radiation (brachytherapy). Patients may or may not receive hormone therapy&#xD;
      alongside the radiation depending on their physician's preference. For those who receive&#xD;
      radiation therapy, the tumor typically receives the same dose as the rest of the prostate&#xD;
      gland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings to date: In the past few years the investigators have discovered that patients with&#xD;
      a tumor large enough to be seen on MRI images (&gt;5mm) have a higher chance than normal of&#xD;
      having cancer remain in the prostate, despite receiving treatment for their cancer 3 years&#xD;
      earlier. Using new technology investigators can deliver radiation therapy after viewing the&#xD;
      prostate tumor on MRI. This guides therapy, allowing the radiation treatment to be targeted&#xD;
      to the tumor within the prostate. Based on this earlier success the investigators believe&#xD;
      that they can now safely give a higher dose of radiation to specifically target the cancer&#xD;
      within the prostate gland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reason for the study: The investigators would like to test this technology and expertise to&#xD;
      give radiation to a higher than normal dose to the tumor nodule in prostate gland.&#xD;

      This is a prospective two arm phase 2 trial investigating the technical and clinical&#xD;
      performance of tumor-targeted (rather than prostate targeted) radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 (Control group): This group consists of patients who have had previous radiation.&#xD;
      This group will not receive any active treatment but will have a biopsy at 3 years from the&#xD;
      time they completed their radiation therapy. Patient in this group will also continue to have&#xD;
      their PSA checked per standard practice&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 (Experimental group): Patients in this group will receive one of 2 treatment arms of&#xD;
      their choice. In addition to the MRI-guided prostate biopsy at 3 years and regular standard&#xD;
      of care PSA checks, this group will also complete a quality of life questionnaire and have&#xD;
      regular imaging per standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will be followed by the research team per protocol.&#xD;
