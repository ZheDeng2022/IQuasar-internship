  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, partially-blinded, placebo and moxifloxacin-controlled, single dose,&#xD;
      4-period, balanced crossover study. The primary objective of this study is to separately&#xD;
      assess the effects of a therapeutic and supratherapeutic dose of GSK1322322 on the cardiac&#xD;
      conduction (corrected QT interval [QTc]) compared with placebo in eligible healthy male and&#xD;
      female subjects. Avelox (moxifloxacin hydrochloride) will be used as an open-label positive&#xD;
      control in order to validate the sensitivity of the study in detecting QTc change.&#xD;
      Approximately 56 healthy subjects will participate in the study for approximately 9 weeks&#xD;
      i.e. 30 day Screening period, 4-week Treatment period, and a 7-10 day Follow-up period. There&#xD;
      will be 4 treatment periods separated by at least 1 week. Subjects will be admitted to the&#xD;
      clinical unit on Day -1 of each dosing period. Each subject will receive each of the four&#xD;
      treatment sequences (GSK1322322 1200 milligram [mg] intravenous [IV] over 60 minutes x 1&#xD;
      dose, GSK1322322 3000 mg IV over 60 minutes x 1 dose, GSK1322322 Placebo IV over 60 minutes x&#xD;
      1 dose, moxifloxacin 400 mg administered orally x 1 dose) on Day 1 of each Treatment period&#xD;
      in a randomized fashion. Twelve-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), continuous Holter monitoring,&#xD;
      laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, and serial pharmacokinetic samples will be&#xD;
      collected for up to 24 hours following each treatment. If no clinically significant&#xD;
      abnormalities are noted, subjects will be discharged from the clinical research unit after&#xD;
      the completion of all assessments on Day 2 in each period and return approximately one week&#xD;
      later for the next dosing period. Each individual subject will follow the same dosing&#xD;
      schedule at every period. A Follow-up visit will be conducted 7-10 days after administration&#xD;
      of the last dose of study medication in treatment period 4.&#xD;
