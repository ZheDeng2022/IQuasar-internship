      This study examines the efficacy of yoga as a complementary therapy for smoking cessation&#xD;

      Despite the existence of effective medications for smoking cessation, approximately 50-80% of&#xD;
      smokers attempt to quit without using pharmacotherapy. Efforts to encourage medication use&#xD;
      during cessation attempts have met with mixed success. Many do not use medications because of&#xD;
      concerns about side effects, contraindications that make medication use inappropriate, and&#xD;
      individual preferences for chemical-free quit attempts. This leaves many smokers seeking an&#xD;
      effective alternative to assist them in attempting to quit smoking. Each year, over 41% of&#xD;
      smokers report failed attempts to quit smoking. Thus, effective non-pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions to increase rates of successful cessation are greatly needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research, and the research of other investigators, has demonstrated that traditional&#xD;
      (Western) exercise (e.g., brisk walking, bicycling) improves smokers' ability to successfully&#xD;
      quit. Exercise may help smokers quit by reducing concerns regarding post-cessation weight&#xD;
      gain, and by reducing nicotine withdrawal and enhancing mood. Recent research suggests that&#xD;
      yoga is an acceptable and potentially effective alternative therapy for smoking cessation for&#xD;
      several reasons: As a form of exercise, yoga shares many of the same properties as&#xD;
      traditional (Western) aerobic exercise in that yoga has been shown to improve mood, physical&#xD;
      fitness, weight control, self-image and quality of life in healthy and ill populations.&#xD;
      Moreover, features of yoga, including a focus on breathing, mental concentration, meditation,&#xD;
      stress reduction and enhanced mood are likely to have special relevance for smokers who are&#xD;
      trying to quit. Thus, yoga may be particularly attractive as an alternative for individuals&#xD;
      who either cannot use medications, or who choose not to use medications while quitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will test the efficacy of Yoga as a complementary therapy for smoking&#xD;
      cessation using a randomized, controlled study design. Adult smokers will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either; 1) Yoga, or 2) an equal contact time Control group (CTL) given a health &amp;&#xD;
      wellness program to control for contact time. All participants will be provided (separately&#xD;
      by treatment group assignment) with the same cognitive-behavioral Smoking Cessation&#xD;
      Counseling (SCC). Smoking abstinence will be measured at the end of treatment (week 8) and at&#xD;
      3, 6 and 12 months follow-up. We hypothesize that abstinence will be significantly higher in&#xD;
      the SCC+Yoga group compared to SCC+CTL. We will also test theoretically posited mediators of&#xD;
      intervention efficacy (e.g., perceived stress, cognitive/perceptual changes), examine the&#xD;
      cost-efficacy of the yoga intervention, and examine the relationship between maintenance of&#xD;
      yoga practice during the post-treatment period and smoking status. This study builds on our&#xD;
      programmatic line of research developing innovative, theory-driven smoking cessation&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;
