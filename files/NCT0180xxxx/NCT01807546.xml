  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if tumors in patients with papillomavirus&#xD;
      (HPV) positive or negative squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) that no longer responds to standard&#xD;
      therapy will decrease in size following treatment with the investigational drug, rigosertib&#xD;
      sodium (ON 01910.Na). A secondary objective is to determine if treatment with rigosertib&#xD;
      causes any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rigosertib is an investigational drug, which means that it has not been approved by the U.S.&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat any diseases. We are studying rigosertib as a new&#xD;
      anticancer drug. Tests that we have done in the laboratory suggest that rigosertib works by&#xD;
      blocking cell division in cancer cells and causing them to die.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multicenter, Phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral&#xD;
      rigosertib in patients with relapsed or metastatic squamous cell carinoma (SCC) who&#xD;
      previously received platinum-based chemotherapy and/or chemo-radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patients with head and neck squamous cell carinoma (HNSCC), non-small cell lung SCC,&#xD;
      skin SCC, cervical SCC, penile SCC, anal SCC or esophageal SCC will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be administered rigosertib capsules at a dose of 560 mg BID on days 1 to 14 of&#xD;
      a 21-day cycle. Patients will be enrolled in 2 cohorts based on HPV test results:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1 will include up to 40 patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive SCC, of&#xD;
           which approximately 30 patients will have HNSCC, and approximately 10 patients with SCC&#xD;
           of another origin (eg, cervix, anal, penile);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2 will include up to 40 patients with HPV-negative SCC, of which approximately 30&#xD;
           patients will have HNSCC, and approximately 10 patients with SCC of another origin (eg,&#xD;
           lung, skin, esophageal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for progression after completing 3 cycles of therapy and every 3&#xD;
      cycles thereafter. Patients with stable disease (SD) or better, based on revised Response&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) 1.1, will receive repeated cycles of treatment on a 21-day&#xD;
      cycle schedule until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal&#xD;
      of consent. Patients with progressive disease (PD) but who, in the opinion of the&#xD;
      Investigator, appear to be deriving clinical benefit, may continue on study with a planned&#xD;
      disease reassessment after one further cycle of therapy. Should the patient have SD or PR at&#xD;
      this reassessment, s/he may continue on study, with subsequent reassessments every 3 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following discontinuation of rigosertib treatment, patients' mortality status will be&#xD;
      assessed every 3 months.&#xD;
