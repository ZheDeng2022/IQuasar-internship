    <textblock>
      Background: Low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with high risk of&#xD;
      non-communicable diseases and all-cause mortality. Physical activity level is the primary&#xD;
      determinant of cardiorespiratory fitness in adults. However, knowledge on how to motivate&#xD;
      people to engage in physical activity and maintain an active lifestyle is lacking. This study&#xD;
      aims to investigate whether a motivational, individual, and locally anchored exercise&#xD;
      intervention, in primary care, can improve cardiorespiratory fitness in 30 to 49 year olds&#xD;
      with a low or very low cardiorespiratory fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomised controlled trial with 6 and 12 months follow-up. The primary outcome is&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness. Secondary outcomes include biochemical parameters (HbA1C, HDL- and&#xD;
      LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride), physical activity level (measured by accelerometer),&#xD;
      self-reported physical activity, anthropometric parameters and health-related quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Cardiorespiratory fitness will be estimated via a maximal incremental exercise test&#xD;
      and expressed as the index of maximum oxygen uptake per minute divided by body weight (ml&#xD;
      O2/kg/min). A total of 236 participants, classified with a very low or low cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      fitness at a local health check programme, (corresponding to ≤ 39 and ≤35 ml O2/kg/min. for&#xD;
      30-39 and 40-49 year-old men respectively and ≤33 and ≤31 ml O2/kg/min. for 30-39 and 40-49&#xD;
      year-old women respectively), will be randomised into two groups. The intervention group will&#xD;
      receive 4 motivational interviews, six months membership to a sport club, and a global&#xD;
      positioning watch to upload training activity to a social media. The comparison group will&#xD;
      receive standard care: a one hour motivational interview. In addition to an&#xD;
      Intention-to-treat analysis a per-protocol analysis will be performed. Effect of the&#xD;
      intervention will be estimated by evaluating the differences in mean changes in&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion:In new and innovative ways the focus of this study will be to improve&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness among a 30-49 year-old at-risk group using social media,&#xD;
      GPS-technology, on-going personal support and individually tailored physical activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background It is well known that low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with&#xD;
      a high risk of noncommunicable diseases and all cause mortality, and that improvements in&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness decreases this risk especially among the least fit (1-5). Although&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness has a genetic contribution, physical activity habits are the&#xD;
      primary determinant of cardiorespiratory fitness in adults, and changes in physical activity&#xD;
      levels result in changes in cardiorespiratory fitness (2,6). Thus the World Health&#xD;
      Organization recommends adults aged between 18-64 to do at least 150 minutes of&#xD;
      moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity&#xD;
      aerobic physical activity weekly or an equivalent combination of moderate- and&#xD;
      vigorous-intensity activity. In Denmark only an estimated 32 % fullfill these recommendations&#xD;
      (7) and improving physical activity among this group of people is of great importance to&#xD;
      public health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In primary care several simple- and multicomponent physical activity interventions have been&#xD;
      conducted in order to increase physical activity. However, the results of these interventions&#xD;
      remain inconsistent. In addition, the content of the interventions is often unclearly&#xD;
      described, particularly in relation to intensity and fidelity of the intervention delivery&#xD;
      and reviews reveal how most of the studies use self-reported measures of physical activity&#xD;
      (8,9). These issues warrant well-described intervention studies using objectively measures of&#xD;
      physical activity and specifically designed for, and evaluated in primary care settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Denmark, the &quot;Check your health&quot; programme is aimed at screening all individuals&#xD;
      (n≈26,500) in the municipality of Randers aged between 30-49 years for cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      during a 5-year period. Identifying people that are insufficiently active and people with a&#xD;
      low cardiorespiratory fitness is one of the central objectives of the programme and this is&#xD;
      done by self-reported and objective measures of physical activity and cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform a successful intervention, strategies and techniques to motivate and guide people&#xD;
      to adopt healthy choices need to be identified. Some of this may be accomplished by close&#xD;
      supervision and personal instruction with healthcare professionals applying communication&#xD;
      skills such as motivational interviewing (10,11), which has been found to be an effective&#xD;
      approach to changing behaviour. This method specifically offers promise in improvement of&#xD;
      cardiovascular health status (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, a key issue will be to adopt modern technology and social media into the&#xD;
      interventions (13). A Danish report supports this idea and concludes that particularly the&#xD;
      30-50 year olds, an age-group that does not always give high priority to regular physical&#xD;
      activity due to lack of time and commitments such as job/further education and establishment&#xD;
      of a family, are motivated by the social media and technology (14-16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, it is also suggested that physical activity interventions should be integrated into&#xD;
      the structure of a broader range of community-based organisations e.g. sport clubs in order&#xD;
      to offer a wide range of activities, and thereby individualise and anchor the physical&#xD;
      activity locally (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the combination of motivational interviewning, social media, technology and the&#xD;
      community organisations may build individual capability and organisational capacity for&#xD;
      behaviour change, create new social norms, and promote policy and environmental changes that&#xD;
      support higher levels of physical activity across the population in the long-term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore hypothesise that a locally anchored &quot;primary care package&quot; containing social&#xD;
      media and technology, ongoing personal support and individually tailored flexible physical&#xD;
      activity will improve cardiorespiratory fitness among 30-49 year-olds with a low&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The design of a study evaluating the efficacy of a motivational, individual and locally&#xD;
           anchored exercise intervention in primary care aiming to improve cardiorespiratory&#xD;
           fitness among 30 to 49 year olds with low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The actual intervention to a level of detail that allows its replication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Study design The study is conducted as a single (researcher) blinded randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial higly explanatory in attitude delivered under as optimal conditions as&#xD;
      possible (18).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size This study was calculated to detect a 3 ml/kg/minute (sd 6) difference between&#xD;
      the intervention- and comparison group at the end of 6 months. The sample size calculation&#xD;
      was based on unpuplished data from another randomised controlled health screening programme&#xD;
      in Denmark showing a difference in cardiorespiratory fitness of 2,1 (sd 6) over a five year&#xD;
      period and previous studies comparing 6 and 24 month intervention effects of a lifestyle&#xD;
      physical activity program reporting differences between 3.64 (sd 3,5) and 1.34 (sd 3.37)&#xD;
      ml/kg/minute respectively (19). With a power of 90 % using a two-sided p=0.05 test, a sample&#xD;
      size of at least 85 in each group will be necessary. To accommodate non-independence within&#xD;
      couples, we used robust variance estimation to obtain valid uncertainty estimates and an&#xD;
      extra 6 participants in each group will be added to the sample size. Anticipating a drop-out&#xD;
      of 30 %, a total of 118 participants will be included in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants A volunteer sample of 236 participants with low or very low cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      fitness will be recruited from the &quot;Check your health&quot; programme to the MILE-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be a six month &quot;primary care package&quot; based on motivational, individual&#xD;
      and locally anchored physical activity. The content is elaborated in the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity The participants will receive a six-month free membership for Randers&#xD;
      Gymnastic Club, which is a nonprofit local sports club geographically situated in the middle&#xD;
      of Randers municipality.The activities will take place in open classes with other members of&#xD;
      the Randers Gymnastic Club and will be delivered by experienced trained instructors. The&#xD;
      participants will decide themselves whether they will attend activities in Randers Gymnastic&#xD;
      Club, or do moderate/vigorous/high intensity physical activity on their own or in other sport&#xD;
      clubs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual software platform The participants will be required to upload training activities and&#xD;
      pulse data at least once a week to the virtual software platform Endomondo.com via a global&#xD;
      positioning system (GPS)-watch (Garmin Forerunner 210).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motivational interviewing The intervention group will receive four motivational interviews -&#xD;
      at baseline, after three weeks and after three and six months. The purpose of the interviews&#xD;
      will be to support and guide the participants to the kind of physical activity that suits&#xD;
      them and their everyday life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first interview will be a 90-minute long &quot;face to face&quot; interview in Randers Gymnastic&#xD;
      Club including introduction to Randers Gymnastic Club, the GPS-watch and uploading of&#xD;
      training data Endomondo.com.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two ensuing interviews will be 15-minute telephone interviews including a status on the&#xD;
      uploaded activities which the instructors will have access to, and finally a 30-minute face&#xD;
      to face interview will be conducted. The motivational interviews will be delivered by trained&#xD;
      fitness instructors from Randers Gymnastic Club, who have had a total of 8 hours training on&#xD;
      the guiding principles underlying the motivational interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison group Each participant in the comparison group will be invited to a one-hour&#xD;
      motivational interview (11) about their current activity level, motivation and different&#xD;
      options for increasing their physical activity level. The interview will be conducted by an&#xD;
      experienced internationally certified coach at Randers Health Care Centre, and followed by a&#xD;
      second meeting, if requested. This is the current standard care in the municipality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis The primary analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat principle; however&#xD;
      a per-protocol analysis will also be performed. Effect of the intervention on VO2max will be&#xD;
      estimated by the difference of the mean changes after 6 and 12 months between the&#xD;
      intervention group and the comparison group. Furthermore a subgroup analysis regarding gender&#xD;
      will be performed. A Student t-test or nonparametric test will be used for normally and&#xD;
      unevenly distributed data, respectively. Loss to follow-up analyses will be conducted via&#xD;
      baseline characteristics from Check your health and Danish Registers. Results will be&#xD;
      presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p values. P values of &lt;0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered as statistically significant.&#xD;
