  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of SB&#xD;
      9200 given for up to 14 days to subjects with chronic Hepatitis C infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a First-in-human, Two-stage, Multi-centre study. Part A is an open-label, single&#xD;
      ascending dose study in fed or fasted subjects and Part B is a randomized, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      multiple ascending dose study. The study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of ascending doses of SB 9200 given as monotherapy for up to 14 days to subjects with chronic&#xD;
      Hepatitis C infection, and to determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationship&#xD;
      over this dose range.&#xD;
