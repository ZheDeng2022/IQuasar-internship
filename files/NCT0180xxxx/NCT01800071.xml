  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is looking at a vaccine called MVA-EBNA1/LMP2. This is a new vaccine that&#xD;
      has already been studied in small number of cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccine is designed to boost a patient's immunity against a common virus. The virus is&#xD;
      called Epstein Barr virus or EBV. EBV is sometimes found inside cancer cells and is commonly&#xD;
      found in nasopharyngeal cancer cells.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main aims of the clinical study are to find out more about how the immune system responds&#xD;
      to the vaccine, more about the potential side effects of the vaccine and the effects of&#xD;
      giving an additional booster vaccination on the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 18 patients with EBV positive nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) will be recruited to&#xD;
      the trial. Patients will receive up to four vaccinations with the MVA-EBNA1/LMP2 vaccine. The&#xD;
      first three vaccines will be given at 3 weekly intervals, followed by a fourth vaccine 12&#xD;
      weeks later. The vaccine will be given by intradermal injection with the dose divided across&#xD;
      multiple injection sites on the arm, or on the thigh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will participate in the study for approximately 12 months from first vaccination and&#xD;
      attend hospital approximately 11 times during this period. Standard safety assessments will&#xD;
      be performed throughout the trial and at each clinic visit patients will be asked to provide&#xD;
      research blood samples. These samples will be used to monitor the effects of the vaccine on&#xD;
      the patient's immune system.&#xD;

             tumour by immunohistochemistry for viral antigens or EBV early RNA (EBER) fluorescent&#xD;
             in situ hybridisation (FISH).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients in remission or with current disease for whom no standard therapy is&#xD;
             currently appropriate or required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who have received primary treatment for their malignancy (radiotherapy ±&#xD;
             chemotherapy) and up to one additional second-line course of therapy.&#xD;

             measurements must be performed within one week (Day -7 to Day 1) before the patient&#xD;
             receives their first vaccination with MVA-EBNA1/LMP2.&#xD;
