      -  Saliva plays an important role in the homeostasis of the digestive tract mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Salivary organic components, such as the Epidermal Growth Factor(EGF) have been found in&#xD;
           defficient concentrations in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and&#xD;
           reflux related laryngitis (LPR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway is one of the most&#xD;
           important pathways that regulate growth, survival, proliferation, and differentiation in&#xD;
           mammalian cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eperdermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression has been linked to&#xD;
           hyperproliferative diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is unknown if the inflammatory process in GERD is realated to difficiencies in EGFR&#xD;
           expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The objective of the current study was to try to establish a correlation between the&#xD;
           expression of EGFR in the laryngeal and esophageal mucosa and the severity of laryngitis&#xD;
           in adults with GERD and LPR&#xD;

      Objectives: The expression of the Epidermal Growth Factor receptor (EGFR) has been studied in&#xD;
      a number of neoplastic and chronic diseases, but there are no reports in literature regarding&#xD;
      its expression in chronic laryngitis associated to Gastroesophageal Reflux isease (GERD),&#xD;
      also known as Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR). The current study compared the expression of&#xD;
      EGFR in the esophageal and laryngeal mucosa of adults with GERD and LPR. Study Design:&#xD;
      Prospective based on imunohistochemical analysis of parafine embedded biopsy specimens and&#xD;
      clinical data. Methods: From August, 2004 to February 2007 a total of 24 adults with&#xD;
      confirmed diagnosis of LPR and no other clinical conditions or habits known to cause chronic&#xD;
      laryngitis were studied at a University Hospital. Biopsies of the distal esophagus and the&#xD;
      retrocrycoid laryngeal mucosa were obtained during upper digestive endoscopy. Data were&#xD;
      analyzed statistically comparing samples in each individual and between individuals using the&#xD;
      severity of histological signs of inflammation on hematoxacillin and eosinophillin (HE)&#xD;
      stains to immunohistochemical analysis of the expression of EGFR. Other independent variables&#xD;
      were severity of symptoms and signs, gender and age. Fishers´s exact test and multivariance&#xD;
      ANOVA tests were used with significance level established at 95%.&#xD;
