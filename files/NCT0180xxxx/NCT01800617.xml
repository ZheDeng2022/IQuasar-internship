    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a new thyroid hormone preparation. The thyroid gland&#xD;
      produces two thyroid hormones: mostly T4 and a smaller amount of T3. Thyroid hormone therapy&#xD;
      for hypothyroidism or thyroid cancer is generally provided using levothyroxine, which is a&#xD;
      synthetic form of T4. T4 is converted into the active hormone T3 in the circulation.&#xD;
      Therefore, some researchers believe that T3 levels in T4-treated patients may be slightly&#xD;
      lower than in individuals whose own thyroid gland is functioning normally. Symptoms of&#xD;
      hypothyroidism have been suggested to occur because of this possible T3 deficiency, although&#xD;
      this is controversial. Studies of T3, added to or substituted for T4 in traditional&#xD;
      levothyroxine regimens, have generally not shown any benefit of T3. However, it is still&#xD;
      possible that no benefit is seen because of the short duration of action or &quot;half-life&quot; of&#xD;
      T3. This short-life makes it necessary to dose T3 twice or three times daily. Despite&#xD;
      multiple daily doses of T3, T3 levels during its therapy tend to be troubled by peaks and&#xD;
      troughs. These peaks can be associated with symptoms of excessive thyroid hormone levels.&#xD;
      This study will look at TSH and thyroid hormone levels following a daily dose of a new&#xD;
      preparation of T3 that may have longer duration of action than liothyronine. This preparation&#xD;
      of T3 is called Thyromax速 or BCT303. The investigators believe that steady levels of T3 will&#xD;
      be seen after taking Thyromax速. The investigators believe that in patients with&#xD;
      hypothyroidism use of Thyromax速 in the correct dose will produce normal TSH levels, without&#xD;
      producing symptoms of too much thyroid hormone. The goal of future studies is to test whether&#xD;
      Thyromax速 may be a potential treatment for hypothyroidism, by comparing it with traditional&#xD;
      levothyroxine therapy.&#xD;
