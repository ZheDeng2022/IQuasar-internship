      This study is evaluating two approaches to improving the control blood sugar, and other risk&#xD;
      factors for heart disease in overweight and obese adults with type 2 diabetes. The first&#xD;
      approach has participants focus on weight loss via reducing food intake and increasing&#xD;
      physical activity, while attending weekly group sessions led by trained community health&#xD;
      workers for 12 months. The second approach has participants receive education on diabetes&#xD;
      self management, which focuses primarily on glucose control, while attending monthly group&#xD;
      sessions led by a study staff member for 12 months. We are recruiting persons with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes who live in the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County area of North Carolina who are willing&#xD;
      to attend sessions at the Downtown Health Plaza of Wake Forest Baptist Health. We will&#xD;
      measure risk factors for heart disease (glucose control, blood pressure, blood cholesterol)&#xD;
      and calculate the predicted risk of heart disease, and see which intervention lowers risk to&#xD;
      a greater extent at 12 months, as well as 24 months.&#xD;

      The Look AHEAD trial has demonstrated improved risk factor control among overweight or obese&#xD;
      diabetes patients who received an intensive lifestyle intervention at both one and four years&#xD;
      after enrollment. Translating such findings into accessible and effective weight loss&#xD;
      programs is a major public health challenge. We are conducting &quot;Lifestyle Interventions for&#xD;
      Treatment of Diabetes&quot; (LIFT Diabetes). The overall goal is to investigate two approaches to&#xD;
      improving risk factor control; one which is modeled after Look AHEAD and is designed to&#xD;
      achieve 7% weight loss and increase physical activity to &gt; 175 minutes per week among&#xD;
      minority and lower income diabetes patients via a 12-month, group based lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention, using community health workers supervised by an interventionist. Participants&#xD;
      will have up to 4 group visits/month and up to 12 individual contacts/year. The other&#xD;
      approach will promote Diabetes Self Management (DSM) by educating participants regarding&#xD;
      health behaviors which lead to improved diabetes control; this arm is also 12 months, and is&#xD;
      delivered in the clinic by intervention staff via monthly group visits and up to 12&#xD;
      individual contacts/year. We will randomize 260 overweight or obese adults with diabetes to&#xD;
      either intervention, and determine the impact on outcomes (UKPDS-estimated CVD risk, risk&#xD;
      factor control), weight, cost, resource utilization, and safety at 12 months, and after&#xD;
      transitioning back to usual care, at 24 months. The hypotheses are that the community based&#xD;
      intervention results in 10% relative reduction in CVD risk compared to clinic-based&#xD;
      intervention; the interventions are equivalent with respect to adherence and participant&#xD;
      satisfaction; and the community based intervention is associated with lower cost than the&#xD;
      clinic based intervention. Translating evidence based, lifestyle strategies, and targeting&#xD;
      minority and underserved patients, will yield, if successful, models for addressing&#xD;
      diabetes-related health disparities.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women 21 years of age and older residing in the Forsyth County, North Carolina&#xD;
             region.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease: Type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Overweight or obese: defined as body mass index (BMI) greater than 25 kg/m2 (&gt;27 if on&#xD;
             insulin).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If not on diabetes medication, persons with hemoglobin A1c greater than or equal to&#xD;
             6.5% and less than 11.0%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If on diabetes medication, hemoglobin A1c greater than or equal to 5.0% and less than&#xD;
             11.0%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood pressure: BP ≤ 160/100 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A usual source of medical care: The intervention may induce hypoglycemia and have&#xD;
             other risks, and weight loss and increased physical activity may modify the need for&#xD;
             drugs used to treat diabetes, high blood pressure, and lipids. Patients must have a&#xD;
             source for ongoing care. Usual source of care will be documented via a &quot;medical&#xD;
             clearance&quot; form with physician signature verifying that MD is aware their patient is&#xD;
             participating in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to exercise: Increasing moderate intensity physical activity is an integral part&#xD;
             of this intervention. Must be able to walk 1/4 mile without assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to communicate in English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other: Willing to give consent to participate in this research program, including&#xD;
             random allocation to either study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Poorly controlled diabetes: defined by hemoglobin A1c&gt;11%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiovascular disease: Clinical history of cardiovascular disease, or newly diagnosed&#xD;
             at screening. This includes myocardial infarction, heart failure, ischemic heart&#xD;
             disease, stroke and other vascular disease. Persons suspected of having angina (chest&#xD;
             pain) or other potentially ischemic symptoms will be required to be evaluated by their&#xD;
             health care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weight Loss: Currently involved in a supervised medical or surgical weight loss&#xD;
             program or with a history of prior weight loss surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age: We will exclude children (&lt;21 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy: Diabetes during pregnancy has specific management criteria, and the role of&#xD;
             weight loss via caloric restriction and increased physical activity is of uncertain&#xD;
             efficacy and safety. Among women of child-bearing potential, planning to become&#xD;
             pregnant within 12 months will be an exclusion criteria. Women who have recently given&#xD;
             birth and are breast feeding are also excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious Illness with anticipated decreased life expectancy during the 2 year (24&#xD;
             month) time frame of the intervention, such as cancer diagnosis or treatment within&#xD;
             the past 5 years (with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to exercise: Patients who are wheel chair bound, have had an amputation, are&#xD;
             undergoing treatment for lower extremity infections, or who self report being unable&#xD;
             to ambulate 400 meters (1/4 mile) without assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another clinical trial involving intervention(s) which affect any&#xD;
             component of cardiovascular risk. Potential participants who are enrolled in purely&#xD;
             observational studies remain eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal disease: Persons with stage 3 chronic renal disease (estimated glomerular&#xD;
             filtration rate &lt;60ml/min by the chronic kidney disease formula used by Wake Forest&#xD;
             Baptist) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other: Conditions/criteria likely to interfere with participation and acceptance of&#xD;
             randomized assignment, including the following: inability/unwillingness to give&#xD;
             informed consent, major psychiatric or cognitive problems (schizophrenia, dementia),&#xD;
             self-reported active illegal substance or alcohol abuse, and clinical judgment.&#xD;
