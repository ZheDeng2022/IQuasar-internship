  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of individuals who are classified as overweight or obese is increasing all&#xD;
      over the world and it represents a primary health concern due to the relationship between&#xD;
      obesity and a number of diseases, disabilities, comorbidities, and mortality. The definition&#xD;
      of obesity should consider not only the increase of body weight but more precisely the&#xD;
      increase in body fat mass. However, body composition evaluation is rarely performed in&#xD;
      overweight and obese subjects and the diagnosis is almost always achieved just considering&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI). In fact, whereas BMI can be considered an important tool in&#xD;
      epidemiological surveys, different papers stated the limitations of the use of BMI in single&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: to assess the determinants of body composition in a population of overweight and obese&#xD;
      subjects and to propose a different model of estimation of fat mass (FM) in these subjects&#xD;
      when more reliable equipments for the evaluation of body composition are not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: in 103 overweight or obese subjects ( 74 women, aged 41.5±10 years, and 29 men, aged&#xD;
      43.8±8 years); a multidimensional evaluation was performed including the assessment of body&#xD;
      composition using Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA), anthropometry, bioimpedance&#xD;
      analysis (BIA) and biochemical parameters (total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, HDL- and LDL-&#xD;
      cholesterol, free fatty acids and glycerol, glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein, plasma&#xD;
      acylated and unacetylated ghrelin, adiponectin and leptin serum levels).&#xD;

      Participants This study was based on the baseline data from a randomised controlled trial&#xD;
      aimed at the evaluation of the effects of 2- month consumption of a combination of bioactive&#xD;
      food ingredients on changes in body composition, satiety control, thermogenesis, serum&#xD;
      markers of lipolysis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was performed under the approval of the Ethics Committee of the Department of&#xD;
      Internal Medicine and Medical Therapy at University of Pavia. The informed consent to the&#xD;
      study was obtained by all the participants or their legal representatives. Healthy males and&#xD;
      females aged from 25 to 45 years, with a BMI greater than 25 kg/m2 and less than 35 kg/m2,&#xD;
      were eligible for the study. All subjects underwent physical examination, anthropometric&#xD;
      assessment and routine laboratory tests. The complete medical history was collected for all&#xD;
      the subjects. Individuals who were pregnant or lactating, or had any disease potentially&#xD;
      affecting body composition and laboratory evaluation were excluded from the study, especially&#xD;
      severe hepatic or renal disease, unstable cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension,&#xD;
      active cancer or surgery for weight loss were the main exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multidimensional evaluation After a 12- hour fasting, and abstinence from water since&#xD;
      midnight, the subjects arrived at around 8:00 a.m., using motorised transportation, at the&#xD;
      Endocrinology and Clinical Nutrition Unit of the University of Pavia (Italy) and at the&#xD;
      Dietetic and Metabolic Unit, &quot;Villa delle Querce&quot; Clinical Rehabilitation Institute in Rome&#xD;
      (Italy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling for routine blood analysis and for the measurements of leptin, adiponectin,&#xD;
      ghrelin, insulin, glycerol, free fatty acid levels, as well as the assessment of body&#xD;
      composition by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and anthropometry were performed in the&#xD;
      fasting state at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body composition was measured using DXA (Lunar Prodigy DXA, General Electric Medical Systems,&#xD;
      Wisconsin). The in vivo coefficients of variation were 4.2% and 0.48% for fat and lean mass,&#xD;
      respectively. Central fat, defined as the approximation of the visceral fat, was assessed&#xD;
      with DXA, measuring the fat percentage corresponding to an ideal rectangle defined from the&#xD;
      upper edge of the second lumbar vertebra to the lower edge of the fourth lumbar vertebra. The&#xD;
      vertical sides of this area were the continuation of the lateral sides of the rib cage . All&#xD;
      measurements for each parameter were gathered by the same investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following anthropometric measurements were performed in all subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      body weight and height; biceps (BSF), triceps (TSF), suprailiac (SISF), and subscapular&#xD;
      (SSSF) skinfold thicknesses, waist circumference (W), hip circumference (H), arm&#xD;
      circumference (AC) and calf circumference (CC) In order to avoid the inter- assessor&#xD;
      variability, anthropometric variables were measured by a unique investigator following a&#xD;
      standardized technique .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the abovementioned anthropometric parameters, the following variables were calculated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body mass index (BMI): weight (kg) / height2 (m2) Waist to hip ratio (WHR) arm muscle area&#xD;
      arm fat area muscle arm circumference Bioimpedance analysis (BIA): whole-body impedance&#xD;
      vector components, resistance (R) and reactance (Xc), were measured with a single-frequency&#xD;
      50- KHz analyzer from AKERN Bioresearch Italy). Measurements were obtained following&#xD;
      standardized procedures . The external calibration of the instrument was checked with a&#xD;
      calibration circuit of known impedance value. Estimations of fat-free mass (FFM) and FM by&#xD;
      BIA were obtained using gender- specific, BIA prediction equations recently developed by Sun&#xD;
      et al in a large population that included extremes of BMI values. The fat mass index (FMI)&#xD;
      was calculated through the normalisation of FM, obtained by the BIA, for height: FMI = FM&#xD;
      (kg)/ height (m)2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were instructed to fast over 12 hours, and to refrain from any form of exercise for&#xD;
      48 hours, before blood collection. Female subjects were tested during the early follicular&#xD;
      phase of their menstrual cycles (days 3-10). Fasting venous blood samples were drawn between&#xD;
      08.00 and 10.00 a.m.. Blood collection and handling were carried out under strictly&#xD;
      standardized conditions and clinical chemistry parameters were detected with dedicated&#xD;
      commercial kits. In particular total cholesterol, triacylglycerol, HDL- and LDL- cholesterol,&#xD;
      free fatty acid (FFA), glycerol, glucose, insulin, C- reactive protein (CRP), plasma acylated&#xD;
      and unacetylated ghrelin, adiponectin and leptin serum levels were measured. Leptin/&#xD;
      adiponectin ratio (LAR) was calculated. Insulin resistance was evaluated using the&#xD;
      Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) and Quantitative Insulin sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI)&#xD;
      using the following formulas:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HOMA-Insulin Resistance = [(fasting insulin, mcU/ml) x (plasma glucose, mmol/l)]/22.5 QUICKI&#xD;
      = 1/ [log (glucose, mg/dl) + log (insulin, µU/ml)] Statistical analysis Data were described&#xD;
      as mean and standard deviation (SD) if continuous and as percentage if categorical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We considered FM from DXA as the outcome variable and all the anthropometric, bioimpedance&#xD;
      and laboratory data as potential explicative variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The predictive value of BMI and FM from BIA were compared to the FM from DXA (overall&#xD;
      predictive value, sensibility, specificity, positive and negative predictive values).&#xD;
      Therefore we considered the following cut-off values for the definition of obesity :&#xD;
&#xD;
      FM ≥ 25 % for men and ≥ 35 % for women (at DXA and BIA) BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 6 The variance&#xD;
      analysis and the Student t-test were used to assess the significance of differences in the&#xD;
      averages; the χ2 to compare the frequencies observed with those expected; the Pearson's to&#xD;
      evaluate the correlation existing between two continuous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables univariately proven correlated with the outcome variable were entered a pool of&#xD;
      potential contributors in multiple regression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We estimated models using a forward likelihood stepwise method (cut-off probability for&#xD;
      entry: 0.05). With each added variable the discriminant function was recalculated and any&#xD;
      variable that no longer met the significance level was removed from the equation (cut-off&#xD;
      probability for removal: 0.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some variables with similar biological significance were excluded from the logistic analysis,&#xD;
      in order to avoid the confounding effect of collinearity (verified with Pearson's r, t-test&#xD;
      or χ2). The best fitting model was chosen according to the value of the correlation&#xD;
      coefficients R2, (comparing the explained variance of the model's predictions with the total&#xD;
      variance of the data), the adjusted R2 (R2 adj), considering a correction for inclusion of&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We considered a significance level equal to a 5% probability of error. Data were analysed&#xD;
      using the SPSS for Windows 10.0 (SPSS Inc 1989-1999) and the Win Episcope 2.0 [Wageningen&#xD;
      University (N), University of Edinburgh (GB)] statistical software packages.&#xD;
