      The aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that a new device would produce a significant&#xD;
      decrease in obstructive breathing events during sleep as indexed by the Apnea Hyperpnoea&#xD;
      Index (AHI) or Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI) and measures of oxygen saturation during&#xD;
      sleep.&#xD;

      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) syndrome is a disorder characterized by repetitive episodes of&#xD;
      upper airway obstruction that occur during sleep. Associated features include loud snoring&#xD;
      and fragmented non-refreshing sleep and have profound impact on quality of life, on safety on&#xD;
      the roads and at work, and on the cardiovascular and metabolic systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that a new device would produce a significant&#xD;
      decrease in obstructive breathing events during sleep as indexed by the AHI/RDI and measures&#xD;
      of oxygen saturation during sleep.&#xD;
