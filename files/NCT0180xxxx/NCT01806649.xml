  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for more effective therapy for patients with esophageal squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma who developed disease progression after first line therapy. Currently, there is no&#xD;
      standard second-line therapy for this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BKM-120 is a pan-PI3K inhibitor currently tested in clinical trials. In a cellular model of&#xD;
      oral-esophageal carcinogenesis, it has shown that EGFR overexpression activated PI3/AKT&#xD;
      pathway. Therfore, there is interest to see the efficacy and safety of BKM120 in this&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
