      The aim of this study is to investigate the pathophysiological mechanism of omalizumab in&#xD;
      patients with documented chronic urticaria who have complaints under standard antihistamine&#xD;
      treatment. With this study the investigators will assess the correlation between Fc-IgE&#xD;
      receptor downregulation as well as functionality and clinical response to omalizumab&#xD;
      treatment in patients with chronic urticaria. This may be an approach for other diseases as&#xD;
      well, where Fc-IgE receptor crosslinking are essential. The treatment time is set for a total&#xD;
      of 4 monthly applications of omalizumab. According to the dosage recommendations of recent&#xD;
      studies, fixed doses of 300 mg omalizumab are administered subcutaneously.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic urticaria (CU) is a frequent disease with a lifetime incidence of up to 25-30% of the&#xD;
      population. Currently, CU treatment relies mainly on second generation antihistamines and is&#xD;
      purely symptomatic. The disease tends to have a cyclical nature with spontaneous&#xD;
      disappearance and frequent relapses. Some patients show a sufficient response to standard&#xD;
      second generation antihistamines like (levo)cetirizine 10mg, (des)loratadine 5mg or&#xD;
      terfenadine 120-180mg. Others need higher doses (up to 4-fold usual daily dose), often&#xD;
      accompanied by sedation. Treatment may last for months, even years. If this first-line&#xD;
      therapy is insufficient, the next step (sometimes even before use of excessively high doses&#xD;
      of antihistamines) is to add first generation, even more sedating antihistamines, some of&#xD;
      which have additional modes of action (e.g. anticholinergic effects in doxepin treatment). A&#xD;
      considerable number of patients with CU need treatment escalations with leukotriene receptor&#xD;
      blocking agents (e.g. montelukast), systemic corticosteroids (5-20mg prednisolon/d) or even&#xD;
      cyclosporine (daily dose 3-5 mg/kg) or other immunosuppressive drugs used off-label. Such&#xD;
      patients are often investigated more in detail to find an infection or autoimmune disease -&#xD;
      often still without clear results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different clinical findings suggest that the mast cell system in many patients with CU is&#xD;
      &quot;overactive&quot; with increased releasability. Minor stress like scratching can already induce&#xD;
      degranulation resulting in wheal-and-flare skin reactions. Therefore, a therapy directly&#xD;
      aiming at a decrease in this mast cell &quot;hyperreleasability&quot; would be optimal. Omalizumab&#xD;
      binds selectively to free IgE in plasma, inhibits its binding to Fc-IgE receptor on the&#xD;
      surface of mast cells and basophils and reduces the number of Fc-IgE receptors on basophils&#xD;
      in atopic patients. Significant reduction of Fc-IgE receptor density on the surface of&#xD;
      circulating basophils has been found as early as 1 week after administration of omalizumab.&#xD;
      In contrast to this, the onset of clinical efficacy of omalizumab in asthma is considered to&#xD;
      take place relatively late, namely about 4 months after start of treatment. The&#xD;
      pathophysiologic concepts of omalizumab treatment in allergic asthma are focused on the&#xD;
      neutralisation of IgE, and less on the Fc-IgE receptor density. In allergology, free IgE in&#xD;
      plasma is only relevant regarding Fc-IgE receptor density on effector cells. Therefore,&#xD;
      Fc-IgE receptor density measurement might be an important parameter for mast cell and&#xD;
      basophil &quot;releasability&quot; and therefore a good in vitro surrogate marker for their reactivity.&#xD;
      E.g. it is well known that only about 50% of IgE-sensitized individuals show clinically&#xD;
      relevant allergic symptoms. This difference between sensitization and allergy may also be due&#xD;
      to Fc-IgE receptor density on mast cells and basophils. Flowcytometric determination of&#xD;
      Fc-IgE receptor density on the surface of basophils and additional testing for the functional&#xD;
      consequences of a change in this density (ability to crosslink Fc-IgE receptors by&#xD;
      autoantibodies and allergens) raise the possibility to evaluate this hypothesis - using&#xD;
      omalizumab as a drug being able to decrease Fc-IgE receptor density:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study data show that a fixed dose of 300 mg omalizumab is useful for the treatment of&#xD;
           CU. The investigators assume that this effect is due to the decrease of Fc-IgE receptor&#xD;
           density. Thus, the basophil Fc-IgE receptor density should be monitored quantitatively&#xD;
           and functionally (see below) and correlated to clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 30-40% of patients with CU have autoantibodies against Fc-IgE receptor or IgE itself,&#xD;
           which can be measured in vitro (already via ELISA, flowcytometric via CD63 and CD203c&#xD;
           upregulation on basophils). Decrease of Fc-IgE receptor density may decrease basophil&#xD;
           reactivity and explain or be correlated to the clinical response in CU patients. At&#xD;
           least three patients will be followed for reactivity to autoantibodies over the study&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Some patients with CU may also have an accompanying IgE-mediated allergy, which is most&#xD;
           probably irrelevant for the CU, but offers the possibility of a functional test of&#xD;
           basophil responsiveness to low concentrations of allergens - before (with presumably&#xD;
           high Fc-IgE receptor density) and after omalizumab treatment (low Fc-IgE rec. density).&#xD;
           At least three patients will be followed for allergen reactivity of basophils.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a monocentric, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial, which aims to&#xD;
      investigate the pathophysiological mechanism of omalizumab in patients with documented&#xD;
      chronic urticaria who have complaints under standard antihistamine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the inclusion criteria, 30 patients with diagnosed chronic urticaria will be&#xD;
      recruited in our outpatient clinic. Omalizumab (XolairÂ®) is administered in fixed dose of 300&#xD;
      mg in a total of 4 monthly doses according to the reference. A follow-up visit is planned 2&#xD;
      months after the last injection.&#xD;
