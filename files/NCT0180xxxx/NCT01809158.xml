  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is understood to be a heterogeneous brain condition with overlapping symptom&#xD;
      dimensions. The negative symptom dimension, with its protean cognitive manifestations,&#xD;
      responds poorly to treatment, which can be a particular challenge in countries where&#xD;
      clozapine therapy is not available. Preliminary data indicates that minocycline may be&#xD;
      beneficial adjunct in the treatment of schizophrenia: positive, negative, and cognitive&#xD;
      symptoms. Persons with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and recent onset&#xD;
      schizophrenic episode or recent relapse who are prescribed minocycline in addition to&#xD;
      standard antipsychotic medication will show greater symptom reduction, as measured by the&#xD;
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score.&#xD;

      Minocycline has excellent penetration of the blood-brain barrier. In a mechanism that seems&#xD;
      to be distinct from its antimicrobial properties, minocycline has anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      neuroprotective properties. These properties are thought to be related to some combination of&#xD;
      its inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS); caspase 1 and 3; p-38&#xD;
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); cytochrome C release; cyclooxygenase-2 expression;&#xD;
      prostaglandin E2 formation; and microglial activation. Minocycline has also been reported to&#xD;
      have antiviral effects against HIV and antiprotozoal effects against Toxoplasma gondii.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its use in individuals with schizophrenia has been encouraged by its effects in rodent models&#xD;
      of this disorder. In one study, minocycline attenuated the behavioral changes following the&#xD;
      administration of an NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate)antagonist in mice. In another study,&#xD;
      minocycline reversed the effects of an NMDA antagonist in rats. Some preliminary data also&#xD;
      suggest that minocycline may be useful in patients with schizophrenia. Two case report series&#xD;
      have been published, one including two patients with schizophrenia and the other including&#xD;
      three patients with recent-onset acute paranoid schizophrenia. An open label study of 22&#xD;
      patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, using minocycline 150 mg/d for four weeks,&#xD;
      reported an improvement in both positive and negative symptoms. Two double blind trials have&#xD;
      been carried out. In one study, 73 patients with schizophrenia of less than five years'&#xD;
      duration were randomized to minocycline 200 mg or placebo for 12 months: &quot;all symptom&#xD;
      measures improved significantly&quot; especially in the negative symptoms. In the other study, 54&#xD;
      &quot;early phase&quot; (symptoms of less than five years) patients were randomized to minocycline 200&#xD;
      mg/d or placebo for six months; the authors reported a significant improvement in negative&#xD;
      symptoms measured using Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and Clinical&#xD;
      Global Impressions scale (CGI) and a significant improvement in some test of executive&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These initial findings encourage further replication. First, these studies are of&#xD;
      comparatively small size. Second, in countries like Ethiopia where options for the treatment&#xD;
      of schizophrenia are limited, identifying a safe alternative to clozapine is important.&#xD;
      Related to this, most patients have limited exposure to psychotropic medications. Third,&#xD;
      exposure to alcohol and substances is generally believed to be lower in the Ethiopian&#xD;
      setting. Finally, given our hypothesis that infectious agents as a cause of schizophrenia may&#xD;
      be more important in low and middle income countries (LAMICs) such as Ethiopia, minocycline&#xD;
      may prove more useful. In this regard, the trial will help to explore the etiology of&#xD;
      schizophrenia. The investigators have experience in following-up a large cohort of patients&#xD;
      with schizophrenia and in conducting randomized controlled trials of a similar nature, which&#xD;
      makes this proposed study feasible.&#xD;
