      College counseling centers (CCCs) are being faced with increasing demands for services to&#xD;
      meet the treatment needs of their students, in the context of increasingly severe cases and&#xD;
      declining resources. Innovative, cost effective solutions are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project seeks to meet these needs by testing a web-based guided self-help&#xD;
      version of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), an evidence-based transdiagnostic therapy&#xD;
      found to effectively treat a range of psychological problems. An ACT program would provide a&#xD;
      means of implementing effective treatment for the range of problems in the CCC setting, while&#xD;
      the guided self-help format would reduce counselors' workload, improving cost-effectiveness&#xD;
      and reducing waiting lists. This would both treat students and train counselors in how to&#xD;
      implement the ACT intervention. Three self-help lessons have been developed, as well as a&#xD;
      counselor portal to review students' use of the program and to receive training on&#xD;
      implementing ACT guided self-help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a pre-post, open(i.e., non-randomized) feasibility trial with 20 counselors and&#xD;
      60 clients from multiple CCCs throughout the country.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly half of all college students have a diagnosable mental health problem. College&#xD;
      counseling centers (CCCs) are faced with increasing demands for services from Universities,&#xD;
      students, and parents to meet the treatment needs of their students, in the context of&#xD;
      increasingly severe cases and declining resources. Innovative, cost effective solutions are&#xD;
      needed that can improve treatment effectiveness with a range of presenting problems while&#xD;
      reducing counselor workloads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current project seeks to meet these needs by recruiting participants at several CCCs&#xD;
      throughout the country to test a web-based guided self-help version of Acceptance and&#xD;
      Commitment Therapy, an evidence-based transdiagnostic therapy that has been found to&#xD;
      effectively treat a range of mental health problems by targeting experiential avoidance, the&#xD;
      tendency to avoid unwanted emotions and negative thoughts. An ACT program would provide a&#xD;
      means of implementing effective treatment for the range of problems encountered in the CCC&#xD;
      setting, while the online guided self-help format would reduce counselors' workload for each&#xD;
      client, improving cost effectiveness and reducing waiting lists. This product would both&#xD;
      treat students through a series of self-help modules and train CCC counselors in how to&#xD;
      implement the guided self-help ACT intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the current phase (Phase I) of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant,&#xD;
      three self-help modules (mindfulness, acceptance of difficult thoughts and feelings, and&#xD;
      values exploration) have been developed, as well as a counselor portal to review students'&#xD;
      use of the program and to receive training on implementing ACT guided self-help. The current&#xD;
      study is a pre-post feasibility trial with at least 20 counselors and 60 clients (3 student&#xD;
      clients per CCC counselor) from different CCCs throughout the country. The study is an open&#xD;
      trial in which all counselors and clients will use the program and complete assessments and&#xD;
      pre and post. The study will examine the initial feasibility, efficacy and acceptability of&#xD;
      the program with both students and counselors. These findings will inform the development of&#xD;
      a final commercial program to be marketed to CCCs.&#xD;
