  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with increased risk for mortality, atherosclerotic cerebrovascular&#xD;
      disease, coronary heart disease, colorectal cancer, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, gallbladder&#xD;
      disease, and diabetes mellitus, resulting in over 111,000 deaths annually in the United&#xD;
      States ). In the US, 65% of adults are overweight or obese. Unfortunately, the treatment of&#xD;
      choice for obesity (behavioral weight loss treatment) only results in a 10% reduction in body&#xD;
      weight on average and most patients regain this weight within a few years. Further, most&#xD;
      obesity prevention programs do not reduce risk for future weight gain. The limited success of&#xD;
      treatment and prevention interventions may be due to an incomplete understanding of the&#xD;
      processes that increase risk for obesity. Recent data suggest that obese adults show&#xD;
      abnormalities in reward from food intake and anticipated food intake relative to lean adults,&#xD;
      but the precise nature of these abnormalities is unclear and it has not been established&#xD;
      whether these abnormalities predate obesity onset or are a consequence. It is vital to&#xD;
      elucidate risk factors for obesity onset to advance understanding of etiological processes&#xD;
      and determine the content of prevention and treatment programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this study are to (1) determine whether adolescents at high-risk for obesity, by&#xD;
      virtue of having two obese parents, show abnormalities in reward from food intake&#xD;
      (consummatory food reward) and anticipated reward from food intake (anticipatory food reward)&#xD;
      compared to adolescents who are at low-risk for obesity, (2) determine whether abnormalities&#xD;
      in consummatory and anticipatory food reward increase risk for weight gain and obesity onset,&#xD;
      (3) examine moderators that may amplify the relations of consummatory and anticipatory food&#xD;
      reward to unhealthy weight gain, and (4) examine changes in consummatory and anticipatory&#xD;
      food reward in those participants who show obesity onset relative to those not showing&#xD;
      obesity onset. Each of these goals is described in more detail below.&#xD;

      All DNA samples will be stored at the Sequencing and Genomics lab of the University of&#xD;
      Colorado. Only authorized staff will have access to remove the DNA samples for analysis. The&#xD;
      DNA samples will be analyzed in this lab using standard DNA procedures. Data will be kept on&#xD;
      the password protected server for a period of six months. After six months, the data will be&#xD;
      destroyed. The DNA samples will be stored with a unique identification number, connected to a&#xD;
      code list accessed only by our research team. Once the analysis has been completed, the&#xD;
      saliva sample will be destroyed by soaking it in bleach. This will remove all DNA. In&#xD;
      addition, by the end of the study the code list connecting subject numbers with DNA numbers&#xD;
      will be destroyed. No individual samples, analyzed results, or any other individual data will&#xD;
      be shared with other researchers.&#xD;

        Participants will be 140 lean adolescents at risk for obesity (by virtue of having two&#xD;
        obese parents) and 40 lean adolescents with two lean parents. Participants will range in&#xD;
        age from 14-16 and be recruited from high schools.&#xD;
