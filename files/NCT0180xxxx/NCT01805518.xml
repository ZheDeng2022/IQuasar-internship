    <textblock>
      Phosphodiesterase is a candidate for the Rx &amp; prevention of cognitive and psychotic&#xD;
      disorders. Since caffeine targets primarily PDE4(Phosphodiesterase subtype 4), caffeine&#xD;
      analogs have been developed to mimic the actions of caffeine's ability to inhibit PDE-a,&#xD;
      PDE4, PDE5 and adenosine-2 (AD-2)but are limited by the side effects of insomnia and&#xD;
      heightened anxiety. Sildenafil (PDE-5 inhibitor) fails to enhance cognition in schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of PDE-4 in cognition in Alzheimer's dementia and schizophrenia has been done using&#xD;
      the PDE-4 prototypal compound, rolipram, which improves cognition in rodents. Rolipram&#xD;
      reverses the memory deficits induced by amyloid fragment Abeta25-35 and Abeta1-40 peptide. In&#xD;
      humans the frequent side effect of vomiting hampers translational research. The clinical&#xD;
      trial of rolipram in multiple sclerosis was terminated prematurely due to serious adverse&#xD;
      events with paradoxical increases in MRI MS-specific brain lesions. However, PDE-4 remains&#xD;
      paradigm for cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another strategy is chemical moieties capable of antagonizing the PDE-4 through allosteric&#xD;
      modulation, rather than direct competitive inhibition hoping to minimize adverse events while&#xD;
      retaining the biological potencies and functional responses of PDE-4 Modulators. Dietary&#xD;
      supplements with PDE-4 effects have advantages in that small investments are needed to&#xD;
      adequately study them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacologically active chemicals of Sceletium species are mesembrine-type alkaloids that&#xD;
      have proven PDE-4 activity. The PDE-4D knockout mice have enhanced memory function mediated&#xD;
      through hippocampal neurogenesis via phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein&#xD;
      (pCREB) signaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study purpose is to delineate the relationship of PDE-4 and cognition in normals. pCREB&#xD;
      is possibly the putative biomarker of PDE-4 response with CREB as effector signaling pathway&#xD;
      of PDE-4. CREB is close to nuclear receptors represented by BDNF (Brain Derived Neurotrophic&#xD;
      Factor) and PPAR (Peroxisome Proliferator Activating Receptor) complexes. CREB changes in&#xD;
      neuronal plasticity are targets for pharmacological paradigms for cognitive enhancement. This&#xD;
      study will use the scelectium tortuosum as manufactured as Zembrin®. The findings in control&#xD;
      subjects will form the basis for designing future studies of Zembrin® in neurodegenerative&#xD;
      disorders with marked cognitive impairment such as Alzheimer's Dementia and Parkinson's&#xD;
      Disease.&#xD;

      1. Contextual Background For the past decade, converging evidence suggests that targeting PD&#xD;
      Phosphodiesterase for cognition represents novel heuristic approaches for development of&#xD;
      dietary supplements and drug candidates for the treatment and prevention of cognitive and&#xD;
      psychotic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. . The earlier findings on caffeine as the prototypal PD inhibitor targeting primarily&#xD;
           PDE4 (Phosphodiesterase subtype 4) has stimulated synthesis of caffeine analogs to&#xD;
           improve upon the pharmacokinetic profile and benefits/risk ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. . The dual actions of caffeine as inhibitor of PDE-a, PDE4 and PDE5 and adenosine-2&#xD;
           (AD-2) antagonist, exerts multiple brain-behavior functions including sleep, cognition,&#xD;
           memory and learning. It remains to be seen whether caffeine analogues live up the&#xD;
           therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative diseases while bypassing the side effects of&#xD;
           insomnia and heightened anxiety. Sildenafil (Viagra R) PDE-5 inhibitor indicated for&#xD;
           erectile dysfunction (ED) fails to enhance cognition in schizophrenia&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. . The full dosage range may not have been explored in the study with sildenafil. It is&#xD;
           noteworthy that PDE-5 inhibition is related to NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartic acid)&#xD;
           glutamatergic modulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In conducting a Pub Med search of recent studies point to the role of PDE-4 in diverse&#xD;
           domains of cognition: memory, attention, executive function, recall, visual-spatial&#xD;
           tasks. We find converging evidence targeting PDE-4 as the novel approach towards&#xD;
           treating the cognitive deficits in Alzheimer dementia and schizophrenia&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. . Most of the preclinical studies focus exclusively on the PDE-4 prototypal compound,&#xD;
           rolipram. Rolipram improves memory consolidation, working memory and information&#xD;
           processing in rodent species subjected to a variety of cognitive tasks: radial arm maze,&#xD;
           passive avoidance, delayed arm water maze&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. . A very recent study found that rolipram, reverses deficits induced by amyloid fragment&#xD;
           Abeta25-35 and Abeta1-40 peptide in the Morris water maze and passive avoidance task&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. . In preclinical screening of PDE-4 inhibitors, vomiting mediated via activating the&#xD;
           area postema has been consistently noted. Tolerability and safety has hampered&#xD;
           significantly the translation research in PDE-4 inhibitors. The clinical trial of&#xD;
           rolipram in multiple sclerosis was terminated prematurely due to serious adverse events&#xD;
           with paradoxical increases in MS-specific brain lesions identified by MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. . Notwithstanding the challenges in translational research, the molecular template of&#xD;
           PDE-4 remains a highly viable paradigm for cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Drug Design has adopted another strategy in developing chemical moieties capable of&#xD;
           antagonizing the PDE-4 pharmacological effects. Through allosteric modulation, rather&#xD;
           than direct competitive inhibition at the catalytic site domain of PDE-4, the hope is to&#xD;
           minimize the adverse events while retaining the biological potencies and functional&#xD;
           responses relevant to the pharmacological activities of PDE-4 compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. . The emergence of PDE-4 Modulators (PDE-4M) has attracted attention. Dietary&#xD;
           supplements possessing the molecular templates and requirements in PDE-4 design strategy&#xD;
           have added advantages in that preliminary clinical studies can be undertaken with a&#xD;
           disproportionately small investment. If the preliminary results are favorable, strategic&#xD;
           advances to GMP patented drug candidates are more predictable and confer less fiscal and&#xD;
           clinical risks without compromising the efficacy stipulation in satisfying FDA criteria&#xD;
           for phase II and Phase III trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Our study the Zembrin® formulation of Scelectium Toruosum in cognition expands on an&#xD;
           earlier study protocol which investigated the effects of Zembrin® in Generalized Anxiety&#xD;
           Disorder (GAD). The pharmacologically active chemicals from the Sceletium species belong&#xD;
           to mesembrine-type alkaloids; the structures are well characterized. Structure-activity&#xD;
           relationship of the mesembrine-derivative alkaloids has been delineated in in-vitro&#xD;
           assay of recombinant PDE-4 regarding the relative potencies in producing the functional&#xD;
           responses. The IC50 of mesembrine-HCL is determined to be 20 microM&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. . The PDE-4D knockout mice model provides evidence of enhanced memory function is&#xD;
           mediated through hippocampal neurogenesis via phosphorylated cAMP response element&#xD;
           binding protein (pCREB) signaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. . Microinfusion of lentiviral vectors carrying micro RNAs targeting the long-form of&#xD;
           PDE4D isoforms directly into bilateral dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in the mice&#xD;
           resulted in improved performance scores in object recognition test, water maze and&#xD;
           radial arm maze.&#xD;
&#xD;
           These considerations lead us to organize a pilot &quot;proof-of-concept study&quot; to delineate&#xD;
           the relationship of PDE-4 and cognition in normal control subjects to validate the&#xD;
           target of PDE-4 in modulating cognition functions in normal control subjects. It is&#xD;
           noteworthy that none of the preliminary studies include measure of cAMP signaling in&#xD;
           clinical subjects to correlate with brain-behavior interactions. With the availability&#xD;
           of sensitive, reliable and valid ELISA method of assaying for pCREB, we consider it&#xD;
           important to examine pCREB as the putative biomarker of PDE-4 response in clinical&#xD;
           subjects treated with Zembrin®. There is emerging an increase of evidence in support of&#xD;
           the construct that CREB as the effector signaling pathway of PDE-4, is the target of&#xD;
           diverse classes of antidepressants&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. . CREB is the late molecular partner to the family of nuclear receptors represented by&#xD;
           BDNF (Brain derived neurotrophic factor) and PPAR (Peroxisome Proliferator Activating&#xD;
           Receptor) complex&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. . CREB reflects changes in neuronal plasticity and is sensitive to pharmacological&#xD;
           paradigms for cognitive enhancement. CREB signaling integrates signal transduction from&#xD;
           related neurotransmitters and neuromodulators besides PDE-4. Neuronal alpha-7 nicotinic&#xD;
           receptor agonist A-582941 exerts its cognitive effects through interacting with&#xD;
           phosphorylation of CREB pathway (13). The findings in control subjects will form the&#xD;
           rational basis for designing controlled studies of Zembrin® in neurodegenerative&#xD;
           disorders with marked cognitive impairment such as Alzheimer's Dementia and Parkinson's&#xD;
           Disease.&#xD;
