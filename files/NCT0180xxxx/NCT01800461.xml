      Participation in valued activities following stroke is a recognized problem. Efficient and&#xD;
      effective interventions to address this problem have not yet been established although the&#xD;
      literature provides direction as to the needs of stroke survivors and important parts of&#xD;
      interventions to address these needs. Occupational Performance Coaching (OPC) is an emerging&#xD;
      approach to enabling occupational performance or participation in valued activities that&#xD;
      includes these important parts of interventions. The primary goal of OPC is ability and&#xD;
      satisfaction with participation in chosen activities, while promoting a client's ability to&#xD;
      address future problems with participation. OPC has been successfully used with parents and&#xD;
      their children in addressing problems with participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPC has not been explored among adults who have experienced a stroke. For this study&#xD;
      OPC-Stroke (OPC adapted for stroke survivors) will be tested to explore its potential&#xD;
      effectiveness for increasing participation as well as how feasible and acceptable the&#xD;
      research methods are. Sixteen participants who receive OPC-Stroke will be compared with&#xD;
      sixteen who do not using measures of participation, goal achievement, well-being,&#xD;
      self-efficacy and cognition. Those who receive OPC-Stroke will also be interviewed about&#xD;
      their experience of the treatment.&#xD;

      Introduction Approximately 300,000 Canadians live with the effects of stroke. Following&#xD;
      hospital discharge, stroke survivors attempt to return to participation in valued activities&#xD;
      but this can be quite challenging. In fact, the majority of stroke survivors, across all&#xD;
      disability levels, report problems occupying their time in meaningful ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current interventions to enhance participation in valued activities have been limited and&#xD;
      studies of these have had mixed results. This may be due to lack on consideration of&#xD;
      important factors. As well, it is possible that success has been limited because there is not&#xD;
      yet an efficient way to provide the kind of long term, individualized support that is&#xD;
      required for successful return to valued activities. Effective and efficient interventions&#xD;
      must be designed to build competence and provide stroke survivors with the skills and the&#xD;
      tools they need to allow them to plan and manage their own return to personally valued&#xD;
      activities over several months of recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occupational Performance Coaching (OPC) is a new approach in occupational therapy whereby&#xD;
      individuals are guided to solve problems critical to the achievement of self-identified goals&#xD;
      related to participation. OPC draws on concepts from personal coaching, solution-focused&#xD;
      therapy, problem solving interventions and emotional support. A positive, strengths-based&#xD;
      approach is used to promote patient self-efficacy and self-management. This individualized&#xD;
      approach provides a time-limited intervention to address current participation goals, while&#xD;
      allowing individuals to develop the skills to address future participation goals. OPC has&#xD;
      been tested with families of children who face challenges participating in age appropriate&#xD;
      activities but has not been tested with adults who have experienced stroke. Following review&#xD;
      of the literature, an adaptation of OPC for stroke survivors (OPC-Stroke) was developed that&#xD;
      emphasizes individualized education and metacognitive strategies during both goal setting and&#xD;
      problem solving, and broadens how support is considered beyond the family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research is to explore the effectiveness of OPC-Stroke with adults who&#xD;
      have experienced stroke and to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the research&#xD;
      methods in preparation for a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT). This objective will be&#xD;
      attained through answering the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do stroke survivors receiving OPC-Stroke following discharge to the community report&#xD;
           increased participation compared with those receiving standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do stroke survivors receiving OPC-Stroke following discharge to the community report&#xD;
           increased performance and satisfaction with individually identified participation goals,&#xD;
           emotional wellbeing, goal self-efficacy, cognition and mobility compared with those&#xD;
           receiving standard care?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What is the experience of research participants receiving OPC-Stroke?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Which components and processes of OPC-Stroke promote achievement of self-identified&#xD;
           participation goals?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Are the research procedures feasible to implement and are they acceptable to&#xD;
           participants and therefore appropriate for testing OPC-Stroke in a larger trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design This study will use a concurrent mixed method design of a pilot RCT with an embedded&#xD;
      qualitative study. The qualitative component of this study will be a descriptive qualitative&#xD;
      study with the goal of exploring the experience of participants who receive OPC-Stroke and&#xD;
      providing insight into the components and processes of OPC-Stroke that promote goal&#xD;
      achievement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population Thirty-two stroke survivors being discharged home from the acute stroke unit&#xD;
      at The Ottawa Hospital or the Bruyère in-patient stroke rehabilitation unit will be recruited&#xD;
      to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited at the time of discharge from hospital. The occupational&#xD;
      therapists at the hospitals will screen potential participants and refer potentially&#xD;
      interested patients to the Research Assistant who will seek informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Following consent to participate in the research study and completion of the&#xD;
      initial outcome measures, participants will be allocated to the treatment or control group&#xD;
      using block randomization (block size of 4). The randomization and allocation process will be&#xD;
      completed by the statistician on contract with Bruyère Research Institute to ensure that&#xD;
      randomization is adequate and group allocation cannot be tampered with.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OPC-Stroke intervention consists of 10 face to face visits with an occupational therapist&#xD;
      trained in OPC over a 16 week period. Visits will last approximately one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the one of the secondary outcomes is changes in performance and satisfaction with&#xD;
      individually-identified participation goals, all participants will receive the first visit&#xD;
      prior to randomization. During this visit the coach will use the Personal Project Analysis&#xD;
      tool combined with the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) to facilitate&#xD;
      discussion of and reflection on current participation in activities/projects. Three personal&#xD;
      projects will be identified by each participant as intervention goals, and OPC-Stroke&#xD;
      sessions will be focused on these projects. Finally, during this first session each&#xD;
      participants will score their current performance and satisfaction in these projects using&#xD;
      the COPM; as well as goal self-efficacy for each goal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention participants will proceed directly to receive the OPC-Stroke intervention. As&#xD;
      noted in the introduction, OPC-Stroke is a process of goal-focussed problem solving and&#xD;
      collaborative performance analysis examining the interaction between the person, the&#xD;
      environment and the task demands of the project/goal. Throughout the process, the coach will&#xD;
      provide emotional support and promote exchange of information. During the final intervention&#xD;
      visit, goal progress and the problem solving process will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group The purpose of the control group in this study is to enhance internal validity&#xD;
      including controlling for change that may occur with the passage of time. This is&#xD;
      particularly relevant following stroke as the course of natural recovery and adjustment may&#xD;
      lead to changes in participation. Therefore a usual care option for the control group was&#xD;
      selected. Usual care is may consist of limited outpatient therapy (excluding occupational&#xD;
      therapy) and/or personal support services for activities of daily living.&#xD;
