  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that frailty assessment prior to concurrent chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiation therapy in the elderly will predict treatment-related toxicity and morbidity and&#xD;
      that such assessment at serial time points will help improve treatment and outcomes for these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have one of the following histologically or cytologically confirmed&#xD;
             cancers: lung cancer, head and neck cancer, gastric cancer, anal cancer, rectal&#xD;
             cancer, cervix cancer, or bladder cancer, and must have appropriate indications for&#xD;
             the use of standard concurrent chemotherapy plus radiation therapy as defined in the&#xD;
             NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) Guidelines for each of these specific&#xD;
             organ-sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;70 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG (Easter Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of 0, 1 or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy Tables showing upper, middle, and lower quartiles of life expectancy&#xD;
             for women and men age 70 and older should be used and life expectancy should be&#xD;
             estimated to be of sufficient to justify the use of concurrent chemotherapy plus&#xD;
             radiation for each organ site and indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering&#xD;
             the study or those who have not recovered to baseline from adverse events due to&#xD;
             agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known distant site metastases (M1 disease) or brain metastases should be&#xD;
             excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they&#xD;
             often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of&#xD;
             neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have a history of one or more other concurrent cancers besides the cancer&#xD;
             for which concurrent chemotherapy plus radiation therapy is considered are ineligible&#xD;
             only if the other cancer or cancers are being considered for treatment or are actively&#xD;
             being treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients carrying a pre-existing diagnosis of HIV/AIDS and are on combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
             interactions with chemotherapy. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of&#xD;
             lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies&#xD;
             will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when&#xD;
             indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any standard contraindication to chemotherapy or radiation therapy are&#xD;
             ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Transplant recipient patients on immune-suppressant agents are ineligible due to&#xD;
             increased risk of infection.&#xD;
