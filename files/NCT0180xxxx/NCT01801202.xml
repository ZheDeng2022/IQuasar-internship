      -  The study will re-confirm that the LightSheer Duet HS 805 nm handpiece is safe for&#xD;
           removal of unwanted hair, and will result in hair removal and permanent hair count&#xD;
           reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Twenty (20)subjects, Fitzpatrick Skin Type I-IV will be included in a single site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each subject will receive five treatments at four to six week intervals and return for&#xD;
           follow-up visits at three and six months after the last treatment for evaluation of the&#xD;
           treated areas.&#xD;
