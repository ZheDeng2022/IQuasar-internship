    <textblock>
      Magnetization transfer imaging is a magnetic resonance technique that has been used over the&#xD;
      last few years, and known for its ability to detect abnormalities that can be difficult to&#xD;
      detect by conventional MRI techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to test if using an 7 Tesla MRI research scanner can help us&#xD;
      diagnose Multiple Sclerosis more efficiently compared to the current clinical practice, i.e.&#xD;
      if Multiple Sclerosis lesions in Gray Matter can be more readily identified and associated&#xD;
      with disease stage on Magnetic Transfer MRI images as opposed to conventional procedures.&#xD;
      Image analysis will allow the investigators to perform lesion segmentation and sequence&#xD;
      comparison between different MRI techniques. The investigators will apply computation&#xD;
      techniques to measure the local cortical thickness. Repeated scans at 6 monthly intervals&#xD;
      over two years will give an insight into the changes in cortical thickness over time. Based&#xD;
      on obtained data the investigators will look for the relationship between lesion loads in&#xD;
      White Matter and Gray Matter, cortical thickness and disease stage.&#xD;

      Purpose for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research group has previously investigated the usefulness of a powerful new MRI scanner&#xD;
      and have found that the 7 Tesla MRI is able to provide detailed structural images of the&#xD;
      cortex of the brain which can uncover pathology such as cortical demyelinating lesions in MS&#xD;
      patients. Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects the grey matter as well as the white matter of the&#xD;
      brain and spinal cord. However as white matter lesions are more easily visible both&#xD;
      pathologically and on MRI, therefore most MS research has focused on white matter&#xD;
      demyelination. The investigators would like to assess whether MS lesions in Gray Matter as&#xD;
      well as White Matter can be more readily identified on Magnetic Transfer Ratio (MTR) images&#xD;
      as opposed to standard protocols such as DIR, T2* and T1-weighted MPRAGE by comparing the&#xD;
      results of the manual detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will correlate lesion loads against cortical thickness and both lesion&#xD;
      loads and cortical thickness against disease state both globally and on a regional basis. The&#xD;
      investigators will then compare averaged, normalized profiles from different cortical ribbon&#xD;
      regions between patients and controls to determine whether a particular layer of the cortical&#xD;
      strip is more affected. The investigators will also correlate Gray Matter changes with&#xD;
      distant and neighboring White Matter lesions. In addition, the investigators will also build&#xD;
      an average lesion map across all subjects, which can be compared against the results&#xD;
      published in literature. The investigators will use the manual lesion maps to characterize&#xD;
      the regions of the cortex that deviate from normally appearing Gray Matter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How this project will be carried out:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will study patients with MS and other neurological disease, and patients&#xD;
      who are followed already at the neurology. All patients would have had already a brain scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For comparison purposes the investigators will study healthy volunteers, in order to&#xD;
      demonstrate that any new findings demonstrable with the 7T MRI scan are indeed related to&#xD;
      pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical issues:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occasionally the investigators discover incidental abnormalities on brain scans of those who&#xD;
      participate in the study. In such circumstances the investigators will adhere to University&#xD;
      of Nottingham Incidental Findings Procedure. In the Participant Information Sheet the&#xD;
      investigators will explain that if the investigators notice any abnormality on MR scans (for&#xD;
      healthy volunteer) or abnormality on MR scan not expected to be seen under patient's&#xD;
      neurological diagnosis (for patients) the investigators will refer them to their GP. The&#xD;
      investigators will send a letter to patient's GP informing that the investigators have&#xD;
      detected a possible abnormality on the scan. The investigators will show the scans to a&#xD;
      radiologist based in Academic Radiology at the QMC, who will contact participant's GP if&#xD;
      further action is required.&#xD;
