  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The endoscopic management of patients on anti platelet agents (APA) is a wide problem, with&#xD;
      prevalence of patients on this type of therapy steadily increasing. The benefit / risk&#xD;
      balance to stop or continue the APA for the digestive endoscopic procedure confronts us every&#xD;
      day in clinical practice to another: the relationship thrombosis / hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecules most commonly used today are aspirin and clopidogrel. Current recommendations from&#xD;
      the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) allow the maintenance of aspirin&#xD;
      for the polypectomy. Some preliminary data show that the risk of bleeding during endoscopic&#xD;
      mucosal resection (EMR) with aspirin is not significantly higher than polypectomy. The&#xD;
      concept of polypectomy / EMR without stopping aspirin is progressively accepted and returned&#xD;
      gradually to the usual practice. However, these procedures are still not allowed under&#xD;
      clopidogrel, or in a dual APA therapy, in the absence of relevant data on the subject in the&#xD;
      literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is necessary to achieve a large national multicenter study, to clarify the risk of post&#xD;
      recto colonic EMR and polypectomy bleeding in patients under clopidogrel alone or in&#xD;
      combination (aspirin and clopidogrel) taking into account the endoscopic preventive measures&#xD;
      used in daily practice by endoscopists in expert centers (clip, ligature and loop devices,&#xD;
      preventive adrenalin injection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the &quot;MEDOC&quot; study is to determine the incidence of immediate and delayed bleeding&#xD;
      after colonic polypectomy and / or EMR for patients on clopidogrel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected in this work an incidence of post-polypectomy bleeding close to that observed&#xD;
      during the implementation of these actions in the population without any anti platelet&#xD;
      agents.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The endoscopic management of patients on anti platelet agents (APA) is a wide problem, due to&#xD;
      the dramatically increasing prevalence of patients on these therapies. The benefit / risk&#xD;
      balance to stop or continue the APA for the digestive endoscopic procedure confronts us every&#xD;
      day in clinical practice to another: the relationship thrombosis / hemorrhage. The&#xD;
      maintenance of an APA is particularly essential for acute coronary episode, but in the long&#xD;
      term, in prevention of recurrent thrombotic cardiovascular disease. Molecules most commonly&#xD;
      used today are aspirin and clopidogrel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current recommendations from the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) allow&#xD;
      the maintenance of aspirin for the polypectomy. Some preliminary data show that the risk of&#xD;
      bleeding during endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) with aspirin is not significantly higher&#xD;
      than polypectomy. The concept of polypectomy / EMR without stopping aspirin is progressively&#xD;
      accepted and returned gradually to the usual practice. However, these procedures are still&#xD;
      not allowed under clopidogrel, or in a dual APA therapy, in the absence of relevant data on&#xD;
      the subject in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However recent studies disrupt this problem for different reasons: i) endoscopic haemostatic&#xD;
      preventive measures have demonstrated efficacy in reducing the rate of immediate and delayed&#xD;
      bleeding post polypectomy or EMR; ii) the inadequate modification or untimely stopping APA&#xD;
      treatment is always complicated by severe vascular thrombosis events in 5% of patients; iii)&#xD;
      three retrospective studies relativize the risk of bleeding after a colonic polypectomy under&#xD;
      clopidogrel. It is therefore essential to carry out a prospective, large-scale, multicenter,&#xD;
      study to clarify the risk of post colonic EMR/polypectomy bleeding in patients under&#xD;
      clopidogrel alone or in combination (aspirin and clopidogrel) taking into account the&#xD;
      endoscopic preventive measures used in daily practice by endoscopists in expert centers&#xD;
      (clip, ligature and loop devices, preventive adrenalin injection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the &quot;MEDOC&quot; study is to determine the incidence of immediate and delayed bleeding&#xD;
      after colonic polypectomy and / or EMR for patients on clopidogrel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study presents an interventional prospective multicentric and national design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      300 patients will be included. The duration of the study inclusions will be 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected in this work an incidence of post-polypectomy bleeding close to that observed&#xD;
      during the implementation of these actions in the population without any anti platelet&#xD;
      agents.&#xD;
