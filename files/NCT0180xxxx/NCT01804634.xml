  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if giving reduced intensity chemotherapy, haploidentical&#xD;
      bone marrow, post-transplant cyclophosphamide and shortened duration tacrolimus is safe and&#xD;
      feasible for patients with very high-risk solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) may be associated with a clinically&#xD;
      significant &quot;graft-versus-tumor&quot; (GVT) effect, even against disease that is unresponsive to&#xD;
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Graft-vs.-tumor (GVT) effects have been described after&#xD;
      allogeneic HCT for neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, melanoma and&#xD;
      hepatoblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' goal is to maximize a T cell and NK cell mediated graft versus tumor&#xD;
      effect in poor prognosis solid tumor patients using haploidentical donors, T cell replete&#xD;
      bone marrow, and a unique post-transplant immunosuppression regimen containing post&#xD;
      transplantation Cy and shortened duration tacrolimus. This therapy will be widely applicable&#xD;
      because almost all patients have a half-matched donor available (parent or sibling). The&#xD;
      investigators hope to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of this therapy in anticipation&#xD;
      of combining this platform with additional post-transplantation relapse/progression&#xD;
      prevention therapy such as an immune checkpoint inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT PLAN Indwelling central venous catheter Placement of a double lumen central venous&#xD;
      catheter will be required for administration of IV medications and transfusion of blood&#xD;
      products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-treatment Evaluation All patients will require documentation of a detailed history and&#xD;
      physical examination and standard evaluation of cardiac, pulmonary, liver and renal function.&#xD;
      All patients will undergo disease evaluation as specified in Table 1, utilizing whichever&#xD;
      modalities following the guidelines in 6.1.3 (i). Pre-BMT blood will be drawn per section&#xD;
      section 5.12 for correlative labs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparative regimen Fludarabine: administered as an IV infusion over 30 minutes on D-7 to&#xD;
      D-3. The dose will be 30 mg/m2/dose (adjusted for renal function).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melphalan: Recommended to be administered as an IV infusion over 30-60 minutes, depending on&#xD;
      volume, on D-2. The dose will be 100mg/m2. Other institutional infusion standards are&#xD;
      acceptable and will not be a protocol deviation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total body irradiation: 200 cGy AP/PA with 4MV or 6MV photons at 8 12 cGy/min at the point of&#xD;
      prescription (average separation of measurements at mediastinum, abdomen, and hips) will be&#xD;
      administered in a single fraction on day -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day of rest: A day of rest, i.e. after preparative regimen completion and prior to bone&#xD;
      marrow infusion, is not routinely scheduled. Up to one day of rest in-between TBI and the&#xD;
      infusion of bone marrow may be added in this window based on logistical considerations or&#xD;
      clinically as indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone Marrow will be harvested and infused on day 0. Institutional guidelines for the infusion&#xD;
      of bone marrow (i.e. major or minor ABO incompatible bone marrow, etc.) will be followed. The&#xD;
      marrow infusion will be done by designated members of the BMT team. The bone marrow graft&#xD;
      will not be manipulated to deplete T cells. The donor will be harvested with a target yield&#xD;
      of 4 x 108 nucleated cells/kg recipient IBW. The lowest acceptable yield is 1.5 x 108&#xD;
      nucleated cells/kg. The CD 34+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD3+ cell count in the marrow will be&#xD;
      quantified by flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-transplantation Cyclophosphamide&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide 50mg/kg will be given on D+3 post-transplant (within 60-72 hr of marrow&#xD;
      infusion) and on D+4 post-transplant. Cyclophosphamide will be given as an IV infusion over&#xD;
      1- 2 hours (depending on volume). Dosing of cyclophosphamide is based on ideal body weight&#xD;
      for subjects whose ideal body weights less than or equal to their actual body weight. On&#xD;
      occasion, a subject's actual body weight may be less than his/her ideal body weight, in which&#xD;
      case cyclophosphamide will be dosed using the subject's actual body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be instructed to increase fluids overnight before cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      administration. Hydration with normal saline at 3 cc/kg/hr iv will be started 8 hr prior to&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, then the rate will be reduced to 2 cc/kg/hr for 1 hr pre-cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      and continued for at least 8 hr post-cyclophosphamide or administered per institutional&#xD;
      standards. Mesna will be given in divided doses IV 30 min pre- and at 3, 6, and 8 hours&#xD;
      post-cyclophosphamide or administered per institutional standards. Mesna dose will be based&#xD;
      on the cyclophosphamide dose being given. The total daily dose of mesna is equal to 80% of&#xD;
      the total daily dose of cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be instructed to increase fluids overnight before cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      administration. Hydration will be administered per institutional standards. Protocol&#xD;
      recommendation of normal saline at 3 cc/kg/hr iv will be started 8 hr prior to&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, then the rate will be reduced to 2 cc/kg/hr for 1 hr pre-cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      and continued for at least 8 hr post-cyclophosphamide. Mesna will be administered per&#xD;
      institutional standards. Mesna dose will be based on the cyclophosphamide dose being given.&#xD;
      The total daily dose of mesna is equal to 80% of the total daily dose of cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is crucial that no immunosuppressive agents are given until 24 hours after the completion&#xD;
      of the post-transplant Cy. This includes steroids as anti-emetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GVHD prophylaxis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tacrolimus On day +5, patients will begin prophylaxis with Tacrolimus (PO or IV as per&#xD;
      institutional standards for starting this prophylaxis).Tacrolimus begins on Day 5, at least&#xD;
      24 hours after completion of posttransplantation Cy. The tacrolimus starting dose will be&#xD;
      given per institutional standards for adult or pediatric patients. The recommended, but not&#xD;
      required, The starting dose of tacrolimus is 0.015mg/kg IBW/dose IV over 4 hours every 12&#xD;
      hours. , or per institutional standard. Serum trough levels of tacrolimus should be measured&#xD;
      around D+7 and the dose should be adjusted based on this level to maintain a level of 5-15&#xD;
      ng/ml. Tacrolimus should be converted to oral dosing when patient has a stable, therapeutic&#xD;
      level and is able to tolerate food or other oral medications. For pediatric patients, the&#xD;
      oral dosing is approximately two to four times the IV dosing. It is recommended that serum&#xD;
      trough levels should be checked at steady state after any dose modification and when&#xD;
      switching from IV to oral to ensure therapeutic trough concentrations. Serum trough&#xD;
      concentrations should be checked at a minimum weekly thereafter and the dose adjusted&#xD;
      accordingly to maintain a level of 5-15 ng/ml. Tacrolimus will be discontinued after the last&#xD;
      dose on Day 90, or may be continued if active GVHD is present. This should be discussed with&#xD;
      the PI. Tacrolimus may also be discontinued early if patients have progressive disease or&#xD;
      relapse. If tacrolimus is stopped earlier or later than day 90 +/- 7 days , this should be&#xD;
      discussed with the PI This should also be discussed with the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mycophenolic acid mofetil (MMF) MMF will be given at a dose of 15 mg/kg PO TID (based upon&#xD;
      actual body weight) with the maximum total daily dose not to exceed 3 grams (1 g PO TID). MMF&#xD;
      prophylaxis will be discontinued after the last dose on D35.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection prophylaxis and therapy All infection prophylaxis and therapy will be administered&#xD;
      and discontinued as per institutional requirements. The following are recommendations only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) During pre-transplant evaluation patients will be screened for respiratory syncytial&#xD;
      virus, influenza A, B and parainfluenza viruses if symptomatic. Assays of these viruses must&#xD;
      be negative for symptomatic patients to be admitted for transplant. Strong consideration&#xD;
      should be given to institution of ribavirin therapy if positive for adenovirus or nalidixic&#xD;
      acid if positive for BK virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) Oral hygiene will be maintained according to institutional standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) Prophylactic anti-microbial therapy will be started during the preparative regimen, per&#xD;
      institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv) Empiric therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics will be instituted for the first&#xD;
      neutropenic fever (specific agents as per current practice).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Growth factor support&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive G-CSF (Filgrastim®) 5µg/kg/d SC or IV starting at Day 5 and continuing&#xD;
      until the ANC&gt;1000/mm3 x 3days or two consecutive measurements over a three day period. For&#xD;
      use in the case of fungal infections or subsequent neutropenia (ANC&lt;500/mm3), G-CSF should be&#xD;
      continued until the WBC&gt;10,000-15,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transfusion support Platelet and packed red cell transfusions will be given per current&#xD;
      institutional recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-ovulatory treatment Menstruating females will are recommended to should be be started on&#xD;
      an anti-ovulatory agent, such as Lupron prior to the initiation of the preparative regimen.&#xD;
      The treatment administered will be at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-BMT evaluation Patients will be followed during (i) the initial post-BMT period (ii)&#xD;
      after discharge to the referring physician as per standard practice.&#xD;

        Patients (Parents/guardians for those &lt;18) and donors must be able to sign consent forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be willing to participate in all stages of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        Criteria for recipient ineligibility Patients will not be excluded on the basis of sex,&#xD;
        racial or ethnic background.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIV-positive&#xD;
&#xD;
        Donor (donor anti-recipient) ABO incompatibility if an ABO compatible donor is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Positive leukocytotoxic crossmatch&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women of childbearing potential who currently are pregnant (HCG+) or who are not practicing&#xD;
        adequate contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
        Uncontrolled viral, bacterial, or fungal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Criteria for donor eligibility Age &gt;0.5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        Donors must meet the selection criteria as defined by the Foundation for the Accreditation&#xD;
        of Hematopoietic Cell Therapy (FACT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Lack of recipient anti-donor HLA antibody Note: In some instances, low level, non-cytotoxic&#xD;
        HLA specific antibodies may be permissible if they are found to be at a level well below&#xD;
        that detectable by flow cytometry. This will be decided on a case-by-case basis by the PI&#xD;
        and one of the immunogenetics directors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In the event that two or more eligible donors are identified, the following order of&#xD;
        priority will be used to determine the preferred donor:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Medically and psychologically fit and willing to donate&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Killer Immunoglobulin Receptor (KIR) Haplotype B Donor&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Red blood-cell compatibility (in order of preference)&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. RBC cross-match compatible&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Minor ABO incompatibility&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Major ABO incompatibility&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. For CMV seronegative recipients, a CMV seronegative donor. For CMV seropositive&#xD;
             recipients, a CMV seropositive donor is preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. When possible, HLA-mismatched donors will be prioritized over HLA-matched to maximize&#xD;
             an allogeneic benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If more than one preferred donor is identified from the above list and there is no medical&#xD;
        reason to prefer one of them, then the following guidelines are recommended:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. If the patient is male, choose a male donor&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Choose the youngest preferred donor&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. If the patient and family express a strong preference for a particular donor, use that&#xD;
             one.&#xD;
