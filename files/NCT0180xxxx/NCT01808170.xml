  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy versus&#xD;
      laparoscopic cyst deroofing on ovarian reserve measured by serum levels of anti mullerian&#xD;
      hormone and antral follicle count in patients with endometriomas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the major concerns about excision of endometriomas is their negative effect on ovarian&#xD;
      reserve because of follicle loss, removal of endometriomas has been associated with poorer&#xD;
      performance in IVF procedures, and decreased ovarian volumes have also been reported after&#xD;
      surgery.Ovarian reserve is defined as the functional potential of the ovary which reflects&#xD;
      the number and quality of the follicles left in the ovary, and is well-correlated with the&#xD;
      response to ovarian stimulation using exogenous gonadotrophin. Over the years, various tests&#xD;
      and markers of ovarian reserve have been reported; the static tests include serum markers,&#xD;
      such as basal FSH, inhibin-B and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), and ultrasonographic markers,&#xD;
      such as ovarian volume and antral follicle count.This study will include 122 patients aged&#xD;
      between 18 and 35 years who have been diagnosed with endometrioma (unilateral or bilateral)&#xD;
      and they are candidates for laparoscopic surgery. They will be selected according to&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.they will be randomized into two study groups, one study&#xD;
      group will undergo laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy, the other study group will undergo&#xD;
      laparoscopic cyst deroofing.AMH,AFC and ovarian volume will be measured pre-operative and&#xD;
      post-operative.&#xD;

    <description>will be performed using video control under general anesthesia, pneumoperitoneum is induced by carbon dioxide, with three 5-mm trocars in the lower abdomen and a 10-mm intraumbilical main trocar, and we will use 5-mm scissors and graspers, and Ringer's lactate solution for irrigation. Before initiating ovarian surgery, the ovaries are completely freed with obtuse and sharp dissection.after a cleavage plane between the cyst wall and ovarian cortex is identified, the ovaries are pulled slowly and gently in opposite directions by means of two a traumatic grasping forceps. After removing the pseudo capsule from the abdominal cavity, selective minimal (15 watt) bipolar coagulation of bleeding is performed, without excessive coagulation of the surgical defect to avoid damaging the ovary.</description>

Before initiating ovarian surgery, the ovaries are completely freed with obtuse and sharp dissection. after mobilizing the ovary, the contents of the cyst is removed with the suction-irrigator probe and the cavity is irrigated. The inside of the cyst is evaluated and the portion of ovarian cortex involved with endometriosis is removed. Small blood vessels from the ovarian bed and bleeding from the ovarian hilum can be controlled with bipolar electro coagulation (15 watt). Low-power bipolar coagulation applied to the inside wall of the redundant ovarian capsule</description>
