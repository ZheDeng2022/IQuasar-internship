  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optic neuritis (ON) is a common event in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and causes significant loss&#xD;
      of nerve cells in the eye, resulting in poor vision. Optic neuritis also provides a sensitive&#xD;
      way of testing the effectiveness of drugs that may help protect from loss of nerve cells in&#xD;
      ON and therefore in MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have identified through laboratory and early clinical research in humans&#xD;
      that amiloride (a water tablet already in use) may be a drug that can be of benefit in optic&#xD;
      neuritis by protecting from loss of nerves cells, ie a neuroprotective drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of amiloride as a neuroprotective drug in&#xD;
      optic neuritis&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory condition of the nervous system, is the most common&#xD;
      cause of disability in people of working age in the western world. In addition to the&#xD;
      inflammatory episodes in MS, axonal and neuronal damage occurs. It is this axonal loss which&#xD;
      is thought to be the major pathological substrate for disability in MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute inflammatory demyelinating optic neuritis is a common event in multiple sclerosis.&#xD;
      Following optic neuritis there is axonal loss in the optic nerve and retina, which if severe&#xD;
      can result in a poor visual recovery. Uniquely amongst central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      structures, the structural and functional changes in the eye during and following optic&#xD;
      neuritis provide a sensitive way of observing neurodegeneration and testing the effectiveness&#xD;
      of potential neuroprotective agents. In optic neuritis it has been shown that thinning of the&#xD;
      retinal nerve fibre layer takes place, and by 6 months this thinning is established and has&#xD;
      largely stabilised. This represents axonal loss in the anterior visual system. The degree of&#xD;
      this thinning has been shown to correlate with the amount of vision recovered following optic&#xD;
      neuritis, the more thinning that occurs, the poorer the outcome. The thickness of the retinal&#xD;
      nerve fibre layer can be measured by the simple scanning techniques of scanning laser&#xD;
      polarimetry (GDx) and optical coherence tomography (OCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Axonal loss in MS is likely to be multifactorial, but a key end point is the influx of sodium&#xD;
      and calcium ions. Recent research suggests that in the inflammatory environment of optic&#xD;
      neuritis, the acid sensing ion channel may have an important role in this influx of sodium&#xD;
      and calcium, and therefore in axonal loss in MS. The drug amiloride, already in use as a&#xD;
      diuretic, is a known blocker of this ion channel. The investigators have identified through&#xD;
      laboratory and early clinical research in humans that by blockade of the acid sensing ion&#xD;
      channel, amiloride may be neuroprotective in optic neuritis and MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators primary objective is to assess the neuroprotective efficacy of amiloride in&#xD;
      optic neuritis through the surrogate measure of retinal nerve fibre layer measurement.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to assess markers of neurodegeneration in ON and the neuroprotective&#xD;
      effect of amiloride through non-conventional MRI outcomes, to assess if amiloride improves&#xD;
      functional and visual outcome following optic neuritis, and to confirm optic neuritis as a&#xD;
      sensitive and efficient model for neuroprotection in a clinical trial framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      46 Participants will be recruited to receive either amiloride, or an identical placebo&#xD;
      capsule for 5 months. The primary outcome will be measured at 6 months, with a further&#xD;
      measure at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should this trial show a significant benefit from amiloride in optic neuritis, it will be an&#xD;
      important first step in developing neuroprotective therapies in optic neuritis and MS and&#xD;
      potentially this could have a significant impact on people with MS and their carers.&#xD;
