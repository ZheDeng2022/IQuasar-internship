      The purpose of this study is to see if taking two nutritional supplements, zinc and SAMe&#xD;
      (S-adenosylmethionine), can improve lung health and immune function in persons with HIV. You&#xD;
      are being asked to volunteer because you have HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and you take&#xD;
      anti-retroviral therapy (ART) medications.&#xD;

      There will be up to eleven study visits and three telephone visits. All study procedures are&#xD;
      for research purposes. All study subjects will receive the nutritional supplements zinc and&#xD;
      SAMe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study you will be asked to answer questions about your alcohol use and smoking&#xD;
      history. You will have exhaled breath tests, blood draws, physical exams, and bronchoscopies.&#xD;
      Your medical records will be reviewed during the study. If you are a woman of childbearing&#xD;
      age, a urine pregnancy test will be done at each study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (screening visit): This visit will last about 2 hours. At this visit you will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a physical exam&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Review your medications&#xD;

        -  Have blood drawn&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a urine pregnancy test for women of child-bearing age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete a survey about your alcohol use and smoking history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discuss and schedule a bronchoscopy for the next visit You may not be eligible to&#xD;
           continue in the study if the blood work done at visit one is not within normal limits or&#xD;
           if you are pregnant. A study team member will contact you to let you know if you do or&#xD;
           do not qualify to participate in the remainder of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: This visit will last about 6 hours and will take place at the Hospital. At this&#xD;
      visit you will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;

      If you experience upset stomach, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, or other uncomfortable side&#xD;
      effects, we will reduce the amount of the nutritional supplements. If you are unable to&#xD;
      tolerate the nutritional supplements, you will be withdrawn from the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 3, 4, and 5 -Telephone Contact: You will receive a telephone call at one, two, and&#xD;
      three weeks after visit 2 to ask you how you are tolerating the study supplements. If you are&#xD;

      instruct you to decrease the dose of the supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 6, 7, and 8 (months one, two, and three): These visits will last about 30 minutes and&#xD;
      will be scheduled two months apart. At this visit you will:&#xD;

        -  Have blood drawn&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a urine pregnancy test for women of child-bearing age&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Answer questions about how you are tolerating the nutritional supplements&#xD;

&#xD;
      If your exhaled breath test is at goal at visit 6, you will continue to take the dietary&#xD;
      supplements for one year from this point forward. If your exhaled breath test is not at goal&#xD;
      at visit 6, you will be asked to return for visit 7. If your exhaled breath test is at goal&#xD;
      at visit 7, you will continue to take the dietary supplements for one year from this point&#xD;
      forward. If your exhaled breath test is not at goal at visit 7, you will be asked to return&#xD;
      for visit 8. You will be asked to take the nutritional supplements for one year from this&#xD;
      point forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 9 through 13: These visits will last about 30 minutes and will be scheduled two months&#xD;
      apart.&#xD;

      At this visit you will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have blood drawn&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a urine pregnancy test for women of child-bearing age&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Receive nutritional supplements and education&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 14: This is the final study visit. It will last about 6 hours and will take place at&#xD;
      the Hospital. At this visit you will:&#xD;
