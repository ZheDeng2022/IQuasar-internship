    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not the medication that blocks the&#xD;
      effects of the hormone progesterone (CDB-4124 or Proellex) will decrease the growth rate of&#xD;
      breast cancer cells as compared to a placebo. CDB-4124 (also called Proellex) is a medication&#xD;
      that works against the hormone, progesterone. The researchers in this study would like to&#xD;
      compare changes in breast cancer cells of women who have taken CDB-4124 prior to surgery to&#xD;
      those from women who have taken a placebo pill prior to surgery.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To test the hypothesis that treatment with the selective progesterone receptor modulator&#xD;
      (SPRM) CDB-4124 (telapristone acetate) will have an anti-tumor effect in women with&#xD;
      early-stage breast cancer, defined as a significant decrease in tumor proliferation (Ki67&#xD;
      labeling index).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Measure changes in apoptosis using IHC (cleaved caspase 3 or TUNEL). II. Measure changes&#xD;
      in blood estradiol and progesterone levels. III. Compare the breast tissue concentrations of&#xD;
      CDB-4124 and its metabolite (CDB4453) to plasma concentrations at the end of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Measure protein expression of related targets (including estrogen receptor alpha (ERA),&#xD;
      estrogen receptor beta (ERB), progesterone receptor isoforms progesterone receptor alpha&#xD;
      [PRA], progesterone receptor beta [PRB], tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member&#xD;
      11a, NFKB activator [RANK], tumor necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily, member 11 [RANKL],&#xD;
      and either cyclin-dependent kinase 2 [cdk2] or cyclin-dependent kinase 4 [cdk4],) using IHC&#xD;
      at baseline and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Perform ribonucleic acid (RNA) microarray analysis comparing tumors and normal tissue&#xD;
      from the intervention and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive telapristone acetate orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 2-10 weeks and&#xD;
      then undergo surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive placebo orally once daily for 2-10 weeks and then undergo surgical&#xD;
      resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 month.&#xD;
