        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a calculated body mass index (BMI) from 19 to 30 kg/m2 at study screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the opinion of the Investigator, subjects must be in good health based upon medical&#xD;
             history, physical examination (including vital signs), and screening and baseline&#xD;
             laboratory evaluations (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis must fall within the&#xD;
             normal range of the local laboratory's reference ranges unless the results have been&#xD;
             determined by the Investigator to have no clinical significance).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to utilize a highly effective method of contraception during heterosexual&#xD;
             intercourse from baseline throughout the study period and for 90 days following&#xD;
             discontinuation of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Refrain from sperm donation from Day -1 through completion of the study and continuing&#xD;
             for at least 90 days from the date of last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a creatinine clearance (CLcr) &gt; 80 mL/min (using the Cockcroft-Gault method)&#xD;
             based on serum creatinine and actual body weight as measured at the screening&#xD;
             evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anticipated, regular, average bowel movement of 1-2 per day.&#xD;
&#xD;

             first dose of study drug. Smokers will be defined as any subject who reports tobacco&#xD;
             use and/or who has a urine cotinine â‰¥200 ng/mL at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive HIV-1 antibody, Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or Hepatitis C&#xD;
             antibody test result.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any serious or active medical or psychiatric illness which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, would interfere with subject treatment, assessment, or compliance with&#xD;
             the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have previously participated in an investigational trial involving administration of&#xD;
             any investigational compound within 30 days prior to study dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have participated in studies using radiomaterials or ionizing radiations or have been&#xD;
             otherwise exposed to significant diagnostic (excluding dental X-rays), therapeutic, or&#xD;
             occupational radiation.&#xD;

             positive alcohol or drug test at screening or baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have poor venous access and are unable to donate blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have donated blood within 56 days of study dosing or plasma within 7 days of study&#xD;
             dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been vaccinated within 90 days of study dosing or, for the influenza vaccine,&#xD;

             herbal products, or medications that affect gastric pH (ie, antacids, H2RAs, and/or&#xD;
             proton pump inhibitors) within 28 days of commencing study drug dosing with the&#xD;
             exception of vitamins, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have taken any systemic steroids, immunosuppressant therapies or chemotherapeutic&#xD;
             agents within 3 months of study screening, or expected to receive these agents during&#xD;
             the study (eg, corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, and other immune- or cytokine-based&#xD;
             therapies).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Syncope, palpitations, or unexplained dizziness.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Liver disease (including known Gilbert's Disease) or clinical evidence of liver&#xD;
                  injury or hepatic synthetic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Severe peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or other gastric&#xD;
                  acid hypersecretory conditions requiring prolonged (&gt;6 months) medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  conditions (eg, gastrectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Significant drug sensitivity or drug allergy.&#xD;
