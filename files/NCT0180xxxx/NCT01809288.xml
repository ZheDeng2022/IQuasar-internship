      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Rates of diabetes and heart disease in women are increasing. Early recognition of risk&#xD;
      could help women live longer and healthier lives. Race and ethnicity may affect the best&#xD;
      kinds of tests to use to screen for these conditions. Researchers want to compare risk&#xD;
      factors for diabetes and heart disease in African, African-American, and white women. Doing&#xD;
      so may help identify the most effective screening test for each group. This study will look&#xD;
      at healthy African, African-American, and white women who are federal employees and&#xD;
      contractors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study risk factors for diabetes and heart disease in African, African-American, and&#xD;
      white women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy African, African-American, and white women between 30 and 65 years of age who&#xD;
           are federal employees or contractors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For this study, African women must be born in Africa and have immigrated to the United&#xD;
           States, and report that both parents are Africans. African-American women must&#xD;
           self-identify as African-Americans, born in the United States, and have parents who both&#xD;
           self-identify as African-American born in the United States. White women must&#xD;
           self-identify as white and have parents who also self-identify as white.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have four visits to study their risk factors for diabetes and heart&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first visit is a screening visit. Participants will be screened with a physical exam&#xD;
           and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected. They will also have an&#xD;
           EKG test. Participants will also be shown how to fill out a 3-Day Food Record and wear&#xD;
           an activity monitor called an accelerometer. The food record will keep track of how much&#xD;
           participants eat for 3 consecutive days, including 1 non-working day. The accelerometer&#xD;
           device will be worn for 3 days to monitor movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the second visit, participants will have blood tests, an oral glucose tolerance test,&#xD;
           and body fat measurements. They will also fill out questionnaires, review the food&#xD;
           record, and have two imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the third visit, participants will have a longer glucose tolerance test. During the&#xD;
           test, participants will receive both glucose and insulin and blood samples will be&#xD;
           collected over several hours. Participants will receive lunch at the clinical center&#xD;
           after the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the fourth visit, participants will have a meal test. They will fast for 12 hours&#xD;
           before the test. Participants will eat a specific meal and have blood samples taken&#xD;
           during and after they eat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will discuss the results of these tests with the study doctors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      African-American women experience disproportionately high rates of conditions related to&#xD;
      insulin resistance, specifically type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). In&#xD;
      Africa, T2D and CVD have also become leading causes of death for women. Early recognition of&#xD;
      risk and the implementation of preventive measures could improve both quality of life and&#xD;
      longevity as well as decrease health care expenditures. However, screening tests for the&#xD;
      early detection of T2D and CVD were developed several decades ago in large studies with&#xD;
      mostly white participants. Emerging evidence suggests that there are racial differences in&#xD;
      the ability and importance of various risk factors to predict the development of diabetes and&#xD;
      CVD. Consequently tests used to screen for T2D and CVD are often not effective in women of&#xD;
      African descent. Thus, women of African descent lose the opportunity and benefit of early&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Designing tests to determine risk for T2D and CVD in women of African descent requires an&#xD;
      appreciation of why current tests do not work. Screening tests to detect risk for T2D and CVD&#xD;
      usually rely on the observation that insulin resistance is associated with increased hepatic&#xD;
      fat, high fasting glucose and high triglyceride (TG) levels. However, while insulin-resistant&#xD;
      white women usually have high liver fat, high fasting glucose and high TG levels,&#xD;
      insulin-resistant African-American women often have normal TG levels, normal fasting glucose&#xD;
      and low hepatic fat. Therefore, these tests routinely fail to detect risk in African-American&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between TG levels to insulin resistance, hepatic glucose production and&#xD;
      liver fat has not been studied in African women. To improve diagnosis, we propose a study of&#xD;
      race differences in TG levels, fasting glucose levels and hepatic fat comparing 3 groups of&#xD;
      women who are federal employees or contractors: African-American African (born in subSaharan&#xD;
      Africa and immigrated to the United States) and white. This design ensures all enrollees will&#xD;
      have health insurance, a similar work environment and a comparable distribution of position&#xD;
      (i.e. scientific, administrative, support). Analyses to detect differences in diet, physical&#xD;
      activity and other psychosocial factors will be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 4 outpatient visits for 360 non-diabetic women (120 African-American, 120&#xD;
      African and 120 white, aged 25 to 65 years, BMI 20 to 45 kg/m2) enrolled. At Visit 1, a&#xD;
      medical history, physical exam and screening labs will be done. Participants will record food&#xD;
      intake and monitor physical activity wear an activity monirot (accelerometer) during a 7-day&#xD;
      period between visits. At Visit 2 an oral glucose tolerance test will be performed. Studies&#xD;
      to examine body fat content and distribution will also be done. At Visit 3, insulin&#xD;
      resistance will be measured with an intravenous glucose tolerance test. At Visit 4, breakfast&#xD;
      will be eaten with blood samples taken before and after the meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the 4 outpatient visits described, there will be an optional overnight stay&#xD;
      the evening before visit 3 for 60 women (30 African descent and 30 white). The purpose of&#xD;
      this smaller study is to determine if race differences in the production of glucose by the&#xD;
      liver contribute to race differences in fasting glucose levels. Eligible women will be in&#xD;
      good health, between 25 and 50 years of age and have a BMI 25-45kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be the first time (a) TG levels in African immigrants are compared to&#xD;
      African-American and white women (b) hepatic glucose production is assessed by race, and (c)&#xD;
      the relationship of TG to insulin resistance, liver fat, body fat distribution, diet,&#xD;
      physical activity and psychosocial factors are examined in these 3 groups of women under&#xD;
      similar metabolic and economic conditions. While failure of screening tests means a lost&#xD;
      opportunity for early intervention, effective screening tests can change outcomes, improve&#xD;
      lives and minimize health care expenditures. This protocol is building a foundation on which&#xD;
      effective screening tests for diabetes and heart disease can be built.&#xD;
