  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Canada, the number of obese children and adolescents has increased tremendously.&#xD;
      Interventions addressing diet and physical activity have been successful in the short-term.&#xD;
      However, a great number of individuals have difficulties maintaining achieved weight loss and&#xD;
      returning to treatment sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New technology interventions, through the web or delivered trough Personal Digital Assistants&#xD;
      (PDAs) (e.g. iPhone or Blackberry), are increasingly being used in health interventions. PDAs&#xD;
      have emerged as appealing in health interventions as they are easily accessible and their&#xD;
      interactivity makes them well suited to promote long-term engagement in behaviour change&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will look at the utility of supplementing a family-based lifestyle program for&#xD;
      overweight and obese adolescents (Shapedown BC) with a PDA intervention (Text2bHealthy)&#xD;
      focussing mainly on physical activity, sedentary behaviours, and dietary intake to maintain&#xD;
      treatment success by improving self-management skills. Adolescents and will receive&#xD;
      Text2bHealthy for 3-months after 3 months participation in the Shapedown BC program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this study will provide needed information on how to improve treatment adherence&#xD;
      and maintenance outcomes through the use of innovative methods and will ultimately contribute&#xD;
      to the improvement of long-term outcomes in obesity treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Around the world, the amount of people who are overweight is increasing. This has become a&#xD;
      public health crisis. Obesity, especially in children, is a problem because it is associated&#xD;
      with risk for health problems and psychological issues. These problems include heart disease&#xD;
      and poor quality of life and can happen both in childhood and later life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Programs that help people change their lifestyle and behaviour are effective to help people&#xD;
      lose weight and improve their mental health. In children, the main issue for treating obesity&#xD;
      is to help the child keep weight off and to prevent a return to unhealthy behaviours. This&#xD;
      means that long-term support is needed. But the health care system is not set up to do this&#xD;
      because of a limited amount of resources. The aim of this study is to see if there are better&#xD;
      long-term results if we use a technology tool along with a lifestyle program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to examine a personal digital assistant (PDA) program&#xD;
      (Text2bHealthy) supplemented to an existing family-based group treatment for overweight and&#xD;
      obese children. This treatment is called the British Columbia Centre for Healthy Weights&#xD;
      (BCCHW) Shapedown BC program. The aim of this study is to see if Text2bHealthy supplemented&#xD;
      to the Shapedown BC program helps children to keep the weight of and improves physical&#xD;
      activity as well as fruit, vegetable, and fat intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We know from studies that reporting one's own behaviour, goal setting, and tailored feedback&#xD;
      are key elements in changing health behaviours. Text2bHealthy includes these key elements.&#xD;
      PDAs will be given to 30 10-16 year old children and adolescents after completing the&#xD;
      Shapedown BC program. They will be explained how to use the PDA. Children who participate in&#xD;
      the Text2bHealthy program will set weekly goals related to their physical activity, eating or&#xD;
      sitting behaviours. Also, they will report on their lifestyle behaviours twice a week. They&#xD;
      will receive personalized feedback on their progress. The feedback is designed to be&#xD;
      supportive and to reinforce their behaviour in a positive way. The control group (N=30) will&#xD;
      use a paper dairy to keep track of their lifestyle behaviours. At 0 and 3 months after&#xD;
      completing the Shapedown BC program, measurements such as height and weight will be taken.&#xD;
      Also, exercise and nutrition behaviour will be measured. Physical activity will be measured&#xD;
      with pedometers and a recall and nutrition intake with questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because it is hard to maintain weight loss, we need to provide programs that offer the&#xD;
      long-term support of behaviour change. Tools such as PDAs seem to be ideal to offer long-term&#xD;
      support. For the purpose of this study, PDAs will be used as a proof of concept; the&#xD;
      programming can be incorporated into smart phones in the future. From previous studies we&#xD;
      know that reporting one's own behaviour seems to improve weight loss in children. Also,&#xD;
      behaviours are more likely to be reported when using mobile phones compared to paper &amp; pencil&#xD;
      diaries. I am one of the first to study the effect of innovative technologies by using&#xD;
      self-reporting, goal setting, and personalized feedback in childhood obesity treatment. We&#xD;
      hope that the results from this study will increase our knowledge on the use and feasibility&#xD;
      of digital devices in childhood obesity treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes of this research will be used to better understand how to improve weight loss&#xD;
      maintenance among obese children. Obesity places children at higher risk for heart disease&#xD;
      and poor quality of life when they are adults. Thus time and cost-effective long-term support&#xD;
      programs need to be developed to improve weight loss maintenance. This new program has the&#xD;
      potential to improve maintenance of weight loss and healthy lifestyle in overweight and obese&#xD;
      children and adolescents.&#xD;
