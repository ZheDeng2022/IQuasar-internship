      The primary goal of this single-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects, double-scan,&#xD;
      one-visit neuroimaging study is to examine the effects of the hypnotic zolpidem (Ambien®) in&#xD;
      individuals who are maintained on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for the&#xD;
      treatment of major depressive disorder. Specifically, levels of the brain chemical GABA will&#xD;
      be examined in the anterior cingulate and thalamus, two brain regions that play important&#xD;
      roles in mediating some of the effects of depression and sleep-related drugs, respectively.&#xD;
      Depressed individuals typically have lower levels of GABA than the healthy population, and&#xD;
      antidepressant treatment has been shown to help normalize this neurochemical in conjunction&#xD;
      with improved mood. Given that individuals maintained on SSRIs often are prescribed&#xD;
      sedative/hypnotics to treat concurrent insomnia, understanding a possible neurochemical&#xD;
      interaction between them, whether beneficial or harmful, is important for informing&#xD;
      evidence-based treatment strategies to treat the co-morbid patient. Zolpidem's effects on&#xD;
      GABA in participants who are maintained on SSRIs will be compared to baseline GABA levels in&#xD;
      these individuals (i.e., following placebo administration). Two separate scanning sessions&#xD;
      lasting approximately 45-60 min each will take place within one single study visit in order&#xD;
      to obtain these measurements using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS). This type&#xD;
      of neuroimaging is like an MRI in that it is non-invasive, but it permits us to obtain&#xD;
      information about chemicals in the brain. A secondary goal of this study is to compare the&#xD;
      subjective drug effects, or how individuals feel, following the intervention. These measures&#xD;
      will be used to determine the existence of brain-behavior relationships in order to assess&#xD;
      the extent to which modulating GABA with zolpidem has effects on mood states in depressed&#xD;
      participants. Collectively, this study will contribute to our understanding of how these&#xD;
      drugs exert their effects when one is administered in the presence of the other, and it will&#xD;
      demonstrate that imaging is an important tool for informing us about how drug effects in the&#xD;
      brain ultimately result in behavior.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbances are a primary complaint in at least 35% of depressed patients, and upwards&#xD;
      of one third of individuals taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to treat&#xD;
      major depressive disorder (MDD) also take prescription sleep-aids. Several controlled trials&#xD;
      have documented the effectiveness of combining hypnotics with antidepressants in order to&#xD;
      improve disordered sleep in MDD, but it is unclear if benzodiazepines and related drugs can&#xD;
      cause or worsen depression. A recent study in which nightly administration of the&#xD;
      benzodiazepine-like hypnotic zolpidem (Ambien®) was added to the SSRI citalopram demonstrated&#xD;
      that while depressive symptoms were not improved by the combination treatment, this regimen&#xD;
      also did not worsen symptoms in a clinically significant manner. However, the adverse events&#xD;
      reported from that trial---although limited---confirm a number of case reports documenting&#xD;
      psychiatric incidents related to this drug combination, and these accounts suggest&#xD;
      collectively that the potential exists for zolpidem-antidepressant interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the brain, SSRIs are believed to exert their actions primarily in cortical regions&#xD;
      where they increase GABA levels. Conversely, we and others have shown that zolpidem and&#xD;
      conventional benzodiazepines reduced GABA levels in the thalamus and occipital cortex,&#xD;
      respectively. Moreover, the zolpidem-induced reduction in GABA was accompanied by increased&#xD;
      self-reported ratings of generally unpleasant or aversive-like subjective feelings,&#xD;
      suggesting a relationship between them may exist. A possible implication of this finding is&#xD;
      that administration of benzodiazepine-like drugs during SSRI treatment may exacerbate&#xD;
      negative affect or depressed mood states by countering the restorative effects of SSRIs on&#xD;
      dysfunctional GABA in MDD. The present study begins to address this hypothesis by employing&#xD;
      proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) at a field strength of 4 Tesla to assess the&#xD;
      effects of a therapeutic dose of zolpidem (10 mg) administered acutely to volunteers&#xD;
      maintained on stable SSRI treatment for the treatment of MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study outlined in this protocol is to investigate drug-induced changes&#xD;
      in the 1H MRS-visible pool of GABA in single voxels located within the anterior cingulate and&#xD;
      thalamus following acute administration of zolpidem relative to placebo in depressed&#xD;
      volunteers. The secondary aim is to collect information regarding the subjective effects&#xD;
      engendered by each of the interventions. This information, in conjunction with data showing&#xD;
      how each treatment affects brain chemistry, will help us understand the neurobiological&#xD;
      mechanisms that may contribute to alterations in mood states when this popular hypnotic is&#xD;
      combined with stable SSRI treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 20 depressed but otherwise healthy volunteers will be enrolled at McLean Hospital&#xD;
      to participate in this 2-visit (1 screening visit, 1 study visit) single-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study, double-scan study. Participants will be between 21 and 40 years of&#xD;
      age, they can be either male or female, and there are no restrictions regarding ethnic&#xD;
      background. Participants will be maintained on stable SSRI therapy for the treatment of MDD,&#xD;
      but they will not meet DSM-IV criteria for other major psychiatric disorders (including any&#xD;
      substance abuse and/or dependence). They cannot report a family history of alcoholism,&#xD;
      medical conditions that could affect drug disposition, and they will not be taking any&#xD;
      medications other than their SSRIs. Participants also cannot have any MRI scanning&#xD;
      contraindications (including pregnancy). They must be able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will visit the laboratory for a screening visit during which s/he will sign the&#xD;
      informed consent form, and undergo both physical and psychiatric exams, as well as a&#xD;
      structural screening MRI. The second visit will involve pre-study assessments, a standard&#xD;
      breakfast, questionnaire sets, drug treatment, two scanning sessions, and lunch. After a&#xD;
      baseline period during which participants will answer computerized questionnaires, they will&#xD;
      receive a study medication (10 mg zolpidem or placebo) and then answer the questionnaires.&#xD;
      Just prior to beginning the approximately 45-min scanning session (45-min post-medication),&#xD;
      participants will be transported to the 4T scanner in a wheelchair and be positioned within&#xD;
      the scanner. A small blood sample will be taken after the scan. In the afternoon,&#xD;
      participants will receive another treatment and then answer the questionnaires. Just prior to&#xD;
      beginning the approximately 45-min scanning session (45-min post-medication), participants&#xD;
      will be transported to the 4T scanner in a wheelchair and be positioned within the scanner. A&#xD;
      second small blood sample will be taken after the scan. The scanning session will be followed&#xD;
      by hourly questionnaire sets until the end of the 8-hr visit at which point participants will&#xD;
      take a taxicab home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An exhaustive screening procedure ensures that participants entering the study have no&#xD;
      contraindicating conditions. All procedures are performed by experts specifically trained in&#xD;
      their respective areas to minimize risks, discomfort, and adverse events. Participants are&#xD;
      well informed of the potential risks of the study. The informed consent form is detailed and&#xD;
      explicit. Participants are provided with unlimited time to read the consent and study&#xD;
      personnel review it in detail before participants sign. In addition, participants have the&#xD;
      opportunity to ask questions before, during, and after consent and at any time during the&#xD;
      study. Participants can earn up to a total of $250 for completing the study.&#xD;
