  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), spinal cord injury (SCI), acquired amputation&#xD;
      (AMP), muscular dystrophy (MD), and low back pain (LBP) experience pain. There has been&#xD;
      little research on how to treat this pain. Different types of treatment that include&#xD;
      self-hypnosis, education about chronic pain, and learning skills on how to change how a&#xD;
      person thinks about his/her pain have been used to treat chronic pain in the general&#xD;
      population. The purpose of this study is to see if these different treatments can help&#xD;
      decrease pain in people with multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury, and determine how and&#xD;
      why these treatments are effective. A subject must have a diagnosis of MS,SCI, AMP, MD, or&#xD;
      LBP, have chronic pain, and be at least 18 years old to participate.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals from the study's recruitment sources with the diagnoses listed above will be&#xD;
      contacted by research staff via telephone and invited to be screened for participation. In&#xD;
      addition, individuals interested in participating may contact research staff upon learning&#xD;
      about the study through a description listed on an approved website or a referral. Research&#xD;
      staff will use a recruitment script for purposes of screening subjects and explaining the&#xD;
      study. In addition, the initial screening process will also include conducting a cognitive&#xD;
      screening known as the 6-item cognitive screener.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research staff will verify the diagnoses (MS, SCI, AMP, MD or LBP) of prospective subjects&#xD;
      who have not been 'pre-verified' in one of three ways during the recruitment process:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Research staff will attempt to determine whether a subject from has a University of&#xD;
           Washington Medical Center (UWMC)/Harborview Medical Center (HMC) medical record by&#xD;
           conducting a simple search using a secure application.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If research staff are unable to locate a medical record for the prospective subject from&#xD;
           recruitment strategy #1, or if the individual is part of recruitment strategy #4 (i.e.&#xD;
           if individual sees description of study on clinicaltrials.gov and contacts research&#xD;
           staff), then one of two options will be pursued:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects will be asked during the initial screening process if staff may review their&#xD;
           medical records if they have received services at the UWMC/HMC since their diagnosis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subjects will be asked during the initial screening process if staff may contact a&#xD;
           physician of their choice to verify their diagnosis if (a) they have not received&#xD;
           services at the UWMC/HMC since their diagnosis; (b) they refuse to give staff permission&#xD;
           to review their UWMC/HMC medical records; or (c) staff for some reason cannot find a&#xD;
           UWMC/HMC medical record despite the subject attesting to being a patient at one time at&#xD;
           the UWMC/HMC and giving staff permission to review his/her records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only individuals whose diagnosis has been verified (either via medical record review prior&#xD;
      to/during screening or through verification via the subject's physician depending on&#xD;
      recruitment source) will proceed with the psychological screening assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a prospective subject has been screened and deemed eligible to participate, research&#xD;
      staff will arrange a time and date for all subjects recruited into the study to participate&#xD;
      in a telephone psychological screening assessment with one of the study's licensed clinicians&#xD;
      (Drs. Jensen, Ehde, Molton, or Dillworth) or senior fellow (Elena Mendoza, a clinical&#xD;
      psychologist). The study clinician will ask potential subjects some questions to assess the&#xD;
      presence of active suicidal ideation or paranoid thoughts using an assessment sheet.&#xD;
      Individuals who do have these types of thoughts will not be eligible for the study.&#xD;
      Individuals will be referred to a mental health professional if he or she needs immediate&#xD;
      attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research staff will then arrange a time with the subject to attend in person what we call the&#xD;
      initial intake session. At the beginning of the initial intake session, research staff will&#xD;
      review a consent form with the subject and answer any questions he/she may have. The subject&#xD;
      will complete and sign the consent form if he/she would like to participate. If the subject&#xD;
      decides to enroll in the study, he/she will then be asked to complete a set of tasks testing&#xD;
      memory and processing speed, participate in a relaxation and hypnotic exercise, and provide&#xD;
      basic demographic information, as well as information about diagnosis and pain problem(s)&#xD;
      he/she experiences. The initial intake session will last about 1.5 hours depending on the&#xD;
      subject's answers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will then participate in a brain activity assessment at the Integrated Brain&#xD;
      Imaging Center (IBIC) at the University of Washington that will take about one hour to&#xD;
      complete. The brain activity assessment consists of an electroencephalogram (EEG), which&#xD;
      measures the electrical activity in the brain through electrodes placed on the scalp. There&#xD;
      is no risk of electrical shock. Research staff will place a damp electrode net on the&#xD;
      subject's head that contains the electrodes that will measure the subject's brain activity.&#xD;
      EEG activity will be collected with the subject's eyes closed. The research staff member will&#xD;
      collect the data and ask the subject to remain as still as possible during the assessment. A&#xD;
      research staff member will ask the subject his/her pain intensity during and after the&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of four treatment&#xD;
      interventions. All four treatment interventions involve educating subjects about pain,&#xD;
      discussing the impact of pain, and discussing different ways to manage it in hopes of&#xD;
      decreasing subjects' pain and its impact on their lives. Two treatment interventions will&#xD;
      also involve self-hypnosis. During self-hypnosis, subjects learn to enter a state of focused&#xD;
      attention, and then change how they experience pain. All four treatment interventions are&#xD;
      called &quot;self-management&quot; approaches to pain management. All of these treatments are commonly&#xD;
      used in pain clinics and have been used to treat pain in persons with MS and SCI. We are&#xD;
      interested in comparing the four different approaches to treating chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research staff member will also contact each subject six times by telephone during his/her&#xD;
      participation in the study to complete three short interviews or assessments, 3-5 minutes&#xD;
      long, and one longer assessment, about 30-40 minutes long, in a period of one week. These&#xD;
      assessments will be completed one week prior to treatment, about halfway through the&#xD;
      treatment period, after the completion of treatment, and 3-, 6- and 12-months after the&#xD;
      subject completes treatment. The three shorter assessments will include questions about pain&#xD;
      intensity. The fourth longer assessment will include questions about such things as how the&#xD;
      subject thinks about pain, treatments for pain the subject has received, medications or drugs&#xD;
      the subject has used, and any depressive symptoms the subject may have experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also ask each subject to participate in a brain activity assessment following the end&#xD;
      of treatment. The brain activity will be done the same way as described earlier and will take&#xD;
      place at the Integrated Brain Imaging Center at the University of Washington.&#xD;
