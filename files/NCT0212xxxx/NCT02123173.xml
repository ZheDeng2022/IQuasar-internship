  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-intubated thoracoscopic surgery has been proved as an adequate alternative for management&#xD;
      of many lung conditions such as pneumothorax , lung volume reduction, pulmonary&#xD;
      metastasectomy, removal of lung nodules, segmentectomy and lobectomy. However, the&#xD;
      hemodynamic changes during one lung ventilation have not been fully investigated. The goals&#xD;
      of this study are to compare the changes of hemodynamics (including blood pressure, heart&#xD;
      rate, cardiac output, pulse pressure variation, fluid responsiveness) during one lung&#xD;
      ventilation between conventional intubated and non-intubated vedio-assisted thoracoscopic&#xD;
      (VATS) operations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-intubated vedio-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) is proved safely performed as well as&#xD;
      traditional intubated VATS. However, the differences of hemodynamic changes and fluid&#xD;
      responsiveness during one lung ventilation(OLV) between these two groups were rarely&#xD;
      reported. For complete lung collapse, spontaneous negative pressure respiration must be well&#xD;
      maintained on non-intubated VATS. In comparison, positive pressure ventilation on dependent&#xD;
      lung was applied during OLV in intubated VATS. This study planned to compared the changes of&#xD;
      hemodynamics (including blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output) during OLV between&#xD;
      groups. As functional hemodynamic monitoring (FloTrac system) was mostly utilized with&#xD;
      positive pressure ventilation, the applicability of FloTrac in non- intubated VATS was also&#xD;
      testified. In this study, we also measure the fluid responsiveness by FloTrac system with&#xD;
      rapid infusion (within 10 minutes) of 10 mL/kg crystalloid fluid. We planned to compare the&#xD;
      changes on cardiac output and the fluid responsiveness during OLV between these two groups.&#xD;
