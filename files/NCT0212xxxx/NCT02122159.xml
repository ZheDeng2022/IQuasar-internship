  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pathologic myopia is a major cause of legal blindness worldwide. In myopic macular&#xD;
      degeneration (MMD), there is degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) layer, and&#xD;
      associated photoreceptors, resulting in vision loss. There is currently no standard treatment&#xD;
      for MMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transplantation of intact sheets of RPE and suspensions of isolated individual RPE cells as&#xD;
      well as autologous translocation of RPE cells has been attempted as treatment for AMD. Human&#xD;
      photoreceptors are comprised of two cell types-rods and cones. Both have a close relationship&#xD;
      with the outermost retinal cells, the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). The RPE is located&#xD;
      between the choroid and the photoreceptors. The RPE maintains photoreceptor function by&#xD;
      recycling photopigments,delivering, metabolizing and storing vitamin A, phagocytosing rod&#xD;
      photoreceptor outer segments, transporting iron and small molecules between retina and&#xD;
      choroid, maintaining Bruch's membrane and absorbing stray light to allow better image&#xD;
      resolution. In essence, the RPE layer is critical to the function and health of&#xD;
      photoreceptors and the retina as a whole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human PRE (hRPE) transplantation may be a viable option for treatment of degenerative&#xD;
      diseases of the retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MA09-hRPE cells are fully differentiated human RPE cells derived from embryonic stem cells.&#xD;
      Transplanted hRPE cells prepared by Advanced Cell Technology have been studied in rodent&#xD;
      models of macular degenerative disease. The data suggests that the subretinal injection of&#xD;
      ACT's hRPE cell products rescues, or at least delays, loss of visual function in two animal&#xD;
      models of retinal degenerative diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MA09-hRPE&#xD;
      cellular therapy in patients with Myopic Macular Degeneration (MMD). Another objective is to&#xD;
      evaluate potential efficacy endpoints to be used in future studies of RPE cellular therapy.&#xD;

    <description>The transplantation of hESC-derived RPE cells MA09-hRPE will be considered safe and tolerated in the absence of:&#xD;
Any grade 2 (NCI grading system) or greater adverse event related to the cell product&#xD;
Any evidence that the cells are contaminated with an infectious agent&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evidence of successful engraftment will consist of:&#xD;
Structural evidence (OCT imaging, fluorescein angiography, slit-lamp examination with fundus photography) that cells have been implanted in the correct location&#xD;
Electroretinographic evidence (mfERG) showing enhanced activity in the implant location</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <description>Evidence of rejection will consist of:&#xD;
• Structural (imaging) evidence that implanted MA09-hRPE cells are no longer in the correct location or the presence of vascular leakage&#xD;
If enhanced electroretinographic activity is observed after the transplantation, subsequent electroretinographic evidence that activity has returned to pre-transplant conditions may be an indication of graft rejection</description>

    <description>MA09-hRPE cells for transplantation will be provided by Ocata Therapeutics as a suspension frozen to the temperature of liquid nitrogen (approximately -196 °C). They will be processed at UCLA under GMPs according to protocol. Following vitrectomy performed under general anesthesia or waking sedation at the surgeon's discretion, hRPE cells will be introduced into a subretinal bleb formed by the injection of balanced salt solution (BSS). Direct viewing will guide the implantation of thawed and washed MA09-hRPE cells, resuspended in BSS, into the created bleb over a period of one minute. To avoid cell reflux, the cannula used to introduce the cells will be held in position for an additional minute. A suspension of either 50,000 MA09-hRPE cells (first cohort), 100,000 MA09-hRPE cells (second cohort), 150,000 MA09-hRPE cells (third cohort) or 200,000 MA09-hRPE cells (fourth cohort) in 150 uL of BSS plus will be implanted over 1 minute in the space created.</description>
