  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2010, 25.8 million people in the US, or 8.3% of the population were reported to have&#xD;
      diabetes. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is especially prevalent among older adults: 26.9%&#xD;
      of people 65 years or older have diabetes with 50% being pre-diabetic. Diabetes is the&#xD;
      leading cause of blindness, kidney disease and lower-limb amputation among older adults, and&#xD;
      is also a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fortunately, diabetes and its related complications are very amenable to lifestyle changes.&#xD;
      Engagement with healthcare providers can significantly affects behavior and disease&#xD;
      management of practices of individuals as does social engagement. The use of mobile&#xD;
      technology and better engagement with providers and peer support networks may support&#xD;
      diabetes self-care management. Individual patient personality attributes may affect the&#xD;
      success of technology interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators propose to design and test a motivation psychology-based&#xD;
      smart engagement system (MOSES), which is a software application on a digital tablet device.&#xD;
      The pre-loaded tablets will be provided to adults with T2DM (age 60+ with high glucose). The&#xD;
      software will allow the patients to record diabetes self-care activities (exercise, glucose,&#xD;
      nutrition, medication adherence), pursue goals, support communication between the patient and&#xD;
      a health coach, support communication between peer patients, and visualize health status more&#xD;
      easily by patients and providers. This research program will enroll 88 patients (4&#xD;
      intervention groups of 12 persons each and a 40-person control group) in a 90-day pilot study&#xD;
      to test and refine the design of the application and its effectiveness in supporting care&#xD;
      plan goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 1: Design, implement, and optimize a motivation psychology-based smart engagement&#xD;
      system (MOSES) for older adults with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 2: Determine if providing older adult diabetic patients to care managers and&#xD;
      peers via a digital tablet-based software application leads to improved diabetes management&#xD;
      as measured by blood glucose control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 3: Refine the personality attributes used to tailor the interaction with the&#xD;
      application.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a 90-day pilot study to establish the effects and value&#xD;
      of MOSES in the management of diabetes. The pilot study will provide initial data to answer&#xD;
      the following research questions: (1) What are the effects of MOSES technology on older&#xD;
      adults' diabetes self-care? (2) What type of social engagement intervention is more effective&#xD;
      for what aspects of diabetes care? (3) What personality characteristics predict older adults'&#xD;
      diabetes self-care?; (4) What personality characteristics moderate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      mobile device (esp. tablet-based) social engagement interventions on older adults' diabetic&#xD;
      care? (5) What model can be developed from our data to predict probability of effective&#xD;
      response to interventions tailored to individual patients, e.g. by message type for clinical,&#xD;
      usage and personality attributes?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Older adults are the target population for this study. Adult volunteers age 60 and&#xD;
      above with an HbA1C of &gt;7.9% and having the capacity to provide informed consent will be&#xD;
      eligible to participate. Participants will be randomized to usual care or to an intervention&#xD;
      group (described below). Once enrolled in the study and randomized to either the intervention&#xD;
      or the control group, the Research Certified Diabetes Educator (CDE) will review all&#xD;
      participants' clinical data and assist with providing feedback messages to the participants&#xD;
      regarding their self-care progress. The Research CDE will alert physicians to any clinical&#xD;
      data that would warrant a change in clinical management (e.g. hyper or hypoglycemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manipulations&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are four manipulations in the experiment: (1) patient recording i.e. using the tablet&#xD;
      and app to track and review progress (this increases mindfulness, engagement, activation, and&#xD;
      informedness, thereby leading to healthier behaviors than the control condition), (2) patient&#xD;
      recording with physician involvement via Health-feed communication messages (in addition to&#xD;
      the benefits listed above, this provides expert feedback from a trusted source on actions,&#xD;
      helps with goal setting, provides motivational reinforcement of positive behavior and&#xD;
      sanction against negative, etc.), (3) patient recording with peer interaction i.e. using&#xD;
      Health-feed messages, Community Views and Health Tournaments (in addition to the benefits&#xD;
      listed for (1), peer effects have been observed in a variety of different settings such as&#xD;
      educational attainment). People tend to emulate the behavior of peers, setting in motion a&#xD;
      cycle of group conformism. People may also be motivated by a desire to compete in a peer&#xD;
      setting, and (4) patient recording with peer interaction AND physician involvement. This&#xD;
      final group will permit analysis of the interaction effects of the two forms of social&#xD;
      engagement. Thus, the experiment will be done with the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: the control group, usual care, (n=40)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: individual patients using app w/o provider support (n=12)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group C: individual patients using app w/ provider support (n=12)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group D: peer patient teams using app w/o provider support (n=12; 4 teams)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group E: peer patient teams using app with provider support (n=12; 4 teams)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups will be assigned to achieve age, gender and HbA1C matching at baseline. For groups&#xD;
      with provider engagement (E), the provider (endocrinologist/CDE) will provide initial advice&#xD;
      to the subjects, as well as continuous monitoring. The study will require a dedicated&#xD;
      diabetes educator, who will spend 2 hours a day to keep in touch with the subjects, including&#xD;
      reviewing the activity logs, sending reminder and motivational messages, as well as&#xD;
      moderating the discussions in the peer engagement group. The CDE will triage the text&#xD;
      messages from subjects and trigger the physician engagement when necessary. The study CDE&#xD;
      will review participant data routinely and will maintain communication with the study team on&#xD;
      a timely basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the experiments, adverse events will be closely monitored by the physician and CDE, as&#xD;
      well as through subject self-reports. The MOSES app has a built-in function to highlight&#xD;
      potential adverse effects in the activity list and physician to-do list. The investigators&#xD;
      will also conduct a weekly review of subject activity log.&#xD;
