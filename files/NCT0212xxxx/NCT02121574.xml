      Background When a patient is anesthetised and undergoes an operation, their body temperature&#xD;
      falls. Managing a body temperature properly by keeping it within normal limits has been shown&#xD;
      to improve recovery from surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A vital part of managing temperature is being able to measure it properly. There are several&#xD;
      ways of doing so, which consist of invasive methods such as temperature probes in the&#xD;
      oesophagus and bladder, and non invasive methods such as infrared scanners and ear canal&#xD;
      probes. During an operation, temperature changes as small as 0.5 °C can affect outcomes but,&#xD;
      currently, only invasive methods are reliable enough to detect this. Oesophageal probes can't&#xD;
      be used in patients who are not anaesthetised during their operations, and it is&#xD;
      inappropriate to insert a urinary catheter should it not be otherwise needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to look at two new methods of measuring a patient's temperature&#xD;
      which would help us in these situations. The first is called zero-flux thermometry and&#xD;
      involves placing an adhesive pad to the forehead, which gives constant measurement of a&#xD;
      patient's core temperature. The second involves swallowing an ingestible capsule that is no&#xD;
      bigger than a normal pill. This technique has been very useful in research tracking a&#xD;
      patient's core temperature as they are transferred through different areas over a longer&#xD;
      period of time. Whilst these two methods are potentially very useful, they have never been&#xD;
      tested on hospital patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to determine whether readings from these thermometers are accurate&#xD;
      enough to be used in patients before, during and after surgery. Should they prove to be&#xD;
      sufficiently accurate it will allow us to improve patient care through both clinical practice&#xD;
      and research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During operations, temperature is routinely measured in line with NICE guidelines with a&#xD;
      thermometer placed in the nose or oesophagous. The investigators will not be changing routine&#xD;
      practice in any way, but checking measurements from the new devices against the proven,&#xD;
      routine ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to record measurements from each device every minute throughout the&#xD;
      operation in 20 patients. The investigators will then perform statistical tests to check&#xD;
      their accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis: Zero flux and ingestible thermometers are not significantly different at&#xD;
      detecting patients body temperature than oesophageal temperature probes&#xD;

      Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been designed to provide information on the suitability and accuracy of two&#xD;
      methods of temperature measurement in the perioperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Good perioperative temperature management is an important means of improving patient outcome&#xD;
      [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      An essential part of optimal management is accurate temperature measurement. The gold&#xD;
      standard is pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) measurement. However, these are used infrequently&#xD;
      in British practice due to the high rates of associated complications. Urinary bladder and&#xD;
      oesophageal temperatures are sufficiently accurate but are unsuitable for many patients [2].&#xD;
      For example it is not possible to use oesophageal probes in awake patients and many patients&#xD;
      are not catheterised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although non-invasive and relatively cheap means of measuring temperature (such as aural&#xD;
      canal probes and infrared scanners) exist, they are neither accurate nor consistent enough to&#xD;
      distinguish the 0.5˚C differences which have a significant effect on patient outcomes [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators plan to look at two methods of temperature measurement which&#xD;
      potentially offer significant improvements to surgical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first is a new method known as zero-flux thermometry. This is completely non-invasive,&#xD;
      involving no more than placing an adhesive pad to the forehead. Connected up to a monitor,&#xD;
      this will equilibrate with the patient's core temperature and give a constant read-out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second is an ingestible capsule. These have become an important tool for measuring both&#xD;
      hypothermia and hyperthermia in other settings. Their accuracy has not, however, been tested&#xD;
      in hospital patients. This technology, although too expensive for routine use, offers&#xD;
      significant advantages for research as they can provide a constant record of temperature&#xD;
      throughout the patient's stay in hospital. For example, the investigators' audit data show&#xD;
      that if patients admitted with fractured neck of femur become hypothermic at any time, their&#xD;
      mortality increases. Subsequent to this we showed that patient temperatures drop&#xD;
      significantly between ambulance, A&amp;E and admission to the ward. These parts of the patient&#xD;
      journey are possible targets for the prevention of hypothermia and the continuous monitoring&#xD;
      offered by these devices will allow us to accurately test the efficacy of the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the accuracy in the perioperative period of zero-flux&#xD;
      and ingestible temperature readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that oesophageal and nasopharyngeal measurements can be taken as&#xD;
      an accurate reflection of core temperature [2]. The consistency and accuracy of the other two&#xD;
      will be compared to this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be purely observational. There will be no interference with current practice.&#xD;
      Nasopharyngeal/oesophageal probes are routinely placed, according to NICE guidelines, in&#xD;
      these patients. The zero-flux thermometer is non-invasive and the ingestible capsule no&#xD;
      bigger than a pill, so neither provide any additional risk to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temperature readings will be downloaded from each of the three devices with a maximum&#xD;
      interval of 1 minute. The investigators have calculated that readings from 15 subjects will&#xD;
      provide sufficient power. The investigators plan to recruit 20 patients. Analysis of&#xD;
      agreement between the methods will be performed as suggested by Bland and Altman[3].&#xD;
