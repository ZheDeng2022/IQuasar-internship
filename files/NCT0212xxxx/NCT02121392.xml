  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to further investigate the efficacy of adductor canal nerve&#xD;
      blocks for pain management after total knee replacement. Specifically we are studying&#xD;
      adductor canal nerve blocks in conjunction with epidural anesthesia, which is a combination&#xD;
      that has not been extensively researched before. Our question is whether combining these&#xD;
      modalities will enhance patient satisfaction after surgery and accelerate patients' readiness&#xD;
      to discharge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knee replacement surgery has become increasingly more common in the United States with&#xD;
      hundreds of thousands of surgeries performed yearly across the country. Despite that, there&#xD;
      is no consensus &quot;standard of care&quot; for optimum pain control regimen after surgery. Pain&#xD;
      management after TKA ranges from local tissue injections and patient controlled anesthesia to&#xD;
      regional nerve blocks to neuraxial anesthesia. Although regional anesthesia has become more&#xD;
      common and widespread, there are wide variations depending on practice setting (academic&#xD;
      versus private), equipment available (adductor nerve blocks require ultrasound guidance),&#xD;
      level of training of the anesthesiologists and patient selection, among other factors.&#xD;
      Another part of the reason for the wide variations in practice is the lack of literature&#xD;
      demonstrating clear effectiveness or superiority of one technique over another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date adductor canal nerve blocks have been mainly studied in comparison with femoral nerve&#xD;
      blocks in terms of their efficacy in controlling pain and their ability to preserve motor&#xD;
      function. Adductor canal nerve blocks have been shown in the literature to be an effective&#xD;
      method for postoperative pain control in total knee replacement surgery. One of the unique&#xD;
      benefits of this particular technique is that the adductor canal nerve block is primarily a&#xD;
      sensory block, thereby controlling pain without impairing motor strength. This is useful for&#xD;
      total knee replacement surgery as pain is controlled while quadriceps muscle strength is&#xD;
      preserved. With well functioning muscles patients are able to fully participate in physical&#xD;
      therapy with less strength impairment and reduced risk of falling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is our aim to investigate one multimodal approach that combines the strengths of two&#xD;
      proven pain management techniques and thereby improve overall postoperative pain control and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction. Our hope is to establish a protocol that is safe and effective for&#xD;
      patient care.&#xD;

    <description>The visual analog scale (VAS) is a pain rating scale. Scores are based on self-reported measures of symptoms that are recorded with a single mark placed at one point along the length of a line that represents a continuum between the two ends of the scale-&quot;no pain&quot; on the left end of the scale (equal to a score of 0) and the &quot;worst pain&quot; on the right end of the scale (equal to a score of 100).</description>

    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) is widely used in the evaluation of Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis. It is a self administered questionnaire consisting of 24 items divided into 3 subscales: pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and physical function (17 items). The subscale scores can vary, with pain ranging from 0 to 20 points; stiffness, 0 to 8 points; and physical function, 0 to 68 points. Higher scores represent worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations. A sum of the scores for all three subscales yields a total WOMAC score.</description>

          <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) is widely used in the evaluation of Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis. It is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 24 items divided into 3 subscales: pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and physical function (17 items). The subscale scores can vary, with pain ranging from 0 to 20 points; stiffness, 0 to 8 points; and physical function, 0 to 68 points. Higher scores represent worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations. A sum of the scores for all three subscales yields a total WOMAC score.</description>

        <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) is widely used in the evaluation of Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis. It is a self administered questionnaire consisting of 24 items divided into 3 subscales: pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and physical function (17 items). The subscale scores can vary, with pain ranging from 0 to 20 points; stiffness, 0 to 8 points; and physical function, 0 to 68 points. Higher scores represent worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations. A sum of the scores for all three subscales yields a total WOMAC score.</description>

Adductor Canal Nerve Block Sham Catheter: Patients randomized to the sham catheter will have a chlorhexidine prep of the skin and ultrasound examination of the adductor canal on postoperative day #1. To minimize patient risk, a wooden applicator will be used to apply 10 seconds of pressure to the leg followed by catheter securing to the skin with the same tegaderm and paper tape dressing used on functional catheters. All catheters will be connected to infusion pumps with opaque plastic bags covering the pumps. The sham catheter pumps will not be turned on.&#xD;
