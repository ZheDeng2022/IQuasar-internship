    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of acupuncture for&#xD;
      the treatment of phantom limb syndrome in lower limb amputees and pilot an acupuncture&#xD;
      protocol. The study will be a comparative effectiveness study comparing acupuncture and&#xD;
      standard care versus standard care alone and will be a randomised controlled trial using a&#xD;
      mixed methods approach. The study hypothesis is a course of acupuncture will reduce the&#xD;
      symptoms of phantom limb syndrome in lower limb amputees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be based the Amputee Rehabilitation Unit, London. Twenty lower limb amputees&#xD;
      with phantom limb syndrome will be randomly assigned to either receive usual care or usual&#xD;
      care plus acupuncture. Acupuncture intervention will include 8 treatments over 4 weeks and&#xD;
      treatment will involve using both body and auricular acupuncture points. Usual care will&#xD;
      include physiotherapy, occupational therapy, pharmacological intervention and other&#xD;
      interventions as deemed appropriate by clinical staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An eleven point numerical rating scale will be the primary outcome measure in this study.&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will include the Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire 2, EQ-5D-5L,&#xD;
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, Insomnia Severity Index,&#xD;
      Participant Global Impression of Change and information will also be obtained on rescue&#xD;
      medication. A cheek swab will also be taken to explore potential subgroups of responders in&#xD;
      relation to the genetic polymorphism of the glucocorticoid receptor. Outcomes will be&#xD;
      recorded weekly for the duration of the study and one and three months post completion of the&#xD;
      study. In order to identify protocol acceptability and acceptability of outcome measures five&#xD;
      participants will be interviewed post completion of the study. Data will also inform&#xD;
      feasibility such as recruitment rate, completion rate and reasons for dropout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from this study will guide the development of a full randomised controlled trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The feasibility study will be a comparative effectiveness study. A randomised controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) using a mixed methods approach will be employed to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      acupuncture on phantom limb syndrome. The RCT will be an open pragmatic effectiveness trial,&#xD;
      of parallel and fixed size design with usual care control. It will be unstratified, with&#xD;
      balanced randomization (1:1). It will be conducted at the Amputee Rehabilitation Unit (ARU)&#xD;
      at Lambeth Community Care Centre, London, UK. Quantitative data will be collected using&#xD;
      standardised, validated outcome measures. Qualitative data will be collected post completion&#xD;
      of the study through one to one semi-structured interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty participants will be approached and recruited whilst they are inpatients at the ARU.&#xD;
      Those felt to meet the inclusion criteria will be identified by the key contact in the&#xD;
      rehabilitation team. Potential participants will then be approached by the researcher,&#xD;
      provided with verbal and written information about the study and be advised to take up to&#xD;
      seven days to consider if they wish to participate in the study or not. No consent will be&#xD;
      obtained at the time of providing information about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who consent to being involved in the study will be screened for eligibility and&#xD;
      if eligible will be randomly assigned into either, usual care plus acupuncture (group A) or&#xD;
      usual care only (group B). Randomisation and allocation concealment will be used to ensure&#xD;
      against selection bias. A computer generated random numbers table will be used in this study&#xD;
      and randomisation will be unstratified and balanced (1:1). Allocation concealment will be&#xD;
      implemented using sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. Randomisation and&#xD;
      allocation concealment will be generated by a researcher not directly involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the study is pragmatic all groups will receive usual care. Usual care will include both&#xD;
      medical intervention, physiotherapy / rehabilitation and any other intervention used at the&#xD;
      ARU. Group A will receive usual care and a standard course of acupuncture (as already agreed&#xD;
      with an expert panel of acupuncture practitioners). Group B will receive standard care only.&#xD;
      The acupuncture intervention in this study will be pragmatic but strict guidelines will be&#xD;
      adhered to within this pragmatic approach. These guidelines have been developed though&#xD;
      current literature and a Delphi study with acupuncture practitioners and consists of some&#xD;
      specific acupuncture points and points selected for that patient according to Chinese&#xD;
      diagnosis. Acupuncture guidelines include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using a combination of body and auricular acupuncture&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treating the opposite limb to amputation and possibly also the residual limb&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using auricular acupuncture points such as shen men, sympathetic, points corresponding&#xD;
           to the lower limb&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using body acupuncture points around the stump (depending on the health of the tissue&#xD;
           and the patient), mirroring local and distal points by needling them on the opposite&#xD;
           limb, and points on the lower back taking a segmental approach to dermatomal pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Including points such as; LI4 + LR3, LR3, GV20, SP10 and individual specific points&#xD;
           according to specific symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electro-acupuncture may be used&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retaining needles for 20-30 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treating twice weekly for four weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the commencement of the study group A and group B participant baseline demographic data&#xD;
      will be collected by the researcher and in group A, a full Traditional Chinese Medicine&#xD;
      Assessment will be completed by the acupuncture practitioner administering treatment. In both&#xD;
      groups initial outcome measures will also be completed at this time and a cheek swab taken.&#xD;
      For the duration of the study outcome measures will be collected once weekly from both groups&#xD;
      by the researcher. Outcome measures will also be collected one and three months post&#xD;
      completion of the study to assess long term effects of acupuncture intervention. At these two&#xD;
      time points participants will be posted questionnaires to complete and return to the&#xD;
      researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to identify protocol acceptability and acceptability of which outcomes are&#xD;
      meaningful to participants and would potentially demonstrate the impact of acupuncture in&#xD;
      future trials, five participants will be consulted post completion of the study. This phase&#xD;
      of the study will take a qualitative approach comprising of one off semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews. This approach was taken to allow participants time to develop accounts of issues&#xD;
      important to them with the aim of generating detailed data. If participants are still&#xD;
      inpatients at the ARU at time of interview the interviews will take place there. If&#xD;
      participants have been discharged the interview will take place in the participant's home or&#xD;
      at their follow up outpatient appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will test for within-patient and between group differences in measurements&#xD;
      taken at the beginning of the study, during the study, at the end and one month and three&#xD;
      months post completion of the study. An intention to treat approach will be taken. In order&#xD;
      to include missing data it will be imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of primary outcome measure (numerical pain rating scale): As the numerical rating&#xD;
      scale produces ordinal data, median and range values will be evaluated. Raw change and&#xD;
      percentage change will be calculated. A 95% confidence interval will be used in this study.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed to verify rejection of the null hypothesis with a P&#xD;
      value of 0.05 selected as indicative of statistical significance. As the data is ordinal and&#xD;
      of small sample size non-parametric tests will be used in analysis. (Non parametric tests&#xD;
      should be used on small sample sizes as under these conditions it is hard to see if data is&#xD;
      normally distributed). The non-parametric Mann Whitney U test will be used for analysis&#xD;
      between groups. Difference between baseline and last observation scores will be analysed&#xD;
      using Wilcoxon signed-ranks test. All analysis will be undertaken using SPSS Version 21&#xD;
      software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of secondary outcome measures: As all secondary outcomes produce ordinal data they&#xD;
      will be treated as the numerical rating scale reporting median and range values and using the&#xD;
      nonparametric tests as listed above. A P value of 0.05 will be considered indicative of&#xD;
      statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics: Categorical data (such as gender and ethnicity) will be shown as n&#xD;
      (%). As the study is small it is expected that data will not be normally distributed and&#xD;
      therefore continuous data (such as age and duration of PLSd) will be shown as median and&#xD;
      range values. Categorical baseline characteristics will be analysed using Fisher's exact test&#xD;
      (as the data is categorical / nominal and unrelated). Continuous data will be analysed using&#xD;
      the Mann-Whitney U test. As with the outcome measures a P value of 0.05 will be selected as&#xD;
      indicative of statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility Study Specific: Compliance with the protocol will be examined through number&#xD;
      counts on drop outs / nonattendance completion rates of outcome measures and deviation from&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data analysis: Framework analysis will be used to analyse data from the&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews. NVIVO 10 software will be used in data analysis. Data analysis&#xD;
      will be transparent, comparative and reflexive. Analysis will focus on the latent content of&#xD;
      the text. Transcripts will be read until the researcher is completely familiar with the data.&#xD;
      Data will be coded, and an analytical framework will be developed. Data will then be indexed&#xD;
      to the analytical framework, charted and mapped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting: Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines will be adhered to&#xD;
      when reporting. The STandards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture&#xD;
      (STRICTA) comprises of a checklist that expands the generic content of the CONSORT statement&#xD;
      to include information on acupuncture intervention and will also be used in this study.&#xD;
      Information will be recorded on style of acupuncture, reason for treatment provided, extent&#xD;
      to which treatment was varied, number of needle insertions per subject per session, names of&#xD;
      points used, depth of insertion, response sought, needle stimulation, needle retention time,&#xD;
      needle type (diameter, length, manufacturer or material), number of treatment sessions,&#xD;
      frequency and duration of treatment sessions, details of any other intervention administered&#xD;
      (e.g. lifestyle advise), settings and context of treatment, practitioners background, precise&#xD;
      description and rationale for control.&#xD;
