    <textblock>
      With medication, many individuals with psychosis experience a remission from hallucinations&#xD;
      and delusions, the most salient aspects of the disorders. However, alleviation of these&#xD;
      symptoms is not associated with recovery of everyday functioning in important areas like&#xD;
      working, socializing, maintaining the household, and recreational pursuits. The reason these&#xD;
      difficulties with functioning persist is that psychotic disorders are associated with&#xD;
      considerable difficulties with cognitive functions such as attention, memory, and planning.&#xD;
      Cognitive impairments persist even when the delusions and hallucinations are treated, and in&#xD;
      fact account for most of the persistent impairments in functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, psychological treatments called Cognitive Remediation have been developed and&#xD;
      tested in research settings, where techniques that train the brain to process information&#xD;
      more efficiently result in very large improvements in cognition. However, there are two major&#xD;
      hurdles remaining as investigators attempt to determine how this treatment can graduate from&#xD;
      research laboratories to become a widespread clinical treatment. First, cognitive remediation&#xD;
      in research settings is very intensive: it requires frequent visits with specialized&#xD;
      therapists who deliver the treatment to groups of patients. This makes it quite difficult for&#xD;
      people with psychosis, who might not have the financial means or motivation to travel and who&#xD;
      might be experiencing symptoms that make it unlikely that they will attend groups, to&#xD;
      participate fully if the traditional research techniques were directly transported to a&#xD;
      clinical setting. The second hurdle is that even though cognitive remediation improves&#xD;
      cognition, it does not always transfer to everyday behavior changes. Investigators recently&#xD;
      found that this transfer to functioning is more meaningful and durable when using additional&#xD;
      techniques that teach people skills such as being aware of your own thinking and to use&#xD;
      multiple, flexible problem solving strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to address these limitations by testing a new development in the&#xD;
      treatment: delivering cognitive remediation to participants in their homes, with cognitive&#xD;
      exercises and therapist support provided online. The techniques are the same as successful&#xD;
      in-session cognitive remediation, but those with psychosis can engage in the intervention at&#xD;
      home and therapists will be able to service more individuals with online discussion forums&#xD;
      and video demonstrations. The more people engage in cognitive remediation, the better the&#xD;
      outcomes. This is particularly true for receiving a consistent dose of exercise, rather than&#xD;
      in longer, once per week sessions typical of traditional psychotherapies. The online&#xD;
      component of this program provides patients with the ability to engage in a higher and more&#xD;
      consistent rate of exercises and skill development, and we will explore whether the amount&#xD;
      and continuity of engagement is associated with larger and broader improvements.&#xD;
