    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of steady state solifenacin and&#xD;
      mirabegron on the pharmacokinetics of co-administered steady state digoxin. This study will&#xD;
      also evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combined steady state administration of&#xD;
      solifenacin, mirabegron and digoxin.&#xD;

      This study is comprised of two study sequences with 2 investigational periods in each&#xD;
      sequence. There will be a wash-out period between each investigational period. Patients will&#xD;
      be admitted to the clinic until discharged after each investigational period.&#xD;
