    <textblock>
      Rationale: For resectable esophageal cancer the standard therapy is 5 weeks of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed by surgery 6-8 weeks afterwards. Surgery is performed&#xD;
      independent of the response to nCRT and is associated with substantial morbidity. A&#xD;
      pathological complete response (pCR) after nCRT is seen in 28-34% of patients. Pathological&#xD;
      non-responders (pNR) most probably do not benefit from nCRT but are exposed to its toxicity&#xD;
      and delay from surgical therapy inevitably occurs in this group. Early identification of&#xD;
      non-responders during nCRT would allow individualized decision making in continuation or&#xD;
      discontinuation of nCRT. Furthermore, a tool is desirable to accurately assess the treatment&#xD;
      response after nCRT to identify patients with a complete response. Studies in rectal cancer&#xD;
      reported that tumor resection could be omitted in patients with persisting clinical complete&#xD;
      response after 12 months. Also, in some esophageal cancer studies, complete responders in&#xD;
      surgical and non-surgical treatment groups had comparable overall survival. These findings&#xD;
      indicate the possibility to perform nCRT as sole treatment in patients with a complete&#xD;
      response. Conversely, if residual tumor is demonstrated, this will support the decision to&#xD;
      move to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Diagnostic study to assess the distinct and combined value of anatomical and&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and combined 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron&#xD;
      emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) in the evaluation of treatment response&#xD;
      to nCRT for patients with esophageal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Multi-center diagnostic study investigating the value of MRI and PET-CT in the&#xD;
      imaging before, during and after nCRT for assessment of response to nCRT for resectable&#xD;
      esophageal cancer. Imaging response measurements will be compared with the histopathological&#xD;
      tumor regression grade (TRG) of the resection specimen as gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 50 patients (&gt;18 years) presenting at the UMC Utrecht or M.D. Anderson&#xD;
      Cancer Center with resectable esophageal cancer, as determined by endoscopy and biopsy,&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), receiving nCRT prior to&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: In addition to the conventional diagnostic work-up for esophageal cancer including&#xD;
      a standard PET-CT before nCRT, two PET-CT scans will be performed during and after nCRT as&#xD;
      well as three MRI scans before, during and after nCRT at the same time points. The first MRI&#xD;
      (and standard-of-care PET-CT) scan session will be within the 6 weeks prior to the start of&#xD;
      nCRT. The second scan session will take place after 10-14 days after the start of nCRT. The&#xD;
      third and final scan session will be planned 1-2 weeks before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Determination of the distinct and combined diagnostic value&#xD;
      of anatomical and functional MRI and PET-CT in the evaluation of treatment response to nCRT&#xD;
      for patients with esophageal cancer. Important imaging parameters include apparent diffusion&#xD;
      coefficient (ADC) values, standardized uptake values (SUV) and volume measurements for the&#xD;
      different time points. The differences of these values between time points are of particular&#xD;
      interest (delta-ADC, delta-SUV, delta-volume). The sensitivity (%), specificity (%), negative&#xD;
      predictive value (%), positive predictive value (%), and accuracy (%) of the different&#xD;
      imaging parameters for correctly identifying histopathological complete response will be&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;

      Multi-center diagnostic study investigating the distinct and combined value of MRI and PET-CT&#xD;
      for response prediction before and response assessment during and after nCRT for esophageal&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be enrolled in two hospitals (UMC Utrecht and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center)&#xD;
      during their first outpatient visit at the Department of Surgery or Radiation Oncology. At&#xD;
      the UMC Utrecht, for study purposes three anatomical and functional MRI scans are made and&#xD;
      two PET-CT scans, in addition to a pre-nCRT PET-CT scan which is standard care. At M.D.&#xD;
      Anderson Cancer Center, for study purposes three anatomical and functional MRI scans are made&#xD;
      and one PET-CT scans, in addition to a pre-nCRT and a post-nCRT PET-CT scan which are&#xD;
      standard care. The MRI scan protocol will consist of anatomical and functional MRI scans. For&#xD;
      the dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) scans, a contrast agent will be administered to&#xD;
      the patient. All MRI scans will be performed on a 1.5-Tesla MRI scanner. For the PET-CT&#xD;
      scans, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the tracer that will be used for the assessment of&#xD;
      abnormal glucose metabolism in the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the start of nCRT, we schedule an MRIpre to have baseline MRI and PET-CT images in all&#xD;
      enrolled patients. This scanning day is matched to the irradiation treatment planning PET-CT&#xD;
      scan, which is routinely made for treatment planning purposes. Next, the patients receive&#xD;
      standard nCRT treatment with weekly administration of carboplatin (doses titrated to achieve&#xD;
      an area under the curve of 2 mg per milliliter per minute) and paclitaxel (50 mg per square&#xD;
      meter of body-surface area) for 5 weeks at UMC Utrecht and 6 weeks at M.D. Anderson Cancer&#xD;
      Center with concurrent radiotherapy (41.4 Gy in 23 fractions in Utrecht or 50.4 Gy in 28&#xD;
      fractions at M.D. Anderson, delivered 5 days per week on workdays). As mentioned in the&#xD;
      introduction, earlier studies reveal that both PET and DWI-MRI after 2 weeks of treatment&#xD;
      showed the best distinction between responders and non-responders. Therefore, we decided to&#xD;
      perform a PET-CTper and an MRIper scan two weeks after the start of the nCRT. Surgery will&#xD;
      follow 6-8 weeks after finishing nCRT and all patients will undergo a preoperative MRIpost&#xD;
      and PET-CTpost scan 1-2 weeks before surgery, combined with a standard preoperative&#xD;
      outpatient follow-up appointment. Overall, no extra hospital visits are asked from&#xD;
      participants as we try to schedule all study activities at days corresponding with&#xD;
      appointments for standard care. If in individual cases an extra visit to the hospital is&#xD;
      needed, travel expenses of this extra visit will be reimbursed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Important imaging parameters include apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values,&#xD;
      standardized uptake values (SUV) and volume measurements for the different time points. The&#xD;
      differences of these values between time points are of particular interest (delta-ADC,&#xD;
      delta-SUV, delta-volume). The sensitivity (%), specificity (%), negative predictive value&#xD;
      (%), positive predictive value (%), and accuracy (%) of the different imaging parameters for&#xD;
      correctly identifying histopathological complete response will be calculated. The resection&#xD;
      specimen will be evaluated meticulously according to standard protocol (tumor type and&#xD;
      extension, lymph nodes, resection margins), and additionally, findings of effects of nCRT&#xD;
      will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research population consists of patients with resectable esophageal carcinoma, scheduled&#xD;
      to receive preoperative chemoradiation according to the CROSS-regimen. The participants will&#xD;
      be recruited from the surgical outpatient clinic or radiation oncology department of the UMC&#xD;
      Utrecht or M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. In total 50 participants with available&#xD;
      histopathologic data of the resection specimen are required for this study.&#xD;
