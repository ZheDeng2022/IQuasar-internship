      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -(Degree)ystinosis is an inherited disease. If not treated correctly, it can cause muscle&#xD;
      wasting and weakness and kidney damage. Researchers want to learn if growth hormone (GH) can&#xD;
      help people with cystinosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To learn if GH treatment can slow or reverse muscle wasting and improve muscle strength in&#xD;
      people with cystinosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People 18 and older who are already enrolled in protocol 78-HG-0093.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be admitted to the clinic for eight 3 4 day visits, mostly four months&#xD;
           apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At each visit, participants will have a history and physical exam and give urine and&#xD;
           blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At month 0 or 13, participants will take tests that will be repeated at their 12- or&#xD;
           25-month visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will have an eye exam, medical consultations, and strength and movement tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will complete questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They may have tests of heart activity and lung function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will have ultrasound imaging of their arm and hand muscles. They will have a scan&#xD;
           of their legs while lying in a magnetic resonance imaging machine (a big metal&#xD;
           cylinder). They will have a DEXA bone scan (two X-ray beams measure body composition).&#xD;
           They will also swallow barium while X-ray imaging records the throat muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be randomly assigned to either receive or not receive GH for the first&#xD;
           12 months. Then, at month 13, if they received GH, they will switch for the next 12&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take GH as a daily injection. They will be taught how to give the&#xD;
           injections.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cystinosis is an autosomal recessive storage disorder due to defective transport of the amino&#xD;
      acid cystine out of cellular lysosomes. Cystine accumulation leads to cellular dysfunction in&#xD;
      most of organs and tissues. Available treatment with the cystine-depleting agent, cysteamine,&#xD;
      can prevent or delay organ damage, including that of muscles. In poorly treated patients,&#xD;
      however, a progressive vacuolar myopathy with muscle wasting beginning in the second decade&#xD;
      of life significantly debilitates some patients. Muscle biopsy demonstrates prominent&#xD;
      unrimmed vacuoles with small ring fibers but no evidence of endomysial inflammation. Plasma&#xD;
      and muscle carnitine deficiency, impairing mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism, might also&#xD;
      limit muscle energy production. Growth Hormone (GH) can potentially counter the muscle&#xD;
      wasting of cystinosis patients. It has consistently induced anabolic effects in patients in&#xD;
      malnourished or catabolic states, by enhancing the growth and development of bone, connective&#xD;
      tissue, viscera, fat, and musculoskeletal muscles. GH, at doses of approximately 0.006 to 0.1&#xD;
      mg/kg/day, has proven safe and effective in HIV/AIDS wasting, parenteral nutrition-dependent&#xD;
      short bowel syndrome, pediatric chronic kidney disease, and adult and pediatric GH-deficiency&#xD;
      states. The current protocol is a randomized (to treatment or no treatment) crossover&#xD;
      clinical trial to determine if GH (0.03 mg/kg/day) is beneficial for muscle wasting in&#xD;
      cystinosis. Patients are examined at the NIH Clinical Research Center every 4 months for 2&#xD;
      years. Change in muscle mass will serve as the primary outcome parameter, and rhGH&#xD;
      (Humatrope) will be provided by Eli Lilly. HumatropeR (somatropin) is currently approved by&#xD;
      the FDA for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment of children with short stature or growth failure associated with growth&#xD;
           hormone (GH) deficiency, Turner syndrome, idiopathic short stature, SHOX deficiency, and&#xD;
           failure to catch up in height after small for gestational age birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment of adults with either childhood-onset or adult-onset GH deficiency.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18-70 years, either gender&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of nephropathic cystinosis confirmed by leucocyte cystine levels&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of muscle involvement such as decrease of muscle mass, weakness or EMG&#xD;
             findings and/or documented abnormal swallowing study and PFT results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to travel to the NIH Clinical Research Center for admissions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Compliant with cysteamine treatment regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability of local medical follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        ENCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not able to self administer daily subcutaneous injections, or not able to identify a&#xD;
             family member/caregiver to administer them to you.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &lt;18&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric illness or neurological disease that interferes with compliance or&#xD;
             communication with health care personnel&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current malignancy or history of malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure &gt;180 systolic or &gt;95 diastolic)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Poor controlled hyperglycemia (fasting blood glucose level &gt;160)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine level &gt;1.8 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children are excluded because the critical issues of dosage and safety can be answered in&#xD;
        adults, and because children with cystinosis are rarely affected with the symptoms of&#xD;
        myopathy. Patients with chronic renal failure, treated with hemodialysis will not be&#xD;
        excluded from the study, as GH is not contraindicated for such patients. Patients received&#xD;
        renal transplants are not excluded from the study as GH treatment are not a&#xD;
        contraindication for such patients. Enrolled patients must be able to travel to the NIH in&#xD;
        case adverse events occur locally after discharge from the NIH Clinical Research Center.&#xD;
        Other medical exclusions will help to avoid the spurious assignation of side effects to&#xD;
        rhGH.&#xD;
