  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many older adults lack the skill of efficient wheelchair propulsion despite being the largest&#xD;
      cohort of wheelchair users. Inefficient wheelchair propulsion can lead to fatigue and overuse&#xD;
      injuries that can result in lost independent mobility. This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a new training strategy using a motor learning based approach to train&#xD;
      efficient wheelchair propulsion. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three&#xD;
      groups: 1) No practice; 2) Motor learning-based training; or 3) Practice (time-matched to&#xD;
      training). Potential improvements based on training will be explored for wheeling&#xD;
      biomechanical variables and energy efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis: We expect that the Training intervention will be superior to the Practice&#xD;
      intervention for improving the biomechanical and physiological efficiency of wheelchair&#xD;
      propulsion. It is also hypothesized that both the Training and Practice interventions will be&#xD;
      superior to no practice.&#xD;

      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculations resulted in a sample size of 10 participants for each of the three groups to&#xD;
      detect a significant difference with 80% power at a significance level of 0.05 (G*Power 3.1).&#xD;
      To account for missing data and loss to follow-up, the sample size was increased by 15% such&#xD;
      that each of the three groups will consist of 12 participants for a total of 36 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant honorariums:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will receive $15 for each of the three testing sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants randomized to either of the intervention groups (practice or training) will&#xD;
           receive $5/ visit (excluding the testing session) to partly compensate for their travel&#xD;
           cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment for Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants interested in participating in this study will be screened for eligibility over&#xD;
      the phone to ensure that they meet the age and weight requirements, do not have injuries to&#xD;
      the upper limbs, and that they understand the potential time commitment. Participants will be&#xD;
      told that they will need to fill out one questionnaire to confirm their eligibility when they&#xD;
      come in for their first appointment. Participants will complete the Mini Mental Exam after&#xD;
      providing informed consent to screen for cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics descriptive information (baseline):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables that are important in describing the participant population will be collected at&#xD;
      baseline including: age; height; sex; exposure to family members or friends that use a manual&#xD;
      wheelchair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical participant information (baseline, post-intervention, and two-weeks&#xD;
      post-intervention):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical variables that are required for the testing procedures or that may influence the&#xD;
      outcomes will be measured at each point of data collection, including: weight; grip strength;&#xD;
      upper limb joint flexibility; and self-perceived physical fitness rating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will be taken before intervention (baseline), four weeks and at 6 weeks&#xD;
      post-baseline. One trained assessor will administer all of the assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As participants are enrolled they will be randomly assigned to either the Motor&#xD;
      learning-based training, practice, or control groups by a randomization algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After providing informed consent and demonstrating approval to exercise by a physician-signed&#xD;
      copy of the Physical activity readiness medical examination (PARMED X) if over 69 y or the&#xD;
      Physical activity readiness questionnaire (PAR-Q+) if under 69 y, participants will complete&#xD;
      a demographics questionnaire including sex, height, weight, age, general fitness level, and&#xD;
      manual wheeling experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the questionnaires, participants will be fitted to an appropriately sized&#xD;
      Elevation wheelchair (Instinct Mobility, Vancouver, BC). Participants will be fitted so that&#xD;
      their elbows form an angle of approximately 100 degrees when their hands are placed at the&#xD;
      top of the wheel while they are seated in the wheelchair. To ensure consistency across&#xD;
      measurement points, details of the wheelchair fitting will be recorded and reproduced during&#xD;
      post-testing to minimize bias. The instrumented measurement wheel for collecting kinetic and&#xD;
      temporal variables (SmartWheel -Three Rivers Holdings, Mesa, AZ) will be exchanged with the&#xD;
      right wheel of the wheelchair and an inertia-matched dummy wheel will be applied to the left&#xD;
      side of the wheelchair. Tire pressure will be inflated to the recommended level of 100 psi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A drag test will then be performed to determine the drag force of the wheelchair-user system&#xD;
      on the treadmill (Max-Mobility). During the drag test, the participant will sit passively in&#xD;
      a fitted-laboratory wheelchair, which is connected by a rope to a force transducer. At a&#xD;
      constant speed (1.1 m/s or 4.0 km/h), the angle of the treadmill will be increased in 10&#xD;
      steps (by 0.5% grade), and at each angle, the drag force will be determined. These 10 force&#xD;
      measurements will be used to calculate the power output (PO) for each angle of inclination on&#xD;
      the treadmill. A linear regression will be used to determine PO (calculated by multiplying&#xD;
      the drag force with velocity according to PO (W) = drag force (N) · belt velocity (m/s)). The&#xD;
      drag test takes approximately 5 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety straps located on the sides of the wheelchair treadmill will be attached to the front&#xD;
      of the Elevation wheelchair (on the metal frame above the front caster wheels). Prior to the&#xD;
      data collection, participants will have five minutes to become acquainted with the wheelchair&#xD;
      treadmill and will gradually be brought up to the set velocity of 1.1 m/s (4.0 km/h) that&#xD;
      will be used for data collection. Previous research has used the speed of 1.1m/s for&#xD;
      biomechanical testing because it is the minimum speed required to cross some intersections in&#xD;
      the United States. To ensure that all participants perform the same amount of work for the&#xD;
      testing trials, the power output will be standardized to 0.15 W/kg at an incline of 0.7%&#xD;
      because an incline of 0.7% produced results most similar to over ground wheeling at speeds of&#xD;
      4-6 km/h. Resistance will be applied to the back of the wheelchair via a pulley system to&#xD;
      ensure that the PO is 0.15 W/kg. The oxygen cost of wheelchair propulsion is affected by the&#xD;
      PO, therefore standardizing the PO allows us to remove differences in drag force resulting&#xD;
      from differences in bodyweight and wheelchair configuration. Standardizing the PO also will&#xD;
      account for variations in participants' weight from pre-testing to post-testing to one-month&#xD;
      post-testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the participant is comfortable wheeling on the treadmill, the mouthpiece and nose plug&#xD;
      for the Parvo Medics' TrueOne 2400 metabolic measurement system will be fitted to the&#xD;
      individual. Ten minutes of baseline (resting state) data will be collected to ensure&#xD;
      participants are breathing normally (i.e., not hyperventilating) and their respiratory&#xD;
      exchange ratio value is appropriate (less than 0.9). Participants will then begin wheeling&#xD;
      with the speed gradually increasing to 1.1 m/s, once the achieved speed is reached&#xD;
      (approximately 15 s) the five minutes of data collection will begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kinetic and spatial-temporal characteristic:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the SmartWheel will be collected at 240 Hz using proprietary software and filtered&#xD;
      using a 4th order low-pass Butterworth filter with a cut-off frequency of 20 Hz. Variables&#xD;
      collected with the SmartWheel™ will include three dimensional forces, total force&#xD;
      (√(Fx2+Fy2+Fz2)), tangential force (force acting on forward propulsion), cadence (cycles/s),&#xD;
      push angle, and velocity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wheeling pattern Two Optotrak 3020 (NDI, Waterloo, ON) position sensors will be used to&#xD;
      record sagittal-plane 2D kinematic data of the position of the 3rd metacarpophalangeal joint.&#xD;
      The marker placed on the 3rd metacarpophalangeal joint will be used to define the wheeling&#xD;
      strategy for each subject. Kinematic data will be collected at a sampling frequency of 200&#xD;
      Hz. All data will be filtered using a fourth order, 7 Hz low-pass Butterworth filter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kinetic and kinematic wheeling data will be synchronized by an external trigger pulse,&#xD;
      divided into cycles based on initiation of force applied to the push rim, and normalized in&#xD;
      time to 100% of the cycle. Data from wheeling cycles that occur within the final 5th minute&#xD;
      will be averaged for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hand trajectory profiles of wheeling cycles that occur within the final 5th minute will be&#xD;
      used to categorize the wheeling pattern into one of four categories. Two investigators,&#xD;
      blinded to the participants group allocation will independently categorize the wheeling&#xD;
      strategies according to their definitions. Wheeling strategies will be compared between two&#xD;
      investigators to ensure consistency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor learning-based training intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor learning-based training will be administered by 1 trainer. She has over 6 years of&#xD;
      experience studying wheelchair propulsion and has experience providing other ML-based&#xD;
      training relating to manual and power wheelchair skills. Three trained volunteers will assist&#xD;
      with pre and post-testing as well as the one-month retention testing on a rotating schedule.&#xD;
      Volunteers will undergo 3 hours of training on the testing protocol. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to participate in 6 x 20 minute one-on-one training sessions over a 3 week period (2&#xD;
      sessions/ week). Six sessions have been selected because improvements in biomechanical&#xD;
      variables have been observed in as little as 12 minutes of training, however improvement in&#xD;
      movement efficiency of other continuous skills has been observed within 6 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The motor learning-based training will focus on some of the core concepts in the field of&#xD;
      motor learning. The motor learning concepts will include variable practice with respect to&#xD;
      speed, feedback (both intrinsic and extrinsic but focusing on extrinsic), feedback focusing&#xD;
      on three main variables (wheeling pattern, speed of hand when contacting push rim, push&#xD;
      angle), sequential learning (specifically relating to wheeling pattern), and mental imagery&#xD;
      (during the rest breaks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practice intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The practice intervention will be administered by 1 trainer. She has over 6 years of manual&#xD;
      wheelchair propulsion research experience. Participants will be asked to participate in 6 x&#xD;
      20 minute one-on-one training sessions over a 3 week period (2 sessions/ week). Six sessions&#xD;
      have been selected because improvements in biomechanical variables have been observed in as&#xD;
      little as 12 minutes of training, however improvement in movement efficiency of other&#xD;
      continuous skills has been observed within 6 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although general practice offers experience through exposure and the repetition obtained from&#xD;
      practice can be considered as an element of motor learning, it is important to determine if&#xD;
      there is an added benefit to one-on-one training with an emphasis on motor learning&#xD;
      principles over what an individual could perform on their own. It is anticipated that some&#xD;
      'motor learning' will occur during the practice intervention, however it is postulated that&#xD;
      it will occur to a lesser extent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor learning-based training and practice scheduling and equipment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the training will be held in Vancouver at the Blusson Spinal Cord Centre at&#xD;
      the Human Mobility Laboratory. The Blusson Spinal Cord Centre is a community-based facility&#xD;
      that has a spine medical clinic as well as several research labs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will not receive any training but will be tested at the same time points as&#xD;
      the intervention groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be provided with a brief overview of the practice or motor learning-based&#xD;
      training, depending on which of the two groups they are assigned to, after completing the&#xD;
      pre-testing. Participants will be informed that there is a 'motor learning-based training'&#xD;
      and 'control' group, however the fact that we are exploring two different types of training&#xD;
      will not be disclosed so that the practice group does not feel that their training is&#xD;
      inferior to the motor learning-based training group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the practice or motor learning-based training, participants will be asked&#xD;
      to complete an open-ended exit questionnaire about what they liked and disliked about the&#xD;
      training and whether they thought it would be useful for a new wheelchair user.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data synthesis and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive Statistics will be synthesized for demographic and physical information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of the motor learning-based training on the primary outcome (gross&#xD;
      mechanical efficiency as well as the secondary outcomes will be estimated using a 3 x 3 mixed&#xD;
      factorial repeated measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). An adjusted p-value will be used to&#xD;
      correct for multiple comparisons between baseline characteristics. A chi-square test will be&#xD;
      used to determine differences in the categorical variable (propulsion technique) pre and post&#xD;
      testing based on training exposure. Significance will be alpha = 0.05.&#xD;
