  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel method has been developed to expand natural (NK) cells and enhance their cytotoxicity&#xD;
      against cancer cells while maintaining low killing capacity against non-transformed cells. In&#xD;
      this method, donor NK cells are expanded by co-culture with the irradiated K562 cell line&#xD;
      modified to express membrane bound IL-15 and 41BB ligand (K562-mb15-41BBL). Expression of&#xD;
      these proteins in conjunction with unknown stimuli provided by K562 cells promotes selective&#xD;
      growth of NK cells. Then, the expanded NK cell population is depleted of T cells to prevent&#xD;
      graft versus host disease (GVHD). Expanded and activated NK cells showed powerful&#xD;
      anti-leukemic activity against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells in vitro and in animal&#xD;
      models of leukemia.Unpublished laboratory results also demonstrated that T-cell acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) is extremely sensitive to the cytotoxicity exerted by the&#xD;
      expanded and activated NK cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study represents the translation of the laboratory findings into clinical&#xD;
      application. The study proposes to determine the feasibility, safety and efficacy of infusing&#xD;
      expanded NK cells into patients who have AML or T-lineage ALL which is resistant to standard&#xD;
      therapy as demonstrated by persistent minimal residual disease (MRD). Patients with&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), who are at high risk to develop AML will also be eligible for&#xD;
      the study. In this patient cohort, the study will also investigate the in vivo lifespan and&#xD;
      phenotype of the expanded NK cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis to be tested in this study is that infusion of expanded activated NK&#xD;
      cells can produce measurable clinical responses in patients with AML or T-ALL.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 20 eligible subjects who will receive NK cell infusion to test whether&#xD;
      infusion of expanded activated NK cells can produce measurable clinical responses in patients&#xD;
      with AML/MDS or T-ALL.The study aims to infuse a target dose of 10 x 107 CD56+ cells/kg,&#xD;
      however, as the actual cell dose obtained will vary depending on the donor harvest, the&#xD;
      accepted range for cell infusion will be 0.5-20 x 107 CD56+ cells/kg. On day -10, eligible&#xD;
      donors (adult family member of recipient) will undergo apheresis once. A second apheresis&#xD;
      procedure may be needed to obtain the required cell count from the donor. NK cells will be&#xD;
      expanded in co-culture with irradiated (100 Gy) K562-mb15-41BBL cells in closed culture&#xD;
      containers for 10 days. Prior to NK cell infusion on Day 0, recipients will undergo screening&#xD;
      evaluations and will receive cyclophosphamide, Fludarabine, IL-2, and supportive medications&#xD;
      (e.g. mesna). Cytokine regimen of IL-2 will be initiated on the evening of day -1 (dose 1 of&#xD;
      6). IL-2 will be continued at a dose of 1 million units/m2 subcutaneously 3 times per week&#xD;
      for 2 weeks (6 doses total). Post-infusion follow-up procedures for up to 1 year from the day&#xD;
      of NK cell infusion include physical examination, Complete Blood Count, and&#xD;
      metabolic/chemistry studies. The effects of NK cell infusion will also be determined by&#xD;
      comparing MRD levels before and after treatment. MRD blood and bone marrow levels will be&#xD;
      collected at baseline and at specified time points (until 1 year from the day of NK cell&#xD;
      infusion). NK cell donors will be recruited from the family members of the patient recipient.&#xD;
      Potential donors aged 21 years old will be consented and will undergo the required screening&#xD;
      tests and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing. Since 20 eligible subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      as NK cell recipients, 20 donors will also be recruited for this study. Ineligible NK cell&#xD;
      donors will have to be replaced.&#xD;

    <description>Peripheral blood cell will be collected by apheresis from donors. Peripheral blood mononucleated cells will be cultured with irradiated K562-mb15-41BBL cells and low dose (10 IU/mL) IL-2 for 10 days. After T-cell depletion, expanded activated NK cells will be infused. Before infusion, patients will receive immunosuppressive therapy to promote temporary engraftment of NK cells. After infusion, they will receive IL-2 to support NK cell viability and expansion in vivo. The effects of NK cell infusion will be determine by comparing MRD levels before and after treatment.</description>

    <description>7 days of preparatory treatment are given before the NK cell infusion. Chemotherapy will be given over 6 days. This chemotherapy will promote donor NK cells engraftment. After which, a drug called Interleukin-2 (IL-2) will be given as an injection just under the skin three times per week for at least 2 weeks (total of 6 doses). This treatment is used to help keep the donor NK cells alive.&#xD;
Blood cells will be collected from an eligible and suitable family donor 10 days before infusion. The collection sample will be processed to remove red blood cells and as many T-cells as possible. T-cells from the donor might cause these donor cells to attack the body, usually the skin, liver, and intestines.&#xD;
NK cells will be activated in the National University Hospital lab and ready for infusion on Day 0.&#xD;
The NK cells will then be infused into the vein, through a peripheral catheter.</description>
