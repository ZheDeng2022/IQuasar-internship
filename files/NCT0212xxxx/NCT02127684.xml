  <brief_summary>

      The investigators would like to investigate the efficacy of more frequent treatment with&#xD;
      Lucentis for subjects with persistent diabetic macular edema despite standard dosing regimen.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, subject masked, phase II study of intravitreally administered&#xD;
      ranibizumab in subjects with persistent diabetic macular edema. Persistent diabetic macular&#xD;
      edema is defined as subjects who still have central subfield thickness on SD-OCT of greater&#xD;
      than 320 microns after having received at least 3 previous doses of AntiVEGF therapy in the&#xD;
      past 5 months. Consented, enrolled subjects will be randomized into two subgroups: (1)&#xD;
      standard dosing of monthly 0.3mg ranibizumab or (2) 0.3mg ranibizumab given 2 weeks apart for&#xD;
      5 doses followed by monthly dosing.&#xD;
