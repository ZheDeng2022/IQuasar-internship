    <textblock>
      Resveratrol, a compound found in red wine and dark-skinned grapes, will improve the function&#xD;
      of mitochondria (energy producing components) within the leg muscles of moderate functioning&#xD;
      older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will look at the role Resveratrol plays in improving physical function by&#xD;
      studying the connection of changes in mitochondrial function and changes in physical&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      An initial telephone screening indicated that the subject may be eligible to participate in&#xD;
      the study. The first study visit (&quot;Screening visit&quot;) will further determine if the subject is&#xD;
      eligible to participate. Should the subject be eligible to participate in the study, the&#xD;
      subject will be asked to participate in a daily resveratrol or placebo supplementation&#xD;
      program for approximately 90 days. The subject will also be asked to return to the clinic for&#xD;
      two additional assessment visits to monitor his/her safety and measure study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details regarding the tests to be conducted during this screening visit and other study&#xD;
      visits are described below. Visits will take place at the University of Florida Institute on&#xD;
      Aging (IOA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Screening Visit is approximately 1.5 to 2 hours and will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood Draw: The subject is asked to fast before the appointment because blood will be&#xD;
           collected during this visit. The investigator will collect approximately 2 tablespoons&#xD;
           of blood. The purpose of this blood draw is to determine levels of certain compounds in&#xD;
           the subject's blood that will help determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Questionnaires: The subject will be asked questions about medical history and&#xD;
           medications as well as mood and will also be asked to complete a short test of memory&#xD;
           and reasoning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Physical Measurements: measurements of the subject's height, body weight, waist&#xD;
           circumference, pulse, and blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Physical Exam: A licensed health care provider will perform a brief physical exam to&#xD;
           determine if it is safe to continue with the study. This exam will include a review of&#xD;
           medical history, medications, and measurement of height, blood pressure, radial pulse,&#xD;
           weight, and waist circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Tests of physical performance: The subject will be asked to complete tests of physical&#xD;
           ability that include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Walking at the usual pace for a distance of 13 feet (4 meters) two (2) separate&#xD;
                times&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The subject will be asked to go from a standing to a sitting position, without&#xD;
                using their arms. If the subject is able to perform this task, then they will be&#xD;
                asked to stand up from and sit down on chair five (5) times as fast as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Maintaining balance while standing in three (3) different positions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visit 1: Should the subject be eligible for the study, they will be asked to return&#xD;
      to the clinic for the first baseline study visit. This visit is expected to take 2 to 3 hours&#xD;
      and will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measurement of pulse and blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measurement of body weight and waist circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Collection of fasting blood samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Questions about the subject's health&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Tests of physical performance, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Walking as fast and far as the subject can for 6 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Walking at subject's usual pace for a distance of 13 feet (4 meters) two (2)&#xD;
                separate times&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Standing from a sitting position, without using their arms. If the subject is able&#xD;
                to perform this task, then they will be asked to stand up from and sit down on&#xD;
                chair five (5) times as fast as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Maintaining balance while standing in three (3) different positions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Assessment of lower-body muscle strength and endurance&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Physical Activity Monitor: The subject will also be asked to wear an armband physical&#xD;
           activity monitor during a typical seven day period to assess baseline physical activity&#xD;
           habits. The monitor will be returned at Baseline Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visit 2 will take approximately 2 hours and will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measurement of pulse and blood pressure before procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Muscle Tissue Sample: The procedure to collect muscle samples will be performed by a&#xD;
           licensed healthcare provider with experience conducting the procedure. The procedure&#xD;
           includes numbing a small area on the thigh with a local anesthetic and then using a&#xD;
           needle about the size of a pen to collect a small amount of muscle tissue approximately&#xD;
           equal to the size of the head of a pencil eraser.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the tissue sample is taken, the subject will receive detailed instruction on how&#xD;
           to care for the incision site. Several follow-up phone assessments will be made&#xD;
           inquiring about any problems that the subject may be experiencing related to the&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Measurement of pulse and blood pressure after procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Randomization: Subjects who are eligible and safe to continue with the study, will be&#xD;
           randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) resveratrol (1000 mg/day) (2)&#xD;
           resveratrol (1500 mg/day) or (3) placebo (vegetable cellulose).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The subject will be provided with a supply of the study drug capsules of at least 30&#xD;
           days and will be asked to return any remaining study drug capsules to the clinic at the&#xD;
           next appointment. Subjects will be asked to orally consume one study drug capsule&#xD;
           following each main meal (i.e. breakfast, lunch and dinner) with a glass of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30-Day &amp; 60-Day Visits last approximately 1 hour and include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Collection of fasting blood samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measurement of pulse and blood pressure&#xD;

&#xD;
      90-Day Visit 1 is similar to the Baseline 1 visit and will last approximately 2-3 hours. This&#xD;
      visit includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measurement of pulse and blood pressure&#xD;

&#xD;
        5. Counting of any remaining study drug capsules that were not taken since last visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Tests of physical performance, including:&#xD;

        7. The subject will receive an armband physical activity monitor to wear for seven days,&#xD;
           and will be asked to return this monitor at the 90-Day Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      90-Day Visit 2 will be similar to the Baseline 2 visit and will last approximately 1.5 to 2&#xD;
