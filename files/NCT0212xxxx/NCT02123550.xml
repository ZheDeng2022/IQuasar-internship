  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective controlled study examines the use of Doppler ultrasound as a means to screen&#xD;
      elective plastic surgery patients for the presence of deep venous blood clots both before and&#xD;
      after surgery. This is a noninvasive technique that is known to be both sensitive and&#xD;
      specific for the detection of deep venous thromboses in the lower extremities. This method&#xD;
      may make it unnecessary to select patients for prophylactic anticoagulation, which poses&#xD;
      additional risks to the patient.&#xD;

      Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigation of Deep Venous Thromboses in Elective Cosmetic Surgery Patients using Doppler&#xD;
      Ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background/Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous thromboembolism is a well-known and serious risk of surgery. In an attempt to reduce&#xD;
      the frequency of this postoperative complication, many plastic surgeons today elect to&#xD;
      anticoagulate patients deemed to be at higher risk.1 The efficacy and ethics of this&#xD;
      treatment have been challenged.2 Moreover, prophylactic anticoagulation poses additional&#xD;
      serious risks of its own, including increased bleeding and wound hematomas.2 It makes sense&#xD;
      to use a screening device to detect not just symptomatic cases but also subclinical deep&#xD;
      venous thrombosis so that treatment can be promptly initiated and patients without evidence&#xD;
      of blood clots can be spared the needless side effects of anticoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doppler ultrasound imaging represents a sensitive, direct, and noninvasive method to screen&#xD;
      for the presence of venous thromboses.3 This prospective study is undertaken to determine its&#xD;
      feasibility in the setting of outpatient plastic surgery. Doppler ultrasound imaging as a&#xD;
      screening tool for elective plastic surgery patients has not been previously published. This&#xD;
      test is added to the perioperative protocol, which is otherwise unchanged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hundred consecutive consenting adult men and women undergoing outpatient elective plastic&#xD;
      surgery under total intravenous anesthesia will be investigated using Doppler ultrasound&#xD;
      scans preoperatively, on the first day after surgery, and approximately 1 week after surgery.&#xD;
      Common operations included liposuction, abdominoplasty, facelifts, and cosmetic breast&#xD;
      surgery. In addition, 25 control patients (i.e., men and women not having surgery) will be&#xD;
      investigated at the same intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Terason t3200 Ultrasound System Vascular series images the deep veins of both lower&#xD;
      extremities. The veins evaluated with this imaging technique consist of the common femoral,&#xD;
      greater saphenous, superficial femoral, popliteal, and posterior tibial veins. Both color&#xD;
      Doppler flow and 2-dimensional compression tests (Duplex scans) are performed. The thickness&#xD;
      of the adipose layer is also measured and patient weights are recorded to check for any&#xD;
      possible correlations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical measures to reduce the risk of venous thrombosis include: (1) spontaneous breathing&#xD;
      without muscle relaxants, (2) no prone positioning in surgery, (4) sequential compression&#xD;
      devices, (4) movement of the lower extremities during surgery, and (5) outpatient treatment&#xD;
      with early ambulation.2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are cautioned that deep venous thrombosis (blood clots) are a known risk of surgery&#xD;
      and that they are to report any asymmetrical swelling of the lower extremities, thigh pain,&#xD;
      or fever to their surgeon immediately. Any patient with a positive scan is referred to a&#xD;
      local hospital for confirmation and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound scans are a safe, noninvasive, effective method to detect blood clots in the deep&#xD;
      veins of the lower extremities in plastic surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are informed as to the nature of the study and are told that their participation is&#xD;
      entirely voluntary and they are free to decline, and that doing so does not in any way&#xD;
      prejudice their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Risk&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no patient risk. The study does not affect patient treatment. It offers the&#xD;
      possibility of detection of sub-clinical deep venous thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of 2000 treated patients and 25 controls is anticipated.&#xD;
