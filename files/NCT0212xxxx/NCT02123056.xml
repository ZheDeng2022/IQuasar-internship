  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Syncope affects about 50% of Canadians, is the cause of 1-2% of emergency room visits, and&#xD;
      probably is responsible for CDN $250 million in health care spending each year. It is&#xD;
      associated with decreased quality of life, trauma, loss of employment, and limitations in&#xD;
      daily activities. The most common cause is vasovagal syncope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This occurs in people of all ages, and is a lifelong predilection. While the median number of&#xD;
      faints in the population is 2, those who come to the investigators care have a median 10-15&#xD;
      lifetime spells, and have an increased frequency in the year before presentation. Vasovagal&#xD;
      syncope is due to abrupt hypotension and transient bradycardia, which cause cerebral&#xD;
      hypoperfusion. The pathophysiology may be either failure of venous return or progressive&#xD;
      vasodilation, both due to inappropriately low sympathetic outflow. Sympathetic stimulation&#xD;
      might be involved early in the reflex cascade. There is no known medical treatment for&#xD;
      frequent fainting. The investigators performed the pivotal CIHR-funded randomized trials that&#xD;
      showed that neither permanent pacing, beta blockers, nor fludrocortisone help the majority of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However 3 observational studies suggested that beta blockers prevent syncope in older&#xD;
      subjects, and the Prevention of Syncope Trial (POST1) showed in a prespecified, -stratified&#xD;
      analysis that patients ≥42 years tended to benefit. The investigators recent meta-analysis&#xD;
      showed a benefit from metoprolol in these patients, with a hazard ratio of 0.52 (CI 0.27 to&#xD;
      1.01), and an age-specific response to beta blockers (p = 0.007). These results suggest the&#xD;
      need for a randomized clinical trial of metoprolol for the prevention of vasovagal syncope in&#xD;
      older subjects. Accordingly,the investigators conducted a poll of 48 cardiologists and&#xD;
      neurologists in Canada and abroad: 98% stated that a randomized trial was necessary, and 92%&#xD;
      agreed to participate in such a trial. Separately, this study emerged as the first choice for&#xD;
      syncope randomized trials after consultation with Canadian and international experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine if treatment with metoprolol in patients ≥40 years old with moderate&#xD;
      to severely frequent vasovagal syncope will better suppress syncope recurrences than placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This will be a longitudinal, prospective, parallel design, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled during a recruitment period of 4 years and followed for a fixed&#xD;
      period of 1 year. Subjects will have had ≥1 faint in the previous year, and a diagnosis of&#xD;
      vasovagal syncope based on a quantitative diagnostic score. They will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either metoprolol or placebo at an initial dose of 50 mg bid. Dose adjustments will&#xD;
      be made according to treating physician discretion to optimize tolerance and compliance while&#xD;
      maximizing dose. The primary outcome measure will be the time to the first recurrence of&#xD;
      syncope (after a 2 week dose titration wash-in period) over the 1-year observation period.&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Secondary analyses&#xD;
      will include an on-treatment analysis, as well as analyses comparing syncope and presyncope&#xD;
      frequency, number needed to treat, quality of life, impact of syncope on daily living, and&#xD;
      cost from the perspective of the publicly funded health care system. The investigators will&#xD;
      enroll 248 patients to have an 85% power to detect a reduction (p&lt;0.05) in the primary&#xD;
      outcome from 50% (placebo group) to 30% (midodrine group), a 40% relative risk reduction.&#xD;
      This sample size also allows for a 11% rate of subject dropout with loss to follow-up before&#xD;
      a syncopal event. The University of Calgary Syncope Clinic has a well-functioning clinical&#xD;
      trial apparatus that successfully completed the randomized, multicenter Prevention of Syncope&#xD;
      Trials (POST1: metoprolol for vasovagal syncope; POST2: fludrocortisone for vasovagal&#xD;
      syncope) and SIRCAT (Statin-Induced Reduction of Cardiomyopathy Trial). Enrolment is underway&#xD;
      in the CIHR-funded POST3 (pacing versus loop recorders in syncope patients with bifascicular&#xD;
      block) and POST4 (midodrine for vasovagal syncope). Study centres that were highly productive&#xD;
      in POST1-4 have agreed to participate. The investigators therefore will have ample syncope&#xD;
      enrolling centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: This study will provide evidence to inform the use of metoprolol in the treatment&#xD;
      of moderate to severely frequent syncope in older patients with vasovagal syncope. Given the&#xD;
      lack of any other conventional medical therapy the investigators expect it to have rapid&#xD;
      impact on care.&#xD;
