    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of a novel combination of&#xD;
      agents, enzalutamide and everolimus, for the treatment of patients with metastatic&#xD;
      castrate-resistant prostate cancer who have never received prior chemotherapy, or who have&#xD;
      previously received docetaxel chemotherapy and have progressive disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase I study with an expansion cohort, in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) who are chemotherapy-naive or have&#xD;
      previously received docetaxel chemotherapy and have progressive disease at the time of study&#xD;
      entry. The dose escalation phase of this study will establish the optimum daily dose of&#xD;
      everolimus that can be delivered along with a standard daily dose of enzalutamide to patients&#xD;
      with metastatic CRPC. Eligible patients must have evaluable (elevated PSA) or measurable&#xD;
      disease (per RECIST v1.1). Following completion of the dose escalation phase, an additional&#xD;
      cohort of patients will be treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to give preliminary&#xD;
      information regarding the efficacy of this combination.&#xD;

    <description>MTD will be determined by testing increasing doses of everolimus with standard dose enzalutamide in 3-patient dose escalation cohorts. The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which ≤1 of 6 patients experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during 1 cycle (28 days) of therapy, assessed according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0.</description>

             prior to the first dose of study drug. For investigational drugs for which 5&#xD;
             half-lives is less than 21 days, a minimum of 10 days between termination of the&#xD;
             investigational drug and administration of study drug is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Most recent chemotherapy ≤21 days from first dose of study treatment and/or patient&#xD;
