  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tranexamic acid is a relatively safe medicine that is used to help the body develop clots and&#xD;
      slow down bleeding after large surgeries. While it has already been shown to work well in&#xD;
      adults and older children, there is no information on whether it works, and how it works in&#xD;
      children younger than 6 months old. The goal of our study is to try and understand whether&#xD;
      and how tranexamic acid works in children younger than 6 months old who are having open heart&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to study tranexamic acid by testing its effect when compared with a placebo. The&#xD;
      investigators will use a method called randomization - which means patients who agree to be&#xD;
      in the study will be entered into a computer. The computer will randomly assign them to&#xD;
      either receive the medicine or the placebo. We will then compare effects on the 2 groups of&#xD;
      patients. Our goal is to have 50 patients in each group, or 100 patients total. We will not&#xD;
      know whether patients receive tranexamic acid or placebo until we review the data collected&#xD;
      at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tranexamic acid is usually given to patients in the operating room during open heart surgery.&#xD;
      During open heart surgery patients require cardio-pulmonary bypass which is a machine that&#xD;
      replaces the function of the heart and lungs for a short period of time. This allows surgeons&#xD;
      to do surgery on the heart itself without having to worry about it moving during the&#xD;
      operation. The bypass machine has lots of tubes to carry the blood around it. When blood&#xD;
      comes into contact with the tubing it has a tendency to clot. To prevent this patients are&#xD;
      given a blood thinner called heparin. Although heparin prevents clotting in the bypass&#xD;
      machine, it can also increase the risk of bleeding when the surgery is over. To reduce this&#xD;
      risk patients are given another medicine at the completion of surgery called protamine to try&#xD;
      and reverse the effect of the blood thinner, heparin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even so bleeding remains a significant problem, especially for babies after open heart&#xD;
      surgery. Being on the bypass machine and having a lot of suture (stitches) lines increase&#xD;
      that risk. In addition, the bypass machine affects the function of platelets, the main&#xD;
      component of the body's clotting system. We often have to replenish blood products after&#xD;
      surgery to try and stop the bleeding. Some centers, including we , have used the medicine&#xD;
      tranexamic acid to try and help with bleeding after surgery. There have been other studies&#xD;
      that show it helps with fibrinolysis, which is another important part of the body's clotting&#xD;
      system. However, that part of the clotting system is not well developed in infants and&#xD;
      therefore likely does not play an important role in preventing bleeding in that age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, it may be that tranexamic acid impacts platelet function as well, and it is that&#xD;
      effect that helps decrease post-operative bleeding in infants younger than 6 months. This has&#xD;
      not been previously studied. In order to study the effect that tranexamic acid has on&#xD;
      platelets the investigators are proposing the investigators' research trial. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to randomize patients to either receive tranexamic acid or placebo in the&#xD;
      operating room as described above. The investigators will then draw a small amount of blood&#xD;
      from each patient (total of approximately 1 tablespoon) and send it to a special lab for&#xD;
      testing of platelet function. The lab test will help us understand whether the platelets&#xD;
      function better when patients receive tranexamic acid instead of placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also be monitoring other outcomes related to platelet function. These&#xD;
      will include how much bleeding patients have after surgery when they are in the intensive&#xD;
      care unit, and how much blood products they require to treat that bleeding. The investigators&#xD;
      will also monitor labs that are checked routinely in all patients after open heart surgery.&#xD;
      The investigators will also track how long it takes each patient to get off the ventilator&#xD;
      and how long they spend in the ICU after surgery. All of this data will help us understand&#xD;
      whether tranexamic acid makes a positive impact on outcomes after open heart surgery in&#xD;
      infants less than 6 months old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard of care is quite variable within our institution as well as at other&#xD;
      institutions. Some anesthesiologists use tranexamic acid while others elect not to. There is&#xD;
      no definitive guideline to its current use. The dosing differs from center to center, and&#xD;
      there are some centers that do not use it at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' hope is that the results of this study will help us understand the role&#xD;
      tranexamic acid plays in preserving the function of platelets after open heart surgery in&#xD;
      young infants, and whether that impact translates into improved outcomes for those patients.&#xD;
      Based on the results of our research we hope to develop definitive guidelines for the use of&#xD;
      tranexamic acid in the population of infants &lt;6 months old undergoing open heart surgery.&#xD;
