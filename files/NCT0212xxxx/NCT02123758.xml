  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate potential drug-drug interaction (DDI) between&#xD;
      JNJ-56021927 and abiraterone acetate and between JNJ-56021927 and prednisone, determine&#xD;
      safety of the combination and evaluate in a descriptive manner the efficacy in these&#xD;
      participants. It will also, potentially provide dosing recommendations for abiraterone&#xD;
      acetate in future studies when combined with JNJ-56021927.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label (participants will know the identity of study drug&#xD;
      received) study in participants with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC).&#xD;
      The study is a single sequence design (ie, all participants will take abiraterone acetate +&#xD;
      prednisone [AAP] once daily on Days 1-7 of Treatment Cycle 1 and then proceed with combined&#xD;
      daily intake of AAP+JNJ-56021927 from Treatment Cycle 1, Day 8 through to the end of&#xD;
      treatment [ie, for up to an expected duration of approximately 18 months] and will be&#xD;
      conducted as two cohorts (group of participant's). The study will consist of a 28-day&#xD;
      screening phase to determine eligibility, an open-label treatment phase consisting of 28-day&#xD;
      treatment cycles, and a 30-day follow-up phase for collection of adverse events (AE) after&#xD;
      last dose of study drug. Participants will have blood samples collected during the study to&#xD;
      evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety, and antitumor activity (PSA). Participant safety will also&#xD;
      be monitored by the collection of adverse events. Imaging assessments for disease evaluation&#xD;
      will be planned at discretion of the Investigator. Once all participants have completed study&#xD;
      treatment up to Cycle 3 Day 1, a data cutoff is planned to evaluate the short term safety&#xD;
      profile of the combination and to complete the PK analysis up to the cutoff date. All&#xD;
      participants will continue on study (ie, to receive treatment) until disease progression,&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, or the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity. The end&#xD;
      of the study is defined when all participants have completed treatment. Participant's safety&#xD;
      will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
