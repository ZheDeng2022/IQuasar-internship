  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The accumulation and maturation of oral biofilm in the gingival margin is widely recognised&#xD;
      to be the primary aetiological factor in the development of chronic gingivitis. Based on this&#xD;
      association, the current treatment of gingivitis is focused on biofilm disruption, which will&#xD;
      normally include mechanical processes, both professionally and at home. However, for&#xD;
      patients, it is not easy to achieve a proper level of plaque control. The efficient plaque&#xD;
      control techniques are very time consuming and require a special motivation and skills for&#xD;
      their optimum use. It was at this point where mouthwashes become important, due to the fact&#xD;
      that they include diverse types of antimicrobial agents to complement the results of&#xD;
      mechanical oral hygiene measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chlorhexidine is considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; of oral antiseptics; nevertheless it has not&#xD;
      been recommended for long periods of time due to its well-known secondary effects. All of&#xD;
      these inconveniences have limited its acceptability among dental professionals and users; in&#xD;
      contrast, however, are the exceptional antiseptic properties, promoting the interest of&#xD;
      researchers in other alternative antiplaque agents. Mouthwashes containing essential oils in&#xD;
      their formulation have received a lot of attention. Their antiplaque activity has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in numerous clinical studies, in which they were used in conjunction with&#xD;
      mechanical oral hygiene measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve a better understanding of the clinical effects that antimicrobial agents&#xD;
      produce in the interior of the biofilm, it is necessary to apply a methodology in which the&#xD;
      biofilm grows directly in the interior of the oral cavity but its three dimensional structure&#xD;
      is not distorted by manipulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the in situ antiplaque effect of 2 antimicrobial agents&#xD;
      (essential oils formulation and 0.2% chlorhexidine) in the short term with a posterior&#xD;
      analysis on &quot;non-destructured&quot; biofilm with Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope combined with&#xD;
      fluorescence staining.&#xD;

      The volunteers wore two individualised splint which was capable of holding 6 glass disks (6&#xD;
      mm in diameter, 1 mm thickness); this was polished at 800 grit. . These splints are formed of&#xD;
      2 sheets, an internal 1 mm soft vinyl sheet where the disks are attached and an external 1 mm&#xD;
      rigid one made of polyethylene terephtalate that is fenestrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Mouthwash protocol During the 96 hour (4 days) duration of each course of study, each&#xD;
      volunteer wore the splints with the glass disks, withdrawing them from the oral cavity only&#xD;
      during meals (they were stored in an opaque container in humid conditions) and to perform&#xD;
      oral hygiene procedures, using only the mechanical removal of bacterial plaque with water,&#xD;
      without the use of any toothpaste or mouthwash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the permitted mechanical oral hygiene measures (without the splints), the volunteers&#xD;
      performed the following protocols based on the manufacturers' instructions, with the splints&#xD;
      in the oral cavity, during the 4 days in the morning (8.30) after breakfast and at night&#xD;
      (22.00) after dinner:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) 20 ml rinses for 30 seconds with essential oils/2 times daily. ----14 days---- B) 10 mL&#xD;
      rinses for 30 seconds with 0.2% chlorhexidine/2 times daily. ----14 days---- C) 20 mL rinses&#xD;
      for 30 seconds with sterile water (negative control). Using an internet-based balanced&#xD;
      randomisation system, indicating the mouthwash that each subject would use first, second and&#xD;
      third, all volunteers performed the 3 rinsing cycles, with a rest period of 14 days between&#xD;
      each test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Collection of the samples of Plaque like-biofilm Sample collection was done individually at&#xD;
      8 am in the morning, so that the samples of each volunteer were analysed on different days.&#xD;
      It was determined that a minimum of 10 hours should have elapsed since the last mouthwash on&#xD;
      the previous night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the glass disks were removed from the splint, they were immediately immersed in 100 µL of&#xD;
      fluorescence solution LIVE/DEAD® BacLight™ and kept in a dark chamber at room temperature for&#xD;
      15 minutes. Microscopic observation was performed by a single investigator who was unaware of&#xD;
      the study design, using a Leica TCS SP2 laser scanning spectral confocal microscope (Leica&#xD;
      Microsystems Heidelberg GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) with an HCX APOL 63x/0.9 water-immersion&#xD;
      lens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Processing of the samples of Plaque like-Biofilm Four selected fields or XYZ series in the&#xD;
      central part of each disk were evaluated. These fields were considered representative of the&#xD;
      whole sample after the observer's general examination. Fluorescence emission was determined&#xD;
      in a series of XY images in which each image corresponded to each of the Z positions (depth).&#xD;
      The optical sections were scanned in 1 µm sections from the surface of the biofilm to its&#xD;
      base, measuring the maximum thickness of the field and subsequently the mean thickness of the&#xD;
      biofilm of the corresponding sample. The maximum thickness of biofilm field was defined as&#xD;
      the distance between the substrate (in perpendicular) and the peaks of the highest cell&#xD;
      clusters. The maximum biofilm thickness of each field was divided into 3 zones or equivalent&#xD;
      layers: outer layer (layer 1), middle layer (layer 2) and inner layer (layer 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The capture of the data was done with the same settings in all cases. The spatial scan mode&#xD;
      (XYZ) and the 1024x1024 pixels scan format resolution were used. The Argon-ion and DPSS laser&#xD;
      were used at a 13% and 78% of maximum intensity, respectively. The values for the pinhole,&#xD;
      zoom and scan speed were 121.58 microns, 1 and 400Hz, respectively. The only values that were&#xD;
      different depending on the sample were the offset (range between -1% to 1%) and PMT gain&#xD;
      which was different for channel red and green, being in general terms, higher for green than&#xD;
      for red (test and positive control), due to the fact that there was more presence of green&#xD;
      than red signal, being for the negative control the opposite. These values were always&#xD;
      adjusted to get a good quality capture without background noise, avoiding excessive&#xD;
      saturation of the brightest pixels of the image. As the technician was blind to the&#xD;
      experiment, they were advised to make the adjustments always consistent with what was seeing&#xD;
      by the objective of the microscope, obtaining an image which was the closest as possible to&#xD;
      reality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantification of bacterial vitality in the series of XY images was determined using&#xD;
      cytofluorographic analysis (Leica Confocal Software). In this analysis, the images of each&#xD;
      fluorochrome were defined as &quot;channels&quot; (SYTO 9 occupies the green channel and propidium&#xD;
      iodide the red channel). Square capture masks were used to measure the area occupied (µm2) by&#xD;
      the pixels in each channel, determining the total area occupied by the biofilm and the&#xD;
      corresponding percentage of vitality. The intensity ranges that were considered as positive&#xD;
      signal were between 100 and 255. Determination of the mean percentage of bacterial vitality&#xD;
      in each field required sections with a minimum area of biofilm of 250 µm2, and the mean&#xD;
      percentage of bacterial vitality of the biofilm was calculated for the corresponding sample&#xD;
      and for each biofilm layer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For quantification of the percentage of surface substrate covered by the biofilm (covering&#xD;
      grade), the cytofluorogram itself was used. From the maximum projection (superposition of all&#xD;
      planes captured) of each of the analysed fields, the percentage of covering grade was&#xD;
      obtained by calculating the sum of the bacterial mass (vital and non-vital) in regard to the&#xD;
      total surface of the field (% positive within total area).&#xD;
