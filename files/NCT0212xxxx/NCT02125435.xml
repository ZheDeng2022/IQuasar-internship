    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK)&#xD;
      of single ascending intravenous (IV) doses of ASP2408 in non-elderly, healthy male and female&#xD;
      subjects and to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of ASP2408.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is single-dose escalation study composed of 8 sequential cohorts of healthy subjects&#xD;
      receiving increasing doses of intravenously administered ASP2408 or matching placebo.&#xD;
      Subjects will be confined in the clinic for 8 days.&#xD;
