    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DTMS compared to sham&#xD;
      treatment as an aid to smoking cessation in chronic, heavy (&gt;10 cigarettes/day) cigarette&#xD;
      smokers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi center, randomized, double blind study to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the device as an aid to smoking cessation. Treatment will be administered&#xD;
      over a 6 week period and follow-up assessments will be conducted at 4 months. The clinical&#xD;
      study design includes multiple measurements of safety and effectiveness parameters. The&#xD;
      design is meant to demonstrate that the device shows superiority compared to sham treatment&#xD;
      over six treatment weeks, at the 4 months follow up.&#xD;
