  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI&#xD;
      1060469 in healthy male and female subjects after oral administration of repeated rising&#xD;
      doses of 3 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg and 250 mg qd. of 1 day followed by 14 days and in&#xD;
      asthmatic male and female patients after oral administration of repeated rising doses of 25&#xD;
      mg and 150 mg qd of 1 day followed by 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are the exploration of the pharmacokinetics (PK) including dose&#xD;
      proportionality, dose linearity after single and multiple dose segments, pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      (PD) of BI 1060469 and to describe the PK/PD relationship.&#xD;
