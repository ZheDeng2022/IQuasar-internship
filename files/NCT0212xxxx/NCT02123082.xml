  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urolithiasis (kidney stones) is a common disease process affecting people all across the&#xD;
      world. Usually, if the stone size is small, it is able to pass through the urinary system and&#xD;
      exit the bladder on its own with no treatment. However, when the size of the stone is bigger,&#xD;
      it can get trapped in the kidney or the ureter, causing significant pain for the patient and&#xD;
      potentially obstructing urine flow. If this occurs, surgical treatment is necessary for the&#xD;
      removal of the stone. The surgical procedure often employed involves the use of a&#xD;
      ureteroscope, which is a device that includes a camera and channels for working instruments&#xD;
      such as a grasper and laser fiber to be placed during a procedure. Ureteroscopes that are&#xD;
      currently in use are flexible and have the ability to treat stones that may otherwise be&#xD;
      inaccessible in the kidney. Most flexible ureteroscopes in clinical use currently only have&#xD;
      one channel therefore only allowing one instrument to be used at a time. Recently, a new type&#xD;
      of ureteroscope has been introduced in the market that offers the advantage of having two&#xD;
      working channels where two instruments can be inserted for use during stone treating&#xD;
      procedure. This can potentially decrease procedure time for patients affected by kidney&#xD;
      stones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research is to compare the efficacy and safety of the ureteroscopes that&#xD;
      have only one channel for instrument insertion with the newer ureteroscope that has two&#xD;
      channels for utilization during stone treatment.&#xD;

      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be prospective, multi-institutional randomized controlled trial comparing&#xD;
      single lumen and dual lumen ureteroscopes. Specifically, a new double-lumen ureteroscope will&#xD;
      be compared in a multicenter trial with the currently existing single-lumen ureteroscopes in&#xD;
      patients undergoing ureteroscopy for stones in the kidney and ureter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Recruitment and Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients presenting to the Department of Urology at University of California, Irvine,&#xD;
      University of Toronto and North Shore-LIJ Health System requiring a flexible ureteroscopy for&#xD;
      treatment of their kidney or ureteral stone disease will be approached for enrolment in the&#xD;
      study, assuming the inclusion and exclusion criteria detailed below are met. After discussion&#xD;
      of the study with potential participants, interested parties will be given a copy of the&#xD;
      consent form. The investigator will review and explain the consent form with the potential&#xD;
      subject. All information about the study will be provided. Ample time will be given for&#xD;
      individuals to ask questions regarding participation and to have questions answered prior to&#xD;
      signing the consent form. If so desired, those interested will be given a copy of the consent&#xD;
      form to take home so that they may have the opportunity to discuss participation further with&#xD;
      family and/or advisors. If an individual chooses to enroll, the consent form will be signed&#xD;
      before procedure begins. Once an individual joins the study and informed consent is obtained,&#xD;
      the subject will receive a signed copy of the consent form. Individuals may chose not be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study or may withdraw from the study at any time without repercussions to&#xD;
      subsequent care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients agreeing to participate in the study will be randomized on the day of surgery.&#xD;
      Stratified block randomization will be utilized to balance the number of patients with&#xD;
      different stone sizes (&gt;1cm, &lt;1cm), kidney, proximal and distal ureteral stones between the&#xD;
      two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device description&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Wolf Cobra Richard (Wolf Endoscopy, Vernon Hills, IL), a dual-lumen flexible ureteroscope&#xD;
      is currently the only existing device with two working channels utilized in the operating&#xD;
      room. Wolf Cobra has a shaft size of 9.9F. Each of the Cobra's two channels is 3.3 F in size&#xD;
      (smaller compared with regular ureteroscopes 3.6F) but give a larger total cross-sectional&#xD;
      area when two combined together. Atraumatic 6 Fr. distal tip dilates to a 9.9 Fr. sheath for&#xD;
      ease of entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dual-channel ureteroscope may provide several advantages. Having additional working channel&#xD;
      enables better irrigation than a single-channel ureteroscope. It is achieved by continuous&#xD;
      inflow and outflow, which might significantly, improve intraoperative visualization and&#xD;
      maintains a clear field of view by efficient cleaning of blood, debris, and stone, even when&#xD;
      utilizing multiple instruments simultaneously. Usually, multiple passes with different&#xD;
      instruments requires the surgeon to reposition the ureteroscope in order to change the&#xD;
      instruments which can potentially reduce efficiency and increase the length of operative&#xD;
      time. The second working channel will allow the surgeon to use multiple instruments&#xD;
      simultaneously while maintaining the flow and efficiently treat the stone or other pathology&#xD;
      (Figure 1). This feature may offer technical advantages&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperatively, all patients will undergo a diagnostic imaging (CT, KUB, US) to identify the&#xD;
      stone burden and location. Follow up imaging will be standardized across all participating&#xD;
      institutions and will include CT or KUB imaging after the procedure to identify residual&#xD;
      stones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study will be the procedure time (minutes). This will be measured&#xD;
      from the start of the endoscopic access to the end of the procedure including complete&#xD;
      fragmentation and stone fragment removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will also be recorded and serve as the secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Stone clearance rate (Will be defined by URS and postoperative imaging)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Total ureteroscopy time&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stone fragmentation time (this time will be recorded from start of first lithotripsy&#xD;
           till complete stone fragmentation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Stone clearance time&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Overall procedure time (including positioning, URS procedure, extubation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Requirement for a second procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Intraoperative complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Immediate postoperative complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Postoperative complications within 30 days of the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Surgeon's opinion and comfort (rank from 1-10?)&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Visibility using a questionnaire or rank from 1 to 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Ureteroscope durability&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, patient demographics and clinical characteristics such as age, gender, Charlson&#xD;
      comorbidity index, ASA, BMI, previous medical and surgical history will be collected. Stone&#xD;
      characteristics such as size, location, density (HU) will be recorded. For each patient,&#xD;
      three (width, length and depth) largest diameters of the stone will be measured from&#xD;
      preoperative CT and volume will be calculated for accurate stone measurements. All&#xD;
      preoperative and postoperative outcomes will be compared based on the stone characteristics&#xD;
      such as size, location and type of stone (HU)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deflection Angles&#xD;
&#xD;
      New single lumen and double lumen ureteroscopes will be used for the purpose of this study.&#xD;
      To avoid any confounding factors, these scopes will be used exclusively on patients who are&#xD;
      involved in the trial. Every week each ureteroscope will be assessed for maximal deflection,&#xD;
      which is defined as the angle between the tangents of the deflection point and the tip of the&#xD;
      ureteroscopes, as described by Monga and Parkin9,10. In order to calculate the angle, a&#xD;
      photocopy of the ureteroscope while in maximal deflection will be taken. Both upward and&#xD;
      downward angles of deflections will be measured three times and the mean value will be&#xD;
      subsequently calculated for each type of ureteroscope prior to first usage. These&#xD;
      measurements will be performed after each week of usage. After the last case of the study,&#xD;
      the maximal angle of deflection for each of the two types of ureteroscopes will be measured&#xD;
      again and will be compared to the measurement at the beginning of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fatigability Fatigability of a given ureteroscope is defined as decrease of the maximum&#xD;
      amount of deflection of the tip4. The fatigability of each ureteroscope will be measured by&#xD;
      subtracting the mean value of maximal deflection at the end of the study from the maximum&#xD;
      deflection measured at the beginning of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each procedure, the surgeon that performs the endoscopic procedure will be asked to&#xD;
      rate the image quality of the scope by filling out a questionnaire from 1-10 (1 being poor&#xD;
      and 10 being excellent visualization). These subjective assessments will be the investigators&#xD;
      secondary outcomes. Additionally, the ease of deflection and overall scope performance will&#xD;
      be asked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once each ureteroscope reaches a point where it will require repair, it will be shipped to&#xD;
      the manufacturing company. The reason for repair will be recorded, and the type and cost of&#xD;
      each repair will be documented.&#xD;
