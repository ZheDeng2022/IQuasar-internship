    <textblock>
      We will undertake initial development of a new behavioral sleep intervention (i.e.,&#xD;
      partner-assisted Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia; CBT-I), based closely on the gold&#xD;
      standard treatment, CBT-I. We will examine if the new treatment has a positive impact on&#xD;
      subjective and objective sleep and quality of life in a clinic-based sample. Secondary aims&#xD;
      will examine treatment adherence and maintenance of therapeutic gains as well as relationship&#xD;
      satisfaction and broader psychiatric functioning.&#xD;

      Objective: To investigate whether partner-assisted Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia&#xD;
      (CBT-I) has a positive impact on subjective and objective sleep and quality of life in&#xD;
      individuals with insomnia. Secondary aims will examine treatment adherence and maintenance of&#xD;
      therapeutic gains as well as relationship satisfaction and impact on broader psychiatric&#xD;
      functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design: This is an open trial, feasibility study designed to examine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of partner-assisted CBT-I on insomnia patient's sleep and quality of life.&#xD;
      After individuals, Veterans and non-Veterans, and their respective bed partners consent to&#xD;
      participate in this treatment study, we will collect de-identified data including self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires, daily sleep diaries, and actigraphy (ambulatory sleep/wake monitoring). For&#xD;
      Veteran participants, we also plan to collect data from medical records. Study participants&#xD;
      will be seen for study partner-assisted CBT-I treatment at the VA San Diego Healthcare System&#xD;
      (VASDHS) Sleep and Mood Clinic. The initial screening appointment and 1-month follow up&#xD;
      assessment will be conducted in the Veterans Medical Research Foundation (VMRF) building. The&#xD;
      entire study will take two years; participation for Veterans and non-Veterans will last about&#xD;
      3 months from the date of initial screening appointment to their follow up assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will primarily be recruited through the VASDHS's Sleep and Mood Clinic by&#xD;
      physician and clinician referrals as well as posted study fliers in these clinics.&#xD;
      Non-veterans such as those enrolled in other UCSD research studies will also be recruited.&#xD;
      All individuals who meet eligibility criteria will be offered the opportunity to participate&#xD;
      and informed consent will be obtained for those who wish to do so. Participation or&#xD;
      non-participation in the protocol will not affect clinical care. Assessments of sleep&#xD;
      symptoms, health-related quality of life, treatment adherence, relationship satisfaction, and&#xD;
      psychiatric functioning will occur as part of standard treatment protocols. Assessments&#xD;
      include self-report questionnaires as well as weekly sleep diaries and two weeks of&#xD;
      actigraphy (e.g., at the start and end of treatment). Assessment data will be de-identified&#xD;
      and analyzed to determine: (a) descriptive characteristics of study participants; (b)&#xD;
      effectiveness of partner-assisted CBT-I treatment; (c) relationship functioning; (d)&#xD;
      treatment adherence (e.g., did participants follow treatment recommendations from week to&#xD;
      week); and, (e) any reduction in symptoms of psychiatric conditions that frequently co-occur&#xD;
      with insomnia including mood and/or PTSD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to test the effectiveness of partner-assisted CBT-I treatment in patients with&#xD;
      insomnia. There are currently no published studies on a couple-based CBT-I approach. The&#xD;
      proposed treatment will closely resemble the CBT-I manual currently used for insomnia group&#xD;
      therapy in the VA Sleep and Mood Clinic. The main difference will be the inclusion of&#xD;
      patients' partners in treatment and administering the manual with emphasis on how patients'&#xD;
      partners can assist the patient in making behavioral changes outlined and prioritized in the&#xD;
      existing manual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Extraction and Security Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected and extracted in a de-identified format and coded only with a study&#xD;
      specific number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic information: e.g., age, relationship status, era of military service (for&#xD;
           Veteran participants), gender, race and ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment information: e.g., number of sessions attended, treatment adherence, treatment&#xD;
           barriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical / Psychiatric Information: e.g., history of treatment for psychiatric&#xD;
           co-morbidities, use of pharmacological agents, and presence of medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to quantitative analyses, data will be screened to ensure quality and to check&#xD;
           standard statistical assumptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Descriptive Statistics will be used to calculate frequency of demographic variables in&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paired sample t-tests will examine change in pre-treatment and post-treatment means for&#xD;
           sleep, quality of life and relationship satisfaction variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paired sample t-tests will also examine change in post-treatment and follow-up means for&#xD;
           sleep, quality of life and relationship satisfaction variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Descriptive Statistics will calculate average weekly treatment adherence from the&#xD;
           participant, partner and the therapist perspectives.&#xD;

    <description>Primary outcome measures (see below for more information about the measures) will assess the change in sleep functioning from baseline to the end of treatment. We will also examine change in sleep functioning from baseline to the 1-month post treatment assessment.&#xD;
Sleep diaries. Participants will be asked to complete a daily sleep diary throughout the 8 week treatment and one week prior to the 1 month post-treatment follow up appointment. Each morning participants are asked to record sleep habits, such as bedtime, wake time, time in bed, and number and duration of awakenings. Our sleep diary will include questions to track treatment adherence. Sleep diaries are widely used in studies of insomnia.&#xD;
Questionnaire. Insomnia Severity Index (ISI; Morin et al., 2011). The ISI consists of 7-items that assess severity of insomnia, satisfaction with sleep pattern, effect of sleep on daytime and social functioning, and concern about current sleep difficulties in the past week.</description>

    <description>Study treatment includes partner-assisted Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) and consists of 7-8 weekly group therapy sessions of 2 hours each. Partner-assisted CBT-I focuses on altering patients' sleep schedules and changing their behaviors and patterns around sleeping in order to help them sleep in a single block of time overnight. As part of this treatment, participants will be asked to change, possibly reduce, the amount of time spent in bed and to maintain a specific bed time and wake time, as well as other potential changes depending on his/her specific insomnia pattern. This treatment has been shown to be safe and efficacious for a wide range of patients.</description>
