    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the effectiveness of a Group Therapy that provides&#xD;
      psycho-education and support for caregivers of cancer patients. Caregivers must be between 21&#xD;
      and 64 years of age and be willing to attend a one-hour a week program for four weeks. The&#xD;
      sessions will be in English, and a set of questionnaires (demographic data, some information&#xD;
      about your family member with cancer, and scales: Caregiver Quality of Life-Cancer Scale&#xD;
      (CQOLC), Perceived Stress Scale and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS)) will be&#xD;
      completed at the start, at 4 weeks, at 8 weeks and at 12 weeks. Some participants placed on a&#xD;
      wait-list to start the Group Therapy 4 weeks later will also complete the set of&#xD;
      questionnaires at this point. A Feedback and Satisfaction Questionnaire will be completed at&#xD;
      the end of the 4 week program. In addition, at the end of the 4 week program, some&#xD;
      participants will go through a 15-minute interview.&#xD;

      Participants Study participants are caregivers, recruited from the Medical Oncology Clinic&#xD;
      (under NCIS) at NUH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and Evaluation of the Psycho-educational Support Group Therapy This is a pre and&#xD;
      post-intervention study with a control group design. The strength of this design is its&#xD;
      experimental nature but without randomization, thereby avoiding the problems related to&#xD;
      randomization. Instead, a wait-list is used as the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive family caregivers who agree to participate will be placed in the first group&#xD;
      (Group 1a) till a group size of ten is reached. The next ten will be put on a wait-list and&#xD;
      form the control group (Group 1b), who will still be able to benefit from the program at a&#xD;
      later time. In this manner subsequent treatment and control groups will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Intervention consists of weekly Psycho-educational Support Groups focusing on topics&#xD;
      specific to psychosocial and emotional aspects of the cancer caregiving role. The&#xD;
      Intervention is over a short duration of 4 weeks so as to appeal to caregivers and reduce the&#xD;
      attrition rate. The proposed intervention is exploratory in nature but is hypothesized to be&#xD;
      beneficial in helping to recognize and handle the difficult and often tumultuous journey of&#xD;
      cancer caregiving. The planned Intervention was developed in discussions and consensus views&#xD;
      using the Delphi method and adapted the brief integrative psychological therapy developed by&#xD;
      Kua et al and psycho-educational programs at overseas centres. The CQOLC, the Perceived&#xD;
      Stress Scale, and the HADS will be administered to participants at 4 time points: T1 (week&#xD;
      0), T2 (end of week 4), T3 (end of week 8) and T4 (end of week 12). The fourth time point is&#xD;
      to evaluate whether the effects of the intervention are sustained. A Satisfaction and&#xD;
      Feedback Questionnaire will be administered to participants at T2, immediately upon&#xD;
      completion of the intervention. Some participants who have gone through the program will be&#xD;
      invited to take part in a 15 minute interview. The purpose of the interview is to obtain&#xD;
      feedback on the ways in which the program has been beneficial. The participants in the&#xD;
      control group will complete a set of the same questionnaires when they are entered into the&#xD;
      wait list; they will complete the questionnaires 5 times.&#xD;
