  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Cook Biodesign mesh for the&#xD;
      repair of complex ventral incisional hernias. Using materials to reinforce tissue defects is&#xD;
      indicated as standard of care for this type of surgery. The Cook Biodesign mesh is currently&#xD;
      FDA-approved for implantation to reinforce soft tissues where weakness exists, but the&#xD;
      investigators would like to collect additional follow-up information to continue to assess&#xD;
      the durability of the repair after placement of the hernia mesh. This follow-up would include&#xD;
      the collection of information about complications such as infections and seromas (collections&#xD;
      of fluid around the surgery site), as well as hernia recurrence and quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaires. Patients who qualify to take part in this study have been diagnosed with a&#xD;
      ventral incisional hernia and will have been scheduled for a surgical hernia repair. This&#xD;
      surgery will be an &quot;open&quot; surgical procedure and reinforcing your tissue with material is&#xD;
      indicated for this type of hernia repair.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior to their scheduled surgery, the patient will be consented and will complete a brief&#xD;
      quality of life survey. They will also be asked some questions about their medical history&#xD;
      that pertain to the study, such as current/ past abdominal infections and surgeries, history&#xD;
      of the hernia, comorbidities, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the surgery, some key data points will be recorded by the research coordinator, such&#xD;
      as time of surgery, type of case, size of mesh used, size of the hernia defect, technique&#xD;
      used, type of sutures used, etc. The mesh will be placed either retrorectus or&#xD;
      intraperitoneally, after the component separation is complete. The mesh will not be used as a&#xD;
      &quot;bridge,&quot; and the fascial layers will be closed completely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research staff may photograph the repair of an enrolled patient's hernia during their&#xD;
      treatment and will supply a copy of the photograph to Cook Medical, Inc. if the sponsor's&#xD;
      review is requested. Any photograph taken for research purposes will be kept in a&#xD;
      password-protected, encrypted database separate from any patient identifying information.&#xD;
