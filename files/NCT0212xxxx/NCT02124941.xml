  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to look at the relationship between brain glucose utilization,&#xD;
      neurotransmission (e.g., glutamate, also known as the main excitatory amino-acid&#xD;
      neurotransmitter in the brain), and synaptic density. This relationship will be explored in&#xD;
      the brain's prefrontal cortex, an area important in decision-making and impulsivity.&#xD;
