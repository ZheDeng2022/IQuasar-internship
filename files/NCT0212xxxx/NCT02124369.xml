  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is difficult to treat, and even in a situation where an operation can be&#xD;
      performed to remove the cancer, the disease can unfortunately come back soon afterwards. When&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer is more advanced, the outcomes are even less positive. Recently, a large&#xD;
      international study showed that combining a chemotherapy drug that is standard for treating&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer, called gemcitabine with a new chemotherapy drug called Abraxane was more&#xD;
      effective than gemcitabine alone for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether this combination of gemcitabine and&#xD;
      Abraxane can shrink a pancreatic cancer that is not thought to be operable enough to enable&#xD;
      it to be removed by surgery. It is hoped that in this way, the treatment may improve the&#xD;
      outcome. In addition, in this study we would like to analyse the appearances of the tumour&#xD;
      using imaging, and collect blood and tumour samples to try to confirm laboratory research&#xD;
      that has been carried out with this treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, non-randomised, phase 2a, single arm, Simon two-stage design trial&#xD;
      of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine (ABX/GEM) in patients with histological documentation of&#xD;
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) who are determined by central radiological review to&#xD;
      have &quot;category 2&quot; borderline unresectable LAPC. We will investigate the feasibility of&#xD;
      administering ABX/GEM in terms of safety and efficacy, and will study activity both in terms&#xD;
      of radiological response and the feasibility of downstaging patients to &quot;category 1&quot; status,&#xD;
      in order to attempt resection after up to 6 cycles of combination treatment. In addition to&#xD;
      adding to data on the safety and tolerability of this combination, peri- and post-operative&#xD;
      morbidity following this treatment will be evaluated. As part of the trial, detailed&#xD;
      correlative studies will be undertaken to evaluate the mechanism of action of the&#xD;
      combination, at a tissue level, a circulating biomarker level and a radiological level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose that the tumour shrinkage (response) seen in Stage IV pancreatic cancer patients&#xD;
      as a result of ABX/GEM may translate to a realistic prospect of downstaging borderline&#xD;
      unresectable LAPC tumours sufficiently to enable resection. Notionally, even in the absence&#xD;
      of a classical partial response by RECIST criteria (≥30% reduction in sum of longest&#xD;
      diameters) a beneficial outcome may arise from any tumour shrinkage sufficient to permit the&#xD;
      tumour to be separated from major vessels thus rendering it resectable. Such an outcome may&#xD;
      significantly alter the poor survival outcomes in this group of patients. The PRICKLE&#xD;
      clinical study paradigm is useful for evaluating novel agents and combinations that show&#xD;
      impressive activity in the pre-clinical or advanced setting and offers an opportunity for&#xD;
      detailed correlative translational studies to evaluate activities of therapy.&#xD;
