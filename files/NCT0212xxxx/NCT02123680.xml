    <textblock>
      Non-specific chronic low back pain guidelines recommend rehabilitation along with a&#xD;
      biopsychosocial approach. However, though psychological and social issues address important&#xD;
      needs of professionals and patients, they have been scarcely developed in this area so far.&#xD;
      Noteworthy, little is known about patients' expectations relative to physiotherapy for&#xD;
      chronic low back pain (CLBP), while professional recommendations advocate taking them into&#xD;
      consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study about patients' experience will provide knowledge about the ill person's perspective&#xD;
      and how the physiotherapists are perceived as well as the role attributed to them. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is, thus, to explore the experience of the patients suffering from CLBP in order&#xD;
      to highlight their expectations toward physiotherapy services and physiotherapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will apply a critically interpretive socio-anthropological approach based&#xD;
      on patients' interviews and observations in an intensive CLBP rehabilitation program. The&#xD;
      results will help improve the care patients receive by facilitating the integration of&#xD;
      biopsychosocial issues related to patient's expectations into the treatment.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is defined as &quot;pain and discomfort, localised below the costal&#xD;
      margin and above the inferior gluteal folds, with or without referred leg pain&quot; persisting&#xD;
      for at least 12 weeks. It is classified as non-specific when &quot;not attributable to a&#xD;
      recognisable, known specific pathology, disorder, radicular syndrome or cauda equina&#xD;
      syndrome&quot;. It is a very frequent condition, one year prevalence being around 25% for men and&#xD;
      35% for women. It can greatly alter functional capacity and quality of life. Including care,&#xD;
      sick leave and work loss, it accounts for most of the back pain related costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommended management of CLBP is multidisciplinary due to the biopsychosocial impact of this&#xD;
      condition. Most guidelines include the patient's education, advice to stay active,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and analgesic medication, exercise therapy, and spinal manipulation.&#xD;
      Multidisciplinary rehabilitation, adjunctive analgesics, and cognitive behavioural therapy&#xD;
      are recommended if the initial approach is not efficient. Self-management strategies,&#xD;
      self-monitoring of status, and decision-making are also promoted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiotherapy plays a role in CLBP management, in collaboration with other health and social&#xD;
      professions. As defined by the World Confederation for Physical Therapy, &quot;Physiotherapy&#xD;
      provides services to individuals and populations to develop, maintain and restore maximum&#xD;
      movement and functional ability throughout the lifespan. (…) Functional movement is central&#xD;
      to what it means to be healthy (…).This encompasses physical, psychological, emotional, and&#xD;
      social wellbeing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local and international standards of physiotherapy practice advocate taking patients'&#xD;
      expectations into consideration. Physiotherapists are also advised to take patients&#xD;
      preferences into account, when applying evidence-based practice (EBP) guidelines. However,&#xD;
      knowledge about the expectations of patients toward physiotherapy is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is conducted with an interdisciplinary approach. Indeed, it takes into account&#xD;
      both the physiotherapy and the anthropological discipline. Physiotherapists want to deepen&#xD;
      their comprehension of the patients' needs in order to take better care of them whereas&#xD;
      anthropologists are interested in the broader experience of chronic illness and in&#xD;
      understanding the relationship between cares and patients. With their concepts and&#xD;
      qualitative methods, the latter have relevant tools to answer the research question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expectations issues within the CLBP rehabilitation process&#xD;
&#xD;
      Commonly, expectations are understood as &quot;a belief that someone will or should achieve&#xD;
      something&quot;. In the health field literature, the notion of expectation is often used, although&#xD;
      it is seldom defined. Nevertheless, three dimensions emerge from the literature on CLBP&#xD;
      patients' expectations: effectiveness of care (diagnosis, effective treatment, pain relief),&#xD;
      relational issues (understanding, partnership, be believed, be treated as a person), and&#xD;
      empowerment (self-management, exercise, advice, explanation, etc). In addition, expectations&#xD;
      appear to be influenced by the course, the prognosis and the outcome of the rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLBP patients are often dissatisfied with back pain rehabilitation. As pain relief is slight,&#xD;
      disappointment with outcome is frequent. Having a clear diagnosis is clearly expected. Thus,&#xD;
      additional medical investigations are frequently requested to find a cause to the disease.&#xD;
      The patients also have expectations with regard to the outcome. Health professionals are&#xD;
      expected to demonstrate communication skills, understand emotional and physical impact, spend&#xD;
      time with the patient, show respect and build a partnership. They are also expected to&#xD;
      understand the personal situation, demonstrate empowering skills, and adapt their language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nature of CLBP thus puts health professionals in an uncomfortable position. The&#xD;
      diagnostic uncertainty and the limited effect of therapy challenge their competencies. The&#xD;
      professional recommendations advise to avoid complex investigations and to stay active&#xD;
      despite the pain. This position may be difficult to have when the patient wishes to obtain a&#xD;
      clear diagnosis or to be prescribed time to rest for example. Thus, unrecommended approaches&#xD;
      are sometimes implemented to maintain the relationship with the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' expectations of a diagnosis and a cure are in line with a biomedical approach,&#xD;
      while a biopsychosocial model applies to CLBP treatment. It requires subtle interaction to&#xD;
      bring the patient to consider that psychosocial issues influence pain and disability without&#xD;
      giving the impression that pain is &quot;in the mind&quot; or exaggerated. This is especially difficult&#xD;
      in a context where the person feels delegitimized. Indeed, disbelief and delegitimization by&#xD;
      health professionals are motives for dissatisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unclear diagnosis and poor social recognition&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Social sciences, the few studies that have explored the experience of CLBP patients show&#xD;
      that, since they face long term diagnostic uncertainty, this places them in a liminal state&#xD;
      being both well and sick, and being neither. Struggling for a diagnosis is an important&#xD;
      source of strain added to the experience of pain, altered moods and functional limitations.&#xD;
      Medical validation of pain cannot be performed through medical imagery in non-specific CLBP,&#xD;
      as the relation between findings and pain is low. Following the anthropological distinction&#xD;
      between disease, illness and sickness, patients, find themselves with &quot;illness&quot; (their&#xD;
      subjective experience of suffering), but without &quot;disease&quot; (medical definition of the&#xD;
      affection) or &quot;sickness&quot; (social construction and recognition). Lack of clear body damage&#xD;
      explaining pain leads to an absence of social recognition as a sick person needing to be&#xD;
      supported by the society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Living with CLBP: a biographical disruption&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic symptoms can lead to a feeling of hopelessness, depression, anger and a loss of self&#xD;
      and identity. The loss of social role, status and identity induced by chronic illness is&#xD;
      documented in medical socio-anthropology. As shown in socio-anthropological studies on&#xD;
      chronic illness, there is a biographical disruption when the illness appears. The CLBP&#xD;
      patient has to manage his life accounting for pain. Self-image is altered and a feeling of&#xD;
      self-discrepancy, i.e. a difference between ideal and perceived self, may be experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients feel that there are held responsible for their suffering, when physicians&#xD;
      situate the origin of pain &quot;in the mind&quot; in the absence of identified body damage. Patients&#xD;
      often consider that physicians don't admit the limitations of medicine. Persons in&#xD;
      unexplained pain, speak of solving the riddle which they can't resign to consider as&#xD;
      &quot;imagined pain&quot;. They are often convinced of the concreteness of their pain, since &quot;you can't&#xD;
      hurt this bad and there being nothing wrong&quot;. Some complain &quot;having been let down&quot; in this&#xD;
      quest and explain they had to cope on their own with their situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although these studies show the importance of taking into account the lived situations and&#xD;
      trajectory of the ill persons since the beginning of the illness, they make little&#xD;
      articulation between these trajectories and ill persons' expectations towards caregivers. In&#xD;
      this study the investigators assume there are strong links between these aspects. For&#xD;
      instance, the duration of the illness, the level of disability, its impact on the quality of&#xD;
      life, the previous recourse to other therapists and treatments necessarily produce variations&#xD;
      in the patients' expectations towards the physiotherapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to identify CLBP patients' expectations toward physiotherapy&#xD;
      and physiotherapists. The investigators will aim at providing a qualitative insight into the&#xD;
      factors influencing the expectations by relating them to the experience and elements of the&#xD;
      context in which they appear. The elements accounted for will include the representation of&#xD;
      CLBP, physiotherapy and its therapists, the illness trajectory, the socio-economic&#xD;
      characteristics, the techniques and the perceived relationship with the physiotherapists.&#xD;
      Expectations will be investigated at the beginning and the end of an intensive rehabilitation&#xD;
      program to seize how this experience answers and/or modifies the patient's expectations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: individual interviews and observations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews with patients and observations of the patient-physiotherapist interactions are&#xD;
      planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual comprehensive interviews are a common method to provide accounts of the experience&#xD;
      of illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use semi-structured interviews based on a guide of questions.&#xD;
      Interviews will be conducted by the anthropologists of the research team. Interviews will&#xD;
      last around 1 hour. They will take place at the ill person's home if he/she agrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the process, 4 pilot interviews and two individual sessions&#xD;
      (observations) will be run to refine questions and procedures, as well as adjust to unplanned&#xD;
      practical issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two interviews will take place, one at the beginning of the rehabilitation program, and the&#xD;
      second at the end. Both interviews will be conducted by the same researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observations&#xD;
&#xD;
      With an aim of a triangulation of data, the interviews will be completed with observations of&#xD;
      the relationship between patients and physiotherapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observations will take place in the back rehabilitation unit of the university hospital.&#xD;
      Patients will follow a 3 week intensive CLBP rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus will be put on individual therapy sessions. More specifically, the first and the last&#xD;
      session of the program will be observed. The investigators will choose ten patients among the&#xD;
      twenty participants using the same purposive sampling process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These observations will be conducted by the two anthropologists in the research team.&#xD;
      Following the observations, all members of the research team will meet for debriefing&#xD;
      sessions, to share visions between anthropologists and physiotherapists about the meaning of&#xD;
      the events. This will assure taking into account both socio-anthropological concepts and&#xD;
      physiotherapists' knowledge of the field in an interdisciplinary approach.&#xD;

        A purposive sample will be used. The investigators will aim at the recruitment of a&#xD;
        diversified sample of patients following an intensive chronic low back pain rehabilitation&#xD;
        program. The sample will include as many men as women, as many young than older&#xD;
        participants (3 age groups: 18-30, 30-50, 50-65), as much variety in educational level and&#xD;
        occupation as possible. The type of work (physical demand of employment) and career track&#xD;
        will also be taken into account, as well as having a representation of migrants (since they&#xD;
        are overrepresented in the back pain population58). It is estimated that data saturation&#xD;
        should be reached with 20 participants.&#xD;
