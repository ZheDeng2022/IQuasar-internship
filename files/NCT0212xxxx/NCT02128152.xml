      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Ekso robotic&#xD;
      exoskeleton in persons affected by a severe stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine if a structured high-dosage exoskeleton training program (EXTP)&#xD;
                results in clinically significant gains in walking recovery in individuals affected&#xD;
                by severe stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine whether timing of EXTP delivery (i.e., sub-acute vs. chronic) and&#xD;
                severity (non-ambulators vs. limited house-hold ambulators) affects the improvement&#xD;
                in gait speed and overall function following the EXTP training protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine whether maintenance or further improvement in gait speed can be&#xD;
                achieved by an intensive follow-up program of either a traditional rehabilitation&#xD;
                program (TRP) or extended EXTP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine the effect on functional walking endurance as assessed by the 6 minute&#xD;
                walk test and 10 meter walk test, in high-dosage exoskeleton training program&#xD;
                (EXTP) vs. traditional rehabilitation program (TRP) carried in an outpatient&#xD;
                setting for post stroke individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine the effect on functional balance, as assessed by the Berg Balance&#xD;
                Scale, Functional Gait Assessment and Five times sit to stand measure as assessed&#xD;
                by the 6 minute walk test, in high-dosage exoskeleton training program (EXTP) vs.&#xD;
                traditional rehabilitation program (TRP) carried in an outpatient setting for post&#xD;
                stroke individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To determine the effect on stroke recovery, as assessed by the step counter of task&#xD;
                specific training in high-dosage exoskeleton training program (EXTP) vs.&#xD;

      *Procedures During Screening Process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve recruitment of individuals who have experienced a severe stroke as&#xD;
      well as patients with similar neurological weakness from the inpatient setting, outpatient&#xD;
      clinics, as well as day rehabilitation sites through The Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago&#xD;
      and Northwestern Memorial Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Members of the research team will perform the initial screening of potential subjects. These&#xD;
      clinicians will determine study eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      provided by Ekso Bionics in accordance with the medical recommendations of Dr. Todd Kuiken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects will be asked questions regarding their medical history and current level&#xD;
      of function. If the subject meets the criteria, researchers will then provide the subject&#xD;
      with a consent form. The researchers will discuss the objectives, study protocol, and the&#xD;
      risks and benefits of the study with each subject. The subjects will be given time to review&#xD;
      the form and ask any questions about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once each subject has provided informed consent, he or she will undergo a screening process&#xD;
      to assess joint range of motion, muscular strength (via manual muscle test), and any&#xD;
      spasticity present (via Modified Ashworth Scale). These measures will be used to determine&#xD;
      subject qualification based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Vital signs (including heart&#xD;
      rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation) will be assessed at baseline, after each session,&#xD;
      and during sessions as needed based on subject's signs and symptoms. Oxygen saturation and&#xD;
      heart rate will be monitored using a pulse oximeter. Blood pressure will be assessed with a&#xD;
      manual blood pressure cuff and stethoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Procedures During Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions will begin with donning the Ekso device to ensure a proper fit. A physical therapist&#xD;
      will check the subject for proper alignment of joints with the device and check for areas of&#xD;
      increased pressure between the device and body. If necessary, additional padding will be&#xD;
      added to ensure safety and comfort or the device configuration will be modified. During the&#xD;
      initial sessions, skin checks will be more frequent as padding is customized, after which&#xD;
      they will occur at the end of each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the pre-session measures, the participant will be attached to a suspension device&#xD;
      (Guldman overhead lift) and guarded by facility clinical/Ekso Bionics staff to ensure&#xD;
      participant safety. Each participant will undergo measurement, sizing, and donning of the&#xD;
      Ekso device in addition to skill training. Each participant will then be instructed in proper&#xD;
      use of the Ekso device and progressed through a series of weight shifting, balance, and&#xD;
      walking skill sets. Participants will be scheduled for an initial screening session and up to&#xD;
      26 follow-up training sessions and assessments after the 9th, 18th, and 26th session. A&#xD;
      follow-up assessment will also take place 3 months after the 26th training session. The&#xD;
      amount of sessions provided will be dependent upon compatibility with device, ability to&#xD;
      tolerate device use, and ability to safely ambulate using the device. A participant will&#xD;
      continue with each phase of the study as deemed appropriate by research staff:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1 (1-9 training sessions): Each subject will be instructed in regards to optimal&#xD;
           postural alignment and weight shifting strategies to walk more efficiently in the&#xD;
           device. The subject will complete balance and weight shifting tasks to improve standing&#xD;
           balance and initiation of stepping in the device. Each subject will participate in 90&#xD;
           minute gait training sessions with an emphasis multi-directional weigh shifting,&#xD;
           balance, and initial walking tasks in the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2 (10-18 training sessions): Each subject will continue with gait training in the&#xD;
           Ekso device utilizing training protocols developed to achieve progression with walking&#xD;
           from maximum-assist, tethered walking towards a greater level of independence including&#xD;
           non-tethered walking in the device. An assessment of gait speed, among other functional&#xD;
           measures, will take place during the 18th session. Each subject's gait speed will&#xD;
           determine the type of training that he or she will receive during the sessions 19-26.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 3 (19-26 training sessions): Subjects with a walking speed &lt;.4m/sec will continue&#xD;
           with Ekso device gait training for 4 weeks at a rate of 2 sessions per week. Subjects&#xD;
           with a walking speed of &gt;.4m/sec will continue with traditional physical therapy&#xD;
           treatment for 4 weeks at a rate of 2 sessions per week. Both types of training sessions&#xD;
           will focus on improving overall balance, walking distance, walking speed, &amp; confidence&#xD;
           with over ground walking.&#xD;

    <description>The 6MWT measures the distance a subject can walk indoors on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes, using assistive devices, as necessary. The test is a reliable and valid evaluation of functional exercise capacity and is used as a sub-maximal test of aerobic capacity and endurance. The minimal detectable change distance for people with sub-acute stroke is 60.98 meters15. The walk test is patient self-paced and assesses the level of functional capacity. Patients are allowed to stop and rest during the test, however, the timer does not stop. If the patient is unable to complete the time, the time stopped is noted and reason for stopping prematurely is recorded. This test will be administered while wearing a mask to measure oxygen consumption.</description>
