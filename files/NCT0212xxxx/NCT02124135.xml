      Dietary counseling at the point of purchase could improve patient adherence to dietary advice&#xD;
      and downstream health outcomes. The aim of our pilot is to test the efficacy of a novel&#xD;
      delivery system for dietary advice. We will study the effect of relocating family weight&#xD;
      management counseling sessions into restaurants, where registered dieticians and patients&#xD;
      will conduct scheduled group visits while enjoying a meal together. As with office-based&#xD;
      visits, our goal is for members and their families to learn how to select food options based&#xD;
      on their unique health needs, budgetary concerns, and time constraints. In contrast to a&#xD;
      traditional counseling visit, however, co-dining with a dietitian will give members a&#xD;
      hands-on experience designed to enhance their learning and improve adherence. The proposed&#xD;
      study would build on an existing pilot of a similar program, the &quot;KP Personal Shopper&quot;, where&#xD;
      dietitian visits were conducted with individuals either in the clinic setting or while&#xD;
      shopping in a grocery store.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will compare the new &quot;Eat Out with Kaiser&quot; approach to the current standard of&#xD;
      clinic-based dietary and lifestyle counseling for weight management among 40 families&#xD;
      affected by obesity, with the following outcomes in mind:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Change in dietary measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nutritional knowledge of families&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participant self-efficacy and confidence in food purchasing decisions&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Participant and dietician perception of visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that, compared to clinic-based visits, our &quot;Eat Out with Kaiser&quot; visits will&#xD;
      result in more favorable perception of the visit by both dietitian and participant, higher&#xD;
      nutritional knowledge scores, higher self-efficacy and confidence of patients around food&#xD;
      decisions, and larger improvements in diet components.&#xD;

      dietitian visits were conducted with individuals either in the clinic setting or while&#xD;
      shopping in a grocery store.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study population will come from a local employer group, and we will use the electronic&#xD;
      medical record to identify families where at least one child and one parent are affected by&#xD;
      obesity. Assuming families are interested and meet eligibility criteria, they will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study design is a randomized trial, where randomization occurs at the unit of the family.&#xD;
      45 families will be randomized into one of two arms. All families will receive a baseline 30&#xD;
      minute phone call with the dietitian, followed by three in-person group visits. Those in the&#xD;
      intervention (Eat Out) arm will have their in-person visits conducted during mealtimes at a&#xD;
      restaurant. Those in the control (clinic) arm will have their in-person visits conducted in a&#xD;
      classroom at a Kaiser medical office building.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will compare the new &quot;Eat Out with Kaiser&quot; approach to the current standard of&#xD;
      clinic-based dietary and lifestyle counseling for weight management among 40 families&#xD;
      affected by obesity, with the following outcomes in mind:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Change in dietary measures including - Fruit and Vegetable Intake, Whole Grain Intake,&#xD;
           Saturated Fat Intake and Added Sugars.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nutritional knowledge of families&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participant self-efficacy and confidence in food purchasing decisions - all family&#xD;
           members&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Participant and dietician perception of visit type (attendance, feasibility,&#xD;
           effectiveness, e.g.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that, compared to clinic-based visits, our &quot;Eat Out with Kaiser&quot; visits will&#xD;
      result in more favorable perception of the visit by both dietitian and participant, higher&#xD;
      nutritional knowledge scores, higher self-efficacy and confidence of patients around food&#xD;
      decisions, and larger improvements in diet components.&#xD;
