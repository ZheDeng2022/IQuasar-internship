  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant central nervous system (CNS) tumor&#xD;
      in adulthood with a median survival of 12-16 months. The drastically shorted life expectancy,&#xD;
      intellectual changes and rapid physical decline in those patients are devastating and do&#xD;
      impose a profound chronic stress on patients and their families. There is extensive evidence&#xD;
      that chronic stress can promote cancer growth and progression. In the setting of GBM&#xD;
      patients, three major questions still have to be answered and will be analysed in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is there a prognostic significance of stress in patients with newly diagnosed GBM on&#xD;
           treatment tolerance and (progression free) survival?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Can this stress be modulated by other factors, like stress of patients partners and&#xD;
           patients physical activity, a known independent prognostic factor in recurrent glioma&#xD;
           patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How is the longitudinal course of patients and partners stress and physical condition&#xD;
           over the disease course and do they influence (progression free) survival?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Answers to these questions will help to establish future projects studying non drug&#xD;
      interventions in patients and patients partners to help improving clinical and tumor related&#xD;
      outcome in patients with newly diagnosed GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that chronic stress, specifically measured as a disruption of&#xD;
      the diurnal cortisol rhythmicity, is an independent prognostic factor in patients with GBM.&#xD;
      Furthermore, physical activity of patients and stress level in patients' partners may impact&#xD;
      - as stress-modulating factors- on stress in patients and on their prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aiming at identifying stress-related prognostic factors as potential targets for novel&#xD;
      treatment approaches, we propose, in a first step, a prospective multicenter cohort study:&#xD;
      all patients with newly diagnosed GBM and good performance status (KPS ≥ 50%) who undergo&#xD;
      standard treatment with combined radiochemotherapy with temozolomide (RCT) followed by 6&#xD;
      month of cyclic temozolomide, are eligible. In addition, one &quot;partner&quot;, defined as a close&#xD;
      person living in the same home or close daily contact to the patient, will be asked for&#xD;
      inclusion.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      General Aim The aim of this prospective, multicenter observational cohort study is to&#xD;
      determine the impact of baseline bio-behavioral stress (Aim I) on cancer progression and&#xD;
      survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) undergoing standard&#xD;
      radiochemotherapy. The role of baseline physical activity (PA) and baseline partner's&#xD;
      distress as stress-modulating factors will be assessed in an exploratory analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims include a longitudinal assessment of self-reported psychological distress in&#xD;
      this homogenous patient cohort and their partners (Aim II) and -in a translational subproject&#xD;
      - to determine the role of serum copeptin as a biomarker for distress (Aim III).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims Specific Aim I: Prognostic role of stress at the time of diagnosis in GBM&#xD;
      patients In this analysis, baseline neuroendocrine stress will be correlated to&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      More specifically we aim at assessing&#xD;
&#xD;
      IA) Whether stress-induced disruption of diurnal cortisol rhythmicity as measured by the&#xD;
      salivary cortisol slope is an independent prognostic factor for (progression-free) survival&#xD;
      in patients with newly diagnosed GBM undergoing standard multimodal treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IB) Whether increased baseline self-reported physical activity is correlated with lower&#xD;
      levels of stress (i.e. acts as a stress-modulating factor) and prolonged (progression-free)&#xD;
      survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      IC) Whether high levels of stress in the patients' partner (baseline diurnal cortisol slope)&#xD;
      are correlated with high levels of stress in the patient (i.e. stress-modulating factor) and&#xD;
      shorter (progression-free) survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim II: Longitudinal cohort of patient-partner dyads In the same cohort of patients&#xD;
      (Aim I above) we aim at describing distress over time (three-monthly) from start of combined&#xD;
      radiochemotherapy to disease progression in patients and - as a paired dyad - in one close&#xD;
      partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim III: Copeptin biomarker subproject In a translational subproject we aim at&#xD;
      assessing the prognostic role of baseline serum copeptin- an easy to test serum biomarker of&#xD;
      stress in many clinical situations, which has never been assessed in cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study design Since the prognostic role of stress in GBM has not been studied before,&#xD;
      we propose in a first step an observational, prospective multicenter cohort study in a&#xD;
      well-defined group of patients, all at the same stage of disease (initial diagnosis) and all&#xD;
      undergoing the same standard multimodal treatment (surgery followed by radiochemotherapy&#xD;
      according to R.Stupp et al.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients All patients in good performance status (Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) ≥ 50%),&#xD;
      aged 18 years and older, with histologically confirmed, previously untreated GBM are eligible&#xD;
      prior to starting initial treatment with radio-chemotherapy. In order to participate,&#xD;
      patients will need to have given their informed consent on the ethics-approved consent form&#xD;
      and will need to be willing and able (as judged by the investigator) to comply with the&#xD;
      protocol. Cardiovascular contraindications to the 6-minute walking test (6MWT) and/or a&#xD;
      history of instable angina pectoris or New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade II or greater&#xD;
      congestive heart failure (according to the Thoracic Society recommendations) preclude trial&#xD;
      inclusion. Equally, patients who have signs or symptoms (including laboratory findings) of&#xD;
      conditions, either metabolic or psychological, that interfere with adequate assessment of the&#xD;
      stress axis (e.g. chronic use of a corticosteroid, psychiatric disorder and medication) are&#xD;
      excluded. Perioperative dexamethasone treatment is not an exclusion criterion as short time&#xD;
      treatment does not clearly affect the HPA axis and synthetic corticosteroids can be&#xD;
      discriminated in salivary cortisol measurements. Inability to follow study procedures, e.g.&#xD;
      due to language problems, psychological disorders, dementia or confusion, is another reason&#xD;
      for study exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' partners Each patient designates his or her closest partner, (not necessarily&#xD;
      intimate partners), either a person living in the same household or with daily contact&#xD;
      (husband/wife, not married partner, other family members). In order to participate, the&#xD;
      patient's partner must be older than 18 years, in a good performance status (KPS≥50%),&#xD;
      willing and able (as judged by the investigator) to comply with the protocol and must give&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient has no partner or the partner is not willing to be part of the trial,&#xD;
      participation in the cohort is still possible (the group of patients without partners will be&#xD;
      analyzed separately).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint for Aim I The primary endpoint is PFS, i.e. the time between diagnosis and&#xD;
      disease progression (according to RANO criteria) or death of any cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response evaluation in MRI will be done using the criteria by MacDonald et al. , which are&#xD;
      specified in the RANO criteria. In brief, the definitions for &quot;progression&quot; is the following:&#xD;
      At least 25% increase in the size of a solid mass or contrast-enhancing lesions on MRI (or&#xD;
      CT) or the appearance of a new lesion or clinical deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints for Aim I&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include overall survival and measures of treatment tolerance:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of patients, who stopped treatment for reasons other than progressive disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of planned temozolomide doses received&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Flow and Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments Baseline (T1): predictor variables Baseline Assessment will occur at a strictly&#xD;
      defined time point (T1) in order to minimize time-dependent confounders on predictor&#xD;
      variables (particularly stress lab): Physical functioning tests and questionnaires will be&#xD;
      performed on days -3 before start of radiochemotherapy. Salivary cortisol samples will be&#xD;
      performed at days -2 and -1 before start of radiochemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Consolidation (T2) The visit will take place 28d after T1 when patients have started&#xD;
      their treatment (&quot;steady-state&quot;), for all non-progressing patients (which will be the vast&#xD;
      majority at this early time-point) and includes the same assessments as T1. The purpose of T2&#xD;
      assessments is to validate T1 i.e. to confirm that T1 (baseline) has been representative for&#xD;
      the condition patients and partners are in early during treatment and to exclude that T1&#xD;
      assessments have been unrepresentative due to the impending start of an unknown treatment. T2&#xD;
      assessments will be analyzed as confirmatory baseline prognostic factors in all&#xD;
      non-progressing patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up visits until progression (FU1) Follow-up visits will be done every 12 weeks. The&#xD;
      purpose of the FU1 visits is i) to measure disease status in MRI for aim I (1° endpoint) and&#xD;
      ii) to longitudinally describe distress, emotional functioning and quality of life (QoL) in&#xD;
      patients and partners for aim II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up visits from progression to death (patients only) (FU2) After progression patients&#xD;
      will be contacted every three months for survival status (dead or alive).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures Stress Aim I (predictor variables): Baseline Stress measurements in patients&#xD;
      as well as partners at baseline (T1) and after 4 weeks (T2) i) Neuroendocrine stress&#xD;
      evaluations using standard laboratory essays (salivary diurnal cortisol slope, cortisol&#xD;
      awakening response (CAR), short adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-test as well as ii)&#xD;
      Self-reported psychological distress evaluations by questionnaires (distress thermometer and&#xD;
      perceived stress scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim II (descriptive variables): Distress in the longitudinal cohort will be evaluated every&#xD;
      three months in patients-partners dyads with self-reported measures such as DT and PSS (ii&#xD;
      above). Quality of life and emotional functioning will also be described as measured by the&#xD;
      FACT-Br and HADS-D score&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ad i.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diurnal Cortisol Slope: Salivary cortisol levels peak 30-60 minutes after awakening and&#xD;
           then drop to a nadir during sleep. This diurnal rhythm is disrupted in chronically&#xD;
           stressed patients: leading to a flattening of the slope (beta) of the curve that&#xD;
           connects salivary cortisol concentrations over time (from awakening to bedtime).&#xD;
           Salivary cortisol will be measured on two consecutive days (patients will receive a kit&#xD;
           with &quot;salivettes&quot; containers to use at home and store in the refrigerator until next day&#xD;
           hospital visit). Salivary samples will be collected after waking up in the morning, 30&#xD;
           minutes later (for CAR below), at 4pm and at 9pm. Cortisol level analyses will be done&#xD;
           by the immunoassay ECLIA (E170 Roche, Switzerland) at the reference hospital (University&#xD;
           Hospital Basel). Sample storage and shipment can be performed at -20°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cortisol awakening response (CAR) describes the increase of about 50% in saliva&#xD;
           cortisol levels, which occurs 20-30 minutes after waking up in the morning. It is&#xD;
           thought to be linked to the hippocampus' preparation of the&#xD;
           hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) to face anticipated stress and it is&#xD;
           independent from the circadian variation in the HPA axis. CAR provides an easy measure&#xD;
           of the capacity of the HPA axis to react to stress. An increased CAR has been associated&#xD;
           with burnout, worry and chronic stress at work. For CAR saliva samples will be collected&#xD;
           on two consecutive days by passive drooling, immediately after awakening (0') and 30 min&#xD;
           (30') later [45].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As perioperative dexamethasone is usually given in these patients, a short or &quot;low-dose&quot;&#xD;
           ACTH test (Synacthen test) will be performed, to rule out relative adrenal&#xD;
           insufficiency. The test reflects the adrenal function and is a validated and save tool&#xD;
           routinely used in daily practice. A baseline sampling of Cortisol is performed before 1&#xD;
           ug Synacthen is applied by intravenous route. Stimulated Cortisol serum level is&#xD;
           measured exactly 30min after Synacthen application. The test will be performed in the&#xD;
           morning. Cortisol level analyses will be done by the immunoassay ECLIA (E170 Roche,&#xD;
           Switzerland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ad ii) The distress-thermometer (DT) is a 10-point scale displayed in a thermometer format&#xD;
      and was originally developed by Roth and colleagues (Appendix 1). Validity of DT has been&#xD;
      examined for outpatient cancer patients as well as relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The perceived stress scale (PSS) is a universally accepted, standardized unidimensional scale&#xD;
      that assesses perceived stress by asking respondents to report whether their lives seem to be&#xD;
      unpredictable or uncontrollable, or if they feel overburdened. It assesses the cognitively&#xD;
      mediated emotional response to an objective event, rather than the objective event itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life (QOL) will be measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy&#xD;
      (FACT). The FACT comprises a series of questionnaires to measure general QOL, as well as&#xD;
      cancer- and condition-specific symptoms during and after cancer treatment. The questionnaires&#xD;
      are broadly used and validated in several languages, including German. The following scales&#xD;
      will be used: FACT-Br (brain), containing 37 items on physical wellbeing, family/social&#xD;
      wellbeing, emotional wellbeing and functional wellbeing. For comparable evaluations in&#xD;
      partners, an adapted version of the FACT-G (general) has been generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emotional functioning: The German version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale&#xD;
      (HADS-D) will be used to assess current levels of depression and anxiety. Each scale&#xD;
      comprises 7 items, which are answered on a 4-point scale. The scale is widely used to&#xD;
      evaluate emotional wellbeing in patients with chronic physical conditions and is validated&#xD;
      for the German language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity Exercise behavior will be evaluated in patients as well as in partners by&#xD;
      self-reported physical activity in MET-hours per week, by Godin-Leisure-Time-Exercise&#xD;
      Questionnaire (GLTEQ). In this questionnaire -validated in glioma patients- patients and&#xD;
      partners are asked to complete a self-explanatory four-item query of usual leisure-time&#xD;
      exercise habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Physical condition (in patients only) will be tested using an internationally standardized&#xD;
      test that does not need extensive equipment (which is important for practicability in the&#xD;
      multicenter setting): A 6-Minute walking test (6MWT) is a simple method to evaluate&#xD;
      functional capacity and has been tested in multiple settings. Patients will be instructed to&#xD;
      walk at their fastest pace and to cover the longest possible distance over 6 minutes under&#xD;
      the supervision of physical therapist. During exercise, oxyhemoglobin saturation and heart&#xD;
      rate will be monitored by pulse oximetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim III: Copeptin Arginine Vasopressin (AVP) is a hypothalamic stress hormone, which is&#xD;
      produced in the hypothalamus and released from the posterior pituitary. Together with&#xD;
      corticotropin-releasing hormone, it leads to secretion of ACTH and cortisol. With the recent&#xD;
      development of a novel sandwich immunoassay for copeptin (the C-terminal glycoprotein of the&#xD;
      pre-provasopressin), a stable and easy to measure surrogate of AVP secretion has become&#xD;
      available. (Direct AVP measurement is hampered by technical, pre-analytical difficulties). As&#xD;
      a stress hormone copeptin mirrors individual stress levels even more subtly than cortisol.&#xD;
