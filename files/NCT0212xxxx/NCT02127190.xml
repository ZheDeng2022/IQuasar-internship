  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be the first-in-human (FIH) study with CXA-10. The main purpose of this trial is to&#xD;
      demonstrate the tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of CXA-10 at various&#xD;
      incremental doses, and to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of the rate of the emulsion&#xD;
      vehicle infusion in healthy volunteers. In addition, associated pharmacodynamic (PD) effects&#xD;
      of CXA-10 will be investigated.&#xD;
