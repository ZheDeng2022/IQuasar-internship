  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching aim of this project is to develop and pilot an innovative online intervention&#xD;
      (Share) that integrates an Individual Internet Intervention (III) and an Internet Support&#xD;
      Group (ISG) in preventing Postpartum Major Depression (PPMD). To establish that supportive&#xD;
      accountability is a critical component of the intervention, Share will be compared to an III&#xD;
      alone, and an ISG without the III components.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum major depression (PPMD) occurs in approximately 7% of women in the first three&#xD;
      months after childbirth and up to 22% of women over the first year postpartum. The impact of&#xD;
      PPMD can be profound, including emotional distress, impairment in daily functioning and&#xD;
      especially in caring for an infant for women as well as disturbances in infant development.&#xD;
      The need for preventive interventions that are effective and widely accessible is clear and&#xD;
      widely recognized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While several psychological interventions to prevent PPMD have demonstrated efficacy, all of&#xD;
      these interventions require women to be physically present at a treatment site at a&#xD;
      particular time and day. There are numerous well established access barriers to traditional&#xD;
      face-to-face psychological interventions, particularly for postpartum women facing the&#xD;
      demands of childcare, including cost, transportation barriers, and time constraints, all of&#xD;
      which make it impossible for the vast majority of women to participate in preventive care.&#xD;
      The Internet offers great potential in extending mental health services to perinatal women&#xD;
      because it directly circumvents these barriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two broad classes of internet interventions have been evaluated within medicine generally,&#xD;
      although to date there are no published evaluations of such interventions among perinatal&#xD;
      women: Individual Internet Interventions (IIIs), which provide patients with access to&#xD;
      web-based self-management programs, and Internet Support Groups (ISGs), which are usually&#xD;
      centered around a discussion board or chat room. Meta-analyses suggest that IIIs are&#xD;
      effective with acutely depressed patients when they include regular support by live coach&#xD;
      (d=.61), but are much less effective when they are provided as a stand-alone treatment&#xD;
      (d=.25). The enhanced efficacy of coach-supported IIIs appears to be due to the greater&#xD;
      adherence to the intervention (e.g. more frequent usage) resulting from personal coach&#xD;
      contact. The obvious drawbacks are cost and scalability: infrastructures for the training,&#xD;
      oversight and payment of coaches must be implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, ISGs provide a vehicle for peer support, and are very highly valued and commonly&#xD;
      used by perinatal women. However, while adherence may be good, trials have found unmoderated&#xD;
      ISGs to be ineffective at reducing distress and depression, Taken together, the efficacy of&#xD;
      the IIIs and the adherence, flexibility, and potential for peer support in an ISG suggest&#xD;
      that peers in a well-constructed ISG that encourages support and collaborative learning,&#xD;
      could enhance adherence and outcomes of online self-management training programs. Learning&#xD;
      these self-management skills have proven effective in face-to-face interventions to prevent&#xD;
      depression among perinatal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention, which we call &quot;Share&quot;, is based upon a unique combination of two critical&#xD;
      concepts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the capacity of IIIs to teach self-management skills; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the potential for ISGs to enhance adherence and contribute to effective learning.&#xD;
