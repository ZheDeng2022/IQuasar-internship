      The primary objective of this study is to determine the reasons for balloon aortic&#xD;
      valvuloplasty (BAV) in the current clinical setting and to determine the outcomes of BAV in&#xD;
      patients with aortic stenosis. The ultimate aim is to establish the safety, effectiveness,&#xD;
      and appropriate role of BAV therapy as definitive therapy (palliation) or as a &quot;bridge&quot; to&#xD;
      surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).&#xD;

      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the volume of BAV procedures and success of the procedure as a 'bridge' to&#xD;
           AVR/TAVR (percent of BAV patients that go on to receive valve replacement).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To establish the demographic profile of the patients having a BAV with clear&#xD;
           determination of the primary indication for the BAV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To collect baseline, 30-day, 3 and 6 month, and 1 year patient data to assess&#xD;
           improvement in primary cardiac condition (AVA, EF &amp; GRAD) and other primary endpoint&#xD;
           conditions and symptomology according to pre-operative BAV rationale (e.g., renal&#xD;
           function, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, etc - see inclusion criterion).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess patient Quality Of Life prior to procedure and at all follow-up time points&#xD;
           through to 1-year post-procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess patient's Resilience at baseline and 30 day follow-up using the&#xD;
           Connor-Davidson 10 Resilience Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To assess post-operative rate of stroke and other complications (according to VARC2&#xD;
           definitions ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To identify the survival in relation to the treatment indication for BAV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      BAV is a percutaneous treatment for severe aortic stenosis with a balloon catheter inside the&#xD;
      valve. The balloon stretches the valve open, in an effort to increase the opening size of the&#xD;
      valve and improve blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the procedure offers relief from symptoms, the preferred alternative is aortic valve&#xD;
      replacement. The Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Guidelines on Valvular Heart&#xD;
      Disease assert that BAV should be limited to serving as a bridge to surgery in those with&#xD;
      compromised hemodynamic status or as a method for palliation of symptoms in those who are not&#xD;
      candidates for AVR (Class IIb).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the commercial release of the Edwards Sapien transcatheter aortic valve system and&#xD;
      increasing availability of TAVR, patients previously bridged to inclusion in TAVR feasibility&#xD;
      trials with BAV might proceed more directly to TAVR. Thus an important challenge will be to&#xD;
      better define the relative role for TAVR and of palliative BAV, especially in extreme-risk&#xD;
      patients for whom the survival benefit of successful TAVR may be limited due to other&#xD;
      life-threatening comorbid conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective chart review of patients that had undergone BAV from 2006 to May 2013 was&#xD;
      performed. Several indications were identified in relation to this surgical intervention&#xD;
      (palliative therapy from the outset; a means to 'bridge' a patient to operable status /&#xD;
      treatment; therapy for patients under consideration for TAVR but delayed due to trial&#xD;
      constraints; and as ultimate therapy because patients declined further treatment).&#xD;
      Unfortunately, however, patient category determinations were made post-hoc, and proved&#xD;
      problematic to properly validate. The current study proposes to rectify that problem by&#xD;
      collecting definitive diagnostic intention prior to study inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of Proposed Research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective collection of patient indication, procedural, and intermediate&#xD;
      outcomes for all patients undergoing BAV. Data from hospital records, 30-day, 3 month, 6&#xD;
      month, and 1-year follow-up clinic visits and all other subsequent clinic and hospital&#xD;
      records through to 1-year post-procedure will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a minimum enrollment of 100 total patients, the estimated time period of this study is 6&#xD;
      months + 1 year for all baseline and follow-up data collection (beginning 6/2013 through&#xD;
      10/2014). This estimate is based on an average monthly rate of 7 BAV procedures at Medical&#xD;
      City, and 10 at the Heart Hospital Baylor Plano.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule of Assessments/Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-procedure: Kansas City QOL and Connor-Davidson 10 Resilience Scale will be assessed&#xD;
      pre-procedure gained from all consenting patients prior to BAV. Indication for BAV will be&#xD;
      obtained by a case report form for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospitalization period: All other data will be collected from existing medical records for&#xD;
      hospitalization and for BAV procedure through to discharge, as well as all inpatient hospital&#xD;
      visits following BAV through to 1 year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 day, 3 month, 6 month and 1 year clinic follow-up: Clinic follow-up will re-assess&#xD;
      parameters of cardiac function, as well as pulmonary, and/or renal function as deemed&#xD;
      necessary for evaluation of procedural &quot;success&quot; based on pre-BAV indicators. Telephone&#xD;
      follow-up will be performed for any patients that fail to appear for clinic visits. QOL from&#xD;
      all patients who have consented to QOL assessment will be obtained at each time point. The&#xD;
      Connor-Davison 10 Resilience Scale will be collected at the 30 day follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical &amp; Analytical Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endpoint variables are procedural mortality, survival post intervention and other major&#xD;
      adverse event (the following clinical endpoints will be queried as per VARC2 recommendations:&#xD;
      mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, bleeding complications, acute kidney injury,&#xD;
      vascular complications, conduction disturbances and arrhythmias, and other relevant&#xD;
      complications not previously categorized).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication for BAV will be the primary planned comparison, with additional analyses planned&#xD;
      for demographic factors (age, gender, race/ethnicity, height, weight, and BMI, and body&#xD;
      surface area (BSA). Changes in cardiac function (output in l/min, ejection fraction, aortic&#xD;
      peak velocity in m/s, aortic valve area in cm2, aortic valve gradient in mmHg) will be&#xD;
      compared in all patients with echocardiography. Definition of success will also assess change&#xD;
      in renal function (lab creatinine values), and pulmonary (Fev1/DLCO) values, and pre-post&#xD;
      score QOL and resilience scale changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedural variables will include balloon specifications, number of balloons used for each&#xD;
      patient, number of times each balloon has been dilated, and complications. The latter will be&#xD;
      distinguished in procedural and post procedural adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be shown as mean and standard deviation, proportion of patients of the total&#xD;
      numbers who had a BAV. The cardiac catheter lab parameters before and after the BAV procedure&#xD;
      will be contrasted using a student's paired both tail T-Tests. A p value of less than 0.05&#xD;
      will be considered significant. Categorical variables will be compared using a chi- square&#xD;
      test. The association between the risk factors and the outcome of interest will be tested&#xD;
      with a Cox proportional hazards model. In addition Kaplan-Meier survival curves will be used&#xD;
      to determine the time from BAV to procedural death and overall survival differentiated by&#xD;
      each type of BAV indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be reviewed by Data Advisory Group for completeness and accuracy.&#xD;
