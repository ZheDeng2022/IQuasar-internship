      Aims: To evaluate the effect of ezetimibe/simvastatin and rosuvastatin on oxidative stress&#xD;
      and mitochondrial function in patients with DPN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We performed a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase II clinical&#xD;
      trial in adult patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) who had Diabetic Polyneuropathy&#xD;
      (DPN) evaluated by composite scores and nerve conduction studies (NCS), HBA1C &lt;12% (108&#xD;
      mmol/mol), previous exclusion of other neuropathies. Ninety-eight persons with T2DM were&#xD;
      allocated 1:1:1 to either placebo, ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/20 mg or rosuvastatin 20 mg for&#xD;
      16 weeks, and healthy controls (not randomized) were included for comparisons. Primary&#xD;
      outcomes were lipid peroxidation (LPO), nitric oxide (NO), and total antioxidant capacity&#xD;
      (TAC); secondary were clinical, NCS and metabolic parameters. Results were expressed as mean&#xD;
      ± standard deviation (SD) or standard error of the mean (SEM), frequencies and percentages.&#xD;
      Non-parametric analysis was used.&#xD;

      Introduction Nerve dysfunction system in patients with diabetes is known as diabetic&#xD;
      neuropathy and is considered as the most prevalent microvascular complication -up to 60%- in&#xD;
      type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) subjects. Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) comprise ≈70% of all&#xD;
      cases. Its diagnosis is established by means of validated scores based on clinical features&#xD;
      and abnormal nerve conduction studies (NCS). Pathophysiologic findings include loss of&#xD;
      multifocal and focal nerve fibers secondary to axonal degeneration an segmental&#xD;
      demyelinization, basically due to oxidative stress induced by chronic hyperglycemia, which&#xD;
      leads to neural apoptosis. Other mechanisms involved in peripheral nerve injure is&#xD;
      nitrosative stress induced by nitric oxide (NO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ezetimibe diminishes cholesterol esters content in chylomicrons by reducing liver cholesterol&#xD;
      intake which in consequence increases LDL uptake and plasma depuration; as monotherapy it&#xD;
      reduces LDL-C by 17%. When combined with simvastatin, cholesterol reduction is potentially&#xD;
      increased; furthermore, pleiotropic effects of statins include an increase on nuclear factor&#xD;
      kappa B activity and amelioration of superoxide ions after 12 week treatment. Another&#xD;
      hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A inhibitor, rosuvastatin, has an antioxidant effect by&#xD;
      acting as free radical carrier diminishing mitochondrial and cellular lipid peroxidation&#xD;
      (LPO) production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We conducted this study to evaluate the effect of ezetimibe/simvastatin and rosuvastatin on&#xD;
      oxidative stress in patients with DPN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study design A randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled phase II clinical trial&#xD;
      was performed in the Clinic and Experimental Therapeutics Institute, University of&#xD;
      Guadalajara, Mexico. Subjects were assigned to three group treatments in blocks with a&#xD;
      parallel sequence 1:1:1 through a randomized computer-based list, generated by a different&#xD;
      researcher unaware of drugs given. Patients were divided to: control group that received&#xD;
      placebo, ezetimibe/simvastatin and rosuvastatin as a daily single dose for 16 weeks. The&#xD;
      selection period was performed from February 2012 to January 2013. We selected 5&#xD;
      non-randomized healthy subjects (HS) from a blood bank to compare the oxidative stress&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population Inclusion criteria were ≥18 years old, T2DM according to American Diabetes&#xD;
      Association and DPN by Dyck et. al.3 criteria, HbA1c &lt;12%, and informed consent signed. They&#xD;
      were excluded if renal or hepatic failure, pregnant or breastfeeding, other neuropathies&#xD;
      (alcohol-induced, radiculopathy, autoimmune, cancer-related), and eliminated if lack&#xD;
      treatment adherence (&lt;80% of drug intake), severe adverse drug reaction and/or serious health&#xD;
      illness. Patients were selected by invitation in forums; outpatients recruited from primary&#xD;
      care clinics; and database collected previously by our Institute from February 2010 to 2012.&#xD;
      Patients were instructed to take their drugs only by night at the same time every day, as&#xD;
      follows: placebo 100 mg, ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/20 mg, and rosuvastatin 20 mg. All drugs&#xD;
      were similar in physical characteristics and presented in dark vials, carefully filled by&#xD;
      another group researcher, who placed a respective tag with the patient code. Also, patients&#xD;
      were provided with a diary where they would write down the date and time of drug&#xD;
      administration, and drug adverse reactions felt. Such information was collected and&#xD;
      registered every 4 weeks. Primary outcomes were oxidative stress markers LPO, NO, and TAC&#xD;
      before and after 16 week intervention. Secondary outcomes were clinical, NCS and metabolic&#xD;
      [fasting glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol, high and low density lipoproteins (HDL, LDL), and&#xD;
      triglycerides] parameters. Safety profile was assessed with drug adverse reactions, renal&#xD;
      (urea, creatinin), and hepatic [(alamin- and aspartate-aminotransferase,&#xD;
      gama-glutamyltransferase, bilirubins and phosphokinase] laboratory variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidative stress and mitochondrial function markers LPO was measured according to kit&#xD;
      specifications (Oxford Biomedical Research Inc., FR12), 200 μL of serum where processed with&#xD;
      a chromogen substance that reacts with malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxy-alkenals (HNA),&#xD;
      the absorbance measured at 586 nm, and results expressed in nmol/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous deproteinization of the samples, we performed a colorimetric for determining the&#xD;
      concentration of NO with 85 µL of serum (Nitric Oxide Assay Kit, User protocol 482650), with&#xD;
      results expressed as pmol/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was realized with 200 µL of serum, to obtain values of&#xD;
      millimole (mM) equivalent of uric acid (Total Antioxidant Power Kit, No. 02090130, Oxford&#xD;
      Biomedical Research®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and nerve conduction variables Neuropathic symptoms (NSS) and disability scores&#xD;
      (NIS) described by Dyck, et. al. were obtained by physical examination and anamnesis. We also&#xD;
      measured the latency, duration, amplitude and motor nerve conduction velocity from fibula,&#xD;
      tibial, median and ulnae nerves, and sensitivity parameters from sural, median and ulnae&#xD;
      nerves, as required by the American Association of Electrodiagnostic Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations The study was approved by the Research and Ethics Committee of the&#xD;
      Health Science University Center, University of Guadalajara, Mexico. Identification codes&#xD;
      were assigned to each participant to guarantee patient confidentiality, and an informed&#xD;
      consent form was signed before entering the protocol, according to national and international&#xD;
      laws, and also as stipulated by the Helsinki Statements (http://www.wma.net/es/30&#xD;
      publications/ 10 policies/b3/17c.pdf, accessed January 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The sample size was obtained by a clinical study design formula taking&#xD;
      in account a difference change of 0.05 nmol/mL in LPO, 95% confidence interval, 80% potency,&#xD;
      and two-tailed p&lt;0.05, which resulted in 21 for each group. Quantitative variables were&#xD;
      expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests were&#xD;
      performed to determine the non-parametric distribution of variables. Friedman and Wilcoxon&#xD;
      tests were realized for before and after measurements, and Kruskal-Wallis with Mann-Whitney´s&#xD;
      U as post-hoc analysis for between group comparisons. Qualitative variables were expressed as&#xD;
      frequencies and percentages. Chi square test was used to evaluate differences in dichotomy&#xD;
      variables before and after treatment, between group comparisons were determined by Fisher´s&#xD;
      exact test and χ2 as needed. Significance level was established with p value &lt;0.05.&#xD;
