  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cone beam image is a part of the radiotherapy treatment machine and uses lower energy&#xD;
      xrays as the head of the radiotherapy machine moves around the patient in a circle. This&#xD;
      takes pictures that give 3-dimensional information, somewhat like a CT scan. These images are&#xD;
      better at showing the position of the tumour and surrounding soft tissues than the standard&#xD;
      xrays that were previously used. Cone Beam Imaging Technology is not new and has been used&#xD;
      regularly at The Christie for many years. The standard cone beam scan is taken before the&#xD;
      actual radiotherapy treatment or after the treatment has been delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT or Arc Radiotherapy) is a novel method of delivering&#xD;
      radiotherapy that involves the continuous movement of the radiotherapy treatment machine head&#xD;
      around the patient and MLC during radiation. Arc radiotherapy has been clinically implemented&#xD;
      at The Christie for prostate radiotherapy treatments and work is in progress for&#xD;
      implementation in lung radiotherapy. The continuous gantry rotation inherent to VMAT delivery&#xD;
      makes this simultaneous imaging possible, although there are concerns associated with the&#xD;
      impact that this may have on patient dose and image quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research is to assess whether the image quality of cone beam scans taken&#xD;
      during treatment are as good as standard cone beam scans taken before or after treatment used&#xD;
      to determine the accuracy of patient position and the tumour coverage by radiotherapy.&#xD;
