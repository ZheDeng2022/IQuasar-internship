    <description>All treatments will be given in the outpatient setting. A cycle is 21 days. The sequence of infusions on Day 1 will be IV paclitaxel (135 mg/m2), then IV bevacizumab (15 mg/kg, beginning Cycle 2). On Day 2 patients will receive IP cisplatin (75 mg/m2). Patients will be given twice-daily treatment with oral olaparib in cycles 1-6 for 7 consecutive days, starting on Day 2 (Days 2-8). IP paclitaxel (60 mg/m2) will be given on Day 8. Sequential cohorts of 3 patients will receive escalating doses of olaparib (50mg BID, 100mg BID, 200mg BID).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with histologic diagnosis of epithelial ovarian carcinoma, primary peritoneal&#xD;
             carcinoma, or fallopian tube carcinoma, following initial surgery. All subjects must&#xD;
             have had appropriate surgery for ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube&#xD;
             carcinoma with appropriate tissue available for histologic evaluation to confirm&#xD;
             diagnosis and stage. Pathology must be verified at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer&#xD;
             Center. Patients with initial cytoreduction surgery performed at outside hospitals&#xD;
             will be eligible for this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with the following histologic cell types are eligible:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  High grade serous adenocarcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Endometrioid adenocarcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Undifferentiated carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Clear cell adenocarcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Mixed epithelial adenocarcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (N.O.S.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Carcinosarcoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of ≥ 70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be entered no more than 12 weeks postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must agree to undergo genetic counseling and BRCA testing. Patients in the&#xD;
             expansion cohort must have a germline BRCA 1 or 2 mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Physical and Laboratory Test Findings&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PT such that international normalized ratio (INR) is ≤1.5 (or an in-range INR, usually&#xD;
             between 2 and 3, if a patient is on a stable dose of therapeutic warfarin) and a PTT ≤&#xD;
             1.5 times the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bone marrow function:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatic function:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST and ALT ≤ 3 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neurologic function:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neuropathy (sensory) ≤ CTC Grade 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Urine Protein Creatinine:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Urine protein creatinine (UPC) ratio must be &lt; 1.0 gm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If UPC ratio ≥1, collection of 24-hour urine measurement of urine protein is&#xD;
             recommended *&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  UPC ratio of spot urine is an estimation of the 24 urine protein excretion - a UPC&#xD;
             ratio of 1 is roughly equivalent to a 24-hour urine protein of 1 gm. UPC ratio is&#xD;
             calculated using one of the following formulas:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. [urine protein]/[urine creatinine] - if both protein and creatinine are reported&#xD;
                  in mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. [(urine protein) x0.088]/[urine creatinine] - if urine creatinine is reported in&#xD;
                  mmol/L *The UPCR has been found to correlate directly with the amount of protein&#xD;
                  excreted in a 24 hour urine collection. Specifically, a UPCR of 1.0 is equivalent&#xD;
                  to 1.0 gram of protein in a 24 hour urine collection. Obtain at least 4 ml of a&#xD;
                  random urine sample in a sterile container (does not have to be a 24 hour urine).&#xD;
                  Send sample to lab with request for urine protein and creatinine levels [separate&#xD;
                  requests]. The lab will measure protein concentration (mg/dL) and creatinine&#xD;
                  concentration (mg/dL). The UPCR is derived as follows: protein concentration&#xD;
                  (mg/dL)/creatinine (mg/dL). Patients must have a UPCR &lt; 1.0 to allow&#xD;
                  participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to&#xD;
             study entry and be practicing an effective form of contraception during the study and&#xD;
             for at least 6 months after receiving the final treatment of bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an Intraperitoneal (IP) port in place. If a patient does not have&#xD;
             an IP port, she must be willing to undergo surgical placement of one.&#xD;
