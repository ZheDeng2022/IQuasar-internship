  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar spondylolysis is a relatively common condition that causes severe and perennial back&#xD;
      pain in young populations. Conservative treatment of this condition may be futile, and may&#xD;
      eventually require surgical treatment such as direct repair of pars defect and a segmental&#xD;
      lumbar fusion with an anterior or posterior approach. Recently, of surgical treatment methods&#xD;
      for spondylolysis, direct repair surgery of pars defect has been focused due to its inherited&#xD;
      strengths. Most importantly, fusion surgery caused the affected segment to lose the nature&#xD;
      range of motion and furthermore adjacent segment to be adversely affecting such as adjacent&#xD;
      disc disease or degeneration, while direct repair theoretically could preserve the motion of&#xD;
      the affected segment, which do not cause the adjacent segment problems as being the fusion&#xD;
      surgery, as well as could produce better surgical outcomes with relatively less invasive&#xD;
      technique as compared to fusion surgery. Moreover, previous articles have demonstrated that&#xD;
      the direct repair surgery for spondylolysis of lumbar spine could achieve great functional&#xD;
      and radiological outcomes. However, most of the previous studies was conducted using lower&#xD;
      level designed study such as retrospective and small sample size, thereby prior literature&#xD;
      does not provide clear information on the therapeutic outcome of direct repair for lumbar&#xD;
      spondylolysis, especially for managing spondylolysis of young population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, The investigators aimed to evaluate and determine the outcomes of direct repair&#xD;
      surgery for lumbar spondylolysis in young population. To our knowledge, this is the first&#xD;
      report that describes the functional and radiological outcomes of direct repair for&#xD;
      spondylolysis in young populations with prospective cohort study design and relatively large&#xD;
      sample size.&#xD;
