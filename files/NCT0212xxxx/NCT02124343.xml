  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is a cornerstone of pulmonary rehabilitation in the treatment of Chronic Obstructive&#xD;
      Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Although researchers have shown numerous benefits with exercise in&#xD;
      COPD patients, most studies have only looked at exercise tolerance and psychological outcomes&#xD;
      following training. COPD is characterised by persistent inflammation that can cause&#xD;
      progressive decline in lung function and multisystemic complications. This inflammation can&#xD;
      be amplified in patients when they suffer acute exacerbations. There is a wellknown&#xD;
      relationship between exercise, immune function and risk of infection. Exercise has also been&#xD;
      shown to have an antiinflammatory effect when performed regularly. There is a lack of&#xD;
      research looking into the inflammatory or immune response to exercise in patients with COPD.&#xD;
      The exercise within this study will be individually tailored to patients with COPD based on&#xD;
      their validated 6 minute walk test (6MWT) but the protocol will involve interval exercise&#xD;
      that has been used previously. This type of exercise is considered most appropriate for&#xD;
      research into mechanisms of benefit because it maintains the exercise training effects of&#xD;
      other modalities (e.g. continuous low intensity aerobic exercise) while avoiding the&#xD;
      occurrence of limitations to exercise in people with lung problems (e.g. dynamic&#xD;
      hyperinflation). It also closely mirrors daily activity of someone with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to explore the effects of exercise specifically on immune function in&#xD;
      15 people COPD and compare any changes to 15 Controls. By better understanding the mechanisms&#xD;
      of how exercise affects inflammation, the investigators could eventually design better&#xD;
      Pulmonary Rehabilitation interventions, especially for those most at risk.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will undertake an interval exercise session (on a harnessed treadmill) (HP Cosmos Mercury 4.0, HP Cosmos Sports and Medical Gmbh, Nussdorf-Traustein,Germany) based on the average speed calculated from the 6 minute walk test (6MWT).&#xD;
Intervals are based on the work previously done by Mador et al., 2009 who used intervals of 150% (for 1 minute) followed by intervals of 75% (for 2 minutes) based on 80% average speed from the 6 minute walk test.&#xD;
This study repeated these intervals 7 times with a duration of 23 minutes in total for the exercise intervention with the 75% intervals at the start and at the end of the exercise session. No warm up was undertaken for this method as it was a walking exercise test and the risk of injury was minimised with use of the harnessed treadmill.</description>
