    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well lenalidomide works in treating patients with acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia that have had a decrease in or disappearance of signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      cancer, although cancer still may be in the body and may be likely to come back or spread.&#xD;
      Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, use substances made from living organisms that&#xD;
      may kill cancer cells by blocking blood flow to the cancer and by stimulating white blood&#xD;
      cells to kill the cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess relapse-free survival (RFS) of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)&#xD;
      treated with lenalidomide maintenance therapy after achieving remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess overall survival (OS) of patients with AML treated with lenalidomide&#xD;
      maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess event-free survival (EFS) of patients with AML treated with lenalidomide&#xD;
      maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the duration of remission (CRd) of patients with AML treated with lenalidomide&#xD;
      maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess toxicity and safety of lenalidomide maintenance in patients with AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess the effects of lenalidomide maintenance on natural killer (NK) cell modulation&#xD;
      and dynamics of minimal residual disease and their relationship to outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-12 months.&#xD;
