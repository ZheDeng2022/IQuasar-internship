      The aim of the present study is the evaluation of cardiovascular biomarkers in patients with&#xD;
      abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) or abdominal aortic occlusive disease AOD) undergoing open&#xD;
      (OR) or endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) with regards to short- and long-term outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By blood collection and measurement of the serum biomarkers Copeptin, N-terminal- pro Brain&#xD;
      Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP), cardiac Troponin I (cTnI), high sensitive Troponin T&#xD;
      (hs-cTnT) and C-reactive Protein (CRP) we expect an improvement of patients stratification by&#xD;
      assessment of cardiac stress tolerance. Data gathered may help to simplify the decision&#xD;
      whether an open or endovascular approach for abdominal aortic repair (OR and EVAR) should be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the predictive value of cardiovascular biomarkers (Copeptin, NT-proBNP,&#xD;
      hsTnT, cTnI, CRP) improve patient stratification and selection of surgical treatment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with aneurysmal or occlusive&#xD;
      disease of the aorta is high: more than 50 percent of patients suffering from peripheral&#xD;
      arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) or abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) do also have coronary&#xD;
      artery disease. As a result, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in patients undergoing aortic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying patients at increased risk of cardiac complications following major vascular&#xD;
      surgery is also part of the decision-finding process when patients are assigned to open or&#xD;
      endovascular surgery. The 30-day mortality rate for elective open aneurysm repair (OR) is&#xD;
      estimated to be 4 to 8%, while endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has a perioperative risk&#xD;
      of 1.2 to 1.6%. However, the early survival advantage of patients undergoing EVAR disappears&#xD;
      with time and all-cause mortality is similar for EVAR and open repair at late follow-up.&#xD;
      Patients treated by EVAR show a higher number of complications and reinterventions, and a&#xD;
      significant proportion of late deaths after EVAR are due to aneurysm rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, patients who need abdominal aortic surgery are required to undergo a thorough&#xD;
      medical examination, on the one hand to assess cardiac capacity, on the other hand to&#xD;
      estimate life expectancy. Current recommendations for the preoperative management of patients&#xD;
      undergoing major non-cardiac vascular surgery include physical examination and routine&#xD;
      performance of electrocardiogram and echocardiogram as part of a cardiovascular evaluation.&#xD;
      However, guidelines do not include routine screening with cardiac enzymes or cardiac stress&#xD;
      markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and the inactive precursor N-terminal prohormone of brain&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are valuable screening tools for identifying patients who may&#xD;
      suffer from heart failure. NT-proBNP plays an important role in heart remodeling and volume&#xD;
      homeostasis. It is an important indicator of prognosis in heart failure and after acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction. Elevated pre- and postoperative plasma NT-proBNP levels independently&#xD;
      predict postoperative myocardial injury, which is associated with adverse outcome in the&#xD;
      short- and long-term regardless of the presence of symptoms of acute coronary syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Copeptin is a novel marker that allows highly sensitive but unspecific assessment of stress.&#xD;
      Copeptin is the C-terminal fragment of provasopressin, the precursor peptide of vasopressin&#xD;
      (antidiuretic hormone). Vasopressin is released by the neurohypophysis in order to promote&#xD;
      water absorption and vasoconstriction, and thereby contributes to osmotic and cardiovascular&#xD;
      homeostasis. Due to the fact that Vasopressin is unstable in the peripheral circulation, the&#xD;
      stable Copeptin, which is released in equimolar amounts, is measured instead of Vasopressin.&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown that this peptide may also be applied for the assessment of the&#xD;
      risk of morbidity and mortality: increased copeptin levels are associated with poor short-&#xD;
      and long- term prognosis after myocardial infarction and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Troponins are widely used biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and acute coronary syndrome. Troponin is an essential protein of muscle cells.&#xD;
      Thus, damage to the heart muscle, such as coronary vasospasm, cardiomyopathy, heart failure&#xD;
      and myocarditis, can be indicated by elevated serum levels of cardiac troponin. The most&#xD;
      common cause of raised troponins is myocardial ischemia as a result of acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome or myocardial infarction. In patients undergoing major vascular surgery even early&#xD;
      small postoperative rises in troponin have been shown to correlate with adverse short- and&#xD;
      medium-term outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute-phase protein, is a sensitive marker of inflammation and&#xD;
      tissue damage. Elevated CRP levels are able to predict future atherothrombotic events, such&#xD;
      as stroke, coronary events and progression of peripheral arterial disease. Furthermore,&#xD;
      inflammation is crucially involved in atherosclerosis and plaque development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Prospective, non-randomized, open-labeled, observational study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      500 patients of the Department of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery of the&#xD;
      Wilhelminenhospital (Vienna). Preoperative evaluation includes electrocardiography,&#xD;
      echocardiography and internal medical examination. Comorbidities, history of cardiac events,&#xD;
      previous operations, routine laboratory tests and current medication are documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Sampling and Laboratory Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are obtained by venipuncture and collected in standard serum and EDTA tubes&#xD;
      preoperatively, 48 hours postoperatively, ten days and six weeks after surgery, centrifuged&#xD;
      for 20 minutes at 2000 G and the plasma is stored in aliquots at minus 80 degrees Celsius&#xD;
      until determination of the respective biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery is standardized by performing endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) or open surgical&#xD;
      procedures (OR). OR is performed in general anesthesia via a transabdominal or&#xD;
      retroperitoneal approach that allows repair of the aneurysmal or stenosed aorta with tube- or&#xD;
      bifurcated grafts. In contrast, groin access for EVAR is achieved in local anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study cohort consists of three study groups: patients with AAA undergoing EVAR, patients&#xD;
      with AAA undergoing OR and patients suffering from AOD undergoing open surgical repair. All&#xD;
      patients will be observed until complete follow-up (plasma samples at 0, 2 days, 10 days, 6&#xD;
      weeks and an annual outpatient checkup thereafter) or until a primary fatal outcome event.&#xD;
      The statistical distribution of the serum levels of the respective biomarkers is assessed by&#xD;
      a histogram. The skewed distribution prompts non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney-U) for&#xD;
      comparison of medians by (gender and status of survival). The effect of biomarkers on 5-year&#xD;
      postoperative survival (primary endpoint) is estimated in uni- and multivariate proportional&#xD;
      hazard models (Cox Regression) for establishment of a prognostic model. In order to adjust&#xD;
      for confounders, the latter includes classic cardiovascular risk factors (age, hypertension,&#xD;
      nicotine abuse, diabetes mellitus, history of cardiac events, high lipoproteins), which are&#xD;
      documented preoperatively and entered as covariates. Survival estimates stratified by the&#xD;
      three study groups will be shown in Kaplan Meier Curves (log-rank test). A two-sided p-value&#xD;
      (P) of less than 0.05 is considered to indicate statistical significance. Hosmer and Lemeshow&#xD;
      tests are performed to test for adequacy for all regression models (P &gt; 0.05). Tests for&#xD;
      proportional hazard assumption is performed through linear regression of partial residuals&#xD;
      (Schoenfeld) for each variable and 5-year survival time. Cox proportional hazards model are&#xD;
      presented as hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). All statistical analyses are&#xD;
      performed with the use of SPSS 20 (IBM Inc., Somers, NY 10589, USA.).&#xD;
