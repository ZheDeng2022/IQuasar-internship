    <textblock>
      The aim ot the study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of two new intensified&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens (gemcitabine (Gem)/nab- paclitaxel (PAC), FOLFIRINOX) as neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy protocol in locally advanced, non-metastatic pancreatic cancer (LAPC) and&#xD;
      consecutive conversion of the tumor to resectability.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective open randomized multicenter phase II trial with two arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suffering from histologically confirmed LAPC (and assessed as unresectable or&#xD;
      borderline resectable according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical&#xD;
      Practice Guidelines &quot;pancreatic adenocarcinoma&quot; version 1.2013) without metastases will&#xD;
      receive two different neoadjuvant treatment regimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First all patients receive two cycles Gem/nab-PAC (duration of each cycle 28 days) as&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy in equal measure and a first restaging is performed after these two&#xD;
      cycles based on imaging criteria. If there is no progression according to Response evaluation&#xD;
      criteria in solid tumors (RECIST 1.1) criteria at the first restaging, the patients are&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 relation to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two further cycles Gem/nab-PAC (duration of each cycle 28 days). or Four further cycles&#xD;
      FOLFIRINOX (duration of each cycle 14 days). After the neoadjuvant chemotherapy a 2nd&#xD;
      restaging is performed based on imaging criteria. All patients without progression at this&#xD;
      restaging or at an earlier time point undergo obligatory exploratory laparotomy irrespective&#xD;
      of imaging criteria to assess resectability. If they are evaluated as converted to resectable&#xD;
      during this exploratory laparotomy, pancreas resection in curative intent will be performed.&#xD;
      All patients with successful R0 or R1 pancreatic resection will receive three further cycles&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy with Gem/nab-PAC. Adjuvant chemotherapy will start within 4 to 8 weeks&#xD;
      after pancreatic resection surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further treatment of patients with PD after 1st or 2nd restaging as well as patients with&#xD;
      unresectable status based on exploratory laparotomy is under the discretion of the local&#xD;
      investigators (e.g. second-line chemotherapy in case of distant relapse or local&#xD;
      radiochemotherapy in case of local progression or definitive irresectability).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are followed up for local recurrence, progression and survival until death or&#xD;
      for at least one year after last application of study drugs whichever is sooner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The translational research conducts exploratory analyses for potential biomarkers of possible&#xD;
      prognostic or predictive value for efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in LAPC; including&#xD;
      analyses of circulating tumor cells, molecular pathways of pancreatic adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      including SPARC expression.&#xD;
