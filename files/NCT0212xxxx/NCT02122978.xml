  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing research evidence supports the effectiveness of mindfulness based interventions;&#xD;
      however, the exact mechanisms of change are poorly understood. Some evidence proposes that&#xD;
      self-compassion is an important mechanism of change in the effectiveness of mindfulness based&#xD;
      interventions. The current research will evaluate and compare the effectiveness of two&#xD;
      mindfulness meditation approaches; Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Mindfulness&#xD;
      based Self-compassion Therapy (MBSCT), for individuals with psoriasis, a skin condition&#xD;
      commonly associated with stress. Blood analyses will be conducted to assess and compare the&#xD;
      impact of the interventions on the immune system. Self-report questionnaires will explore&#xD;
      participants' psychological functioning (e.g. self-compassion, depression, anxiety, worry).&#xD;
      This study will also examine whether a relationship exists between immune functioning and&#xD;
      psychological factors. An audio-guided MBSCT programme will be piloted, with a view to&#xD;
      trialling as a more cost-effective alternative to traditional mindfulness interventions.&#xD;
      Findings will enable us to design more effective interventions in the future, and yield clear&#xD;
      results regarding the existence of a definite link between immunological functioning and&#xD;
      psychological functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main research hypothesis is that participants who complete a mindfulness based&#xD;
      intervention will experience significantly greater psychological well-being, symptom&#xD;
      reduction, and greater changes in telomerase and cytokine activity than individuals who only&#xD;
      receive treatment as usual for their psoriasis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research is a randomized, multi-site, blinded comparative study of&#xD;
      mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), Mindfulness Based Self-compassion Therapy&#xD;
      (MBSCT), minimal-contact MBSCT, and treatment as usual (TAU) in patients with psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment commenced in November 2013 and continued until March 2014. Participants were&#xD;
      recruited via the Department of Dermatology in St. Vincent's University Hospital. During&#xD;
      weekly dermatology clinics eligible participants were identified by medical members of the&#xD;
      Dermatology team and on expression of interest were referred to an Assistant Psychologist for&#xD;
      recruitment purposes. In addition participants were also recruited via an advertisement&#xD;
      placed in a national newspaper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to TAU (n=25), MBCT (n=25), MBSCT (n=25), or&#xD;
      audio-guided MBSCT (n=25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Time 1 (pre intervention), participants will be required to give blood (a 50ml sample,&#xD;
      i.e., roughly 10 teaspoons), and complete self-report measures on the same day as beginning&#xD;
      the mindfulness programme. As it has previously been indicated that cells may be sensitive to&#xD;
      sudden changes in stress, mood and time of day (Epel, 2012), blood samples will always be&#xD;
      taken after completing the self-report measures and at a relatively standardized time, e.g.,&#xD;
      between 3-5pm. Care will be taken to ensure that conditions are relaxed across all&#xD;
      participants, and a 10 minute rest period between completing the questionnaires and giving&#xD;
      blood will be enforced. Bloods can be kept at room temperate for up to 24 hours and then&#xD;
      prepared for storage below 60 degrees Celsius until PBMC analysis is to be conducted after&#xD;
      all samples have been collected at Time 1 (post intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Time 2, six-months and twelve-months follow-up, participants will again be required to&#xD;
      give 50ml of blood and complete all self-report measures via an identical protocol, and&#xD;
      analysis will be conducted again accordingly. Telomerase will be assessed using a TRAPeze&#xD;
      EXCEL Telomerase Detection Kit. This will be complemented by flow cytometry analysis of&#xD;
      telomere length. Serum cytokines before and after treatment will be examined by ELISA. This&#xD;
      should give an indication of the effect of treatment on systemic inflammation. We will also&#xD;
      examine the ability of PBMC from patients to produce proinflammatory cytokines, including&#xD;
      IL-6, TNF, IL-1, and others associated with anxiety and depression. PBMC will be activated&#xD;
      with innate stimulus such as LPS/zymosan. The production of cytokines will be determined by&#xD;
      ELISA. Highly sensitive CRP is also a marker for psoriasis and will be assessed by ELISA to&#xD;
      give an indication of overall inflammation. In regards to self-report measures, the following&#xD;
      psychological scales will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; Snaith &amp; Zigmond, 1994)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ: Meyer, Miller, Metzger &amp; Borkovec, 1990) 3 Fears&#xD;
           of Compassion Scales (Gilbert, 2009)&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Five Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ: Baer, Smith, Hopkins, Krietemeyer &amp; Toner,&#xD;
      2006) 5. World Health Organisation Quality of Life - BREF (WHO, 2004). 6. Dermatology Quality&#xD;
      of Life Index&#xD;
&#xD;
      Addressing our research question regarding the effectiveness of the mindfulness programs&#xD;
      involves a repeated-measures comparative group intervention design. 4x4 mixed-methods ANOVAs&#xD;
      will be used to assess pre, post and six/twelve month follow-up differences across the four&#xD;
      experimental conditions, with group as the independent variable and psychological experience&#xD;
      (e.g., depression, anxiety, worry, self compassion and mindfulness) or immunological activity&#xD;
      (e.g., PBMC telomerase and cytokines) as the dependent variables. Number of hours per week&#xD;
      practicing mindfulness during follow-up will be entered as a covariate. Effect sizes and&#xD;
      confidence intervals will be calculated post-hoc using G*Power in order to facilitate ease of&#xD;
      comparison between the study findings and other future studies and the relevant field of&#xD;
      literature. Bivariate Spearman's Correlations will be conducted to examine the relationship&#xD;
      between psychological variables and telomerase and cytokine activity on all four testing&#xD;
      occasions, respectively. Spearman's Correlations are chosen as a suitable non-parametric&#xD;
      correlation analysis given reports of telomerase as non-normally distributed (e.g., Epel et&#xD;
      al., 2010; Wolkowitz et al., 2012) and inspection of our own preliminary data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected on four occasions; pre and post intervention and at six and twelve&#xD;
      months follow up.&#xD;
