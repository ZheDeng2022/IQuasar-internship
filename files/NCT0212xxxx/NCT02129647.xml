  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the study drug, AXITINIB, has any effect on&#xD;
      tumors found in patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NF2 is a condition that mainly affects the skin and nervous system. It causes non-cancerous&#xD;
      tumors to grow on the nerves around a person's body. Some signs of NF2 include a gradual loss&#xD;
      of hearing and tumors growing on the skin, the brain and the spinal cord, which can lead to&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AXITINIB is an oral drug (taken by mouth) that is approved by the United States Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of other types of tumors. However, in this research&#xD;
      study, AXITINIB is considered investigational because it is not approved by the FDA for&#xD;
      treatment of NF2. Much is known regarding how well it is tolerated (handled), but&#xD;
      investigators do not know if it is effective in treating NF2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study will test whether AXITINIB may shrink tumors commonly found in patients&#xD;
      with NF2 or stop them from growing. This will help to decide if AXITINIB should be used to&#xD;
      treat NF2 patients in the future. AXITINIB is a drug that has been used to treat various&#xD;
      forms of cancer. It has not been studied for the treatment of tumors in NF2 patients.&#xD;
      Investigators have selected AXITINIB for this clinical trial in patients with NF2 and&#xD;
      NF2-related tumors because a very similar drug, bevacizumab, can shrink Vestibular&#xD;
      Schwannomas (VS) in some NF2 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pfizer, Inc., the manufacturer of the study drug, AXITINIB, will provide the AXITINIB being&#xD;
      used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To estimate the objective volumetric response rates to axitinib in adult&#xD;
      NF2 patients with VS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: To assess the toxicity of axitinib given daily in patients with NF2 and&#xD;
      to examine the association of objective measures of response on MRI, i.e. volumetric tumor&#xD;
      analysis with clinical measures of response, i.e. (audiogram), as well as quality of life&#xD;
      assessments (NFTI-QOL). In addition, response in non-VS tumors, such as other schwannomas and&#xD;
      meningiomas, may be explored.&#xD;
