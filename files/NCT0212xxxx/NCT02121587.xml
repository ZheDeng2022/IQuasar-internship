      The purpose of this pre and post intervention observational study is to evaluate&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes from an new clinical course which integrates Mindfulness and&#xD;
      Acceptance-based approaches from '3rd wave' Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with osteopathic&#xD;
      manual therapy treatment for patients with persistent pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is being conducted by the British School of Osteopathy (BSO) in London. In Stage 1 (in&#xD;
      progress, June 2013 to August 2014), a course was developed for self-referring patients&#xD;
      attending the BSO Clinic. In Stage 2 (September 2014 to May 2016), delivery will be expanded&#xD;
      to evaluate outcomes for patients attending National Health Service (NHS) General&#xD;
      Practitioner (GP) surgeries in South East London.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention consists of a pre-course screening interview; a structured course of six,&#xD;
      weekly, one-hour treatment sessions for individual patients; and an optional follow-up&#xD;
      interview after three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation study is being conducted by an independent study team from the National&#xD;
      Council for Osteopathic Research. Patients complete a set of standardised questionnaires&#xD;
      before the course and after six months to assess self-reported changes in quality of life,&#xD;
      well-being, activity levels, mindfulness and use of health resources. A sample of patients&#xD;
      will be invited to provide consent for a treatment session to be observed and/or recorded, or&#xD;
      to attend a follow-up interview after six months, to evaluate the quality of course delivery.&#xD;
      This is an observational study of patient-reported outcomes from a new intervention in a&#xD;
      single cohort of patients, so there is no formal study hypothesis but it is anticipated that&#xD;
      outcomes will include increased quality of life, well-being, and active engagement with&#xD;
      valued activities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The OsteoMAP course is a new clinical intervention integrating Mindfulness and&#xD;
      Acceptance-based approaches of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with manual therapy for patients&#xD;
      with persistent pain. In Stage 1 (in progress, June 2013 to April 2014) an intervention for&#xD;
      individual patients of six, structured, one hour sessions was piloted by osteopaths at the&#xD;
      British School of Osteopathy (BSO) in London with patients already attending the osteopathic&#xD;
      clinic. In Stage 2 (awaiting ethical approval, September 2014 to May 2016) recruitment will&#xD;
      be expanded to include NHS patients referred from, and treated in, participating GP practices&#xD;
      in South East London. The study aims to assess whether participants report improved quality&#xD;
      of life, well-being and engagement in personally-valued activities six months after their&#xD;
      course ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteopathy is a low risk form of manual therapy that promotes physical functioning in the&#xD;
      musculoskeletal system. Acceptance-based approaches promote a way of thinking that encourages&#xD;
      acceptance of unwanted experiences (i.e. symptoms which cannot be fully resolved) by&#xD;
      recognising that emotions, thoughts and physical sensations do not necessarily control&#xD;
      behaviour. Chronic pain is an increasing healthcare burden with significant psychological,&#xD;
      social and economic consequences but there is evidence that Mindfulness can be effective with&#xD;
      a range of mental and physical health problems, including chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational evaluation study includes a 'before-and-after' patient-reported outcome&#xD;
      study with an embedded qualitative interview study and a fidelity evaluation. There is no&#xD;
      control group or comparison with standard care. The programme was funded as a new service&#xD;
      development, not primary research, but will generate new data from pre and post course&#xD;
      measures using standardised self-report questionnaires at baseline and after six months. The&#xD;
      fidelity assessment of adherence and competence will evaluate whether the course being&#xD;
      delivered as intended, independently observed by a team from the National Council for&#xD;
      Osteopathic Research (NCOR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Posters will be placed in participating surgeries with information sheets for&#xD;
      doctors who wish to discuss the OsteoMAP course with patients. Patients will be invited to&#xD;
      'opt in' by completing application forms and invited to Pre-Course Interviews to screen for&#xD;
      eligibility and discuss the nature and potential benefits and risks of joining an&#xD;
      experiential course. Patients will complete standardised questionnaires before their&#xD;
      interview, either electronically on a laptop computer which submits data directly to the&#xD;
      evaluation team via Survey Monkey, or as paper copies with stamped addressed envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Course interviews aim to explore patients' willingness to try a new approach to pain&#xD;
      management and assess motivation and scope for change. Patients will be told about potential&#xD;
      psychological risks, as they will be invited to think about the full impact of pain and to&#xD;
      increase their awareness of both pleasant and painful experiences. Joint decisions will be&#xD;
      made about whether it is appropriate for a patient to join. If it is not clear, the patient&#xD;
      will be asked for permission to contact their doctor before a decision is made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Intervention: Patients will be invited to attend individual sessions, one hour a week for&#xD;
      six weeks, delivered by a clinical care team led by a qualified osteopath and up to three&#xD;
      senior student osteopaths. Sessions include osteopathic treatment, as appropriate for each&#xD;
      patient, and mindfulness and acceptance-based pain management exercises. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to attend the full course, which is based on the structure outlined in a key Acceptance&#xD;
      and Commitment Therapy text by Russ Harris ('ACT Made Simple', 2009, New Harbinger&#xD;
      Publications).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1: Living with pain - to help patients become more aware of how their current&#xD;
      reactions to discomfort limit them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 2: Living more flexibly with pain - to promote acceptance and create opportunities&#xD;
      for choosing more flexible, active responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 3: Living in the present - to strengthen mindfulness skills, body awareness and&#xD;
      develop skills to integrate painful and pleasant experiences into present moment awareness&#xD;
      and action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 4: Living a fulfilling life - to help patients become more aware of their values and&#xD;
      goals, build self-compassion, and engage with personally valued activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 5: Overcoming obstacles - to help patients develop the skills to overcome unworkable&#xD;
      habitual reactions to pain, and maintain engagement with values-based activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 6: Moving on - to help patients create personal self-care plans to promote well-being&#xD;
      and resilience and sustain their choices to do the things that matter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of each session, patients will be invited to choose home practices to develop&#xD;
      self-care skills and explore activities they may avoid because of pain. Activities are&#xD;
      optional and patients can choose to withdraw at any time, without giving a reason and with no&#xD;
      effect on their existing or future healthcare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: Patients will be offered optional follow-up interviews (not including treatment)&#xD;
      three months after their course ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following ethical concerns have been addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality: This study does not involve access to NHS patients' medical records. Paper&#xD;
      copies of personal and medical information (e.g. application forms, osteopathic case records)&#xD;
      will be stored securely by the OsteoMAP care team in administrative offices, in line with&#xD;
      current guidelines and standard BSO operating policies. Paper copies of consent forms and&#xD;
      anonymised audit data will be stored securely in locked cabinets and on password protected&#xD;
      computers in BSO staff offices. Only the care team will have access to clinical intervention&#xD;
      data, and only the evaluation team will have access to questionnaire data. Patient outcomes&#xD;
      will be collected as online questionnaires via Survey Monkey. A laptop computer will be&#xD;
      provided by the clinical team at the patient's first appointment to facilitate questionnaire&#xD;
      completion. Participants will submit their own data directly, immediately downloaded to the&#xD;
      evaluation team, so no personal details or data will be retained on the computer.&#xD;
      Participants who wish to complete paper questionnaires will be asked to post them directly to&#xD;
      the evaluation team in the stamped, addressed envelopes provided. After six months, follow-up&#xD;
      questionnaires will be distributed directly to participants by the evaluation team, by email&#xD;
      or post (as requested by the patient). Study data will be anonymised and patients will be&#xD;
      allocated unique identifying numbers. The database will be stored by the evaluation team on a&#xD;
      secure bespoke research server at Queen Mary University, London.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Courses will be run in private treatment rooms at the BSO and in GP surgeries in which rooms&#xD;
      have been made available for OsteoMAP clinicians. Personal or identifying details will be&#xD;
      deleted from interview transcripts, verbatim quotes used to illustrate findings will be&#xD;
      anonymised, and any potentially identifying details will be altered or deleted from all&#xD;
      written reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coercion to join the course: This has been minimised by adopting an 'opt-in' policy.&#xD;
      Practitioners can discuss potential benefits and risks but cannot directly refer patients&#xD;
      onto the course. Participants will be fully informed about the nature of the course and it&#xD;
      will be emphasised that it is a voluntary self-management option being provided by the BSO,&#xD;
      an organisation outside the NHS, and that choosing to participate, or not, will not affect&#xD;
      their usual healthcare. They will be asked to 'opt-in' on a Patient Application Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coercion to participate in course activities: This has been minimised by ensuring that&#xD;
      participants are aware that activities are optional and each session is guided by their&#xD;
      personal goals and needs. Participants will be made aware that they can choose to withdraw&#xD;
      from a session, or the whole course, at any time, without giving a reason, with no detriment&#xD;
      to their usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk of physical harm: Mindfulness interventions and osteopathic care are both considered as&#xD;
      low risk interventions. Risks have been minimised through the use of inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria and screening interviews to check that participants are considered suitable. The&#xD;
      risks associated with manual therapy are low at &lt;1: 50,000 - 100,000 of a serious adverse&#xD;
      event after manipulation. The risks are even lower with other conservative (i.e. massage)&#xD;
      techniques used by osteopaths. Around half of patients may feel some short-lived (&lt;24 hours)&#xD;
      of minor muscle soreness after their first treatment. The practitioners responsible for&#xD;
      delivering the courses are clinically and educationally experienced and have received&#xD;
      additional OsteoMAP training. The student osteopaths involved are in their final year of&#xD;
      training, have been assessed as clinically competent, and will be carefully supervised in&#xD;
      each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk of psychological harm: Chronic pain is often associated with co-morbid mental health&#xD;
      issues such as anxiety and depression, and the risk of causing harm to vulnerable patients&#xD;
      has been minimised though the use of standardised questionnaire measures, inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria, and screening interviews to check that participants are able and willing&#xD;
      to participate in Mindfulness-informed interventions, which are also considered low risk.&#xD;
      This experiential course involves participants thinking about experiences of pain and the&#xD;
      effects on their life, an approach which has an inherent potential to cause some emotional&#xD;
      distress, which is clearly explained in the Information Sheets and Pre-Course interviews. In&#xD;
      treatment sessions, participants will be invited to try experiential activities and informed&#xD;
      in advance that these may cause some distress, a normal part of the process of exploring and&#xD;
      confronting beliefs and behaviour related to chronic pain. A qualified osteopath will be&#xD;
      available for any participants who need extra support during a session and the Project Leader&#xD;
      and Programme Developer will be contacted in the event of an adverse event. Supervision for&#xD;
      clinicians will be provided by the Programme Developer, an experienced Chartered Clinical and&#xD;
      Health Psychologist and Mindfulness teacher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance: The OsteoMAP Project Board report to the BSO Academic Council and are&#xD;
      subject to standard operating and quality assurance procedures. The clinical course is&#xD;
      supported by Patient Workbooks and Practitioner Training Manuals and is being externally&#xD;
      observed and internally audited. Practitioners delivering the course have participated in&#xD;
      additional training, and the quality of training and adherence and competence to the study&#xD;
      protocol is being monitored by the evaluation team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project oversight: The Chief Investigator/Project Leader, Programme Developer and&#xD;
      Administrator prepare activity and budget reports for the Board, which meets at least three&#xD;
      times per year, and annual reports for the Department of Health. Local audits will be&#xD;
      prepared annually as information for doctors about patient activity in their surgeries.&#xD;
