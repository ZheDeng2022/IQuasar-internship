      A Single Arm Phase II Trial of BMN 673 for Inoperable, Advanced Endometrial Cancer With&#xD;
      Retrospective PTEN, MSI and MRE11 Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTEN= Phosphatase and tensin homolog MSI= Microsatellite instability MRE11= Double-strand&#xD;
      break repair protein MRE11A&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will investigate whether the drug BMN 673 has therapeutic benefit in the treatment&#xD;
      of advanced endometrial cancer. Nearly 8,000 patients are diagnosed with endometrial cancer&#xD;
      in the UK every year. A significant proportion are either diagnosed with advanced disease&#xD;
      which may be inoperable and/or metastatic (i.e spread to other organs outside the&#xD;
      endometrium), or curable disease which relapses following first line treatment. There is no&#xD;
      established standard of care for these patients as both chemo and hormone therapy has limited&#xD;
      effectiveness and survival benefit. Survival rates have not improved in the past 20 years.&#xD;
      Furthermore there are no so called 'targeted' drugs licensed for its treatment i.e. drugs&#xD;
      that block the growth and spread of cancer by interfering with specific molecules involved in&#xD;
      tumor growth and progression. This leaves an unmet need for effective systemic treatments for&#xD;
      advanced, inoperable and metastatic endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BMN 673 has been shown to be potentially effective in treating cancers known to behave&#xD;
      similarly to endometrial disease, both in the laboratory and in Phase I studies involving&#xD;
      patients with advanced cancers. Similarly the drug appears to be relatively tolerable. A&#xD;
      Phase II trial such as the one proposed by this application could demonstrate activity that&#xD;
      might lead to a new effective treatment for patients with inoperable, advanced, recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic endometrial cancer, while the proposed substudy also presents the possibility of&#xD;
      discovering a subset of patients more likely to derive benefit from BMN 673.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is for adult women (18 and above) with advanced, inoperable or metastatic&#xD;
      endometrial cancer. Patients will be recruited from approximately 15 National Health Service&#xD;
      (NHS) Trusts based in the United Kingdom (UK). The study is expected to last approximately&#xD;
      18-24 months in terms of recruitment time, and a maximum of 100 eligible women will be&#xD;
      registered. All patients will receive BMN 673 until their disease worsens or their doctor&#xD;
      decides they should stop treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed endometrial cancer. All histological subtypes except for&#xD;
             carcinosarcoma are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of inoperable, advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease by imaging and/or&#xD;
             histological criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≤ 1 previous line of systemic cancer therapy for inoperable, advanced, recurrent or&#xD;
             metastatic endometrial cancer. Chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting is not considered&#xD;
             a prior line of therapy unless recurrence occurred during adjuvant treatment or ≤ 6&#xD;
             months after the last treatment; first line treatment of advanced disease must include&#xD;
             at least one cytotoxic agent to be considered as a line of therapy; prior hormonal&#xD;
             treatment is not considered a line of therapy in any setting&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent obtained prior to any screening procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must give consent for provision of archival histological tissue for the&#xD;

             undergo biopsy where feasible. If biopsy is not feasible or the patient does not give&#xD;
             consent for biopsy when archival tissue is not available, the patient will not be&#xD;
             eligible for the trial. The quality and quantity of archival tissue will be assessed&#xD;
             by a suitably qualified individual, usually a histopathologist, at site to ensure&#xD;
             adequate tissue sample available for testing PTEN, MSI and MRE11&#xD;

          -  Patient has at least one site of measurable disease on radiological imaging (i.e.&#xD;
             target lesion) as per RECIST v1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of non-childbearing status and must not be lactating OR must have&#xD;
             postmenopausal status&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Serious concomitant non-malignant disease, uncontrolled organ dysfunction or medical&#xD;
             disorder considered by the Investigator to make the subject unsuitable for trial&#xD;
             participation including any psychiatric disorder that prevents informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant active cardiovascular disease&#xD;
