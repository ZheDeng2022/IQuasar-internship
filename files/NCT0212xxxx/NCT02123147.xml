    <textblock>
      Sj√∂gren's syndrome (SjS) is an autoimmune disease characterized primarily by exocrine gland&#xD;
      dysfunction, specifically of the salivary and lacrimal glands, resulting in dry mouth and dry&#xD;
      eyes symptoms. It can be systemic by affecting other organs including the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract, skin, lungs, vasculature, kidneys, bladder and vagina. Involvement of the musculature&#xD;
      can lead to fibromyalgia-like symptoms and chronic fatigue, while approximately 20% of&#xD;
      patients develop various neuropathies, including sensory, peripheral, cranial and myelopathic&#xD;
      neuropathies exhibited by cognitive impairments such as dementia, lack of concentration,&#xD;
      memory loss and various psychiatric disorders. Like most autoimmune connective tissue&#xD;
      diseases, SjS shows a sexual dimorphism with women affected 10-times more frequently than&#xD;
      men, suggesting a role for sex hormones in disease susceptibility or progression. One common&#xD;
      feature of SjS is it infiltration of mononuclear cells into the salivary and lacrimal glands,&#xD;
      aggregating into clusters referred to as lymphocytic foci (LF). Critical to the studies&#xD;
      proposed is the fact that a predominant cell population of LF is the pathogenic TH17 cell&#xD;
      that produces IL-17 cytokine and autoreactive B cells reactive to M3R, Ro, and La&#xD;
      autoantigens. The goal of this study is characterize the change in receptor gene repertoires&#xD;
      of autoreactive B and T cells at different time points during the disease process and examine&#xD;
      the correlation with various disease parameters.&#xD;

      Blood from patient and healthy controls will be collected once every 3-6 months. White blood&#xD;
      cells from blood samples will be separated. Tests will be done to see which substances these&#xD;
      cells make. Using sequencing techniques, the investigators will determine the genetic code of&#xD;
      the receptors expressed on these cells. The investigators plan to test how these cells change&#xD;
      over the period of at least 3 years at different visits. In addition, the investigators will&#xD;
      check how these changes relate to patients' general medical history relevant to autoimmune&#xD;
      disease, lab results and physical examinations and exams pertinent to the diagnosis of&#xD;
      autoimmune disease, and psychosocial data.&#xD;
