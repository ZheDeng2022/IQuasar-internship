  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The randomized, controlled trial is aiming at comparing local control rate between two&#xD;
      surgical resections, barrier resection and local wide resection with 1cm or equivalent normal&#xD;
      tissues. This is based on the fact that the goal of local surgical treatment is to remove the&#xD;
      tumor with negative margin and best functional outcome, but there is a lack of standard&#xD;
      principle of surgery. Some surgical oncologists recommended enlarging surgical field in which&#xD;
      case the associated muscle was removed from origin to insertion, the previous surgical scar&#xD;
      and radiation field were also grossly remove, though there would be extra trauma and&#xD;
      unacceptable function impairment, they believe that patients would benefit from &quot;big&#xD;
      operations&quot;. Most other surgeons would perform a sarcoma resection through normal tissues,&#xD;
      and reported a fair local control as long as a negative margin was obtained. As reported by&#xD;
      various authors, recurrent STSs are associated with higher risk to develop further recurrence&#xD;
      as compared to primary STSs, thus, efforts should focus on this category of STSs to improve&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;

      1. Background Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is a category of malignancy with mesenchymal&#xD;
           origin, its incidence is 10-20 cases/million and accounts for 1% of all human malignant&#xD;
           neoplasms. The most common STSs include undifferentiated polymorphic sarcoma/malignant&#xD;
           fibrohistiocytoma (UPS/MFH), synovial sarcoma, fibrosarcoma and liposarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The rarity of the tumor, the various subtypes and heterogeneous behavior make the&#xD;
           diagnosis and treatment of sarcoma a challenge. Many patients, especially those from&#xD;
           developing countries were diagnosed with a late stage disease or recurrent sarcoma being&#xD;
           treated with many unplanned resections, which would impact limb function or even&#xD;
           survival. Except those with unresectable diseases, surgical resection remains the&#xD;
           mainstay of treatment for soft tissue sarcoma, the defined aim of surgery is R0&#xD;
           resection with a good functional outcome. With development of modern strategy and&#xD;
           technique, limb sparing surgery has been implied in more than 80% of cases and was&#xD;
           proven to have similar local control as amputation without sacrifice of survival. The&#xD;
           most common limb sparing surgeries include compartment resection and wide resection.&#xD;
           Compartment resection has been gradually replaced by functional compartment resection,&#xD;
           aiming at more function preservation, while so far there has been no evidence-based and&#xD;
           clinically comprehensible definition of the term &quot;wide resection&quot;. Many textbooks still&#xD;
           advocate the need to obtain a 2- to 3cm surgical margin width in all directions when&#xD;
           resecting a soft tissue sarcoma, but some other orthopaedic and surgical oncologists&#xD;
           recommended 1cm or 5cm margin width for STS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Local recurrence-free interval is the major end-point in evaluating the quality of&#xD;
           surgery, functional outcomes and treatment morbidities are equally important end-points.&#xD;
           Five-year local recurrence-free estimations for limb and trunk wall sarcoma should be&#xD;
           below 20%, and approaching 10%. Margin status is reported to be a key prognostic factor&#xD;
           for local recurrence. Surgical margin width is determined mainly by the distance from&#xD;
           the tumor edge to the periphery of the specimen, and should be co-assessed by surgical&#xD;
           oncologist and pathologist. Different margin width of 1-5cm has been recommended for&#xD;
           obtaining a safe margin, as stated above, but in a limb sparing surgery, margins&#xD;
           exceeding 1 cm were obtained in only 47% of patients and it's nearly impossible to&#xD;
           obtain 2 cm margins in all directions for an extremity STS. With adjuvant therapies, a&#xD;
           close dissection can be adequate in order to preserve important functional structures，&#xD;
           but the following questions are unanswered:1. How close is safe for STS resection? 2. Is&#xD;
           a margin close to periosteum has the same oncologic result as a margin close to muscular&#xD;
           membrane or subcutaneous fat? As we all know that local anatomy influences sarcoma&#xD;
           growth by setting natural barriers to extension, and sarcoma might infiltrate or&#xD;
           compress surrounding structures, thus, a rational resection should be designed mainly&#xD;
           based on the understanding of these characteristics. Scientists investigated different&#xD;
           barriers and converted them into different margin width in order to facilitate a safe&#xD;
           resection. Among these efforts, a barrier resection was reported to be an option for&#xD;
           recurrent extremity STSs and obtained satisfactory local control.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Barrier resection was defined as &quot;en bloc&quot; removal of tumor with surrounding barriers.&#xD;
           The barriers include muscular fascia, vascular adventitia, epineurium and periosteum, in&#xD;
           some cases where there is no barrier, 3-5cm of healthy tissue is considered equivalent.&#xD;
           Barrier resection was developed according to the above characteristics of STSs, which&#xD;
           featured with the fact that sarcomas take the path of least resistance and initially&#xD;
           grow within the anatomical compartment in which they arose, and the phenomenon that skip&#xD;
           metastases are limited within the same anatomic compartment in which the primary lesion&#xD;
           is located. Furthermore, a barrier resection can be designed preoperatively based on&#xD;
           imaging studies and is easy to perform intraoperatively based on understanding of local&#xD;
           anatomy, and also, it's easy for pathologists to obtain materials for margin evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Another content of barrier resection is repair and reconstruction, which includes vessel&#xD;
           replacement, dynamic restoration, supporting and wound coverage. With the assistance of&#xD;
           repair and reconstruction, sacrifice of margin safety would be no longer needed and in&#xD;
           some selected cases, adjuvant radiotherapy would be spared.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Well defined &quot;R&quot; classification is widely implied to determine the margin status in&#xD;
           STSs, in brief, R0 is microscopically negative, R1 is microscopically positive but&#xD;
           macroscopically negative, R2 is macroscopically positive. The goal of resection is R0&#xD;
           resection with a good functional outcome, but it's impossible to confirm margin status&#xD;
           for all cut edges intraoperatively, while postoperative examination can't guide&#xD;
           intraoperative manipulation. So far there has been no evidence-based and clinically&#xD;
           comprehensible definition of the term &quot;wide resection&quot;, though many guidelines&#xD;
           recommended a 1cm normal tissue around tumor. Thus, our study aims at investigating the&#xD;
           difference between barrier resection and 1cm margin resection, with local recurrence as&#xD;
           main end-point, disease specific survival and functional outcome as secondary&#xD;
           end-points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aims First end-point: Compare the local recurrence between barrier resection and 1cm&#xD;
           margin resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end-point:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease specific survival (DSS) Functional outcome (MSTS) Surgical complications (Grade)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first end-point is to compare the local recurrence between barrier resection and 1cm&#xD;
      margin resection, it's designed based on the following facts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In compartment theory of Enneking, muscle is independent compartment and most recurrent&#xD;
           STSs develop in the same compartment as its original site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The &quot;R&quot; classification of UICC categorized resection margin with margin status, but not&#xD;
           margin width, most guidelines recommended 1cm margin resection and a muscle resection&#xD;
           from origin to insertion was not required any more. As a result, local control for&#xD;
           recurrent STSs was reported to have higher recurrent rate as compared to primary STSs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Some authors in China reported that barrier resection was effective in local control&#xD;
           with acceptable extremity functional outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From Jan. 2014 to Dec. 2018, as following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2014.01-2014.03: Methodology and infrastructure construction. 2014.04-2015.09: Sample&#xD;
      collection, Surveillance, data gathering. 2015.10-2018.12: Followup, data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with recurrent extremity STSs are candidates of the study, preoperative CT or MRI&#xD;
      should be taken for orientation. As reported previously, barrier resection was associated&#xD;
      with comparable local recurrent rate as primary STSs, closing to 15% and 5% of amputation&#xD;
      rate, while Eilber reported a recurrent rate and amputation rate for recurrent STSs of 18%&#xD;
      and 38%, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscles in trunk don't have independent compartment, thus a barrier resection is not feasible&#xD;
      for patients with trunk recurrent STSs. Retroperitoneal STSs have distinctive anatomy and&#xD;
      biological behavior, thus are also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Randomization: Patients would be randomized as 1:1 to two groups. Randomization should be&#xD;
      taken after radiological evaluation and inclusion. Patients would be stratified according to&#xD;
      histologic subtypes and adjuvant therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients would be followed up for at least 24 months for disease status and the survival&#xD;
      information will be followed up to postoperative 60 months.&#xD;
