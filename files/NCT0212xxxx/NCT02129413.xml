      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the Delta system in&#xD;
      the treatment of cerebral vasospasm post aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Delta system is intended to deliver electrical modulation signal to the carotid body, to&#xD;
      result in cerebral vasodilation and blood flow augmentation in the brain, for treatment of&#xD;
      patients suffering from vasospasm post aSAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical trial the Delta system in intended to be used on patients who have their&#xD;
      ruptured aneurysm secured, hospitalized in the neuro ICU (Intensive Care Unit) and are&#xD;
      anesthetized and intubated, diagnose as suffer from cerebral vasospasm, who fulfill all the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion as detailed in the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The system is intended to be used for up to 7 days under hospital supervision that is&#xD;
      routinely provided for stabilizing patients following SAH and securing aneurysms. Follow up&#xD;
      period is 30 days after end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Delta system is comprised from two main elements: Electrical Stimulation Unit (ESU) and&#xD;
      Delivery kit.The ESU is a reusable external autonomic stimulator unit, cable and graphic user&#xD;
      interface (GUI) software based on a PC tablet. The delivery kit is a disposable stimulating&#xD;
      leads shaft and accessories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure includes insertion of the leads shaft over a guiding needle via patient neck,&#xD;
      so electrodes are positioned adjacent the carotid bodies. Therapy parameters are set by the&#xD;
      physician and monitoring is continued during patient hospitalization to determine when&#xD;
      therapy can be discontinued and shaft removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty three (23) patients will be recruited to the study, including 3 roll-in patients. The&#xD;
      study is an open label, uncontrolled, non-randomized, multicenter feasibility study. This&#xD;
      study will recruit male and female adult patients with aSAH secondary to rupture of an&#xD;
      aneurysm, secured by coiling or clipping, and in WFNS grades I-IV. Only anesthetized and&#xD;
      intubated patients will be recruited for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates the safety and performance of the Delta system. The potential benefits&#xD;
      and risks of participation in this study are clearly identified in the informed consent form&#xD;
      and are to be explained to the subject prior to participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment - The Delta system is inserted by minimally exposure of the carotid&#xD;
      bifurcation. The system electrically stimulates the carotid body chemoreceptors, aiming to&#xD;
      achieve sustainable cerebral vasodilation for inducing enhancement of cerebral perfusion and&#xD;
      thereby minimizing ischemia and consequently prevent delayed neurological deficit. Treatment&#xD;
      with the delta system is intended for up to seven (7) days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manufacturing and assembling the Delta system is done in certified facilities. Further&#xD;
      information and complete details regarding device materials, specifications, design, quality&#xD;
      assurance, etc. can be found in the Investigator's Brochure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk to benefit rational - reverse vasospasm and increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) is the&#xD;
      major component of cerebral perfusion augmentation, results in reducing the rate of vasospasm&#xD;
      complication. The Delta system may provide vasospasm subjects with a novel treatment option.&#xD;
      Based on the Delta system design, the extensive pre-clinical tests conducted with the system&#xD;
      and the comparison to other similar devices and alternative treatments, the company believes&#xD;
      that the system is safe for use and beneficial for reduction of delayed cerebral ischemia&#xD;
      complication that are vasospasm related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan - Sample size for this study is determined by the secondary end&#xD;
      point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size of N=20 achieves:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  88% power to detect CBF decrease of ≥ 15% in at least one of the affected cerebral&#xD;
           arteries measured by TCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  88% power to detect increase in artery diameter of ≥15% in at least one of the affected&#xD;
           main cerebral arteries measured by DSA or CTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  99% power to detect CBF increase of ≥20% measured by CerOx monitor system or Licox®&#xD;
           monitoring system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All with an estimated standard deviation of 0.2 and with alpha of 0.05, using a one-sample&#xD;
      t-test analysis. The sample size also serves the qualitative analysis of the primary end&#xD;
      point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A t-test is any statistical hypothesis test in which the test statistic follows a Student's t&#xD;
      distribution if the null hypothesis is supported. It can be used to determine if two sets of&#xD;
      data are significantly different from each other for continues parameters (such as artery&#xD;
      diameter) , and is most commonly applied when the test statistic would follow a normal&#xD;
      distribution if the value of a scaling term in the test statistic were known. The estimation&#xD;
      for the significant clinical difference as well as the assumed standard deviation was based&#xD;
      on previous experience with the device. When the scaling term is unknown and is replaced by&#xD;
      an estimate based on the data, the test statistic (under certain conditions) follows a&#xD;
      Student's t distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management plan - Data management will be directly provided or contracted by the sponsor&#xD;
      and compliant to the requirements of ISO 14155:2011. The Sponsor or its designee will provide&#xD;
      the investigator with a Case Report Form (CRF) booklet for each subject enrolled in the study&#xD;
      and will train the site personnel in the correct manner of recording data. The appropriate&#xD;
      CRFs will be completed and signed by the Investigator as appropriate. All CRFs will be&#xD;
      completed in a legible manner in blue or black ink. Any corrections will be made by drawing a&#xD;
      single line through the incorrect entry, entering the correct information, and initialing and&#xD;
      dating the change. Data entry boxes or spaces should not be left blank, but instead should&#xD;
      indicate: NA for not applicable, ND for not done or &quot;-&quot;for missing or not available data. The&#xD;
      original signed forms, not copies, will be returned to the Sponsor. All clinical data&#xD;
      generated in the study will be submitted to the Sponsor or its designee for quality assurance&#xD;
      review, data entry, and statistical analysis. All forms will be reviewed for completeness.&#xD;
      Any recording errors will be corrected by contact with the appropriate clinical site.&#xD;
      Double-entry routines will be utilized to reduce data entry errors, and computerized editing&#xD;
      routines will be used to identify unusual data entries for verification prior to statistical&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
