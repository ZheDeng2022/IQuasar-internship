  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 multi-center study to evaluate the clinical safety and immune response of&#xD;
      ID-LV305 when injected intradermally in patients with advanced cancer. ID-LV305 is a novel&#xD;
      immunotherapy agent designed to target dendritic cells and stimulate the body's immune system&#xD;
      to fight the spread and growth of cancer for patients whose tumors express the NY-ESO-1&#xD;
      protein. Patients with melanoma, sarcoma, ovarian cancer, or small cell lung cancer that&#xD;
      express NY-ESO-1 may be considered for the trial. Selected sites will be evaluating ID-LV305&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab for patients with melanoma who have inadequately responded to anti-PD-1&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ID-LV305 is an agent designed to specifically target dendritic cells within the patient and&#xD;
      induce them to stimulate and generate cytotoxic T cell responses against the NY-ESO-1&#xD;
      protein, a molecule which is often expressed in certain types of cancer cells. This is a&#xD;
      first in human study of ID-LV305. The primary purpose of the study is to determine what dose&#xD;
      ID-LV305 can be given safely to patients with advanced cancers that express NY-ESO-1 protein.&#xD;
      ID-LV305 will be administered by intradermal injection every three weeks times four doses.&#xD;
      The study will have two phases. In Part 1, Dose Escalation, which has been completed, three&#xD;
      sequentially enrolled cohorts of patients were treated at one of four dose levels of ID-LV305&#xD;
      using a standard escalation design. Followed by Part 2 expansion where an additional 27&#xD;
      subjects were enrolled. In Part 2SA, Site-specific Amendment, patients with unresectable&#xD;
      and/or metastatic melanoma with an inadequate response to anti-PD-1 MAb therapy, defined as&#xD;
      SD or PD using RECIST criteria following at least 2 months of therapy. Patients with PD have&#xD;
      a tumor measurement increase of &lt;2-fold from the time of starting anti-PD-1 therapy, must not&#xD;
      be symptomatic or have worsening of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance&#xD;
      status due to their disease progression, and cannot have new CNS lesion. Patients must also&#xD;
      meet the lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), ECOG status, and no tumor size criteria are used in&#xD;
      Part 2SA.&#xD;
