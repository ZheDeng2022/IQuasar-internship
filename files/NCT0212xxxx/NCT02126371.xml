      LEO 32731 (&quot;Study Drug&quot;) is an investigational drug which is being developed by LEO Pharma&#xD;
      A/S (&quot;the Sponsor&quot;), with an aim to help people with skin conditions called psoriasis. The&#xD;
      aim (s) of this Study are to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effects of the Study Drug when given as different formulations intended for oral&#xD;
           administration (tablets and capsules)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The safety of the Study Drug and any side effects that might be associated with it&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The effect of food on the Study Drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Study will also measure how much of the Study Drug gets into the blood stream and&#xD;
           how long it takes the body to remove it and what affect the Study Drug has on the body.&#xD;

          1. Male subjects who are not willing, or whose partners are not willing, to use&#xD;
             appropriate contraception (such as a condom with spermicidal&#xD;

             respiration rate that, in the opinion of the investigator, increases the risk of&#xD;

             screening confirmed by a repeat assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects who have an abnormality in the 12-lead ECG that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
