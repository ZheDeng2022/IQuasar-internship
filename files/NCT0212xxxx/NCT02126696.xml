    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in a cohort of HIV-positive patients on first-line anti-retroviral&#xD;
      therapy (ART) in rural health facilities in Lesotho, Southern Africa. It examines virologic&#xD;
      treatment failure as well as chronic communicable and non-communicable comorbidities among&#xD;
      patients on ART. The study has two phases. Phase 1 consists of a cross-sectional survey to&#xD;
      determine prevalence of treatment failure as well as the prevalence of the following&#xD;
      comorbidities: diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, depression, alcohol&#xD;
      use disorder, hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Phase 2 is a cohort study, where patients with&#xD;
      treatment failure or a comorbidity or both are followed-up for 12 months.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Owing to successful scale-up and decentralization of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) in rural&#xD;
      Lesotho, the number of persons infected with HIV who stay alive increased dramatically. The&#xD;
      new situation of HIV having turned from a deadly disease into a chronic but manageable&#xD;
      condition creates a new challenge to health care providers in rural facilities of the&#xD;
      country. Patients on long-time ART may suffer from comorbidities endangering the success of&#xD;
      ART and their health and/or from ART-failure due to development of resistance of the virus.&#xD;
      The magnitude of the burden of comorbidities as well as ART- failure has not been examined&#xD;
      extensively in Lesotho yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has six major objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the prevalence of virologic failure and genotype-resistance of HIV among&#xD;
           patients on ART in rural Lesotho.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the prevalence of hepatitis C and hepatitis B among patients on ART in rural&#xD;
           facilities in Lesotho&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the prevalence of diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension and dyslipidaemia&#xD;
           among patients on ART in rural facilities in Lesotho&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the prevalence of depression and alcohol use disorder among patients on ART in&#xD;
           rural facilities in Lesotho&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To examine associations between chronic comorbidities and virologic outcome among&#xD;
           patients on ART in rural Lesotho&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To follow-up patients with virologic failure and/or comorbidity(ies) among patients on&#xD;
           ART in rural Lesotho&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design/Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is planned to take place in two districts of Lesotho: Botha-Bothe and Thaba-Tseka.&#xD;
      Prevalence of the selected comorbidities is measured in a cross-sectional, facility-based&#xD;
      survey in eight health centers and two hospitals from the two districts. Patients with a&#xD;
      detectable viral load will receive enhanced adherence counselling and a second viral load&#xD;
      measurement after 2-3 months. In case of confirmed virologic failure, a genotype resistance&#xD;
      testing will be done before patients are switched to second-line. Patients with specific&#xD;
      comorbidities or patients with virologic failure who had been switched to second-line ART&#xD;
      will be followed-up in a cohort study 12-18 months after the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results and Impact&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevalence of the selected comorbidities will inform the Ministry of Health as well as its&#xD;
      implementing partners on which chronic conditions might be most urgent to be addressed among&#xD;
      patients on ART in Lesotho and the national HIV-programme may be used to leverage on for&#xD;
      other chronic conditions. Data on virologic failure will inform on the prevalence of&#xD;
      virologic failure among a previously not virologically monitored cohort. Moreover it will&#xD;
      provide data on the resistance patterns among patients who fail on first-line ART and on the&#xD;
      one-year outcome after switch to a second-line regimen.&#xD;

    <description>All patients on first-line ART â‰¥ 6 months will receive viral load testing. Those with a detectable viral load will receive enhanced adherence counselling and again a viral load measurement 3 months after the initial viral load (as recommended by the consolidated WHO-guidelines). In case of persistent virologic failure (2 times detectable viral load) a genotype resitance testing will be done and patients will be switched to second-line ART. This will allow to validate the WHO algorithm for virologic failure in a remote, resource-limited setting.</description>
