    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well psychoeducational and behavioral strategies work&#xD;
      in reducing distress and anxiety in patients with multiple myeloma and their family&#xD;
      caregivers. Education and walking programs, may be able to reduce distress and anxiety and&#xD;
      improve the well-being and quality of life of patients with multiple myeloma and their family&#xD;
      caregivers. Understanding how different forms of education and support can promote emotional&#xD;
      wellness may help nurse researchers find ways to improve services provided to patients and&#xD;
      family members during cancer treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the effect of the intervention, as compared to the control group, on emotional&#xD;
      distress, the primary outcome, measured as anxiety in patients with multiple myeloma and&#xD;
      their caregivers at the transition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the effect, including the effect size, of the intervention, as compared to the&#xD;
      control group, on activation for self-management, fatigue, depression, and health-related&#xD;
      quality of life (HRQOL) in both patients and caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess the feasibility, acceptability, and content integrity of the intervention in&#xD;
      patients with multiple myeloma and their family caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Participants meet with a nurse in-person for approximately 30 minutes to receive&#xD;
      information about strategies for cognitive self-management of distress and an individualized&#xD;
      walking prescription to gradually increase their walking to 30 minutes per day, 5 times per&#xD;
      week. Participants wear a pedometer for at least 3 consecutive days during weeks 1, 6, and&#xD;
      12. Participants are also contacted by the nurse via telephone at 1 and 3 weeks for&#xD;
      supplemental counseling support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Participants meet with a nurse in-person for approximately 20 minutes to receive&#xD;
      National Cancer Institute (NCI) educational booklets and a link to the American Cancer&#xD;
      Society (ACS) website. Participants are also contacted by the nurse via telephone at 1 and 3&#xD;
      weeks but the calls are primarily social in nature and do not include counseling support.&#xD;
