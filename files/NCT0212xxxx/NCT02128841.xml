      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if rivaroxaban (Xarelto) is feasible and safe for prevention of major&#xD;
      complications in patients undergoing a mechanical aortic heart valve replace-ment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the value of molecular markers suitable for monitoring of anticoagulation&#xD;
      effectiveness of rivaroxaban and its correlation with transcranial Doppler emboli count in&#xD;
      patients undergoing a mechanical aortic heart valve replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design This is a prospective, open-label phase 2 pilot study with independent evaluation of&#xD;
      all outcomes and a historical control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients 30 in experimental group (patients in the center's registry database serve&#xD;
      as control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main eligibility criteria All patients between 18 and 70 years old receiving a mechanical&#xD;
      aortic valve replacement with a pre-operative left ventricular ejection fraction &gt;/=35%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions Experimental: Rivaroxaban 20mg p.o., once daily, for six months Historical&#xD;
      control: Phenprocoumon (Marcoumar) p.o., once daily Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Composite outcome of prosthetic thrombus requiring reoperation/intervention, major bleeding,&#xD;
      visceral ischemia, stroke, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction or death from any cause&#xD;
      180 days after intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each component of the composite outcome plus serious adverse events. Prosthetic thrombus&#xD;
      requiring reoperation/intervention plus non-clinically relevant thrombi will be used as an&#xD;
      additional safety outcome.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the overall incidence of complications associated with prosthetic cardiac valve&#xD;
      implantation has decreased considerably since its introduction more than 3 decades ago,&#xD;
      valvular thrombosis and systemic thromboembolism remain a major concern for cardiothoracic&#xD;
      surgeons, cardiologists, and other practicing clinicians because of the well-known potential&#xD;
      to cause devastating events including ischemic stroke and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Factors that contribute to the thrombogenicity of prosthetic heart valves include: altered&#xD;
      blood flow and haemostatic activation caused by vessel-wall disruption during surgery or&#xD;
      exposure of artificial surfaces to the circulating blood. Short-term parenteral&#xD;
      anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin is often used&#xD;
      until therapeutic concentrations of an oral vitamin K antagonist are reached. Vitamin K&#xD;
      antagonists, alone or in combination with aspirin, are used for long-term management of these&#xD;
      patients. However, Vitamin K antagonists are cumbersome to use, because of their multiple&#xD;
      interactions with food and drugs, and they require frequent laboratory monitoring. Therefore,&#xD;
      they are often not used, and when they are, rates of discontinuation are high. Many patients&#xD;
      receiving Phenprocoumon still have inadequate anticoagulation. Thus, there is a need for new&#xD;
      anticoagulant agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who self-monitor therapy with vitamin K antagonists at home rather than in a&#xD;
      laboratory are more often in the therapeutic range and have a lower incidence of&#xD;
      complications and hospital admissions than those who do not. Meta-analyses of randomized&#xD;
      trials have recently found that patient self-monitoring was associated with a 33% reduction&#xD;
      of risk of death, a 55% reduction of risk of thromboembolism, and a slight decrease in major&#xD;
      haemorrhage. Self-monitoring was also associated with improved quality of life and&#xD;
      satisfaction. However, the number of INR values within the target range in self-monitored&#xD;
      patients is still very poor, which is no more than 70% !, even taking in account a wide range&#xD;
      of INR 2.5-4.5. Another main obstacle to widespread use of patient self-monitoring is cost.&#xD;
      In the UK National Health Service, the estimated cost of patient self-monitoring is £122 000&#xD;
      per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) over 5 years and £63 000 over 10 years. This is not&#xD;
      cost-effective considering the commonly accepted threshold of £30 000 per QALY. Costs are&#xD;
      related to the portable INR-monitoring device, test strips, and patient education programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oral direct thrombin inhibitor - dabigatran etexilate - and two oral direct factor Xa&#xD;
      inhibitors - rivaroxaban and apixaban - are in advanced stages of clinical development and&#xD;
      are expected to replace oral vitamin K antagonists for many indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a published phase 2, dose-validation study investigating the use of dabigatran in&#xD;
      patients with mechanical heart valves (the RE-ALIGN trial). This trial was terminated&#xD;
      prematurely because of an excess of thromboembolic and bleeding events among&#xD;
      dabigatran-treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does the RE-ALIGN trial preclude the investigation of rivaroxaban and other direct oral&#xD;
      factor Xa inhibitors in patients with mechanical heart valves? Not necessarily! Coagulation&#xD;
      develops in at least two subsequent waves of thrombin generation and fibrin deposition, with&#xD;
      factor Xa playing a pivotal role for its amplification. In fact, since activation of 1&#xD;
      molecule of factor X results in the generation of 1000 molecules of thrombin, on a molar&#xD;
      basis factor Xa is more thrombogenic than thrombin and several lines of research show that it&#xD;
      requires less heparin to inhibit thrombosis prior thrombin formation than afterwards.&#xD;
      Therefore, there is a sound rationale for hypothesizing that direct factor Xa inhibitors may&#xD;
      be more efficient than dabigatran in preventing thromboembolic events among patients with&#xD;
      mechanical heart valves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: CATHAR is a pilot study to determine if rivaroxaban is feasible and safe&#xD;
      for prevention of major complications in patients undergoing a mechanical aortic heart valve&#xD;
      replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives will be to identify the value of molecular markers suitable for&#xD;
      monitoring of anticoagulation effectiveness of rivaroxaban and its correlation with&#xD;
      transcranial Doppler emboli count in patients undergoing a mechanical aortic heart valve&#xD;
      replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      CATHAR is a prospective, open-label, pilot, phase 2 study with independent evaluation of all&#xD;
      outcomes. The trial is based on a Bayesian design by incorporating historical information for&#xD;
      the control group for all analyses. All patients will receive an aortic valve replacement&#xD;
      with a bileaflet mechanical valve. Rivaroxaban (Xarelto, Bayer) will be administered to all&#xD;
      patients for prevention of complications. The dose of rivaroxaban is 20mg once daily.&#xD;
      Continuous bood monitoring will be performed during hospitalisation and at follow up. Before&#xD;
      hospital discharge and at 1, 3 and 6 months follow up all patients will receive an&#xD;
      echocardiography. Trans-cranial Doppler will be performed in 10 random patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of the study: Rivaroxaban patients will be switched to Phenprocoumon at 6 months follow&#xD;
      up.&#xD;
