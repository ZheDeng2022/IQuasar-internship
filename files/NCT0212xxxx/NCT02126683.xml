  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is a common form of autoimmune thyroid disease, which affects up&#xD;
      to 2% of general population. The annual incidence of HT worldwide is estimated to be 0.8 -&#xD;
      3.5 cases per 1000 persons. The thyroid gland attacked by a variety of cell- and&#xD;
      antibody-mediated immune processes. Various auto-antibodies may be present against TPO and&#xD;
      Tg, and ADCC is a substantial factor behind the apoptotic fall-out of HT. Activation of&#xD;
      cytotoxic T-lymphocytes in response to cell-mediated immune response affected by helper&#xD;
      T-cells is central to thyrocyte destruction. Recent studies showed higher pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines in serum of patients with HT, and suggested HT is associated with regulatory&#xD;
      T-cells dysfunction, imbalance of ratio of Th1 cell and Th2 cell, overexpression of Th17&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies suggested that pregnant women with HT, even at euthyroid state had higher&#xD;
      risk of spontaneous miscarriage, more frequent post-partum depression and higher depressive,&#xD;
      anger, and total mood disturbance risk compared to those without HT. Presence of thyroid&#xD;
      auto-antibodies is also associated with negative pregnant outcomes including gestational&#xD;
      hypertension, late abortion, fetal death, premature delivery and neonatal respiratory&#xD;
      distress. Neonates from mothers with ATD have higher rate of transient hypothyroidism.&#xD;
      Children of mothers with ATD had higher risk of positive serum thyroid auto-antibodies and&#xD;
      development of goiter and thyroid dysfunction. However, there is no suggested treatment for&#xD;
      subjects with HT who have normal thyroid function. Low-iodine diet and regularly follow-up&#xD;
      were suggested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) is an anti-malarial agent, and has been used to treat several&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases, including lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis for more than a&#xD;
      century. It reduced lymphocytes, production of auto-antibodies, cytokines, and immune&#xD;
      mediators, NK cell activity, and inhibits antigens presenting to CD4 T-cells of B cells,&#xD;
      dendritic cells and monocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study focuses on the effect of Plaquenil on thyroid auto-antibodies, inflammatory&#xD;
      markers, cytokines, and goiter size in euthyroid women with HT.&#xD;
