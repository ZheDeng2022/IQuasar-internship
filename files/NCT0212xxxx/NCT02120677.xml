      This research is being done to study the molecular effects of topically applied itraconazole&#xD;
      ointment on the growth of basal cell carcinomas.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer in Caucasians worldwide. Although&#xD;
      rarely metastatic, it can be locally destructive causing disfigurement and pain. Current&#xD;
      therapies include surgical removal, local destruction, radiotherapy and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advances in understanding the molecular basis behind BCCs indicate that mutations in the&#xD;
      hedgehog signaling pathway can lead to the development of many sporadically occurring basal&#xD;
      cell carcinomas (BCCs). An oral drug that targets the hedgehog signaling pathway has been&#xD;
      shown to be effective in treating patients with metastatic and inoperable BCCs. There is&#xD;
      evidence that itraconazole, a commonly prescribed antifungal medication may also affect this&#xD;
      pathway. It is not known whether itraconazole ointment applied topically can affect the&#xD;
      growth of BCCs.&#xD;

    <description>Itraconazole comes in the form of capsules and liquid (oral solution). It is FDA approved for treatment of systemic Blastomycosis, Histoplasmosis and Aspergillosis in immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients at doses ranging from 200mg to 400mg daily. The current FDA approved dosage recommendation for treating toenail onychomycosis (nail fungus) is 200mg PO per day for 3 months. Test materials in this study will be prepared as an ointment (compounded in petrolatum jelly).</description>
