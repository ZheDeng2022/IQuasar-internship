  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation of the trochanteric bursa is a common cause of hip pain. A bursa is a closed&#xD;
      fluid filled sac or sac-like cavity found between tissues that function as a gliding surface&#xD;
      to reduce friction. Bursitis is the inflammation of the bursa. Inflammation between the&#xD;
      trochanteric process of the femur and gluteus medius tendon/ iliotibial tract is the cause of&#xD;
      trochanteric bursitis. Several treatments exist for trochanteric bursitis, including a local&#xD;
      steroid injection. The injection consists of a mixture of local anesthetic and steroid&#xD;
      medications. The steroid is routinely mixed with a local anesthetic. The anesthetic acts to&#xD;
      diluent the steroid as well as act as a pain reliever. Various steroid preparations have been&#xD;
      used, at varying doses, for trochanteric bursitis. The steroid preparation, triamcinolone is&#xD;
      commonly used for various reasons. Besides the procedure associated and injection site risks,&#xD;
      risks associated with the use of steroids, though rare, exist. Short term, the steroid can&#xD;
      raise blood sugar levels and should be used with caution and be appropriately monitored in&#xD;
      diabetics. Additionally, the steroid can suppress the immune system. Long-term risks are&#xD;
      related to the dose and frequency of use. These risks include thinning of the skin, easy&#xD;
      bruising, weight gain, elevated blood pressure, cataract formation, thinning of bones and&#xD;
      joints. Studies have shown the effectiveness of local steroid injections for trochanteric&#xD;
      bursitis. Unfortunately, there is limited data on the ideal dose of the steroid preparation.&#xD;
      Triamcinolone of 40mg/ mL is commonly used, but, studies have shown effectiveness at various&#xD;
      doses, ranging 20 to 160 mg/mL. The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of local steroid injections of various steroid dosages for the treatment of&#xD;
      trochanteric bursitis.&#xD;

      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>This study is considered to be completed, because before leaving the institution the PI indicated the study status as completed and entered that actual enrollment number of 120 participants. No other information could be located or obtained for the study and therefore no specific results information can be included. The study status as completed and actual enrollment number of 120 participants should be considered an accurate representation of all available study information.</limitations_and_caveats>
