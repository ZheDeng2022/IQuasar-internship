  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label phase II trial of 38 patients with recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic SCCHN. Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance&#xD;
      status of 0-1 with good organ function and will be treated with six weekly cycles of&#xD;
      carboplatin, paclitaxel and cetuximab. Following assessment of response, the treating&#xD;
      physician at their discretion may continue to treat with weekly cetuximab as maintenance&#xD;
      until disease progression. The study is designed to evaluate whether this regimen improves&#xD;
      median overall survival (OS) as compared to an historical control population treated with a&#xD;
      platinum plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). There is currently no agreed upon first line therapy for&#xD;
      recurrent or metastatic SCCHN; regimen options are highly toxic, inconvenient and resource&#xD;
      intensive. Our study regimen has been used extensively for induction therapy and off-protocol&#xD;
      in palliative care, but treatment outcomes have yet to be defined by a clinical trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because of their high response rates and low toxicity, the taxane, carboplatin, cetuximab&#xD;
      regimens have frequently been adapted for use in the palliative setting. At UNC, we have&#xD;
      observed high rates of response, leading to symptomatic benefit and low toxicity. Further,&#xD;
      the regimen de-medicalizes the patient's life in several important ways. First, unlike with&#xD;
      the EXTREME regimen, no PORT or 4 day infusion is required. Second, the regimen gives only&#xD;
      six weeks of cytotoxic therapy. Finally, in our experience there is a low rate of severe&#xD;
      toxicity and this, coupled with the high rate of response, may improve quality of life. We&#xD;
      are not aware of any presented or published results on the use of this combination in&#xD;
      palliative therapy; with the adoption of this regimen in clinical practice, documentation of&#xD;
      its benefit via conduct of a clinical trial is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a study designed to detect an improvement in median OS versus a historical&#xD;
      control. The control arm from the EXTREME trial achieved a median OS of 7.4 months. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that a less toxic and more effective 3-drug regimen will result in improved&#xD;
      median OS compared with the control arm from EXTREME (median 7.4 months). The toxicity&#xD;
      associated with EXTREME is primarily attributable to the cisplatin and 5FU cytotoxic backbone&#xD;
      as its toxicity has been consistent in multiple studies of both palliative therapy and&#xD;
      induction therapy. If a 4-month improvement in OS is achieved with acceptable toxicity, we&#xD;
      will consider this regimen worth of further study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives will include characterizing changes in quality of life (QoL), symptoms&#xD;
      and toxicities. Patients will be encouraged to co-enroll into the UNCseq protocol for further&#xD;
      exploration of associations between genetic changes and clinical outcomes.&#xD;

The FACT-G is a 27 item measure of general QOL assessing function in 4 domains: physical well-being (PWB), social-family well-being (SFWB), emotional well-being (EWB) and functional well-being (FWB). Items are rated by patients on a Likert scale from 0 to 4, with all subscales summed to give a total score with a range of 0-148 Higher scores represent better QOL.</description>

        <description>Quality of life (QOL) as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Head and Neck (FACT-HN) questionnaire. The FACT-HN is the FACT-General (FACT-G) and a head and neck cancer specific, 12 item subscale given at baseline, at end of treatment, and at first follow-up visit. The FACT-G is a 27 item measure of general QOL assessing function in 4 domains: physical well-being (PWB), social-family well-being (SFWB), emotional well-being (EWB) and functional well-being (FWB). Items are rated by patients on a Likert scale from 0 to 4, with all subscales summed to give a total score with a range of 0-148 Higher scores represent better QOL.</description>

            <description>A 6 week course of weekly carboplatin, paclitaxel, and cetuximab will be administered to 38 patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN. Once protocol therapy is complete, cetuximab may be continued if the patient and physician agree. Within 3 weeks of the end of protocol therapy, response will be assessed, and if the patient has achieved at least stable disease, the treating physician may continue to treat with weekly cetuximab at their discretion until disease progression. Patients will be followed for a maximum of 3 years after the end of the 6 week treatment phase.&#xD;
Cetuximab: 400mg/m2 IV (in the vein) on day 1 of week 1 and 250mg/m2 IV (in the vein) on day 1 of weeks 2-6. Patients with stable disease may continue on maintenance therapy at the 250mg/m2 dose until disease progression.&#xD;
