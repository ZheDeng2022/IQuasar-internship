      Objective: To determine the immediate effects of oral alcohol consumption in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers on gut wall integrity as measured by I-FABP and LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized, single blinded cross over study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 15 healthy adult male human volunteers will be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: the consumption of alcoholic beverages (1 g/kg ethanol) of wine (12%) compared&#xD;
      to the consumption of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The aim of this study is to determine the immediate effects&#xD;
      of oral alcohol consumption in healthy volunteers on gut wall integrity as measured by I-FABP&#xD;
      and LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Subjects consume 1g of alcohol per kg bodyweight. One blood sample of 14 ml&#xD;
      followed by 6 samples of 8 ml will be drawn between 16.45 hours and 19:00 hours the day&#xD;
      after. The first 6 observations take place in a single visit followed by one observation in&#xD;
      short visit the next day. It is unlikely that subjects will experience any physical or&#xD;
      psychological discomfort from the withdrawal of a total of 62 ml of blood in 24 hours or the&#xD;
      consumption of the amounts alcohol or water mentioned above. The same protocol will be&#xD;
      repeated one week after the first visit in which the alcohol group and water group are&#xD;
      crossed over.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A common finding in trauma patients admitted to the ER with serious injuries is the presence&#xD;
      of alcohol abuse. Alcohol is involved in up to 40% of deaths from motor vehicle crashes, 60%&#xD;
      of deaths from intentional injuries, and 50% of hospital admissions for injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic alcohol consumption leads to a decrease in gut wall integrity in actively drinking&#xD;
      alcoholics and patients with alcohol induced liver disease. Animal studies show that the&#xD;
      mucosal damage caused by alcohol consumption increases the permeability of the gut to&#xD;
      macromolecules. This facilitates the translocation of endotoxin and other bacterial toxins&#xD;
      from the gut lumen to the portal circulation. In addition to increased endotoxemia other&#xD;
      studies show that the initial event in response to alcohol is an increased influx of&#xD;
      leukocytes leading to an enhanced release of noxious mediators, such as reactive oxygen&#xD;
      species, leukotrienes and histamine by mast cells. Alcohol consumption thus leads to a&#xD;
      decrease in gut wall integrity with increased endotoxemia and as a result induces an&#xD;
      inflammatory response. Data on the effects of acute alcohol consumption on gut wall integrity&#xD;
      in non-alcoholics is still scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients exposed to severe trauma, loss of gut wall integrity has been implicated as an&#xD;
      important contributor to the development of excessive inflammation [6]. Intestinal mucosal&#xD;
      damage develops early after trauma leading to loss of gut wall integrity and resulting in&#xD;
      translocation of luminal bacteria and toxins into the gut wall. This has been associated with&#xD;
      the development of an inflammatory response. This excessive inflammation can in turn lead to&#xD;
      the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) which can ultimately lead to multiple&#xD;
      organ failure (MOF) and death. Up to 20% of the deaths in trauma patients are due to the&#xD;
      consequences of SIRS and MOF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When assessing the effects of alcohol and severe trauma on gut wall integrity combined with&#xD;
      the fact that the two co-exist frequently one can hypothesize that the outcome for trauma&#xD;
      patients under the influence of alcohol is detrimental. Literature regarding this issue is&#xD;
      unequivocal, consisting only of relatively small retrospective series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population (base) 15 healthy adult male human volunteers will be included in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  male volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age between 18 and 60 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical history of alcohol abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  use of any medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical history of bowel disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will confirm meeting the inclusion criteria by signing the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation As there is currently no data available on the effect of alcohol on&#xD;
      gut wall integrity as measured by FABP the investigators will conduct a pilot study. The&#xD;
      chosen population size of 15 volunteers is based upon financial and organisational benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational product/treatment Subjects will consume either 1g/kg of wine (12%) or 600 ml&#xD;
      of water within 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Main study parameter/endpoint Primary Objective: The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      determine the immediate effects of oral alcohol consumption in healthy volunteers on gut wall&#xD;
      integrity as measured by I-FABP and LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gut wall integrity will be assessed using I-FABP as a measure of the integrity of the&#xD;
      enterocyte. Lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), a protein that binds LPS, will serve as&#xD;
      a measure of endotoxemia. Furthermore, the effect of alcohol on gut wall integrity markers&#xD;
      per se is assessed by artificially adding alcohol to blood and comparing it to&#xD;
      non-alcoholised blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following 'patient' characteristics are acquired to assess their possible effect on&#xD;
      FABP/LBP levels and to correct for any variance that is witnessed: age, weight, length, body&#xD;
      temperature and race.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures After informed consent fifteen healthy adult male volunteers, aged 18-60,&#xD;
      will participate in the study. They will be randomized into two groups: one will consume&#xD;
      alcohol, the other will consume water (see below). One week later, the groups will switch&#xD;
      Volunteers with a medical history of alcohol abuse or bowel disease or subjects using any&#xD;
      medication will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be fasting for 6 hours before sampling to obtain a reproducible alcohol&#xD;
      uptake. To avoid dehydration or hypoglycaemia, volunteers will be allowed to drink tea, water&#xD;
      or clear fruit juices until 2 hours before sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling: from each volunteer two samples of blood will be collected without additives.&#xD;
      The first sample (S1) of 14 ml blood will be divided in two halves: 5ml blood for analyzing&#xD;
      gut wall integrity without addition of ethanol, the other 5 ml will be analyzed after&#xD;
      addition of 5 µl of 96% pure ethanol to obtain a blood concentration of 1‰ ethanol. After the&#xD;
      first sample volunteers are randomized to drink either 1 g/kg ethanol in wine (12 gr/100 ml)&#xD;
      to obtain a blood alcohol level of 1 ‰ or to drink the same amount in water. The beverages&#xD;
      will be consumed in a maximum of 45 minutes. Thirty minutes after the last glass of beverage&#xD;
      is consumed, the second sample (S2) of 8 ml blood will be collected. The next 4 samples are&#xD;
      taken with one hour intervals (S3, S4, S5 and S6 respectively). The last sample is taken in a&#xD;
      second visit at 19:00 the day after. One week after this visit the same protocol will be&#xD;
      repeated in which the alcohol and water group will be crossed over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each sample I-FABP, L-FABP, LBP, IL-6, ALT, AST, GGT will be measured as well as the&#xD;
      alcohol permillage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal of individual subjects Subjects can leave the study at any time for any reason if&#xD;
      they wish to do so without any consequences. Any data collected so far will be destroyed. The&#xD;
      investigator can decide to withdraw a subject from the study for urgent medical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Replacement of individual subjects after withdrawal Replacement of individuals that were&#xD;
      withdrawn for whatever reason will take place if necessary. This will be concluded once&#xD;
      analysis has been done as this is a pilot study. Replacement will only take place when a&#xD;
      subject is not able to complete the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY REPORTING In accordance to section 10, subsection 1, of the WMO, the investigator will&#xD;
      inform the subjects and the reviewing accredited METC if anything occurs, on the basis of&#xD;
      which it appears that the disadvantages of participation may be significantly greater than&#xD;
      was foreseen in the research proposal. The study will be suspended pending further review by&#xD;
      the accredited METC, except insofar as suspension would jeopardise the subjects' health. The&#xD;
      investigator will take care that all subjects are kept informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse and serious adverse events Adverse events are defined as any undesirable experience&#xD;
      occurring to a subject during the study. All adverse events reported spontaneously by the&#xD;
      subject or observed by the investiga¬tor or his staff will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  results in death;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is life threatening (at the time of the event);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing inpatients' hospitalisation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is a congenital anomaly or birth defect;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is a new event of the trial likely to affect the safety of the subjects, such as an&#xD;
           unexpected outcome of an adverse reaction, lack of efficacy of an IMP used for the&#xD;
           treatment of a life threatening disease, major safety finding from a newly completed&#xD;
           animal study, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All SAEs will be reported through the web portal ToetsingOnline to the accredited METC that&#xD;
      approved the protocol, within 15 days after the sponsor has first knowledge of the serious&#xD;
      adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAEs that result in death or are life threatening should be reported expedited. The expedited&#xD;
      reporting will occur not later than 7 days after the responsible investigator has first&#xD;
      knowledge of the adverse reaction. This is for a preliminary report with another 8 days for&#xD;
      completion of the report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse reactions are all untoward and unintended responses to an investigational product&#xD;
      related to any dose administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unexpected adverse reactions are adverse reactions, of which the nature, or severity, is not&#xD;
      consistent with the applicable product information (e.g. Investigator's Brochure for an&#xD;
      unapproved IMP or Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for an authorised medicinal&#xD;
      product).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor will report expedited the following SUSARs through the web portal ToetsingOnline&#xD;
      to the METC:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SUSARs that have arisen in the clinical trial that was assessed by the METC;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SUSARs that have arisen in other clinical trials of the same sponsor and with the same&#xD;
           medicinal product, and that could have consequences for the safety of the subjects&#xD;
           involved in the clinical trial that was assessed by the METC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The remaining SUSARs are recorded in an overview list (line-listing) that will be submitted&#xD;
      once every half year to the METC. This line-listing provides an overview of all SUSARs from&#xD;
      the study medicine, accompanied by a brief report highlighting the main points of concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expedited reporting of SUSARs through the web portal ToetsingOnline is sufficient as&#xD;
      notification to the competent authority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor will report expedited all SUSARs to the competent authorities in other Member&#xD;
      States, according to the requirements of the Member States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expedited reporting will occur not later than 15 days after the sponsor has first&#xD;
      knowledge of the adverse reactions. For fatal or life threatening cases the term will be&#xD;
      maximal 7 days for a preliminary report with another 8 days for completion of the report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Annual safety report In addition to the expedited reporting of SUSARs, the sponsor will&#xD;
      submit, once a year throughout the clinical trial, a safety report to the accredited METC,&#xD;
      competent authority, Medicine Evaluation Board and competent authorities of the concerned&#xD;
      Member States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This safety report consists of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a list of all suspected (unexpected or expected) serious adverse reactions, along with&#xD;
           an aggregated summary table of all reported serious adverse reactions, ordered by organ&#xD;
           system, per study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a report concerning the safety of the subjects, consisting of a complete safety analysis&#xD;
           and an evaluation of the balance between the efficacy and the harmfulness of the&#xD;
           medicine under investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up of adverse events All adverse events will be followed until they have abated, or&#xD;
      until a stable situation has been reached. Depending on the event, follow up may require&#xD;
      additional tests or medical procedures as indicated, and/or referral to the general physician&#xD;
      or a medical specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Regulation statement The study will be conducted according to the&#xD;
      principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, October 2008 t)&#xD;
      and in accordance with the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO) and other&#xD;
      guidelines, regulations and Acts&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and consent All interested persons will receive a folder concerning the study at&#xD;
      least two weeks before start of the study. If the volunteer agrees in taking part of the&#xD;
      study, the volunteer will be asked to sign the informed consent and take it back to the&#xD;
      hospital on the day of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits and risks assessment, group relatedness Subjects consume 1g of alcohol per kg&#xD;
      bodyweight. One blood sample of 19 ml followed by 5 samples of 11 ml and one of 8 ml will be&#xD;
      drawn between 17.00 hours and 18.00 hours the next day. Observations will take place in two&#xD;
      six hour visits and two one hour visits. It is unlikely that subjects will experience any&#xD;
      physical or psychological discomfort from the total 82 ml blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteers will fast for six hours prior to the first blood sample to obtain a reliable&#xD;
      blood ethanol concentration. After sampling at 22.00 hours volunteers will be transported&#xD;
      homewards by taxi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compensation for injury The sponsor/investigator has a liability insurance which is in&#xD;
      accordance with article 7, subsection 6 of the WMO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor (also) has an insurance which is in accordance with the legal requirements in the&#xD;
      Netherlands (Article 7 WMO and the Measure regarding Compulsory Insurance for Clinical&#xD;
      Research in Humans of 23th June 2003). This insurance provides cover for damage to research&#xD;
      subjects through injury or death caused by the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The insurance applies to the damage that becomes apparent during the study or within 4 years&#xD;
      after the end of the study.&#xD;
