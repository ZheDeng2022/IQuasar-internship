      The most common reason for preterm prelabor rupture of membrane (PPROM) is an ascendance of&#xD;
      infection. Moreover PPROM is one of the main risk factors for chorioamnionitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PPROM-related morbidity and mortality is higher in the neonate than in the mother, especially&#xD;
      in case of intrauterine inflammation. Of note, the most common biomarkers like CRP and&#xD;
      leucocytes are not specific for uterine infections and have not been proven useful in these&#xD;
      particular cases. Studies in intensive care medicine could show that there is a possible&#xD;
      correlation between onset of infection and body-core-temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OvulaRing® is a non-invasive thermometer measuring the intravaginal temperature every 5&#xD;
      minutes. It was originally invented to assess the moment of ovulation and optimize fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty patients with verified PPROM between gestation week 22 and 27 should be included in&#xD;
      this study. After gynecological and physical examination within verification of PPROM women&#xD;
      will be informed and invited to participate in this study. Subsequently informed consent will&#xD;
      be obtained and the OvulaRing® placed into the vaginal fornix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to describe a possible correlation between core-temperature and common&#xD;
      biomarkers in clinical use for the detection of chorioamnionitis in patients with PPROM to&#xD;
      possibly assess the optimal time for delivery subsequently.&#xD;

      Introduction A prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) is defined as a loss of amniotic fluid&#xD;
      within a rupture of amniotic membrane before the onset of labour, as preterm prelabor rupture&#xD;
      of membranes (PPROM) refers to PROM before 37+0 weeks of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PPROM occurs in 3 percent of pregnancies and is associated with one third of preterm births.&#xD;
      There are multiple risk-factors for PPROM as maternal physiologic, genetic, and environmental&#xD;
      as well as life-style factors. Of note, history of PPROM in a previous pregnancy, antepartum&#xD;
      bleeding, cigarette smoking and genital tract infections, as the single most identifiable&#xD;
      risk factor, are strongly associated with PPROM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PPROM is diagnosed by the clinical loss of fluid from the cervical os. In case of not&#xD;
      immediately visible amniotic fluid loss during the gynecological inspection, it can be&#xD;
      diagnosed by ultrasound and verified by tests like the Amnisure© or the Fertisave© which&#xD;
      detect the alpha microgloubulin 1 or the IGF binding protein of the fetal membranes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Referring to a randomized controlled trial, the majority of pregnancies with PPROM deliver&#xD;
      within one week of membrane rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PPROM-related morbidity and mortality, which depends on gestational age, is higher in the&#xD;
      neonate than in the mother, especially in case of intrauterine inflammation. Pulmonary&#xD;
      hypoplasia, facial and orthopedic deformation can be the cause of prolonged, early PPROMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the incidence of infection is higher at earlier gestational ages, up to one third of women&#xD;
      with PPROM develop serious infections, including chorioamnionitis, endometritis and&#xD;
      septicemia. Responsible bacterias are enterococcus, staphylococcus or anaerobic species.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of antibiotic prophylaxis/therapy in PPROM is to reduce maternal and neonatal&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Women should be observed for signs of infection, including maternal&#xD;
      temperature, fetal heart rate, uterine contractions, and periodically common clinical&#xD;
      infection markers. As the most common biomarkers like CRP and leucocytes are not specific for&#xD;
      uterine infections, they have not been proven useful in these particular cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prematurity is the crucial risk to the fetus with PPROM in the absence of complications like&#xD;
      infection, before 34 weeks of gestation. Therefore, expectative management of uncomplicated&#xD;
      PPROM-pregnancies at this gestational age is routinely used. This includes blood cell and&#xD;
      infection monitoring, avoiding vaginal manipulation, antibiotic prophylaxis/treatment and&#xD;
      corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After having reached gestational week 34+ induction of labour is routinely performed, without&#xD;
      induction of lung maturity. The goal is a quick reaction to a chorioamnionitis with a prompt&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods This study is conducted as a single centre pilot study in patients with&#xD;
      PPROM. The study was approved by the local ethics committee of the Medical University of&#xD;
      Vienna (IRB number: 1031/2014). Study center is the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology&#xD;
      of the Medical Universitiy of Vienna General Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty patients with verified PPROM between gestation week 22 and 27 should be included.&#xD;
      After gynecological and physical examination within verification of PPROM women will be&#xD;
      informed about the study and invited to participate in this study. Subsequently informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained and the OvulaRing® placed into the vaginal fornix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OvulaRing® is a non-invasive thermometer measuring the intravaginal temperature every 5&#xD;
      minutes. It was originally invented to assess the moment of ovulation and optimize fertility.&#xD;
      This plastic ring including a high-tech-sensored thermometer should be placed into the&#xD;
      vaginal fornix for a maximum of 30 days, measuring the intravaginal core-temperature 288&#xD;
      times a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As there is no change of common PPROM-therapy, only clinical standard parameters will lead to&#xD;
      the termination of pregnancy. Directly before delivery the OvulaRing® will be removed and the&#xD;
      sensor-data will be analyzed with a special software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis In this pilot study, the investigators aim to describe a possible correlation&#xD;
      between core-temperature and common biomarkers in clinical use for the detection of&#xD;
      chorioamnionitis in patients with PPROM to possibly assess the optimal time for delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A correlation between temperature and CRP, leucocytes and IL-6 should be explored. Later on,&#xD;
      these facts may be used to optimize the standard procedures for a PPROM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In some studies there is pointed out that there is a need for new parameters for&#xD;
      chorioamnionitis. Maybe temperature monitoring can become such a new biomarker.&#xD;
