  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being offered to patients who have castrate-resistant (also known as&#xD;
      hormone-refractory) prostate cancer. The cancer has metastasized or spread outside the&#xD;
      prostate area to other parts of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of sequencing hormonal therapies&#xD;
      (abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide) and to assess treatment efficacy of these two agents.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide have emerged as standard therapies in metastatic&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Both agents improve outcomes in patients&#xD;
      previously treated with docetaxel and in those that are chemotherapy-naive. Although their&#xD;
      mechanisms of action differ, both abiraterone and enzalutamide target persistent androgen&#xD;
      receptor (AR) signaling. Abiraterone inhibits CYP17 and testicular and extragonadal androgen&#xD;
      production whereas enzalutamide directly antagonises the AR. Whether cross resistance occurs&#xD;
      between these agents if used in sequence is unknown, but theoretically disparate mechanisms&#xD;
      of resistance may allow for successful sequencing of these agents. Prior studies have&#xD;
      reported Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) response rates of under 10% in patients treated with&#xD;
      abiraterone after enzalutamide and 13%-29% in patients treated with enzalutamide after&#xD;
      abiraterone. Since these data were generated in small, retrospective series, a prospective&#xD;
      clinical trial is warranted to evaluate effects of sequencing abiraterone and enzalutamide. A&#xD;
      randomised phase II study is proposed in which patients with PSA progression on abiraterone&#xD;
      or enzalutamide will be crossed over to the opposite agent. Although not a surrogate for&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, PSA changes will be used to assess treatment efficacy since PSA expression&#xD;
      is driven by AR activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from determining optimal sequencing of abiraterone and enzalutamide in mCRPC patients,&#xD;
      a key issue associated with the use of these agents is identifying circulating biomarkers&#xD;
      associated with treatment response and resistance. Our group has preliminary data showing&#xD;
      that a high proportion of enzalutamide-resistant mCRPC patients and some&#xD;
      abiraterone-resistant mCRPC patients possess focal AR amplification in cell-free tumour DNA&#xD;
      extracted from plasma. In pre-clinical studies, other potential mechanisms of resistance to&#xD;
      these agents include increased expression of AR splice variants (abiraterone and&#xD;
      enzalutamide) increased expression of CYP17 (abiraterone), upregulation of the&#xD;
      stress-activated chaperone protein clusterin (enzalutamide only) and a point mutation (F876L)&#xD;
      in the ligand-binding domain of the AR (enzalutamide only). Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are&#xD;
      additional biomarkers of interest since they are implicated in tumorigenesis and are readily&#xD;
      detectable in plasma of mCRPC patients. Examination of these biomarkers in serum and plasma&#xD;
      is planned, with the aim of identifying potentially novel factors associated with treatment&#xD;
      efficacy and resistance in mCRPC patients receiving abiraterone and enzalutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cognitive effects of abiraterone and enzalutamide are not well described. Enzalutamide is&#xD;
      known to cross the blood-brain barrier and infrequently causes seizures, possibly related to&#xD;
      effects on the γ-aminobutyric acid-gated chloride channel. In the enzalutamide registration&#xD;
      study, a small subset (&lt; 5%) of patients also developed mental impairment disorders including&#xD;
      amnesia, memory impairment, cognitive disorder and disturbance in attention. Conversely, no&#xD;
      central nervous system effects of abiraterone have been reported. Cognitive testing will&#xD;
      therefore be undertaken in this study to evaluate potential differences between these agents.&#xD;
