  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of azacitidine and sonidegib or&#xD;
      decitabine and so see how well they work in treating patients with myeloid malignancies. The&#xD;
      hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays an important role in cellular growth, differentiation&#xD;
      and repair. Inappropriate activation of Hh pathway signaling and uncontrolled cellular&#xD;
      proliferation may be associated with mutations in the Hh-ligand cell surface receptor Smo.&#xD;
      Sonidegib binds to the Hh cell surface receptor Smo, which may result in the suppression of&#xD;
      the Hh signaling pathway and the inhibition of cancer cells. Azacitidine and decitabine may&#xD;
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Giving azacitidine together with sonidegib or decitabine may be a safe and successful&#xD;
      treatment for patients with myeloid malignancies.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of LDE225 (sonidegib) (days 1-28) in&#xD;
      combination with azacitidine (overall); LDE225 (days 1-7) in combination with azacitidine&#xD;
      (overall); and LDE225 (days 1-28) in combination with decitabine (overall). (Phase I) II. To&#xD;
      estimate the efficacy of LDE225 (days 1-28) in combination with azacitidine in the following&#xD;
      subgroups: untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/chronic myelomonocytic leukemia&#xD;
      (CMML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) overlap;&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory AML/CMML/MDS/MPN overlap; and myelofibrosis (MF) only. (Phase Ib)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the duration of response, time to progression, overall survival, and time to&#xD;
      AML or death (for MDS subjects) of LDE225 (days 1-28) in combination with azacitidine&#xD;
      (overall and by cohort). (Phase I/1b)&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To conduct correlative studies to measure HH pathway activation and inhibition and explore&#xD;
      biomarkers of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate quality of life (QOL) and patient-reported symptoms using the&#xD;
      Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF) and European Organization for&#xD;
      Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-Core (C)30 in&#xD;
      subjects treated with LDE225 in combination with azacitidine or decitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of erismodegib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) on days 1-7, sonidegib&#xD;
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 or 1-7* or decitabine IV on days 1-5. Courses repeat&#xD;
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *NOTE: Sonidegib PO QD is given on days 1-7 if in combination with azacitidine or on days&#xD;
      1-28 is given if in combination with decitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until&#xD;
      progressive disease and then every 6 months for 2 years.&#xD;

                                 implanted) are not allowed as it cannot be ruled out that the&#xD;
                                 study drug decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraception&#xD;

                                 surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at&#xD;
                                 least six weeks ago; in the case of oophorectomy alone, only when&#xD;
                                 the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow&#xD;
                                 up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing&#xD;
