    <textblock>
      This study is a multisite, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study of&#xD;
      MG01CI (low dose and high dose once daily) for 6 weeks compared with placebo in a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      of 60 adolescent and adult subjects with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). Following Screening,&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized to MG01CI or matching placebo at Baseline (Day 0) and the 6 week&#xD;
      Double-blind Treatment Period will begin on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 4 weeks of the treatment period will be a dose-optimization period,&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will start with two daily tablets: low dose metadoxine or matching blinded&#xD;
      placebo. At weekly visits/phone assessments, the investigator will evaluate the dose based&#xD;
      upon the investigator's assessment of safety and tolerability. If the subject demonstrates&#xD;
      safety or tolerability concerns with the low dose after 1 or 2 weeks of treatment, then the&#xD;
      subject will be discontinued. If there are no concerns about safety and tolerability after 2&#xD;
      weeks of treatment, then the dose will be increased to high dose or placebo. If at the high&#xD;
      dose there are concerns about safety and tolerability, then the dose will be either kept the&#xD;
      same or reduced to low dose for the remainder of the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a 2-week Follow-up Period after the last dose of study treatment or early&#xD;
      termination.&#xD;

      This study is a multisite, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study of&#xD;
      MG01CI (low and high doses of metadoxine once daily) for 6 weeks compared with placebo in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio of 60 adolescent and adult subjects with FXS. Following Screening, subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to MG01CI or matching placebo at Baseline (Day 0) and the 6 week Double-blind&#xD;
      Treatment Period will begin on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 4 weeks of the treatment period will be a dose-optimization period, during which&#xD;
      the subject's dose of MG01CI or placebo will be optimized. Investigators and subjects will be&#xD;
      blinded with regard to whether the subject is taking active drug or placebo. Subjects will be&#xD;
      blinded to anticipated dose (low vs high dose), while Investigators will not be blinded to&#xD;
      anticipated dose, low dose vs high dose. Every two weeks subjects will receive 2-week supply&#xD;
      treatment. A phone follow-up assessment of safety and tolerability will occur during&#xD;
      titration after 1 and 3 weeks of treatment; if the investigator has any significant concerns&#xD;
      regarding safety and tolerability, the subject will be assessed at the site at an unscheduled&#xD;
      visit. All subjects will be assessed at the site after 2 weeks and 4 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will start with either low dose or matching blinded placebo (2 tablets daily).&#xD;
      At weekly visits/phone assessments, the investigator will evaluate the dose based upon the&#xD;
      investigator's assessment of safety and tolerability. If the subject demonstrates safety or&#xD;
      tolerability concerns with the low dose after 1 or 2 weeks of treatment, then the subject&#xD;
      will be discontinued. If there are no concerns about safety and tolerability after 2 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment, then the dose will be increased to 2 tablets of either high dose of active&#xD;
      treatment or placebo. If at high dose there are concerns about safety and tolerability, then&#xD;
      the dose will be either kept the same or reduced to low dose for the remainder of the&#xD;
      treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last 2 weeks of the treatment period will be a dose-maintenance period. During the&#xD;
      dose-maintenance period, the subject will maintain his or her optimal dose as determined at&#xD;
      the end of the dose-optimization period. A phone follow-up assessment of safety and&#xD;
      tolerability will occur after 5 weeks of treatment (after 1 week of dose maintenance). If the&#xD;
      investigator has any significant concerns regarding safety and tolerability, the subject will&#xD;
      be assessed at the site at an unscheduled visit. The subject will be assessed at the site&#xD;
      after 6 weeks of treatment (after 2 weeks of dose maintenance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a 2-week Follow-up Period after the last dose of study treatment or early&#xD;
      termination.&#xD;

         13. Any psychiatric condition (eg, schizophrenia or personality disorder as diagnosed by&#xD;
             DSM-IV) or clinically significant or unstable medical or surgical condition that may&#xD;
             preclude safe and complete study participation as determined by the investigator using&#xD;
             medical history, physical examination, neurological examination, laboratory tests, and&#xD;
             electrocardiograms. Common diseases such as mild hypertension, well-controlled type 2&#xD;
             diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1C [Hgb A1C] &lt;6.5%), etc. are allowed per the&#xD;
             investigator's judgment as long as they are stable and controlled by medical therapy&#xD;
             that is constant for at least 8 weeks before randomization and subsequently throughout&#xD;
             the study. If there are any concerns about the suitability of the subject's medical or&#xD;
             surgical condition, the investigator should review the subject's history with the&#xD;
             medical monitor. Subjects with autism spectrum disorder or anxiety disorder will be&#xD;
