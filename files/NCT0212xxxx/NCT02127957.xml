  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the investigators research program is to determine whether a combined&#xD;
      exercise program (aerobic and resistance) improves abnormal glucose tolerance and diabetes&#xD;
      control in CF patients. This program of exercises to increase strength and muscle endurance,&#xD;
      exercise tolerance, will be assessed in a group of 12 CF patients with impaired glucose&#xD;
      tolerance. The effect of exercise will be compared with a control group of 12 patients also&#xD;
      glucose intolerant but do not participate in structured physical activity program. The&#xD;
      duration of the exercise program will be 12 weeks and several measures (glucose tolerance,&#xD;
      inflammatory profile, lung function, exercise capacity, muscle strength and endurance) will&#xD;
      be conducted pre and post program to assess the program's impact .&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 24 subjects with CF with impaired glucose tolerance or with diabetes related to CF&#xD;
      (CFRD) unmedicated will be recruited. Participants will be recruited through a research nurse&#xD;
      in CF , which will analyze the available data to medical records and seek the participation&#xD;
      of subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria . Patients receive during their&#xD;
      visit to the outpatient clinic of FK at Hotel -Dieu du CHUM hospital , a inform consent form&#xD;
      (ICF) for the study. Their intention to participate and the main inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be confirmed in a telephone interview conducted by a member of the team at the&#xD;
      IRCM. Finally, during the visit at the IRCM , the subject will get answer to his question for&#xD;
      ICF and ICF will be signed before any procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants who agree to participate in the research project must undergo a short&#xD;
      telephone interview (20 minutes) and 4 assessment visits ( approximately 1-5 hours) Pre (2&#xD;
      visits ) and post (2 visits ) study . The control patients with delayed exercises conduct a&#xD;
      further assessment visit at the end of the training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 1 EXERCISES : Patients in exercises group will be required to take part of two&#xD;
      supervised training sessions and 8 follow up phone call . The exercise program will be&#xD;
      performed three times per week for about one hour .&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 2 CONTROL: Participants in the control group will be contacted by phone once a month&#xD;
      following entry into the study. On this occasion a reminder to complete the physical activity&#xD;
      log will be realized. Following the visit #6 , patients in the control group will be invited&#xD;
      to participate in a second study phase to participate in supervised exercise program . This&#xD;
      participation will involve an additional 12 weeks of follow-up, which included the same visit&#xD;
      as Group 1 with exercises. In this case, to simplify participation and reduce the volume of&#xD;
      blood collected , the final visit (#5) of the project will also be the first visit of&#xD;
      exercises phase. This part of study, involves 2 supervised training sessions and 8 follow up&#xD;
      phone call . The exercises program will be performed three times per week for about one hour&#xD;
      .&#xD;
