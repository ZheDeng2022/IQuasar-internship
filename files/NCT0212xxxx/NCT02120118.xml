  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goals of hyperthermia combined with chemotherapy/radiotherapy on treatment&#xD;
      failure solid tumors are tumor response rate, while secondary goals are rates of acute and&#xD;
      late adverse effects, local control rate, distant metastasis rate, progression-free rate and&#xD;
      overall survival rate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to conduct a phase II clinical trial evaluating the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of combination of low temperature (40-43℃ range) hyperthermia and concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in treatment failure solid tumors. There are 3 reasons of conducting&#xD;
      this clinical trial. Firstly, it has been demonstrated that hyperthermia can enhance the&#xD;
      efficacy of chemotherapy, radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy in various cancers, with&#xD;
      acceptable safety profiles. Secondly, the salvage outcomes for treatment failure solid tumors&#xD;
      were frustrated. Thermal enhancement ratio (TER) was observed when using hyperthermia&#xD;
      combining radiotherapy or chemotherapy. This strategy should be investigated in its efficacy&#xD;
      in treating those failing from previous standard treatment and maybe several times of salvage&#xD;
      therapy. Thirdly, biologically reciprocal complementation between hyperthermia, chemotherapy&#xD;
      and radiotherapy was observed. The reason may be complicated, including theories involving&#xD;
      hypoxia, immunomodulation and reperfusion … etc. If the immunity microenvironment could be&#xD;
      improved by addition of hyperthermia, an unexpected survival benefit as compared with the&#xD;
      literature may be potentially demonstrated from this study.&#xD;
