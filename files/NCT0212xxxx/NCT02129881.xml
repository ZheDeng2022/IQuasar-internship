  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to assess cell therapy as a treatment to prevent kidney transplant rejection. The&#xD;
      trial will involve purification of naturally occurring regulatory T cells (nTregs) from&#xD;
      living-donor renal transplant recipients. The cells will then be grown in the laboratory and&#xD;
      re-infused into the patient five days after the kidney transplant. This trial is part of an&#xD;
      international European Union funded consortium aimed at evaluating cellular immunotherapy in&#xD;
      solid organ transplantation (The ONE Study). It is anticipated that immune regulation induced&#xD;
      by nTreg therapy can eventually be used to recude the need for conventional immunosuppression&#xD;
      in transplant recipients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decades of immunosuppressive drug development has produced an array of powerful&#xD;
      pharmacological agents, but the various drawbacks with these treatments leaves considerable&#xD;
      room for improvement. By harnessing the power of suppressive mechanisms in the human immune&#xD;
      system, regulatory cell therapy may be able to support peripheral tolerance and induce a&#xD;
      level of donor-specific unresponsiveness that allows for a reduction in the use of&#xD;
      conventional immunosuppression in organ transplant recipients. Several alternative regulatory&#xD;
      cell types have been identified as potential adjunct immunotherapies for solid organ&#xD;
      transplantation and are now approaching a stage of development that would allow clinical&#xD;
      testing in an early-stage trial. The EU-funded international ONE study consortium aims to&#xD;
      answer the question as to whether Treg treatment, or other immunoregulatory cell-based&#xD;
      therapies, can be advanced in the clinical management of solid organ transplant recipients.&#xD;
      This particular Treg trial aims to explored the potential of Treg therapy as an adjunct&#xD;
      immunosuppressive treatment in living-donor renal transplant recipients through a clinical&#xD;
      protocol design shared by other investigators in the ONE study group testing additional&#xD;
      regulatory cell therapies in seperate trials.&#xD;
