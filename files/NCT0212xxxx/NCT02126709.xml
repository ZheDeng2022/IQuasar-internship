      Importance This will be a proof of concept study - whereby we hypothesize that Repigel may&#xD;
      represent a paradigm shift in global acne treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, there has been a dearth of clinical evidence in this use of povidone-iodine for&#xD;
      inflammatory acne. This is likely due to staining related to iodine use, which is not&#xD;
      acceptable to consumers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial drug, Povidone Iodine, however, becomes colourless and odourless in a matter of&#xD;
      seconds after application on the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This represents an ideal product for which we may perform testing to look at its efficacy in&#xD;
      the management of acne.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mainstay in the pathogenesis of acne involves the overgrowth and proliferation of skin&#xD;
      micro-organisms, primarily proprionibacterium Acnes. Long term antibiotic therapy is usually&#xD;
      prescribed for a period of 3 to 6 months or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have revealed this form of antibiotic therapy is ineffective, patients are&#xD;
      usually poorly compliant, and also results in the formation of antibiotic resistant&#xD;
      micro-organisms,which in turn reduces treatment efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, Povidone Iodine with its antiseptic property represents a promising avenue for the&#xD;
      elimination of Proprionibacterium Acnes without the associated problems of long term&#xD;
      antibiotic use, and the development of antibiotic-resistance. It is cosmetically acceptable,&#xD;
      affordable, and easy to use.&#xD;

      Aim This is a proof of concept study - to determine the efficacy and safety of Povidone&#xD;
      Iodine in the treatment of acne.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology This will be a single centre, double blind, randomized controlled trial. There&#xD;
      will be 2 arms of 15 patients with a 2 month study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up at Week 0, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Capture baseline demographics&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Age b. Sex c. Race d. Lesion counts - total, inflammatory, non-inflammatory e. FDA score&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Efficacy evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. 5 point IGA score b. Total lesional count c. No. of inflammatory lesions d. No. of&#xD;
      non-inflammatory lesions e. Photography (+-) f. Scoring of the Cardiff Acne Disability Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Safety Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Score of itchiness b. Score of scaling c. Score of erythema d. Score of pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Primary end points -&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. percentage reduction in lesion counts from week 0 to week 8 i. total lesion counts ii.&#xD;
      total inflammatory counts iii. total non-inflammatory counts b. Proportion of subjects who&#xD;
      had a IGA score of 0 or 1 by week 8 c. Time to 50% reduction of total lesion counts&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Secondary end point&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Improvement of the Cardiff Acne Disability Index&#xD;
&#xD;
      Povidone Iodine will be applied on the face by the patient using his own finger tips - onto&#xD;
      his acne affected areas on the face.&#xD;
