      When people feel shame, they experience negative thoughts about themselves (&quot;I'm a bad&#xD;
      person&quot;) and urges to avoid others. Shame is related to many psychological problems, such as&#xD;
      depression, social anxiety, and borderline personality disorder (BPD). Because there are&#xD;
      currently no well-tested treatments for shame, this study will examine the utility of&#xD;
      Self-Acceptance Group Therapy (SAGT). SAGT is short-term group therapy that addresses shame&#xD;
      specifically. Changes in shame, mood, and behavior will be examined over the course of&#xD;
      treatment and a one-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on theory and existing evidence, Hypothesis 1a is that individuals with elevated&#xD;
      initial levels of shame will report improvements on all outcome measures (e.g., reductions in&#xD;
      trait shame, increases in self-acceptance) from pre-treatment to post-treatment, and&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1b is that these gains will be maintained at follow-up one month after treatment&#xD;
      completion.&#xD;

      Shame is an unpleasant self-conscious emotion that can be experienced following unwanted&#xD;
      outcomes and events (Lewis, 1971). Cognitively, shame involves the attribution of negative&#xD;
      outcomes to global, stable characterological flaws (e.g., thinking &quot;That happened because I&#xD;
      am a bad person;&quot; Tracy &amp; Robins, 2006). Behaviorally, shame involves urges to avoid or&#xD;
      withdraw from other people in order to hide perceived flaws (e.g., Lindsay-Hartz et al.,&#xD;
      1995). Shame has been theoretically implicated in the development and maintenance of many&#xD;
      forms of psychopathology and problematic behaviors, including depression, social anxiety, and&#xD;
      borderline personality pathology (e.g., Beck &amp; Alford, 2009; Clark &amp; Wells, 1995; Rizvi et&#xD;
      al., 2011; Schoenleber &amp; Berenbaum, 2012). Indeed, research indicates that shame is&#xD;
      ubiquitous in psychopathology (see Tangney &amp; Dearing, 2002), resulting in increasing&#xD;
      recognition that treatments specifically addressing shame are needed (see Dearing &amp; Tangney,&#xD;
      2011). Although a few promising and potentially shame-relevant treatments have recently been&#xD;
      described (Brown et al., 2011; Germer &amp; Neff, 2013; Gilbert, 2011), no well-validated&#xD;
      treatments currently exist and these novel treatments generally do not address both the&#xD;
      cognitive and the behavioral components of shame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence that shame involves both problematic thinking patterns and maladaptive actions&#xD;
      suggests that effective interventions for shame need to address each of these components.&#xD;
      Indeed, there is some initial evidence that cognitive and behavioral therapy techniques can&#xD;
      reduce shame, at least in response to specific triggers. For example, cognitive restructuring&#xD;
      in the context of cognitive processing therapy has been found to reduce trauma-related&#xD;
      self-blaming thoughts (Resick et al., 2002), and women instructed in how to use the&#xD;
      dialectical behavior therapy opposite-action skill to address a specified shame trigger&#xD;
      reported reductions in shame about the given trigger (Rizvi &amp; Linehan, 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drawing from this literature, a shame-focused intervention, Self-Acceptance Group Therapy&#xD;
      (SAGT), was developed to target both the cognitive and behavioral components of shame from a&#xD;
      cognitive-behavior therapy framework. SAGT is an 8-week group treatment that involves&#xD;
      psychoeducation and training in cognitive and behavioral shame-coping skills in order to&#xD;
      promote improvements in self-acceptance, which is the conceptual opposite of shame. For&#xD;
      example, group members are taught how to recognize and challenge shame-eliciting thoughts, as&#xD;
      well as how to effectively discuss shame-eliciting topics with others in order to alleviate&#xD;
      shame, foster adaptive social support, and enhance their ability to demonstrate&#xD;
      self-kindness/compassion. As in other cognitive-behavior therapies, group members complete&#xD;
      weekly homework assignments that allow them to practice their new skills. In addition,&#xD;
      in-session activities are used to promote further skills practice and target the social&#xD;
      disconnection created by shame. An initial version of SAGT was provided to 8 women Veterans&#xD;
      at the G.V. (Sonny) Montgomery VA Medical Center by one of the researchers (Dr. Schoenleber).&#xD;
      Preliminary data indicate that group members reported large reductions in trait shame (d =&#xD;
      1.55) and improvements in self-acceptance (d = 2.15). Based on feedback provided by these&#xD;
      group members, an updated version of the SAGT protocol has been prepared. The primary aim of&#xD;
      the present study is to examine whether the current version of Self-Acceptance Group Therapy&#xD;
      is effective in improving shame, as well as emotional and interpersonal functioning among&#xD;
      individuals with elevated shame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on theory and existing evidence, Hypothesis 1a is that individuals with elevated&#xD;
      initial levels of shame will report improvements on all outcome measures (e.g., trait shame,&#xD;
      self-acceptance, psychiatric symptoms) from pre-treatment to post-treatment, and Hypothesis&#xD;
      1b is that these gains will be maintained at follow-up one month after treatment completion.&#xD;

    <description>SAGT is an 8-week group therapy for persons with high levels of shame focused on providing psychoeducation regarding shame and self-acceptance and teaching skills for effectively responding to shame. SAGT is based on a cognitive-behavioral framework. Group members are taught how to recognize and challenge shame-eliciting thoughts, effectively discuss shame-eliciting topics with others, and build self-acceptance. Group members also complete weekly homework assignments that allow them to practice their new skills. All sessions include a review of homework and previously discussed concepts, introduction of new material, and in-session discussions/activities. The content of SAGT includes: defining self-acceptance and recognizing shame; increasing balanced thinking about oneself; improving social connections; increasing skillful interpersonal disclosure; challenging unhelpful expectations; handling setbacks; review and commitment to future practice.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible participants will be adults (age 18 or older) who are fluent in English (as&#xD;
             all materials will be presented in English) and report elevated levels of trait shame&#xD;
             on the Experience of Shame Scale (ESS) at screening. Specifically, based on past&#xD;
             research, individuals must score at least 55 on the ESS screening items, which is&#xD;
             consistent with levels of shame often reported by clinical samples. In addition, all&#xD;
             interested individuals must have a therapist/case manager/psychiatrist who provides&#xD;
             them with individual psychotherapy on a regular basis and for whom the participant is&#xD;
             willing to sign an Authorization for Release of Health Information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals will be excluded from the present study if they do not report significant&#xD;
             difficulties with shame (i.e. ESS screening item scores less than 55), do not have an&#xD;
             individual therapist/case manager/psychiatrist who monitors and addresses their&#xD;
             broader mental health concerns, are experiencing active psychosis (i.e. delusions&#xD;
             and/or hallucinations), or are experiencing an episode of mania.&#xD;
