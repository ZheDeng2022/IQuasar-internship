    <textblock>
      A total of 120 patients will be included in the study. Sixty patients are critically ill with&#xD;
      evidence of sepsis during ICU stay (sepsis group) and sixty patients are critically ill&#xD;
      without evidence of infectious organism (SIRS group). At admission, Patients data include&#xD;
      clinical status; SOFA score; central venous pressure; laboratory analysis and arterial blood&#xD;
      gas analysis are measured. Routine cultures will be obtained. The attending physician will&#xD;
      evaluate the patients for sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock as long as their stay in&#xD;
      ICU. A serum level of sTREM-1 and MNDA will be monitored.&#xD;

      A total of 120 patients will be included in the study. Sixty patients are critically ill with&#xD;
      evidence of sepsis during ICU stay (sepsis group) and sixty patients are critically ill&#xD;
      without evidence of infectious organism (SIRS group). At admission, Patients data include&#xD;
      clinical status; SOFA score; central venous pressure; laboratory analysis and arterial blood&#xD;
      gas analysis are measured. Routine cultures will be obtained. The attending physician will&#xD;
      evaluate the patients for sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock as long as their stay in&#xD;
      ICU. A serum level of sTREM-1 and MNDA will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At admission, patient's age, sex, weight and height were Patients data that include the&#xD;
      clinical status; sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score; temperature; heart rate;&#xD;
      respiratory rate; blood pressure; central venous pressure; laboratory analysis (complete&#xD;
      blood count, blood urea nitrogen, blood sugar, serum sodium, potassium, calcium, aspartate&#xD;
      aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, prothrombin time, albumin and CRP) and arterial&#xD;
      blood gas analysis were measured. Routine cultures of suspected sites, blood and urine were&#xD;
      obtained to determine the presence of infection. We attempted to maintain the patient&#xD;
      hemoglobin level at 10-12g/dl and central venous pressure at 8-12 cmH2o. When needed,&#xD;
      intravascular fluid replacement, blood products and inotropic or vasopressor agents were&#xD;
      administered. Each day the attending physician evaluated all the study patients for sepsis,&#xD;
      severe sepsis, or septic shock as long as their stay in ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The signs of sepsis were body temperature &lt;36C° or &gt; 38C°, tachycardia (&gt;90 beats/min),&#xD;
      ventilatory frequency&gt;20 breath/min or Pco2&lt;32mmHg (unless the patient was mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated), a white cell count ≥12×109 litre-1 or &lt; 4x 109 litre-1, or &gt;10% immature&#xD;
      neutrophils, in addition to the presence of infection. Severe sepsis is a sepsis associated&#xD;
      with evidence of organ dysfunction , hypoperfusion, acute alteration of mental status,&#xD;
      elevated plasma lactate, unexplained metabolic acidosis (arterial ph&lt;7.3), hypoxaemia,&#xD;
      prolonged prothrombin time or decrease in platelet count &gt;50% or ≤100×109litre1, oliguria and&#xD;
      hypotension defined as systolic arterial pressure &lt;90mmHg or a decrease of &gt;40mmHg. Septic&#xD;
      shock was defined as hypotension (&lt;90/60mmHg) in addition to sepsis syndrome persisting&#xD;
      despite adequate fluid resuscitation and requiring intropic support&#xD;
