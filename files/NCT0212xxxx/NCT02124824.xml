  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for one in every&#xD;
      four deaths in 2010 and costing over $300 billion annually in health care, medication, and&#xD;
      lost productivity. Heart failure (HF), a clinical syndrome that develops as a consequence of&#xD;
      heart disease, is characterized by the worsening of symptoms, such as dyspnea and fatigue,&#xD;
      upon exertion, collectively defined as &quot;exercise intolerance&quot;. Surprisingly, exercise&#xD;
      intolerance does not correlate with the degree of cardiac contractile (ventricular)&#xD;
      dysfunction, suggesting that changes in the peripheral circulation may be to blame for&#xD;
      exercise intolerance in this cohort. Though there are a host of factors that may contribute&#xD;
      to this impairment, disease-related increases in circulating endothelin-1 (ET-1) may be a&#xD;
      significant factor in the sequelae of exercise intolerance in HF. Thus, the overall purpose&#xD;
      of this Small Projects in Rehabilitation Research (SPiRE) proposal is to explore the&#xD;
      contribution of ET-1 to chronic vasoconstriction in HF patients, and to examine whether&#xD;
      inhibition of this pathway could improve vasodilatory ability, and thus exercise tolerance,&#xD;
      in Veterans with HF.&#xD;

      Specific Aim 1 will determine the direct effect of vascular endothelin-1 (ET-1) on skeletal&#xD;
      muscle vasoconstriction in HF and age-matched controls. Intra-arterial infusion of the ETA&#xD;
      subtype receptor will be undertaken to pharmacologically probe disease-related changes in the&#xD;
      ET-1 pathway at rest and during exercise. It is hypothesized that ET-1-mediated&#xD;
      vasoconstriction will be elevated in HF compared to controls at rest, such that ETA receptor&#xD;
      blockade will augment blood flow in HF patients to a greater degree than age-matched&#xD;
      controls. During exercise, the investigators anticipate that inhibition of the ETA receptor&#xD;
      will augment skeletal muscle blood flow in HF patients compared to age-matched controls,&#xD;
      leading to improved exercise tolerance and reduced skeletal muscle fatigue in this patient&#xD;
      group. Specific Aim 2 will determine the potentiating effect of vascular endothelin-1 (ET-1)&#xD;
      on sympathetic vasoconstriction in HF and age-matched controls. At rest, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that infusion of a sympathomimetic drug (norepinephrine, NE) will produce greater&#xD;
      vasoconstriction in HF patients compared to age-matched controls, demonstrating a&#xD;
      hypersensitivity of the alpha-adrenergic receptors. Inhibition of the ETA receptor will&#xD;
      reduce &quot;sensitivity&quot; of NE-mediated vasoconstriction in HF patients towards that of&#xD;
      age-matched controls, identifying ET-1 as a contributor to alpha adrenergic hypersensitivity&#xD;
      in HF. During exercise, it is anticipated that NE-mediated vasoconstriction will be greater&#xD;
      in HF patients compared to age-matched controls. Inhibition of the ETA receptor will reduce&#xD;
      NE-mediated vasoconstriction during exercise. This will augment skeletal muscle blood flow,&#xD;
      leading to improved exercise tolerance and reduced skeletal muscle fatigue in HF patients.&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that findings from the proposed work with ET-1 inhibition could&#xD;
      thus provide a &quot;missing link&quot; of information in the investigators' understanding of skeletal&#xD;
      muscle blood flow regulation and exercise tolerance in HF, ultimately leading to enhanced&#xD;
      quality of life in this cohort.&#xD;
