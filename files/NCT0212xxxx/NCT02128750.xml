      The primary objective of our work is to show that quantification of muscular&#xD;
      microvascularisation evaluated by injection of contrast agent is different between chronic&#xD;
      critical limb ischemia (before revascularization) and after (healing of ischemia) and thus&#xD;
      make the proof of its utility in evaluation of PAD therapeutics.&#xD;

      -  Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a frequent disease the incidence of which in men is&#xD;
           about 32.5°/°° before 40 years and 71°/°° after 50 years. Prevalence of the disease&#xD;
           increases with age to reach 3.7% of 60 to 69 year old subjects (Kannel 1970, 1985, Bloch&#xD;
           1985).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Critical limb ischemia (CLI) ischemia is defined by typical chronic ischemic rest pain&#xD;
           or ischemic skin lesions either ulcers or gangrene for more than two weeks (Norgren).&#xD;
           Incidence is about 500 - 1000 / 106 / year in Europe and United states. Critical limb&#xD;
           ischemia concerns 15 - 20% of patients with intermittent claudication (Eneroth 1992,&#xD;
           Taylor 1989). Development can lead to limb loss with a frequency estimated between 7% at&#xD;
           5 years to 12% at 10 years. Problem is crucial for patients who cannot benefit from&#xD;
           revascularization. Results of single medical treatments are uncertain. Development of&#xD;
           neovascularisation by innovating therapeutic (autolog cell stem grafts, intramuscular&#xD;
           growth factor injections ) represent an exciting and promising field of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral arterial disease evaluation and staging are based on measures of resting&#xD;
           ankle pressures, diagnosis of stenosis and obliteration (duplex, angiography, computed&#xD;
           tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging) and on measure of microcirculatory skin&#xD;
           perfusion by Tc PO2. On the other hand, there is no simple tool to measure muscular&#xD;
           microvascularisation whereas muscles suffer from ischemia in the same way as skin and&#xD;
           nerves. Measures of muscular perfusion can be performed by Tc 99, magnetic resonance&#xD;
           imaging but this is not used in clinical practice. CEUS used in routine to assess&#xD;
           hepatic microvascularisation has recently been shown to be potentially useful to study&#xD;
           muscle (Kramer 2008, Weber 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasonic contrast agents are intravascular microbubbles which used at low mechanical&#xD;
           index generate harmonics and allow real time imaging in ultrasonography. Their use&#xD;
           allows study of parenchyma enhancement in real time, notably of liver and kidneys; they&#xD;
           are also used in practice to differentiate benign and malign tumors (Correas 2009).&#xD;
           Correlations have been shown between muscle enhancement studied by CEUS and histologic&#xD;
           data of capillary vascularisation (Weber 2005). More recently some authors have shown&#xD;
           that CEUS may allow to differentiate patients with PAD at a stage of intermittent&#xD;
           claudication and patients without PAD (Duerschmied 2006).Very few studies have studied&#xD;
           patients with CLI. Duerschmied and all have shown that kinetic data of muscle&#xD;
           enhancement may reflect collateral circulation developed in reaction to chronic&#xD;
           ischemia. CEUS may be used to study muscular perfusion in the same way as TcPO2 reflects&#xD;
           cutaneous vascularisation and may become an evaluation criteria of PAD therapeutics in a&#xD;
           near future.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We propose to study muscular perfusion by CEUS in patients with critical limb ischemia&#xD;
           eligible to revascularization (PTA or bypass) before and after revascularization.&#xD;
           Microbubbles injection leads to an increase in muscle echogenicity in two sequences: a&#xD;
           rapid phase 15-20 s after injection (arteriolar filling) then a more intense second&#xD;
           phase (veinular and capillary filling) (Duerschmied 2006). These two phases may be&#xD;
           described by measures of acoustic intensity function of time and in particular time to&#xD;
           peak (TTP), area under the curve (AUC). Time to peak seems to be the more reliable&#xD;
           criteria (Duerschmied).&#xD;
