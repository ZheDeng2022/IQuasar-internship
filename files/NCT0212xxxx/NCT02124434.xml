      Surgery is considered the best therapy for morbid obesity and its comorbidities, where&#xD;
      alterations in lifestyle, diets and drugs have failed to achieve weight loss. The most widely&#xD;
      performed in Israel is Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG), and several studies have&#xD;
      reported high success rates in reducing weight and improving comorbidities common among obese&#xD;
      patients such as hypertension; diabetes mellitus type II; dyslipidemia; osteoarthritis;&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this prospective study is that the LSG is an effective treatment for&#xD;
      achieving weight loss, for improving and even curing comorbidities and for improving the&#xD;
      patient's QOL. Another supposition is that patient's socio-economic status can influence&#xD;
      success rates of bariatric procedures.&#xD;

      Introduction - Morbid obesity is considered an ever growing pandemic. Most morbidly obese&#xD;
      patients suffer from comorbidities such as hypertension; diabetes mellitus type II;&#xD;
      dyslipidemia; osteoarthritis; obstructive sleep apnea etc. Surgery is considered the best&#xD;
      therapy for morbid obesity and its comorbidities, where alterations in lifestyle, diets and&#xD;
      drugs have failed to achieve weight loss. There are some procedures, some more commonly&#xD;
      practiced than others, most of them done laparoscopically. The most widely performed in&#xD;
      Israel is Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG), and several studies have reported high&#xD;
      success rates in reducing weight and improving comorbidities. However, few studies exists,&#xD;
      mostly retrospective, on the long term results after LSG. These studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      significant weight loss, significant decrease in excessive body weight and also significant&#xD;
      improvement in patients' quality of lives (QOL). However, a single comprehensive prospective&#xD;
      research encompassing all three parameters was not found by us in a preliminary literature&#xD;
      review. No studies were found regarding the effect of socio-economic status on the late&#xD;
      results of LSG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals -The goal of the present study is to prospectively follow patients undergoing LSG and&#xD;
      to assess its effectiveness in weight loss and in the improvement of comorbidities and&#xD;
      quality of life. We also plan to evaluate the effect of socio-economic status on the results&#xD;
      of bariatric surgery, with emphasis on changes in QOL of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods - In an 18 month long prospective research, a set of two questionnaires&#xD;
      will be given to each patient undergoing LSG for morbid obesity at three time points: before&#xD;
      surgery, 6 and 12 months post-surgery. The first questionnaire includes demographic,&#xD;
      socio-economic and physiological data and health related questions regarding comorbidities&#xD;
      and their methods of treatment. The second questionnaire is the Short Form 36v2, an accepted&#xD;
      QOL questionnaire which, using 36 questions. At the end of the research, a statistical&#xD;
      analysis of the results will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis - The hypothesis states that the LSG is an effective treatment for achieving&#xD;
      weight loss, for improving and even curing comorbidities and for improving the patient's QOL.&#xD;
      Another supposition is that patient's socio-economic status can influence success rates of&#xD;
      bariatric procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of the study - Several studies was done reviewing this procedure's efficacy&#xD;
      according to physiological parameters and improvement in comorbidities and quality of life.&#xD;
      Most of which are retrospective. A prospective research that encompasses all these three&#xD;
      parameters was not currently found in the medical literature Keywords - Morbid Obesity,&#xD;
      Bariatric surgery, Sleeve Gastrectomy, Quality of Life, Comorbidities, Weight loss.&#xD;
