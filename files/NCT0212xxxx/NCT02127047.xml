  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing evidence suggests pancreatic islet beta-cell regeneration occurs throughout the&#xD;
      course of the disease in patients with type 1 diabetes. Therefore, decreased beta-cell mass&#xD;
      in type 1 diabetes may be improved through inhibition of beta-cell destruction and&#xD;
      stimulation of proliferation, even after prolonged duration of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity improves insulin secretion via unknown underlying mechanisms. We recently&#xD;
      observed that Interleukin-6 induces glucagon like Peptide (GLP)-1 production and release from&#xD;
      the islet alpha-cell and the intestinal L-cell. Furthermore, exercise induces release of&#xD;
      Interleukin-6 from skeletal muscle resulting in elevated circulating Interleukin-6 levels.&#xD;
      Therefore we hypothesize that exercise-induced Interleukin-6 promotes glucagon like peptide-1&#xD;
      secretion from the islet α-cell and the intestinal L-cell, thereby providing a mechanism how&#xD;
      physical activity can help maintain and improve beta-cell function in patients with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes. This mechanism can be enhanced by concomitant dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity is also known to enhance insulin sensitivity and to attenuate the immune&#xD;
      system activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore by combining physical activity and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibition we aim to&#xD;
      allow for beta-cell regeneration in a interventional randomized open-label study.&#xD;
