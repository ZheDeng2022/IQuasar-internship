  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ibrutinib works in treating patients with B-cell acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia that has come back after treatment or has not responded to other&#xD;
      treatment. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) as measured by objective response rate (ORR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the global safety profile of ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      B-ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess response duration. III. To assess Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) target&#xD;
      inhibition, biomarkers, and gene expression profiles in B-ALL patient samples before and&#xD;
      during treatment with ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4&#xD;
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with complete or partial response. Response definitions of Complete Response (CR): disappearance of leukemia as indicated by &lt;5% marrow blasts &amp; absence of peripheral blood leukemic blasts, with recovery of hematopoiesis defined by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1000/μL &amp; platelets &gt;100,000/μL. C1 extramedullary disease status required. CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi): CR except with ANC &lt;1000/μL and/or platelets &lt;100,000/μL. Partial response (PR): improved or no worsening of ALL as indicated by no peripheral blood blasts, neutrophils &gt;1000/μL, platelets &gt;100,000μL, and either or both of the following: &gt;50% decrease in marrow blast percentage, compared to pretreatment value, &amp; marrow blast percentage ≥ 5% and ≤ 25%. C2 extramedullary disease status. Treatment failures are defined as participants who fail to achieve CR, CRi or PR.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to thirty days after after completion of study treatment anticipated to be 12 weeks for total of 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The time measurement from beginning treatment to recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented. Overall survival time will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The two-sided log-rank test will be used to assess the differences of time to events between groups such as age groups, or Philadelphia chromosome-positive versus Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-ALL. Progressive disease is defined as a doubling of the peripheral blasts and an absolute increase of &gt; 5 x 10^9/L.</description>

Overall survival time will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The two-sided log-rank test will be used to assess the differences of time to events between groups such as age groups, or Philadelphia chromosome-positive versus Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-ALL.
