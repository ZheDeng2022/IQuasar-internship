    <textblock>
      The use of clonidine as an alternative to epidural opioids offers several potential benefits.&#xD;
      Clonidine does not have respiratory depressant effects, and the incidence of vomiting and&#xD;
      pruritus is less frequent compared with that seen after administration of epidural morphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidural clonidine have focused on the optimal doses of clonidine to be used, rather than&#xD;
      analyzing the potential advantage of using epidural clonidine versus opioids with respect to&#xD;
      efficacy and incidence of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidural fentanyl has been used effectively as an alternative to morphine and has been shown&#xD;
      to induce fewer complications when compared with epidural morphine. However, the incidence of&#xD;
      vomiting in patients receiving epidural fentanyl still ranges between 28% and 52% depending&#xD;
      on the study population and concentration used. The analgesic and side effects profile of&#xD;
      epidural clonidine compared with epidural fentanyl are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this randomized double-blind trial is to test the hypothesis that epidural&#xD;
      clonidine decreases the incidence of side effects compared with epidural fentanyl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we compared the hemodynamic effects of the epidural bupivacaine-clonidine-&#xD;
      fentanyl combination with those of epidural bupivacaine- clonidine- meperdine. The secondary&#xD;
      aim of this study was to determine the analgesic efficacy of bupivacaine-clonidine- fentanyl&#xD;
      combination in comparison to bupivacaine- clonidine- meperdine combination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized double-blind clinical trial design was used in a cohort of ninety&#xD;
      patients of both genders, physical status American Society of Anaesthesiologist (ASA) I and&#xD;
      II who will undergo lower limb orthopedic surgery, will be enrolled into the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will divided randomly into two equal groups: Epidural Bupivacain-clonidine and&#xD;
      fentanyl (BF) Group and Bupivacain-clonidine and meperdine (BM) Group, comprising of 45&#xD;
      patients each. Randomization will be performed by random numbers using sealed envelopes&#xD;
      without sex stratification. Sealed envelopes indicate the group of assignment. An independent&#xD;
      anesthesiologist, who did not participate in the study or data collection, will read the&#xD;
      number contained in the envelope and made group assignments. Patients will be blindly&#xD;
      randomized to the two groups; the process of inclusion into the study will go on until the&#xD;
      requested number of patients will be reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be excluded from the study if their preoperative medication included opioid or&#xD;
      non-opioid analgesics, corticosteroids, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Coagulation&#xD;
      disorders, pregnancy, age less than 18 year, patient refusal, and emergency re-operation&#xD;
      within the first 24hours also were exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under full aseptic conditions, the epidural space was identified at the L 2-3 or L 3-4 lumbar&#xD;
      interspace using the loss-of-resistance to saline technique using 16-gauge Tuohy needle. An&#xD;
      injection of 2 ml of hyperbaric bupivacaine will be injected into the subarachnoid space&#xD;
      through 25 gauge spinal needle, then 15ml 0.5% bupivacaine, 25 micrograms of fentanyl and 1&#xD;
      ml of clonidine will be injected epidurally in fentanyl (F) Group, while 15ml 0.5%&#xD;
      bupivacaine,25 mg of meperdine and 1 ml of clonidine will be injected epidurally in meperdine&#xD;
      (M) Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The injection will be given with unlabelled syringes prepared by independent anaesthologist&#xD;
      not involved in the patients care or in pain assessment. The specific treatment given is&#xD;
      unknown to the patient, anesthesiologist, surgeon, or nurses in charge of pain assessment.&#xD;
      All patients and personnel involved in patient management and data collection are unaware of&#xD;
      the group to which the patient will be assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the evening before surgery, patients will be instructed about the use of a 10-cm visual&#xD;
      analog scale (VAS) (0 = no pain to 10 = worst possible pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain will be assessed by independent physicians who will completely blinded to&#xD;
      patients group assignment not sharing in the study design or data collection, visual analogue&#xD;
      scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain). Pain level will be&#xD;
      recorded at PACU every 3 h for the first 24h. All patients received 15 mg/kg i.v.&#xD;
      acetaminophen every 6 h; the first dose will be given 40 min before the end of surgery.&#xD;
      Supplementary doses of acetaminophen i.v. will be given to patients with a VAS higher than 4.&#xD;
      Any episodes of bradycardia (HR&lt; 50 beats/min), hypotension (SBP&lt; 90 mmHg), nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      and excessive sedation were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the degree of postoperative pain score using VAS in the two groups.&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes measures are analgesic requirement of the two groups during the first&#xD;
      24 h after surgery. All adverse events related to surgery and the regional anesthetic&#xD;
      technique will be recorded.&#xD;
