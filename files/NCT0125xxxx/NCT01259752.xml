      This is a multicenter prospective randomized superiority controlled trial comparing leg&#xD;
      stockings and standard care to standard care of ankle sprain and testing the hypothesis that&#xD;
      compression stockings enable to reduce the median of recovery from ankle sprain by at least 6&#xD;
      days.&#xD;

      Introduction: Ankle sprain is a frequently encountered trauma lesion in emergency departments&#xD;
      and is associated with important health expenses. However, appropriate care of this trauma&#xD;
      lesion remains a matter of debate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The tested hypothesis is that compression stockings enable to reduce the median&#xD;
      of recovery from ankle sprain by at least 6 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main end point: Delay to recovery of normal painless walking, without any analgesic drug&#xD;
      consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points : Pain at rest and during walking using a visual analog pain scale,&#xD;
      bimalleolar and middle-feet perimeters, number of days with analgesic drug consumption,&#xD;
      observance analysis, patient's tolerance using a visual analog scale, delay to recover sport&#xD;
      activities in the subgroup of patients having a regular sport activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Multicenter Prospective randomized superiority controlled trial comparing leg&#xD;
      stockings and standard care to standard care of ankle sprain. Standard care include the RICE&#xD;
      (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) protocol at admission, immobilization with ankle bracing&#xD;
      (3 to 6 week duration according to severity and clinical course), recommendation for walking&#xD;
      (no weight baring, partial weight bearing, total weight bearing), administration of analgesic&#xD;
      drugs. The medical device tested in the present study is class II compressive stockings&#xD;
      (compression between 15 and 20 mmHg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients: With an alpha risk of 5%, a beta risk of 5%, 70 patients should be&#xD;
      included in each group to be able to detect a 6 day difference in the delay of recovery,&#xD;
      defined as normal painless walking without any analgesic drug consumption, taking into&#xD;
      consideration 10% of patients lost during follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for inclusion: Recent (&lt;48h) ankle sprain without fracture and without other&#xD;
      traumatic lesions in adult patients aged between 18 and 55 years. Patients with limb arterial&#xD;
      disease, diabetes, or any diseases expected to potentially interfere with recovery of&#xD;
      walking, are excluded as well as pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study schedule: Inclusion during first visit to the emergency department, then at day 7,&#xD;
      15-21, 30-45, and 90. Phone call interviews are performed to define the more appropriate&#xD;
      timing of the visits.&#xD;
