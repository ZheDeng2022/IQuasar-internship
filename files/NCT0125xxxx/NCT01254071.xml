      Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be an open-label, randomized, single dose, two-period crossover study to&#xD;
      determine the bioavailability of a fixed dose combination capsule formulation of dutasteride&#xD;
      and tamsulosin hydrochloride (0.5mg/0.2mg) relative to co-administration of dutasteride 0.5mg&#xD;
      capsules and tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.2mg tablets in healthy male subjects of North East&#xD;
      Asian and non-Asian ancestry. Subjects will receive single oral doses of a combination&#xD;
      capsule formulation of dutasteride 0.5 mg/ tamsulosin 0.2 mg in a fed or fasted state or&#xD;
      concomitant dosing of dutasteride 0.5 mg and the Japan-sourced Harnal-D 0.2 mg in a fed or&#xD;
      fasted state. Each dose of study medication will be separated by a 28-day washout period.&#xD;
      Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be taken at regular intervals after dosing.&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed by measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, safety laboratory data,&#xD;
      and review of adverse events. The study will enrol 88 healthy male subjects to ensure that 80&#xD;
      complete the study. At least twenty percent of the study population will be of Japanese&#xD;
      ancestry, approximately 20% will be of Chinese ancestry and approximately 20% of Korean&#xD;
      ancestry while the remainder of the population will be of non-Asian ancestry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dutasteride (AVODART â„¢) is an approved potent 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor indicated for the&#xD;
      treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men with an enlarged prostate&#xD;
      to improve symptoms, reduce the risk of acute urinary retention and reduce the risk of the&#xD;
      need for BPH-related surgery [AVODART Package Insert, 2009].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In humans, dutasteride is well-tolerated in single doses up to 40mg/day, multiple doses up to&#xD;
      40mg/day administered for 7 days, and 5mg/day administered for 24 weeks. In clinical studies,&#xD;
      the overall incidence and type of adverse events (AEs) was similar across the dutasteride,&#xD;
      placebo, and finasteride treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tamsulosin (Harnal, Harnal D, Flomax) is an alpha-1-adrenoceptor blocking agent approved for&#xD;
      the treatment of signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Tamsulosin HCl is&#xD;
      extensively metabolized, with less than 10% of the dose excreted in the urine unchanged&#xD;
      [Harnal, 2009a; Harnal, 2009b; Flomax, 2009]. In human liver microsomes and human&#xD;
      lymphoblastoid cells expressing CYP cDNAs in vitro, tamsulosin HCl is metabolized by both&#xD;
      CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 [Matsushima, 1998].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data exist to support that tamsulosin (an alpha-1-adrenoceptor antagonist), when&#xD;
      used in combination with dutasteride (a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor), offers a more effective&#xD;
      treatment for the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia than either drug used alone [GSK&#xD;
      study ARI40005, GlaxoSmithKline document number HM2002/00171/01]. In addition, data from a&#xD;
      large, multi-centre National Institutes of Health-sponsored Medical Therapy of Prostatic&#xD;
      Symptoms (MTOPS) study revealed greater benefits of combination alpha-1-adreoceptor&#xD;
      antagonist and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor therapy compared with either monotherapy in males&#xD;
      with BPH [McConnell, 2002].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical drug interaction studies have shown no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      interactions between dutasteride and tamsulosin. Dutasteride may be administered with or&#xD;
      without food. Tamsulosin should be administered with food. While there is food effect PK data&#xD;
      on dutasteride and tamsulosin when administered individually, an objective of this study is&#xD;
      to evaluate the effect of food (high fat meal state versus fasted state) on the absorption of&#xD;
      dutasteride and tamsulosin HCl when given in a combination capsule formulation relative to&#xD;
      the co-administration of the two components, dutasteride and tamsulosin HCl. A previous&#xD;
      study, ARI109882, [GlaxoSmithKline document number ZM2007/00022/00], also determined the&#xD;
      bioequivalence and food effect of the combination capsule formulation relative to the&#xD;
      co-administration of each component administered separately. In that study, the GSK&#xD;
      combination capsule was found to be bioequivalent (under both fed and fasted conditions) to&#xD;
      the marketed products administered separately. In the present study, the dose of tamsulosin&#xD;
      HCl administered will be lower than in ARI109882 (0.2 mg versus 0.4mg administered in&#xD;
      ARI109882). The dose of dutasteride is the same in both studies (0.5mg).&#xD;
