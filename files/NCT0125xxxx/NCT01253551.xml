  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm the absence of a clinically relevant interaction&#xD;
      between telaprevir and raltegravir at steady-state.Telaprevir is being investigated for the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection, and raltegravir is used to treat HIV&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized (the order in which you receive the treatment sessions is&#xD;
      determined by chance, like tossing a coin), crossover (participants will receive different&#xD;
      interventions sequentially during the trial) study in healthy participants to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of telaprevir 750 mg, every 8 hours, on the pharmacokinetics (how the drug is absorbed&#xD;
      into the bloodstream, distributed in the body and eliminated from the body) of raltegravir&#xD;
      400 mg, twice a day, and vice versa. The study population will consist of 20 healthy&#xD;
      participants. Each individual participant will receive two treatments: Treatment A&#xD;
      (telaprevir 750 mg, every 8 hours, alone, on Days 1 to 6, with a morning dose on Day 7) and&#xD;
      Treatment B (raltegravir 400 mg, twice a day, on Days 1 to 10 and telaprevir 750 mg, every 8&#xD;
      hours, on Days 5 to 10, with a morning dose of raltegravir, and a morning and afternoon dose&#xD;
      of telaprevir on Day 11). Half of the participants will receive first Treatment A and then&#xD;
      Treatment B; the other half will receive first Treatment B and then Treatment A. There will&#xD;
      be a washout period of at least 14 days between the 2 sessions. The screening period will be&#xD;
      maximum 21 days; the treatment duration will be approximately 4.5 weeks, and the follow-up&#xD;
      period will be 30 to 31 days. All study medication will be taken with food. On Day 7 of&#xD;
      Treatment A and Day 11 of Treatment B, 9 blood samples will be taken for determination of the&#xD;
      levels of telaprevir in the blood. On Days 4 and 11 of Treatment B, 10 blood samples will be&#xD;
      taken for determination of the levels of raltegravir in the blood. Predose pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      samples will be collected on other days during the treatment sessions. Safety and&#xD;
      tolerability will be evaluated throughout the trial by evaluating results of blood and urine&#xD;
      analyses, vital signs, physical examinations, electrocardiograms (electrical recording of the&#xD;
      heart), drug and alcohol screenings, and by assessing how the participant is feeling. In&#xD;
      Treatment A, participants will receive 2 oral tablets of telaprevir 375 mg every 8 hours on&#xD;
      Days 1 to 6, with a morning dose on Day 7. In Treatment B, participants will receive 1 oral&#xD;
      tablet of 400 mg raltegravir twice a day on Days 1 to 10 and 2 oral tablets of 375 mg&#xD;
      telaprevir every 8 hours on Days 5 to 10, with a morning dose of raltegravir, and a morning&#xD;
      and afternoon dose of telaprevir on Day 11.&#xD;
