      The intention of the study is to investigate whether drainage of cerebral spinal fluid via a&#xD;
      lumbar route (&quot;Tuohy-drain&quot;) will improve outcome after intracranial aneurysmal subarachnoid&#xD;
      hemorrhage (SAH).&#xD;

      1. Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients suffering from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) are predominantly&#xD;
           threatened by two distinct medical problems. Firstly, they may experience a second - and&#xD;
           often more severe - hemorrhage, and secondly, they may suffer a constringence reaction&#xD;
           of the vessels supplying the brain with blood, called vasospasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The first problem is resolved by rapid cerebrovascular imaging and subsequent treatment&#xD;
           of the ruptured aneurysm, thus preventing recurrent hemorrhage. Aneurysm treatment may&#xD;
           be performed either via craniotomy and surgical clipping of the aneurysm or with&#xD;
           endovascular techniques by occluding the aneurysm with small platinum coils.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The vasospasm - the second problem - is more difficult to handle. A hypothesis is that&#xD;
           the development of vasospasm is related to the amount of blood in the basal cisterns.&#xD;
           Therefore, a possible strategy tries to remove this blood as much as possible. Excess&#xD;
           removal of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) via an external ventricular drain fails in&#xD;
           preventing vasospasm and may lead to a higher incidence of posthemorrhagic shunt&#xD;
           dependency. Reason is that after aneurysmal SAH, the blood is packed more densely in the&#xD;
           basal cisterns and therefore only CSF, being more lightweight, is drained from the&#xD;
           ventricles. As an alternative approach, application of a lumbar drain is proposed to&#xD;
           address clotting of the blood in the basal cisterns. Three retrospective studies in&#xD;
           patients after aneurysmal SAH, the newest being available only as abstract, were able to&#xD;
           establish the safety of this approach (Klimo et al, Kwon et al, Tizi et al (abstract&#xD;
           DGNC 2009)). One of the fully published studies addressed vasospasm prophylaxis after&#xD;
           surgical clipping, while the other was performed in patients after endovascular coiling.&#xD;
           All studies led to a markedly diminished incidence of angiographic vasospasm. Therefore,&#xD;
           a prospective study addressing the efficacy of this novel therapeutic approach is&#xD;
           warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The focus of the EARLYDRAIN study is to examine the efficacy of application of lumbar&#xD;
           drainage in patients with acute subarachnoidal hemorrhage from a cerebral aneurysm.&#xD;
           Hypothesis is that early application of lumbar drainage after aneurysmal SAH leads to a&#xD;
           diminished incidence of cerebral vasospasm, as assessed by digital subtraction&#xD;
           angiography, and an improved outcome, measured by the modified Rankin score, at six&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study outline&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients suffering from aneurysmal SAH are treated according to international standards.&#xD;
           Aneurysm treatment is at the discretion of the neurovascular team taking care for a&#xD;
           patient and not specified by the study protocol. All medical treatment is performed&#xD;
           according to local guidelines and standard operating procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any patient meeting the inclusion criteria and not violating the exclusion criteria may&#xD;
           participate in the EARLYDRAIN study and be randomized to either receive a lumbar drain&#xD;
           or not, thus defining the two distinct groups LD and NoLD. To prevent premature rupture&#xD;
           of the aneurysm due to accidental drainage, randomization to the study and eventual&#xD;
           placement of a lumbar drain takes place after securing the aneurysm by the preferred&#xD;
           method of choice. Any patient in the LD group receives a lumbar drain during anesthesia&#xD;
           required for aneurysm treatment. This is to be performed before anticoagulation or&#xD;
           anti-platelet therapy is initiated, which sometimes is warranted after endovascular&#xD;
           coiling. A post-procedural CCT scan of the brain is performed within to 24 hours of&#xD;
           aneurysm treatment. In case of any neurological worsening after the procedure it is&#xD;
           strongly recommended to perform the follow-up CCT scan as soon as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In patients in the LD group, CSF drainage is started via LD slowly and steadily at a&#xD;
           rate of approximately 5 ml per hour after the post-interventional CCT. This leads to a&#xD;
           planned daily CSF drainage of about 120 ml per day via lumbar route. Patients in both&#xD;
           groups may receive additional CSF drainage via a ventricular device as required. The&#xD;
           amount of CSF drained via ventricular route is according to clinical requirement and not&#xD;
           specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To facilitate accuracy of drainage, regular drainage control every other hour and&#xD;
           stopping in case of excess drainage is strongly recommended by the principal&#xD;
           investigators. In case of neurological decline suspiciously related to the lumbar&#xD;
           drainage, the drain is closed immediately and may be gradually restarted after 12 to 24&#xD;
           hours, after performing a CCT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the post-procedural CCT or any other follow-up CCT scan shows absent basal cisterns&#xD;
           or any signs of threatening herniation, lumbar CSF diversion in the LD group shall not&#xD;
           be performed. It may still be feasible to carefully drain CSF via the lumbar route may&#xD;
           (Tuettenberg et al), but this is at the discretion of the local investigator and not&#xD;
           recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In patients requiring sedation and mechanical ventilation, either due to neurological&#xD;
           impairment or otherwise, intracranial pressure monitoring is mandatory. This may be&#xD;
           performed according to local policy either with parenchymal or ventricular devices. If&#xD;
           the intracranial pressure exceeds 20 mmHg, further CSF drainage via lumbar route shall&#xD;
           be interrupted until the ICP is below 20 mmHg again. Careful CSF drainage via the lumbar&#xD;
           route may be still feasible in case of high intracranial pressure (Tuettenberg et al),&#xD;
           but is at the discretion of the local investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Further neuromonitoring with TCD, EEG, brain tissue oxygenation, jugular bulb oxymetry,&#xD;
           regional cerebral blood flow, microdialysis or other devices is at the discretion of the&#xD;
           center and according to its local guidelines. As far as possible, this data should be&#xD;
           saved electronically for post-hoc analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A CCT scan as well as conventional digital subtraction angiography, CT angiography or MR&#xD;
           angiography for assessment of vasospasm in the larger vessels is routinely performed on&#xD;
           day 7 to 10 after the initial hemorrhage, regardless of the patient condition. In case&#xD;
           of clinical suspicion of vasospasm, angiography may be performed at any time. If it is&#xD;
           performed earlier and the patient shows no clinical deterioration thereafter, the&#xD;
           angiography on day 7 to 10 is omitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After cerebrovascular imaging on day 7 to 10, or day 8 in case of an earlier&#xD;
           angiography, the lumbar drainage of CSF is stopped in the LD group. It may be pursued on&#xD;
           a clinical base, as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Amount and duration of CSF drainage Patients randomized to the lumbar drainage group&#xD;
           shall receive a daily drainage of 120 ml CSF, or 5 ml per hour for seven days. If higher&#xD;
           amounts of CSF need to be drained on clinical grounds as in patients with hydrocephalus,&#xD;
           this is preferably performed via external ventricular drain.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The drain is planned to remain in place until the control angiography on day 7 to 10&#xD;
           after the initial hemorrhage. The local investigator may decide to remove the drain&#xD;
           earlier in patients fully mobilized without clinical necessity of CSF drainage. However,&#xD;
           consecutive drainage should not be less than four days to achieve a valid study result.&#xD;
           Lumbar CSF drainage may be prolonged beyond the control angiography on clinical&#xD;
           requirement. The amount of CSF drainage may then be adjusted to clinical needs and bears&#xD;
           no further restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients randomized to the control group should not receive a lumbar drain before the&#xD;
           planned control angiography to be performed on day 7 to 10 after SAH. If the patient&#xD;
           develops hydrocephalus, and no EVD was placed initially for CSF drainage, a lumbar drain&#xD;
           may be installed at the discretion of the local investigator. These patients are&#xD;
           analyzed in the intention-to-treat analysis, but are not suitable for per-protocol&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Consent to the study&#xD;
&#xD;
           Consent for study inclusion is sought after explanation and agreement to a specific&#xD;
           aneurysm treatment. Thus, patients capable of consenting to the aneurysm treatment get&#xD;
           the study details explained themselves and may or may not agree to participate. If a&#xD;
           patient is incapable for consenting to the proposed treatment, the legal representative&#xD;
           should be informed on the conditions of treatment choices and afterwards, on the details&#xD;
           of the EARLYDRAIN study. A patient may be randomized if the legal representative gives&#xD;
           informed consent to the study, based on the presumed will of the patient. If neither the&#xD;
           patient is capable of giving informed consent nor a legal representative is available in&#xD;
           due time, an independent physician not involved in the patient's treatment nor in the&#xD;
           trial may be asked for study approval. In these cases of deferred consent, a legal&#xD;
           representative needs to be established as soon as possible, according to German law. As&#xD;
           soon as a legal representative is available and/or the patient is capable again to&#xD;
           consent to the study, he or she must be asked to give informed consent. If the patient&#xD;
           or his/her legal representative refuses consent after inclusion by advice of an&#xD;
           independent physician, no further study participation of the patient is possible. In&#xD;
           this case, however, the patient or his/her legal representative are asked to give&#xD;
           consent for evaluation of already acquired data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Safety of lumbar drains after aneurysmal SAH&#xD;
&#xD;
           In all three retrospective studies, mortality was lower in the lumbar drainage group.&#xD;
           None of the retrospective studies mentions procedural related complications for the&#xD;
           lumbar drains (Klimo et al, Kwon et al, Tizi et al (abstract at the DGNC 2009)). In&#xD;
           patients with increased intracranial pressure, careful lumbar drainage of CSF may be a&#xD;
           possible treatment even in case of compressed basal cisterns (Tuettenberg et al). To&#xD;
           date, there is no data available indicating an increased risk of lumbar drainage in a&#xD;
           controlled neurointensive care environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Insurance coverage&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the EARLYDRAIN study compares two standard procedures of CSF drainage after subarachnoid&#xD;
      hemorrhage used in clinical routine, no additional patient insurance is necessary to perform&#xD;
      the study. German laws §§ 40 to 42 Arzneimittelgesetz or §§ 20 to 23 Medizinproduktegesetz&#xD;
      are not applicable. Any hypothetical adverse events of either treatment are covered by the&#xD;
      regular treatment contracts which do include clinical research.&#xD;
