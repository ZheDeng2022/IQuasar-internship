      This research study measures how well the Eustachian tube works and looks directly at the&#xD;
      anatomy of the Eustachian tube in adults who have had tympanostomy tubes surgically inserted&#xD;
      into their eardrums because they have been diagnosed as having either &quot;otitis media&quot; or &quot;poor&#xD;
      Eustachian tube function&quot;. The Eustachian tube is a biologic tube that connects the back of&#xD;
      the nose to the middle ear (the airspace located behind your eardrum). That tube is usually&#xD;
      closed, but can be opened by swallowing and other activities. Periodic openings of the&#xD;
      Eustachian tube allow air to flow between the nose and middle ear which keeps the pressure of&#xD;
      gas in the middle ear at the same level as that of the atmosphere, a condition required for&#xD;
      good hearing. In children and adults, middle-ear diseases such as otitis media with effusion&#xD;
      (the buildup of fluid within the middle ear) and a form of temporary hearing loss (conductive&#xD;
      hearing loss) occur if the Eustachian tube does not open, does not open frequently enough or&#xD;
      is always open (called a patulous Eustachian tube). A diagnosis of these different conditions&#xD;
      can be made using standard, clinical tests of Eustachian tube function and the Eustachian&#xD;
      tube can be visualized where it enters the back of the nose using a specialized telescope&#xD;
      called an endoscope. Some scientific reports suggest that the cause of poor Eustachian tube&#xD;
      function in an individual can be determined by studying the anatomy of the Eustachian tube at&#xD;
      the back of the nose and the movements of the Eustachian tube in that area during swallowing,&#xD;
      talking and other activities using an endoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators plan to explore the relationship between the results of the&#xD;
      standard Eustachian tube function tests and those for the anatomy and function of the&#xD;
      Eustachian tube in adults with a disease condition likely to be caused by poor Eustachian&#xD;
      tube function. Also, there are a number other disease conditions (examples: nasal allergy,&#xD;
      acid reflux disease) that are related to poor Eustachian tube function and it is possible&#xD;
      that these conditions and their effect on Eustachian tube function can be treated with&#xD;
      medicines. Therefore, the investigators also plan to evaluate enrolled persons for those&#xD;
      conditions. It is expected that if the results of the standard Eustachian tube function tests&#xD;
      can be explained by the anatomy of the back of the nose and Eustachian tube, the functional&#xD;
      anatomy (movements during swallowing etc) of the Eustachian tube or the presence of allergy&#xD;
      and or/acid reflux disease, new medical and/or surgical treatments can be developed to&#xD;
      improve Eustachian tube function and &quot;cure&quot; or treat the associated middle-ear diseases.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study requires a single visit to the Middle Ear Physiology Laboratory (MEPL) located on&#xD;
      the first floor of the Oakland Medical Building (3420 Fifth Avenue in Oakland, Pittsburgh,&#xD;
      PA). Adjacent parking attached to that building is available. The total time of the visit&#xD;
      should be about 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject is eligible and signs informed consent to participate in the study, a series&#xD;
      of questions regarding past history of ear disease will be asked as well as whether or not a&#xD;
      subject has any of several risk factors that makes people more likely to develop otitis media&#xD;
      with effusion and other ear diseases. The subject will also complete a short questionnaire&#xD;
      that asks questions about whether or not they have symptoms consistent with acid reflux&#xD;
      disease. Then, a blood sample (about 2/3 of a tablespoon) will be taken from an arm vein and&#xD;
      sent to a laboratory for assay of chemicals associated with allergic diseases. These&#xD;
      procedures should take about 30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, the subject's Eustachian tube function will be tested in the ear/ears that have open&#xD;
      tympanostomy tubes in the eardrum. For these tests, the subject will be seated comfortably in&#xD;
      a chair and a soft rubber tube will be put partway into their ear canal. This tube is&#xD;
      attached to a machine that can change the pressure in the ear and measure the pressure at&#xD;
      which the Eustachian tube opens and closes, as well as how easily air flows through the&#xD;
      Eustachian tube and how easily the subject can open their Eustachian tube during swallowing.&#xD;
      These tests only require that the subject not pull the ear plug from their ear and perform&#xD;
      certain procedures designed to open their Eustachian tube such as swallowing with an open and&#xD;
      pinched nose, blowing against a closed nose and deep breathing. The total time for testing is&#xD;
      about 20 minutes per ear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, a study doctor will apply topical medicines by spray and cotton balls to the inside of&#xD;
      the nose to decrease any swelling and numb the nose (4% Lidocaine and 0.05% Oxymetazoline&#xD;
      mixed in 1:1 proportion). After a short break of about 20 minutes to allow time for these&#xD;
      medicines to work, the study doctor will choose which side of the subject's nose is most open&#xD;
      and will introduce a small video telescope (called an endoscope) into that side of the nose&#xD;
      and move it to the back of the nose. This will allow him/her to see the back of the nose and&#xD;
      the Eustachian tubes. He/she will focus the endoscope on the Eustachian tubes and will record&#xD;
      video images of the back of the nose, the Eustachian tubes at rest and the movements of the&#xD;
      Eustachian tubes while the subject swallows, yawns, repeats an &quot;O&quot; sound, repeats a &quot;K&quot; sound&#xD;
      and moves their jaw. The subject will be able to see the movements of the Eustachian tube on&#xD;
      a monitor while performing these procedures. This procedure should take about 40 minutes to&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this test, the study is complete.&#xD;
