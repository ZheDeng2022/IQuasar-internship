  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe intracranial atherosclerosis with concomitant stenosis is responsible for&#xD;
      approximately 10% of all strokes. Retrospective studies have indicated that up to 50% of&#xD;
      patients with a recently symptomatic intracranial stenosis experience recurrent ischemic&#xD;
      events. Due to the high stroke risk, patients with high grade 70% symptomatic intracranial&#xD;
      stenosis represent the main target group for endovascular treatment. Atorvastatin is widely&#xD;
      used in the treatment of hyperlipidemia, especially after acute myocardial infarction.&#xD;
      High-dose atorvastatin has been known to stop the progression of atherosclerosis and to&#xD;
      decrease the levels of inflammatory markers. Several recent clinical trials have proved&#xD;
      atorvastatin can reduce restenosis after stent implantation in coronary artery. But the&#xD;
      feasibility of atorvastatin in preventing restenosis in patients with intracranial stenting&#xD;
      has not been evaluated.The purpose of this prospective, randomized, single-blinded trial is&#xD;
      to evaluate the effect of atorvastatin 80 mg daily in preventing restenosis and related&#xD;
      vascular events in patients with intracranial stent implantation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Severe intracranial atherosclerosis with concomitant stenosis is responsible for&#xD;
      approximately 10% of all strokes. In Asian populations intracranial stenoses are even the&#xD;
      most commonly found vascular lesions. Retrospective studies indicated that up to 50% patients&#xD;
      with recently symptomatic intracranial stenosis experienced recurrent ischemic events. The&#xD;
      risk of recurrent stroke increases with the aggravation of intracranial artery stenosis. In&#xD;
      Warfarin-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID) trial, 14% and 23% of the patients&#xD;
      with TIA or stroke attributable to high-grade intracranial stenosis had further ipsilateral&#xD;
      ischemic stroke over the next year despite best medical treatments. If percentage of&#xD;
      intracranial stenosis exceeded 70%, the stroke risk went up to 20% in the first year. These&#xD;
      results spurred the enthusiasm for endovascular approaches, including percutaneous&#xD;
      transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA) and stenting to treat this potentially harmful&#xD;
      disease. Due to the high stroke risk, patients with high-grade ≥70% symptomatic intracranial&#xD;
      stenosis represent the main target group for endovascular treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endovascular management of intracranial arthrosclerosis is, however, associated with an&#xD;
      appreciable number of potential complications, including local thrombosis, thromboembolism&#xD;
      and, especially, restenosis and in-stent occlusion. To date, the reported 1-year restenosis&#xD;
      rates after intracranial stenting in case series and small trials have varied widely, ranging&#xD;
      from less than 10% in some to more than 50% in others. According to a recent review, the&#xD;
      overall 1-year restenosis rate of intracranial stenting was 25%, and the in-stent occlusion&#xD;
      rate was nearly 10%. These relatively high rates of restenosis and re-occlusion after&#xD;
      procedure have raised the question about whether stenting improves the natural course of&#xD;
      intracranial atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared with the relatively good durability of angioplasty and stenting procedures within&#xD;
      the extracranial carotid artery, the high incidence of restenoses appears to be a major&#xD;
      drawback of intracranial stenting. Recent studies suggested that especially younger patients&#xD;
      treated with self-expandable stents within the anterior circulation have a higher risk for&#xD;
      this complication. Considering about 33% of restenoses were symptomatic (TIA or stroke),&#xD;
      decreasing restenosis rates after intracranial stenting became the key issue for improving&#xD;
      the clinical feasibility of this treatment strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Animal studies have indicated that statins can inhibit platelet aggregation and release of&#xD;
      platelet-derived mediators, reduce inflammatory responses of vascular wall, improve artery&#xD;
      endothelial function, all of which may contribute to decrease proliferative responses after&#xD;
      stent implantation. These profiles make statin optimal for preventing restenosis or occlusion&#xD;
      after intracranial stenting, but this strategy has not been tested by clinical trials to&#xD;
      date, although statin has been proved by several recent clinical trials to be efficacious in&#xD;
      preventing restenosis after stent implantation in coronary arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial attempts to lower restenosis rates after coronary balloon angioplasty have failed&#xD;
      to demonstrate beneficial effects of statin therapy, although the FLuvastatin Angioplasty&#xD;
      REstenosis (FLARE) trial reported a reduction in mortality and myocardial infarction in the&#xD;
      fluvastatin treatment patients. Subsequent studies, however, did confirm that statin therapy&#xD;
      can decrease restenosis rates and the related ischemic events after stent implantation in&#xD;
      patients with coronary artery diseases. Unlike chronic vessel shrinkage may account for ≥70%&#xD;
      of recurrence rates after balloon angioplasty, restenosis after coronary stent implantation&#xD;
      is entirely due to neointimal proliferation. Experimental studies have shown that statins are&#xD;
      capable of inhibiting intimal proliferation after arterial injury. Results from other studies&#xD;
      suggested that statins interfere with proliferative responses after coronary stent&#xD;
      implantation in humans. Statin therapy was associated not only with a significant reduction&#xD;
      in late lumen loss, but also with a greater net gain after coronary stent implantation. Thus,&#xD;
      the discrepancy of the effects of statin therapy on restenosis development after balloon&#xD;
      angioplasty compared with coronary stent implantation may be easily reconciled by the&#xD;
      different mechanisms underlying the recurrence of luminal narrowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elevated LDL cholesterol levels increase platelet and red-cell aggregability, and thrombosis&#xD;
      is believed to have a decisive role in the process of restenosis and in-stent occlusion.&#xD;
      Lowering LDL cholesterol levels decreases rates of restenosis in the rat-carotid model,&#xD;
      whereas treatment with statin decreases the progression of disease in the rabbit-iliac model&#xD;
      independently of an effect on LDL cholesterol. In contrast, in the&#xD;
      overstretched-swine-coronary model, no relation between either LDL cholesterol or statin and&#xD;
      restenosis was observed. An attempt was made to resolve these conflicts with a prospective&#xD;
      clinical study in which 157 patients were treated with or without statin. The results&#xD;
      indicated that the rate of restenosis was 12 percent with and 44 percent without statin. More&#xD;
      than one study also identified the diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia at the time of coronary&#xD;
      stent implantation as a major independent predictor for reduced recurrence rates. But a&#xD;
      recent study indicated that statin therapy was associated with a comparable reduction of&#xD;
      restenosis rates in patients with average serum cholesterol levels at baseline, suggest that&#xD;
      the observed effects are not only due to reduced serum cholesterol levels, but also may be&#xD;
      related to the non-lipid anti-atherosclerotic properties of statins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the efficacy of high dose statin in preventing restenosis after coronary artery&#xD;
      stenting has been confirmed by several clinical trials, it is reasonable to presume that&#xD;
      high-dose statin is also efficacious in preventing restenosis and in-stent occlusion after&#xD;
      intracranial stenting, because these two vasculatures share very similar anatomical profiles.&#xD;
      The present study is aimed to evaluate the preventive effects of atorvastatin 80 mg daily in&#xD;
      decreasing restenosis in a consecutive series of patients undergoing intracranial stent&#xD;
      implantation at a single center. The hypotheses of this study is that patients with&#xD;
      atorvastatin therapy is associated with improved clinical outcome and reduced restenosis&#xD;
      rates 12 months after intracranial stent implantation than patients without atorvastatin&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
