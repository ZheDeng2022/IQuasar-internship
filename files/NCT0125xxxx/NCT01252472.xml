      Some men who have a history of use of Tamsulosin (Flomax) are at risk for a condition called&#xD;
      Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome that can develop during otherwise routine cataract&#xD;
      surgery. It is not fully understood why this condition develops or who is at risk for&#xD;
      developing it. In this study the investigators will take pictures of the iris and iris blood&#xD;
      vessels before cataract surgery. The investigators hope that the results of this study will&#xD;
      provide a better understanding of how Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome develops and give&#xD;
      us a non-surgical way of figuring out who might develop this problem during surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Male patients scheduled for cataract surgery who are currently taking tamsulosin will be&#xD;
      recruited into the study. Age-matched male control patients undergoing cataract surgery,&#xD;
      without a history of using any a-adrenergic antagonist medication, will also be recruited.&#xD;
      Careful diagnostic iris evaluation using iris Fluorescein Angiography (FA) and Anterior&#xD;
      Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT) will be performed prior to cataract surgery.&#xD;
      Intraoperative findings and surgical complications will be recorded in an effort to correlate&#xD;
      preoperative diagnostic iris FA and AS-OCT findings with presence and severity of&#xD;
      intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS). The investigators hypothesize that males on&#xD;
      tamsulosin will have abnormal iris blood vessels on iris FA and altered iris morphology,&#xD;
      consistent with iris atrophy, on AS-OCT that will correlate with presence of IFIS and help&#xD;
      elucidate the pathophysiology of tamsulosin-induced IFIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male patients scheduled for cataract surgery who are currently taking tamsulosin will be&#xD;
      eligible for enrollment into the study if they have no other conditions that affect the iris&#xD;
      vasculature and architecture (i.e. diabetes mellitus, glaucoma, pseudoexfoliation syndrome,&#xD;
      history of prior eye surgery or eye trauma, use of eye drops other than artificial tears and&#xD;
      normal preoperative drops). Control patients will be eligible if they have no history of use&#xD;
      of any a-adrenergic antagonist (tamsulosin, alfuzosin, doxazosin, or terazosin). Patients who&#xD;
      are interested in participating will be given a copy of the study consent form to take home&#xD;
      with them. These patients will then be contacted by the study coordinator for further&#xD;
      discussion of the study details. Study volunteers will be asked to come to the Kellogg Eye&#xD;
      Center any time prior to their scheduled surgery. Volunteers will undergo the informed&#xD;
      consent process, sign the consent form and be given a study identification number, linked to&#xD;
      the patient in a de-identified fashion, that will be used exclusively for the study. The link&#xD;
      of the study identification number and patient will be kept in a locked cabinet in the clinic&#xD;
      coordinator's locked office. All patient study information will be collected and encoded&#xD;
      according to HIPAA guidelines and institutional review board approval. The investigators plan&#xD;
      to enroll 20 patients and 10 age-matched controls in a 12-month enrollment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Iris Fluorescein Angiography (FA) will be performed in the surgical eye. The volunteer&#xD;
           will be seated at the Heidelberg Spectralis (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg,&#xD;
           Germany) system. Sodium fluorescein dye (2mL of 25% solution) will be injected&#xD;
           intravenously, and video images of the iris vasculature will be recorded as the&#xD;
           fluorescent dye circulates through the iris blood vessels. The images will be digitally&#xD;
           recorded and assigned the volunteer's study identification number. Data collected from&#xD;
           this procedure includes circumferential extent of vascular filling (number of clock&#xD;
           hours), radial extent of vascular filling (percent of iris radius), delay in iris&#xD;
           circulation (time from dye injection to maximal filling of iris vasculature), blood&#xD;
           vessel tortuosity and alterations in caliber. This procedure takes approximately 20&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT) will be performed in the surgical&#xD;
           eye. The volunteer will be seated at the Visante OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) in&#xD;
           a room with standardized lighting. They will be instructed to look at a visual target&#xD;
           within the instrument, and three high-resolution images of the anterior segment of the&#xD;
           eye will be acquired and saved, identified only with the volunteer's study&#xD;
           identification number. Data collected from this procedure includes iris leaflet&#xD;
           thickness and pupil diameter in a controlled lighting situation. This procedure takes&#xD;
           approximately 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery will be performed according to the individual surgeon's preferences, including the&#xD;
      use of any iris manipulation techniques that are clinically necessary. Surgical parameters&#xD;
      will be recorded on a study visit form with the volunteer's study identification number:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pupil diameter will be measured with calipers at the beginning of surgery prior to&#xD;
           incision, and at the end, after intraocular lens implantation, but prior to instillation&#xD;
           of any miotic agents. These time points are before and after any intra-operative iris&#xD;
           expansion techniques could be performed. The surgeon will also record whether he/she&#xD;
           uses any iris expansion technique (i.e. iris hooks, Malyugin ring, non-standard pupil&#xD;
           dilation medications), which one, and at what point in the procedure the technique was&#xD;
           employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Iris billowing will be graded as present or absent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Iris prolapse will be graded as present or absent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical time from incision to dressing will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical complications or any other surgical findings of interest to the surgeon will be&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
