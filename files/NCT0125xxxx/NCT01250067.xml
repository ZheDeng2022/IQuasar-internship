      In this proposal, in addition to the conventional MRCP recording, the dipoles and sources of&#xD;
      the different subcomponents of MRCP will also be analyzed with the brain electric source&#xD;
      analysis (BESA) to evaluate the difference in the solutions and source strength underlying&#xD;
      the MRCP between normal controls and patients with ET.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Essential tremor (ET) is a common disorder with unknown etiology and pathogenesis. Typically&#xD;
      described as a postural tremor, ET often has a marked kinetic component suggesting cerebellar&#xD;
      involvement in the pathogenesis of the tremor. The assumption has been illustrated by both&#xD;
      positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, which&#xD;
      revealed that blood flow and activity of the cerebellum were increased in ET patients as&#xD;
      compared to the normal controls. In contrast to the cumulative body of imaging evidence, the&#xD;
      physiological bases to link the ET and cerebellar functional alternation are scarce. Studies&#xD;
      with tandem gait analysis have revealed 25% abnormality of ET patients and surface&#xD;
      electromyographic study has found a delay in the second agonist burst during rapid wrist&#xD;
      movements suggesting the possible role of cerebellar functional alternation in the generation&#xD;
      of ET. In addition, since the tremor of ET tends to appear in the movement ignition or during&#xD;
      postural maintenance, it is conceivable that this sort of tremor might exert certain impact&#xD;
      on the programming and preparation of the limb movement. Thus it would be appropriate to&#xD;
      adopt a tool, which can concomitantly assess the cerebellar function and movement&#xD;
      preparation, to investigate the patients with ET. In this proposal, we will record&#xD;
      movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP) in ET patients. MRCP is a slow negative shift&#xD;
      starting 1-1.5 sec before volitional movement. It consists of at least 3 subcomponents, the&#xD;
      Bereitschaftspotential, the negative slope, and the motor potential. The generators crucial&#xD;
      for the generation of MRCP include cerebellum, motor and motor association cortex. Thus MRCP&#xD;
      seems to be an appropriate tool to assess the patients with ET, in whom the trivial&#xD;
      cerebellar functional alternation could be responsible for the tremor generation and motor&#xD;
      preparation might be hampered concomitantly. In this proposal, in addition to the&#xD;
      conventional MRCP recording, the dipoles and sources of the different subcomponents of MRCP&#xD;
      will also be analyzed with the brain electric source analysis (BESA) to evaluate the&#xD;
      difference in the solutions and source strength underlying the MRCP between normal controls&#xD;
      and patients with ET.&#xD;

          -  Bilateral postural tremor with or without kinetic tremor involving hands or forearms,&#xD;
             which is visible and persistent, and long-standing in duration (&gt;5 years). Tremor&#xD;
             involving body parts other than upper limbs may be present, the tremor may be&#xD;
             asymmetrical, amplitude may fluctuate, and the tremor may or may not produce&#xD;
             disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neurological signs, except for Froment's sign&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Causes of enhanced physiologic tremor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent or recent exposure to tremorgenic drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Direct or indirect trauma to the central and peripheral nervous system&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Historical or clinical evidence of psychogenic origins of tremor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Convincing evidence of sudden onset or evidence of stepwise deterioration&#xD;
