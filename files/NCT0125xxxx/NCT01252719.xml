  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 3 trial is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of&#xD;
      oritavancin in ABSSSIs, including those caused by MRSA and to evaluate the potential economic&#xD;
      benefit of oritavancin administered as a single 1200 mg IV dose.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel, comparative efficacy and&#xD;
      safety study of single-dose IV oritavancin/IV placebo versus IV vancomycin for 7 to 10 days&#xD;
      in adults with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI) suspected or proven&#xD;
      to be caused by Gram-positive pathogens. Approximately 960 patients will be randomized at 100&#xD;
      centers globally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, this study will characterize the PK and PK/PD properties of a single 1200 mg IV&#xD;
      dose of oritavancin and evaluate the potential health economic benefits offered by this&#xD;
      dosing strategy.&#xD;
