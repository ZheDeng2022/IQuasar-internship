    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of a monthly regimen of ozarelix&#xD;
      administered subcutaneously (SC) versus Goserelin depot administered subcutaneously in men&#xD;
      with Prostate Cancer. This is an international, multi-center, randomized, open label 84 days&#xD;
      study. Men who are at least 18 years of age or older, with histologically proven prostate&#xD;
      cancer of all stages, in whom endocrine treatment is indicated will be eligible for study&#xD;
      entry.&#xD;

      Prospective study subjects will undergo screening procedures. Approximately 214 eligible&#xD;
      patients will enter the study. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two&#xD;
      treatment arms (Ozarelix or Goserelin). Eligible patients randomized to the ozarelix group&#xD;
      will receive two SC injections of ozarelix 65 mg in the abdomen on Day 1 (left lower&#xD;
      quadrant, LLQ and right lower quadrant, RLQ), followed by a SC injection of 65 mg of Ozarelix&#xD;
      (abdomen LLQ) on day 8 and will receive 2 additional SC injections of Ozarelix on days 28 and&#xD;
      56 (alternating injection sites). Eligible patients randomized to Goserelin will receive one&#xD;
      3.6 mg SC injection in the abdomen (LLQ or RLQ), followed by a 3.6 mg SC injection on Days 28&#xD;
      and 56 (alternating injection sites). Ozarelix will be reconstituted and administered as a 65&#xD;
      mg injection. Patients will receive two Ozarelix 65 mg subcutaneous injections (SC) on Day 1,&#xD;
      and one 65 mg SC injection on day 8, followed by one 65 mg injection on days 28 and 56. The&#xD;
      patients will receive one Goserelin 3.6 mg SC injection at baseline, Day 28 and Day 56.&#xD;
