  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I clinical trial is studying the side effects and the best dose of lenalidomide&#xD;
      after donor bone marrow transplant in treating patients with high-risk hematologic cancer.&#xD;
      Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways&#xD;
      and stop cancer cells from growing.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximal-tolerable dose (MTD) of lenalidomide after allogeneic hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) in patients with advanced acute myeloid leukemia (AML),&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Define the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of lenalidomide in regard to organ&#xD;
      specificity, time course, predictability, and reversibility following AHSCT in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the anti-tumor response in patients treated with lenalidomide after AHSCT when&#xD;
      compared with historical controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the plasma and cellular pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide in patients enrolled on&#xD;
      this study and interactions with supportive agents such as calcineurin inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate the frequency of acute and chronic graft-vs-host disease and graft failure in&#xD;
      patients enrolled on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Prospectively assess the feasibility of administering an oral agent post-transplant as&#xD;
      measured by efficiency of patients being registered to therapy early and also meeting&#xD;
      eligibility criteria for lenalidomide treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Perform pharmacodynamic studies following lenalidomide treatment including development of&#xD;
      B, T, and myeloid cell chimerism; assessment of immune activation; cytokines; tumor cell&#xD;
      expression of co-stimulatory molecules; development of anti-tumor antibodies and&#xD;
      immunoglobulin recovery; and re-expression of microRNAs that may mediate lenalidomide&#xD;
      anti-tumor effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to&#xD;
      diagnosis (high-risk acute myeloid leukemia vs non-Hodgkin lymphoma vs high-risk chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, or B-prolymphocytic leukemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days for&#xD;
      up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood and bone marrow biopsies and aspirate collection at baseline and&#xD;
      periodically during study for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies. Buccal swab&#xD;
      samples are also collected at baseline and analyzed for genetic polymorphisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for up to 1 year.&#xD;
