      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the study drug, Pasireotide LAR can&#xD;
      shrink or slow the growth of Metastatic Neuroendocrine Carcinomas. The safety of this drug&#xD;
      will also be studied. The patient's physical state, changes in the size of the tumor, and&#xD;
      laboratory findings taken while on-study will help us decide if Pasireotide LAR is safe and&#xD;
      effective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-institutional, prospective phase II open-label trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational drug used in this study is pasireotide LAR 60 mg. Pasireotide will be&#xD;
      administered as an intramuscular injection at the beginning of every cycle which is defined&#xD;
      as 28 days (+/- 3 days). Study treatment should begin within 14 days following enrollment&#xD;
      into the study and continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal&#xD;
      of consent. Safety and efficacy will be assessed throughout the treatment period.&#xD;

    <description>Complete response (CR): complete disappearance of all target lesions, confirmed by repeat assessments at no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met. Partial response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter. This must be confirmed by repeat assessment at no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met. Stable Disease (SD): neither sufficient decrease to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since the treatment started.</description>

             subcutaneous (SQ) octreotide (&lt;10 days) in the past are eligible if &gt; 1 week has&#xD;
             elapsed from their last octreotide injection.&#xD;
