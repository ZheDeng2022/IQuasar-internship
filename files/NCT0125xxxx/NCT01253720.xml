  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      UC San Diego researchers conducted a study to develop and evaluate an internet and text&#xD;
      message based weight loss study for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors.&#xD;
      We hypothesized that those study participants randomized to the intervention will demonstrate&#xD;
      greater reduction in BMI-z score as compared to the control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PACE CALL or Fit4Life study, sponsored by the American Cancer Society , was a 4-year&#xD;
      research project aimed at developing and testing the efficacy of a web &amp; cell phone based&#xD;
      weight loss program. The purpose of the intervention was to promote weight loss and&#xD;
      management and improve physical activity, diet and sedentary behaviors among preadolescent&#xD;
      and adolescent youth (7-18) who are survivors of childhood ALL (defined as being off therapy&#xD;
      for at least 2 years without disease relapse). Fit4Life was based on and adapted from notable&#xD;
      prior successful adolescent weight control interventions, and physical activity and diet&#xD;
      behavioral promotion interventions in the preadolescent and adolescent age group. Particular&#xD;
      sensitivity to issues experienced by cancer survivors and their families were incorporated&#xD;
      into this newly developed intervention based on systematic cancer survivor input and feedback&#xD;
      as well as mentor/collaborator input regarding cancer survivor research.&#xD;
