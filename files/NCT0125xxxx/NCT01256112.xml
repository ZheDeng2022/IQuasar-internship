  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a nutrition and physical activity education&#xD;
      program for families of overweight or obese adolescents with Down syndrome is more effective&#xD;
      when behavioral lifestyle change strategies are added.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with intellectual disabilities, including Down syndrome (DS), are as likely to be&#xD;
      overweight than their typically developing peers. The consequences of childhood obesity&#xD;
      include increased risk for Type-2 diabetes, orthopedic problems, sleep apnea, elevated&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk and menstrual irregularities. Research indicating a high prevalence of&#xD;
      overweight, obesity, low fitness levels and other health problems among adults with DS&#xD;
      suggest the need for more attention to health promotion among adolescents with DS, which has&#xD;
      been limited to date. Educational interventions in nutrition and physical activity have not&#xD;
      been tested through randomized clinical trial with families of adolescents with DS; nor have&#xD;
      behavioral &quot;lifestyle change&quot; interventions based on Social Cognitive Theory. Among typical&#xD;
      populations, the addition of training in behavior and lifestyle change to education-alone&#xD;
      interventions increasingly is being seen as critical in helping to promote long-term weight&#xD;
      loss and weight maintenance. The hypothesis of this study is that a parent supported weight&#xD;
      reduction (PSWR) intervention that combines behavioral strategies with nutrition and activity&#xD;
      education (NAE) will be more effective in reducing overweight in adolescents with DS than a&#xD;
      program that provides NAE alone or a Wait-List (WL) control.&#xD;
