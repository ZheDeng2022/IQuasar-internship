      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if delayed-delayed breast reconstruction&#xD;
      in women who require post-mastectomy radiation therapy will improve cosmetic outcomes and&#xD;
      result in fewer complications compared to the standard approach (reconstruction that is not&#xD;
      started until radiation treatment is completed).&#xD;

      Study Visits and Surgeries:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be hospitalized 2-4 times for 1-5 days depending on your condition. If you agree to&#xD;
      take part in this study, you will be scheduled for a skin-sparing mastectomy. The following&#xD;
      tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Operative Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your complete medical history will be updated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The doctor will determine what type of reconstructive surgery can be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have photos taken of your breasts. Your face, hair, or jewelry will not be&#xD;
           photographed. These photos will be kept in a password-protected computer accessible only&#xD;
           by the principle investigator and people directly involved in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a quality of life questionnaire. The questionnaire asks about how&#xD;
           satisfied you are with your appearance. The questionnaire will be sent by email, US&#xD;
           postal service mail, or in person when you come for your follow up visits. The&#xD;
           questionnaire should take about 20 minutes to complete. If sent by US postal service,&#xD;
           you will be given a postage-paid envelope to return the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At your Mastectomy Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your complete medical history will be updated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have photos taken of your breasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the surgery, a tissue expander will be placed in your breast. Sterile salt water&#xD;
           will be added to inflate the expander and a small skin sample (about the size of a&#xD;
           pencil eraser) from the breast will be taken to study stretching and scarring of the&#xD;
           skin. The tissue will be securely maintained at MD Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be monitored for any problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Operative Visit - 7 to 10 Days after Mastectomy Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study staff will look at the results of your surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your complete medical history will be updated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the quality of life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any problems you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deflation Visit - Week 5:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your complete medical history will be updated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have photos taken of your breasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The sterile salt water in the expander will be let out, causing the breast to go flat.&#xD;
           This is done by inserting a needle into a special port and withdrawing the fluid with a&#xD;
           syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation Visit - Week 8:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You must have radiation either at M. D. Anderson or an M. D. Anderson-affiliated site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extra fluid may be added to the tissue expander before radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study staff will look at the results of your surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any problems you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive radiation, typically 5 days a week for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Radiation Visits - About Week 13 and every 2 to 4 Weeks after:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your complete medical history will be updated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study staff will look at the results of your surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any problems you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the quality of life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your expander will be re-inflated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed-delayed Reconstruction Surgery - At about Week 23:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your complete medical history will be updated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have photos taken of your breasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During surgery, you will be monitored for any problems. A tissue sample will be&#xD;
           collected to study stretching and scarring of the skin from the mastectomy incision and&#xD;
           the tissue that is used to form the new breast. The tissue will be securely maintained&#xD;
           at MD Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During surgery, you will have tissue moved from your lower abdomen, back, or buttock to&#xD;
           be used for reconstruction. A silicone or saline breast implant may or may not be used&#xD;
           to help construct the breast. The amount of tissue used for building the breast will&#xD;
           depend on your body size and donation site. Your reconstructive surgeon will discuss&#xD;
           this with you before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During surgery, the expander will be removed and reconstruction of your breast will&#xD;
           occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Surgery - At about Week 47:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your complete medical history will be updated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have photos taken of your breasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the quality of life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During surgery, you will be monitored for any problems and a tissue sample will be&#xD;
           collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During this surgery, procedures will be done to improve the appearance of the breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up Visits - At 6, 12, 24, and 36 Months:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your complete medical history will be updated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have photos taken of your breasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any problems you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At Months 12 and 24, you will complete the quality of life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The implants in this study have been FDA approved for skin&#xD;
      expansion as a method of breast reconstruction. The use of the implants is investigational in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 200 women will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
