  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II clinical trial is studying how well gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway&#xD;
      inhibitor RO4929097 (RO4929097) after autologous stem cell transplant works in treating&#xD;
      patients with multiple myeloma. Giving chemotherapy, such as melphalan, before autologous&#xD;
      stem cell transplant stops the growth of cancer cells by stopping them from dividing or&#xD;
      killing them. Before treatment, stem cells are collected from the patient's blood and stored.&#xD;
      After chemotherapy, the stem cells are returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming&#xD;
      cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy. RO4929097 may stop the growth of cancer cells&#xD;
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving RO4929097 after autologous&#xD;
      stem cell transplant may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy of RO4929097 in eradicating residual/persistent disease&#xD;
      (conversion of VGPR to CR or sCR status) in multiple myeloma patients status post single&#xD;
      high-dose melphalan/autologous stem cell rescue with residual/persistent disease&#xD;
      post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety of single agent RO4929097 post-autologous stem cell transplant in&#xD;
      multiple myeloma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To analyze Notch receptor and ligand protein expression in pre-transplant, pre-treatment&#xD;
      with RO4929097, and post-treatment bone marrow biopsy samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To isolate and identify clonogenic multiple myeloma progenitor cells from bone marrow&#xD;
      aspirate and/or peripheral blood at the following time points: pre-transplant, day 100&#xD;
      post-transplant, and post-treatment staging bone marrow biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To analyze Notch receptor and ligand protein expression on isolated clonogenic progenitor&#xD;
      myeloma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To characterize the tumor xenograft-initiating potential of clonogenic myeloma cells in&#xD;
      adult Casper zebrafish and SCID-hu model and evaluate the drug toxicity and therapeutic&#xD;
      potential of RO4929097 with this model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To analyze anti-angiogenic effects of RO4929097 as measured by reduction in microvessel&#xD;
      density and VEGFR-1 expression in pre-treatment and post-treatment bone marrow biopsy&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To determine whether measurement of soluble surrogate markers of angiogenesis prior to&#xD;
      and following treatment with RO4929097 provide an early marker of disease response to Notch&#xD;
      inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION AND CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients undergo standard mobilization and&#xD;
      collection of autologous peripheral stem cells (&gt;= 4.0 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg). Patients then&#xD;
      receive high-dose melphalan IV on days -3 and -2 and undergo autologous stem cell transfusion&#xD;
      on day 0. Patients with progressive disease, stable disease, partial response, stringent&#xD;
      complete response, or complete response are taken off study; patients with&#xD;
      residual/persistent disease (very good partial response [VGPR]*) continue to therapeutic&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Patients who meet the criteria for VGPR but have findings of abnormal bone marrow&#xD;
      cytogenetic study demonstrating &gt;= 10% metaphase cells positive for either high-risk&#xD;
      chromosomal abnormalities or persistent disease-related chromosomal abnormalities (e.g.,&#xD;
      chromosome del 13; del17p, t(4;14), t(14;16), t(6;14) or complex cytogenetics) will have a&#xD;
      repeat bone marrow biopsy assessment with cytogenetics within 2-3 weeks. If the repeat biopsy&#xD;
      findings suggest persistent high-risk cytogenetic findings, then the patient is considered&#xD;
      eligible to receive RO4929097 to eradicate residual disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THERAPEUTIC TREATMENT: Beginning 100-110 days after transplantation, patients receive oral&#xD;
      RO4929097 once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Courses repeat every 21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 4 weeks.&#xD;
