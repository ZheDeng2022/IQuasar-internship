  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-center, 2&#xD;
      treatment,3-way crossover to investigate the pharmacodynamics, i.e. the flush-symptom of a&#xD;
      single oral repeated dose of 500 mg nicotinic acid in healthy subjects. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to a treatment sequence - AAB, ABA or BAA. The two treatments will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment A: 500 mg nicotinic acid&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment B: Placebo&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             randomization into the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Regular use of medication in the last 60 days before the day of randomization into the&#xD;
