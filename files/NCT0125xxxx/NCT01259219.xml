      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE The HIV and TB epidemics disproportionately affect sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa, and have had a catastrophic impact in the region. The synergy between these pathogens&#xD;
      has resulted in dramatic increases in TB incidence, with 58% of cases of adult TB in 2005 in&#xD;
      South Africa being HIV-associated [1]. The impact of HIV co-infection on TB in children has&#xD;
      not yet been well defined due to inadequate surveillance and diagnostic challenges of&#xD;
      pediatric TB and HIV in resource poor settings. Studies have demonstrated that between 10 and&#xD;
      60% of children with TB in sub-Saharan Africa are co-infected with HIV [2-5]. The risk of&#xD;
      diagnosing TB among HIV-infected children has been shown to be 8 times higher among&#xD;
      HIV-infected children than among HIV-uninfected children [6]. The risk of TB among&#xD;
      HIV-infected children is associated with the degree of immunodeficiency, with a 3-year risk&#xD;
      of developing TB among immunocompromised children (CD4&lt;15%) of 12,400/100,000, compared to&#xD;
      3,300/100,000 in less immunocompromised HIV-infected children [7]. TB in HIV infected&#xD;
      children is not only a cause of morbidity, but is also a frequent cause of death among&#xD;
      HIV-infected children [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though the treatment of HIV-associated TB is complicated by overlapping toxicities, high&#xD;
      pill burden and the occurrence of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS),&#xD;
      experiences of concomitant TB and HIV treatment in children are positive, with HIV-infected&#xD;
      children with active TB who start ART having similar outcomes to children who started on ART&#xD;
      for a non-TB diagnosis [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-administration of TB and HIV medications is associated with clinically significant and&#xD;
      highly complex drug-drug interactions. Protease inhibitors (PIs) and non-nucleoside reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are substrates for cytochrome P450 isozymes and&#xD;
      P-glycoprotein. Rifampin (RIF), a key component of TB treatment regimens, is a potent inducer&#xD;
      of hepatic and intestinal cytochrome P450 isozymes and P-glycoprotein [10]. Multiple studies&#xD;
      have demonstrated decreased concentrations of PIs and NNRTIs when coadministered with&#xD;
      rifampin [11]. The concentrations of Efavirenz (EFV), nevirapine (NVP) and LPV/RTV are&#xD;
      decreased by as much as 22, 68 and 75%, respectively, when coadministered with RIF [12, 13].&#xD;
      While the interaction with EFV may not be clinically important or could be overcome by dose&#xD;
      increase [12], investigations with LPV/RTV have not been able to provide full confidence that&#xD;
      higher doses of LPV/RTV overcome induction of enzymes by RIF [14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In resource-poor countries, most adults with HIV/TB co-infection receive a combination of&#xD;
      EFV-based ART and RIF-based TB treatment. In children under 3 years of age, EFV is not&#xD;
      recommended for antiretroviral treatment. The choice of ART regimen in TB/HIV co-infected&#xD;
      children is further complicated by the limited options for pediatric drug formulations and/or&#xD;
      dosing information. According to the World Health Organization guidelines, the first-line&#xD;
      treatment recommendation for children with TB and HIV co-infection is a triple NRTI regimen&#xD;
      consisting of d4T or AZT plus 3TC and ABC [15]. Alternatively, the standard first-line&#xD;
      regimen of two NRTIs plus NVP can be used. Both of these regimens are suboptimal. The triple&#xD;
      NRTI regimen has been shown to have suboptimal virologic potency [16], and the NVP-based&#xD;
      regimen is problematic in children exposed to single dose NVP for prevention of PMTCT as many&#xD;
      of these will have developed resistance [17].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In South Africa, the recommended regimen for children age &lt; 3 years of age who receive&#xD;
      concomitant treatment for TB is the combination of LPV/RTV with an NRTIs. A recent study&#xD;
      demonstrated that this regimen also results in suboptimal doses of LPV/TRV when given&#xD;
      concomitantly with RIF, and that even a double dose of LPV/RTV given concomitantly with RIF&#xD;
      does not provide adequate LPV exposures [18] . Another study assessed super-boosted LPV as an&#xD;
      alternative approach, using LPV/RTV with extra RTV to equal the dose of LPV but this study&#xD;
      was stopped due to safety concerns [19].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clearly, there is an urgent need for a safe, effective and feasible combined treatment for&#xD;
      young children with HIV-associated TB. Rifabutin (RBT), a wide spectrum antibiotic&#xD;
      particularly active on acid-fast bacilli is a rifamycin with limited CYP450 induction&#xD;
      potential and thus minimal effect on concentrations of NNRTIs and PIs including LPV/RTV [20],&#xD;
      is a recommended alternative to treat TB in combination with PI-based ART in adults [21]. In&#xD;
      adults, RBT has been found to be equally safe and effective as RIF for the treatment of TB,&#xD;
      with similar rates of adverse events, cure and relapse of TB between RIF and RBT [22]. The&#xD;
      information from randomized clinical trials is however dominated by HIV negative individuals&#xD;
      The only comparative randomized clinical trials in HIV positive patients found both RIF and&#xD;
      RBT to be safe and effective and demonstrated more rapid clearance of acid-fast bacilli when&#xD;
      using RBT [23]. The evidence from observational cohort studies including HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients treated with ART does not point to inferior performance of rifabutin, but is less&#xD;
      rigorous. To date, there are no published efficacy studies of RBT in combination with these&#xD;
      boosted PIs. In addition, the clinical experience with RBT for TB in resource-constrained&#xD;
      settings is limited, especially in the context of the PIs [24].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In March 2009, Rifabutin (RBT) was added to the WHO essential medicine list to substitute RIF&#xD;
      for treatment of TB in HIV infected patients treated with RTV boosted PI-containing&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy [25]. Listing RBT on the essential medicine list, was an important&#xD;
      first step toward increasing the availability of RBT for large scale use at affordable cost&#xD;
      in the resource-limited settings. The high cost of RBT when compared with RIF however made it&#xD;
      inaccessible to tuberculosis control programs in resource-limited settings. In August 2009,&#xD;
      the Clinton Foundation announced a price agreement with Pfizer to lower the price of RBT in&#xD;
      emerging markets by 60%, to $1 per 150mg dose. This initiative greatly improved the prospect&#xD;
      of using RBT in a public health approach to co-treatment of TB and HIV in developing&#xD;
      countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major remaining stumbling block to use RBT for concomitant treatment of TB and HIV in&#xD;
      children is the lack of data (dosing, safety and efficacy) on the use of RBT for treatment of&#xD;
      TB in children. Until now, dosing for RBT is only available to treat Mycobacterium Avium&#xD;
      Complex (MAC) in children. Proper dosing of RBT in combination with LPV/TRV ART is essential&#xD;
      to prevent failure of therapy and rise of drug resistant TB and HIV strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed assessment of the optimal dosing strategy, pharmacokinetic profile, and safety&#xD;
      of rifabutin when given concomitantly with LPV/RTV in young children (age &lt; 5 years) will be&#xD;
      a critical step towards improved management of TB/HIV in these children. Availability of a&#xD;
      safe and effective treatment regimen for young HIV co-infected children with TB is highly&#xD;
      important, especially in light of the results of the Children with HIV Early Antiretroviral&#xD;
      Therapy (CHER) trial which indicate that HIV-infected infants should be treated with ART as&#xD;
      early as possible (in the first months of life) as this dramatically decreases their risk of&#xD;
      early death [26].&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS AND STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis We hypothesize that a clinically significant drug interaction exists between&#xD;
      rifabutin (RBT) and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) in young children (age &lt; 5 years) such that&#xD;
      rifabutin dosing for concomitant administration of RBT and LPV/RTV needs to be developed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective To assess dosing, pharmacokinetic profile, and safety of rifabutin when&#xD;
      given concomitantly with LPV/RTV for 14 days in HIV-infected children age &lt; 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES Rifabutin administration, formulation and preparation Rifabutin (RBT) will&#xD;
      be administered at a dose of 5mg/kg three times per week for a period of 14 days in 10&#xD;
      children. All six RBT dosages will be taken under direct observation, witnessed at the&#xD;
      subject's home (community based DOT). The amount of drug dispensed and returned will also be&#xD;
      recorded by the pharmacy. A diary card will be provided to all parents and guardians to&#xD;
      record dosage administration (adherence) of all other drugs throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RBT will be compounded at the Baragwanath hospital using 150mg Mycobutin capsules. Rifabutin&#xD;
      suspension will be provided by the study as a 14 day supply. While there is currently no&#xD;
      commercially available RBT dosage form for use in children, rifabutin has been compounded as&#xD;
      a suspension for easy use in children and was found stable for 12 weeks at 4 to 40 Â°C [27].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since we anticipate minimal change in LPV exposures with the addition of RBT (AUC ratio of&#xD;
      LPV+RBT/ LPV alone is 1.17, 90%CI 1.04-1.31) [28], LPV/RTV dose will not be altered during&#xD;
      co-administration with RBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Dose Justification There is no PK data in children for using RBT alone or in&#xD;
      combination with LPV/RTV. In addition, there is no efficacy data for using RBT to treat TB in&#xD;
      children. Safety and efficacy exist for using RBT to treat Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC)&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial RBT dose of 5 mg/kg three times weekly is based on a review of available&#xD;
      pediatric and adult data (see details below) and corresponds to the recommended dose of 150&#xD;
      mg/kg 3 times per week in adults. Because there is no direct benefit in the participating&#xD;
      children, we opt for a conservative, safe approach and will not adjust the target RBT&#xD;
      concentrations upwards, even if the dose recommendation for adults increases in the future&#xD;
      (which could happen based on preliminary results presented by Boulanger et al) [29].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data in Adults&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In adults, the recommended dose for RBT when given together with LPV/RTV is 150 mg 3&#xD;
           times per week, which is half the dose at half the frequency compared to administration&#xD;
           of RBT without LPV/RTV [21, 28].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data in adults has demonstrated that the development of acquired rifamycin resistance is&#xD;
           more likely in those with AUC 3.0 (1.9-4.5) [mean (95% CI)] compared to those with AUC&#xD;
           5.2 (4.6-5.8) [mean (95% CI)] [30].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data in Children&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The USPHS/IDSA guidelines suggest RBT 5mg/kg QD in children for preventing MAC infection&#xD;
           without concomitant protease inhibitors, and using half this dose when combining&#xD;
           rifabutin with PIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose for MAC treatment in children is 18.5 mg/kg (age â‰¤1 year) and 8.6mg/kg (age 2-10&#xD;
           years), with maximum of 300 mg [31].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The minimal inhibitory concentration is higher for Mycobacterium Avium Complex (MAC), so&#xD;
           treating TB based on MAC dosing should be sufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A RBT dose of 5mg/kg three times a week for two weeks will cause minimal toxicity in&#xD;
           children as toxicity has been observed in populations that used much higher doses (mean&#xD;
           9.2mg/kg) and for a much longer duration (mean of 27 weeks) (Smith).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety and efficacy data in treating MAC in children are sparse. The risk for corneal&#xD;
           deposits is increased with prolonged administration of RBT [32], especially after 14&#xD;
           months of treatment, which is much longer than the standard 6 month treatment for TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;There is a nonlinear relationship between clearance and size. The linear per kilogram&#xD;
           model, based on adult values, underestimates clearance and, consequently, maintenance&#xD;
           dose in children. An established scientific framework is supportive of an&#xD;
           allometric-based model for weight with a coefficient of 0.75 for clearance and 1 for&#xD;
           volume&quot; [33]. This corresponds to approximately twice the clearance and consequently&#xD;
           twice the per kilogram dose requirement in children of about 2-years old (range: 1-5&#xD;
           years) [34].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim Analyses to evaluate the need for dose adjustment An interim analysis of the PK data&#xD;
      will be performed after either completion of study activities in 10 children or the&#xD;
      occurrence of a SAE determined to be related to the RBT, whichever occurs first. A SAE will&#xD;
      be defined as any grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality, development of uveitis,&#xD;
      hospitalization or death. Every SAE will be reviewed by a committee consisting of three&#xD;
      external reviewers: Dr. Mark Cotton and Dr. Brian Eley, infectious disease pediatricians in&#xD;
      Cape Town, SA, and Dr. Ed Caparelli, a US based pharmacologist. If the committee decides that&#xD;
      the SAE is unrelated to RBT, enrollment will continue until 10 children are enrolled or a&#xD;
      second SAE occurs. If the SAE is judged to be related to RBT, then the interim analysis will&#xD;
      be performed prior to completion of study activities in 10 children. Children in whom the&#xD;
      study drug has been started will continue administration for all 6 doses, unless the&#xD;
      committee decided that all drug administration needs to be halted. The NIH program officer&#xD;
      (Carol Worrell) will be informed of each SAE and the decision made by the committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the interim analysis of PK data, a decision will be made on the dose and dosing&#xD;
      interval in subsequent children and the final sample size (determined based on variability&#xD;
      observed in the first 10 children). The sample size will aim to have sufficient precision of&#xD;
      the dose that reaches a geometic mean AUC (0-48 h) in children of 5-6 mg.h/L, approximating&#xD;
      the AUC (0-48h) for rifabutin shown to be effective in adults [30] and approximating RBN AUC&#xD;
      when used alone in a dose of 300 mg/d in adults [35].&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK Sampling and safety assessment PK sampling will consist of one intensive PK assessment for&#xD;
      steady state plasma concentrations of RBT, 25-o-desacetyl RBT (desRBT, the most important&#xD;
      active RBT metabolite) and LPV after 14 days of co-administration with sampling at 0, 2, 4,&#xD;
      and 9 hours for LPV and 0, 2, 4, 9, 24 and 48 hrs for RBT and desRBT. To perform LPV, RBT,&#xD;
      and desRBT assays plasma concentrations, a total of 1.5 ml whole blood will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessment (including clinical exam, liver function test (ALT), and full blood count)&#xD;
      will be performed at screening, at the first scheduled visit (within 2 to 4 weeks of last RBT&#xD;
      administration), and at any time the child presents with signs of symptoms of possible RBT&#xD;
      associated toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant Medications The following medications are not allowed during the study: any&#xD;
      antiretrovirals other than LPV/RTV and NRTIs, Rifampin, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital,&#xD;
      Carbamazepine, Fluconazole, Ketoconazole, Itraconazole, Steroids, any other inducers of&#xD;
      inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 and PGP enzyme system.(see appendix) Any additional&#xD;
      medications required during the study period should be approved by a member of the study&#xD;
      team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LABORATORY EVALUATIONS Processing of peripheral blood samples Whole blood samples of 1.5 ml&#xD;
      will be drawn in lithium heparin tubes, centrifuged at 4degrees C at 2600rpm for 10min;&#xD;
      plasma removed; shipped and stored at -70 degrees C for future analysis in the laboratory of&#xD;
      Dr Maartens, University of Cape Town.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LPV concentrations will be quantified by a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass&#xD;
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method using a modification of the method by Chi J et al [36].The&#xD;
      calibration curve is linear over the range 0.05-20 mg/L. Any sample with LPV results above 20&#xD;
      mg/L will be diluted with drug-free plasma and reanalyzed. The lower limit of quantification&#xD;
      (LLOQ) of the LPV assay is 0.05 mg/L. Any samples with LPV concentration below the LLOQ will&#xD;
      be reported as &lt;0.05 mg/L and treated as 0 mg/L in the analysis. LPV assay accuracy ranged&#xD;
      from 94.3 to 103.0%. The intra-day and inter-day precisions ranged from 0.14 to 4.72% and&#xD;
      from 1.61 to 4.22%, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assays for RBT and its active metabolite 25-o-desacetyl RBT have been developed on the&#xD;
      LC-MS/MS, The validated concentration range for both RBT and 25-o-desacetyl RBT is 5-500&#xD;
      ng/mL (=0.005 to 0.5 mg/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and Safety Laboratory Assessments Laboratory assessments performed at screening and&#xD;
      required for toxicity reasons during the study will be conducted at the NHLS laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL MANAGEMENT ISSUES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity Subjects may experience toxicities and side effects such as uveitis, arthritis,&#xD;
      liver toxicity, or neutropenia. All toxicities are rare at the dose used in the study,&#xD;
      reversible upon interruption of RBT, and have only been described in children receiving RBT&#xD;
      for several months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maximally limit the potential risk of toxicity occurring, we will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  carefully screen children for pre-existing condition that could increase the risk of&#xD;
           toxicity (see eligibility criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform careful clinical and laboratory safety monitoring and use the DAIDS/IMPAACT&#xD;
           grading system to grade toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have all SAE (death, hospitalization, grade 3 or 4 AE) reviewed by an independent safety&#xD;
           committee (see section 5.1.2). Enrollment will be halted until the committee decides&#xD;
           whether the SAE is related to RBT or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRITERIA FOR DISCONTINUATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Premature Study Discontinuation Any child that develops a rash or an SAE (grade 3 or 4&#xD;
      laboratory abnormality, development of uveitis, or hospitalization) will be discontinued from&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints The primary endpoint of the study is the dose of RBT with a resultant AUC of&#xD;
      4.5-6.0 mcg/mL when used in combination with LPV/RTV in children age &lt; 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification If sample size and patient characteristics allow, analysis will be stratified&#xD;
      by age and nutritional status (weight for age z score â‰¤ or &gt; minus 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Accrual We estimate that a sample size of 10 children will provide&#xD;
      information on variability of the AUC parameter in children, sufficient to calculate a final&#xD;
      sample size at the time of the interim analysis. We estimate that a final sample size of&#xD;
      30-40 will allow a sufficient number of samples in order to perform PK modeling (210 data&#xD;
      time points) and stratify analysis by age and nutritional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses LPV/RTV and RBT concentration data will be analyzed using standard WinNonLin Pro&#xD;
      software to determine PK parameters. Drug exposure will be assessed using AUC0-24hr and&#xD;
      AUC0-48hr for RBT and desRBT, and AUC0-12hr for LPV. We will also assess C0hr, Cmax, Tmax,&#xD;
      and oral clearance (CL/F) for RBT, desRBT and LPV. The AUC will be determined using the&#xD;
      trapezoidal rule. To analyze factors associated with the RBT serum levels, we will perform&#xD;
      analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with rifabutin AUC0-24hr adjusted for drug dose as the&#xD;
      dependent variable and demographic, clinical, anthropometric, nutritional and laboratory&#xD;
      characteristics as independent variables. In the final analysis population pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      models for RBT and desRBT will be generated using nonlinear mixed effects methods. These&#xD;
      models will be used to simulate the RBT doses required for pharmacokinetic targets, thus&#xD;
      allowing dose recommendations in subpopulations and, simulation of changing RBT exposure&#xD;
      targets. The data will also be used to validate population RBT models built on data from&#xD;
      other sources&#xD;
&#xD;
      HUMAN SUBJECTS Institutional Review Board (IRB) Review, Recruitment and Informed Consent The&#xD;
      study will be reviewed by the Institutional Review Board of the University of North Carolina&#xD;
      at Chapel Hill, the University of the Witwatersrand and the University of Cape Town. Approval&#xD;
      of the study will be needed before any study activities are started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also be submitted to the South African Medicine Control Council for review and&#xD;
      approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects will be identified during routine clinic visits. The health care worker in&#xD;
      charge of the care of the child will briefly explain the study to parent or legal guardians&#xD;
      of children meeting eligibility requirements. Caretakers that are interested will be referred&#xD;
      to the study nurse for the informed consent process. The informed consent will describe the&#xD;
      purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed and the risks and benefits of&#xD;
      participation. In the event the study subject's guardian cannot read, this consent will be&#xD;
      performed verbally in the subject's native language. All informed consent procedures will be&#xD;
      performed by trained study personnel in a private exam room to ensure privacy. A copy of the&#xD;
      consent from will be given to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Design Issues The study of novel drug regimens in children is important but poses&#xD;
      several ethical challenges. The study team (and NIH reviewers) assessed several approaches to&#xD;
      the study of RBT PK in HIV infected children in need for concomitant ART and TB treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children could have a direct benefit of receiving RBT if in need of TB treatment, i.e&#xD;
      HIV-infected children diagnosed with active TB. Enrollment of these children in a RBT dose&#xD;
      finding study however raises the possibility of substandard treatment for TB, a risk which is&#xD;
      not defendable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reduce the risk of exposure to substandard TB treatment, one could perform real time&#xD;
      therapeutic drug monitoring. Unfortunately, &quot;real time&quot; therapeutic drug monitoring still has&#xD;
      a turn-around time of at least one week, which still poses the an unacceptable risk of&#xD;
      substandard treatment for TB in these children during that time period. Seen that TB has&#xD;
      substantial risk of death in HIV infected children, this risk is unacceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following several rounds of discussion, the group of experts decided that RBT PK should only&#xD;
      be studied in &quot;healthy children&quot;, i.e. children free of TB. Because of the difficulty in&#xD;
      excluding active TB in children (obtaining a respiratory specimen in young children is&#xD;
      difficult and even if successful, the bacteriological yield is low due to the paucibacillary&#xD;
      nature of TB in children), it was decided that the optimal characteristics of eligible&#xD;
      children are those who recently successfully completed TB treatment (see section 4.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Realizing that HIV infected children are potentially more vulnerable compared to HIV&#xD;
      uninfected children, one could suggest including HIV negative children who recently completed&#xD;
      TB treatment. The disadvantages to this approach is that one exposes children to two drugs&#xD;
      they do not need (no direct benefit from either drug) compared to one drug (in the proposed&#xD;
      study, only children receiving LPV/RTV are eligible). Furthermore, the drug absorption and&#xD;
      metabolism in HIV infected children may differ that of HIV uninfected children, a phenomenon&#xD;
      that has been observed for TB drugs in HIV infected vs. HIV negative adults [37-40]. For&#xD;
      these reasons, we selected to include HIV infection as an eligibility criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Confidentiality Data collected for this study will be entered into a confidential&#xD;
      database. The patients will not be assigned a study number, all data will be stored and&#xD;
      analyzed by reference to the study number rather than to the patient name. Study specific&#xD;
      blood samples will also be labelled according to the study number in order to preserve&#xD;
      anonymity. It will not be possible to determine the identity of the patients from the&#xD;
      information maintained in the database. The database will be password protected with access&#xD;
      restricted to certain study personnel (principal investigators A.V.R., T.M., H.M., G.M.,&#xD;
      study nurse, and relevant consultants. All documents specific to this research linking&#xD;
      patient personal information to study ID code numbers will be kept securely in SA. Only the&#xD;
      principal investigators, study manager and study nurse will have access to these files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH AND RESEARCH FINDINGS Research findings will be disseminated at&#xD;
      relevant local (South African) and international meetings, and published in local and/or&#xD;
      international medical journals, as appropriate.&#xD;

        SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF SUBJECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with confirmed HIV infection. Confirmation can be by two rapid tests&#xD;
             (children age &gt; 18 months) or virologic test (children &lt; 18 months), and detectable&#xD;
             viral load prior to starting ARVs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age â‰¤ 5 years old - rationale: changes in body composition and maturity of&#xD;
             metabolizing enzymes and organs result in age-related differences in drug clearance,&#xD;
             especially between children â‰¤ 5 years and children &gt; 5 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving an ART regimen containing 2 NRTIs + LPV/RTV at standard dose&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Successfully completed TB treatment in the past 2 to 6 weeks. Successful completion of&#xD;
             treatment will be defined as children with good clinical response (resolution of TB&#xD;
             symptoms) to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. RBT has not yet been approved for treatment of TB in children. Participating children&#xD;
             can therefore not be in need treatment for TB as this may lead to substandard&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. RBT monotherapy in the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis can lead to the&#xD;
             development of resistance. Excluding active TB is difficult in children, especially&#xD;
             those that are HIV co-infected. Children who have just successfully completed a&#xD;
             treatment for TB can be assumed to be free of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A minimum of two weeks is needed between RIF and RBT administration to ensure wash-out&#xD;
             of any enzyme inducing effects of RIF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of symptomatic clinical hepatitis during TB treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal liver function defined as ALT &gt; 2.5 times the normal upper limit&#xD;
             (corresponding to the US National Institute of Health Division of AIDS scale grade 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal bilirubin defined as &gt; 1.5 UNL (â‰¥ DAIDS grade 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal serum creatinine defined as &gt;1.1 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anemia defined as hemoglobin &lt; 8gm/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neutropenia defined as &lt; 1.0 x 109/L(corresponding to grade 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal platelets defined as &lt;125 x 1012/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre-existing eye conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that the clinician feels would predispose the child to toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children required to take any drug known or predicted to interact with rifabutin (see&#xD;
             appendix)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children who do not meet inclusion criteria and/or whose parents refuse consent.&#xD;
