  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to determine the effect of a behavioral weight loss program supplemented with&#xD;
      Nutrisystem meal replacements on weight, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, and blood&#xD;
      lipids levels over 12 weeks.&#xD;

      Specific Aim 1- Compare two programs, a standard Internet weight loss program and an Internet&#xD;
      behavioral weight loss program, enhanced with Nutrisystem meal provision, on their&#xD;
      effectiveness in producing weight loss and improvements in fasting blood glucose, blood&#xD;
      pressure, and blood lipid levels over 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2- Determine the usage and acceptability of the two programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Internet program with Nutrisystem meal provision will produce greater improvements in&#xD;
      participant's health (weight, blood pressure, blood lipids, and fasting blood glucose) than&#xD;
      the standard Internet program alone at 12 weeks. The acceptability and usage of each program&#xD;
      will directly correlate with weight loss in participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Methods Participants will be recruited through advertisements in local&#xD;
      newspapers. Randomization A two-group randomized design will be used. After meeting all&#xD;
      exclusion/inclusion criteria, completion of all study measurements, and provision of written&#xD;
      consent, individuals will be randomized to one of the two study groups: (1) the standard&#xD;
      Internet behavioral weight loss program alone or (2) the standard Internet program plus&#xD;
      Nutrisystem meal provision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline and Milestones Recruitment advertisements for the study will be placed in&#xD;
      mid-December. Participants who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be invited to a&#xD;
      study information session the first week of January.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery Phase (Jan.-April 2011) The delivery phase will entail: (1) conducting study&#xD;
      information sessions; (2) baseline assessments; (3) conducting the 12-week Intervention; (4)&#xD;
      12-week assessments. Dr. Webber will conduct study information sessions for qualified&#xD;
      participants during the first week of January. Interested participants will then be asked to&#xD;
      sign consent forms, fill out motivation questionnaires, and to schedule appointments at the&#xD;
      Clinical Research Center (CRC) at the University of Kentucky for baseline assessments of&#xD;
      height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose and blood lipids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once measurements at the CRC are taken, participants will be randomized to study group. At&#xD;
      baseline each group will receive a 2-hour weight loss group session with a registered&#xD;
      dietitian. The weight loss session will include presentation of information on exercise and&#xD;
      dietary recommendations, an overview of energy balance, and instructions for self-monitoring,&#xD;
      good dietary practices, exercise safety recommendations, and orientation to the study&#xD;
      website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will be given password protected access to a standard Internet program. The&#xD;
      website will include 12 weekly lessons based on the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a&#xD;
      message board feature, a link to a personal self-monitoring diary, a library of links to&#xD;
      diet, exercise, and behavioral resources available on the web, and a weekly weight loss tip.&#xD;
      The Nutrisystem group will receive 2 weeks of meals at the baseline 2-hour session. They will&#xD;
      be asked to return every two weeks to the clinic to pick up Nutrisystem meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation Phase (May-Oct. 2011) The evaluation phase of the project will entail: (1) data&#xD;
      entry, cleaning and analysis; (2) final report preparation; (3) manuscript preparation.&#xD;
