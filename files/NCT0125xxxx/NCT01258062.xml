  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo controlled, safety and immunogenicity study of GelVac™ nasal&#xD;
      powder H5N1 influenza vaccine. Healthy male and female subjects between 18 and 49 years of&#xD;
      age who are eligible for study participation will be enrolled in the trial. It is expected&#xD;
      that 10 subjects will be screened to obtain 7 subjects who will be eligible for study&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the frequency and severity of local and systemic&#xD;
      adverse events of vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to assess the immunogenicity of the vaccine based on geometric&#xD;
      mean titers (GMT) of serum HAI, serum neutralizing, and nasal wash IgA antibodies.&#xD;
