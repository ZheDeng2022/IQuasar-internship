  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to determine if partial breast irradiation (PBI) limited to the region&#xD;
      of the tumor bed following lumpectomy in patients screened with MRI provides historically&#xD;
      similar rates of local failure, limited acute skin toxicity, late complications and cosmetic&#xD;
      outcome when compared to patients treated with standard 3D-CRT to the whole breast.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stage 0 or I breast carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  40 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Post menopausal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lumpectomy with clear margins (&gt;2mm)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with invasive disease must have undergone an axillary staging by axillary&#xD;
             dissection (with a minimum of 6 axillary nodes) or sentinal node biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gross disease must be unifocal with pathological tumor size 2cm or less&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Target lumpectomy cavity must be clearly marked with surgical clips (the target&#xD;
             lumpectomy cavity/whole breast reference volume must be &lt;=30% based on the&#xD;
             postoperative imaging)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilateral MRI of the breasts within previous 6 months of radiation therapy (RT)&#xD;
             planning&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If patient is eligible based on postoperative imaging, partial breast irradiation&#xD;
             (PBI) is judged to be technically deliverable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of malignancies are eligible if they have stable disease as&#xD;
             determined by their attending oncologist&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have signed the consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with Stage II, II, or IV breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre- or peri-menopausal patients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with positive lymph nodes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with suspicious microcalcifications, densities, or palpable abnormalities&#xD;
             unless biopsied and found to be benign&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with multifocal, multicentric, or bilateral breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgical margins that cannot be microscopically assessed or are positive at&#xD;
             pathological evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clear delineation of the extent of the target lumpectomy cavity is not possible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Breast implants (patients who have had implants removed are eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior breast or thoracic RT for any condition&#xD;
