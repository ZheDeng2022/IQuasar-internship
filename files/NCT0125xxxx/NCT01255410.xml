    <textblock>
      People who are infected with human metapneumovirus (HMPV) may develop upper and lower&#xD;
      respiratory illnesses. Children are particularly sensitive to HMPV infection. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and immune response of an HMPV vaccine in healthy adults,&#xD;
      HMPV-seropositive children, and HMPV-seronegative infants and children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HMPV is a viral respiratory pathogen that was discovered in 2001, but studies have shown that&#xD;
      it has been circulating in humans for at least 50 years. Older adults and adults with asthma&#xD;
      who are infected with HMPV may be at increased risk for lower respiratory illness and&#xD;
      hospitalization. In infants and young children, HMPV infection may cause upper or lower&#xD;
      respiratory illness, ear infections, bronchiolitis, croup, pneumonia, and exacerbations of&#xD;
      asthma. Children less than 2 years of age are most susceptible to severe HMPV infections, and&#xD;
      HMPV is the second or third leading cause of viral lower respiratory illness in children. The&#xD;
      National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is working to develop a&#xD;
      live-attenuated, intranasally administered HMPV vaccine for use in infants. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an HMPV vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccine will be evaluated in four groups of participants: healthy adults;&#xD;
      HMPV-seropositive children; and two groups of HMPV-seronegative infants and children, with&#xD;
      each seronegative group receiving a different dose of the vaccine. In the adult group,&#xD;
      participants will all receive the vaccine; in the infant and children groups, participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to receive either the vaccine or a placebo. Study researchers will&#xD;
      review participants' study data and confirm the safety of the vaccine before enrolling the&#xD;
      next group of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will first enroll healthy adults. At a baseline study visit, all participants will&#xD;
      undergo a medical history review, physical examination, nasal wash procedure, vital sign&#xD;
      measurements, and a blood collection. They will then receive the vaccine, and they will&#xD;
      remain in the clinic for 30 minutes for observation. Participants will record their&#xD;
      temperature daily for 12 days. Additional study visits will occur at Days 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10,&#xD;
      and 12. At each study visit, participants will undergo a medical history review, vital sign&#xD;
      measurements, and a nasal wash procedure. A final study visit will occur on Day 28 and will&#xD;
      also include a blood collection. The second group of participants will include seropositive&#xD;
      children. They will receive the vaccine or a placebo vaccine and take part in the same study&#xD;
      procedures as the adult participants. Participants' parents will receive telephone calls or&#xD;
      e-mails from study staff on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 11, and 13 to obtain and record medical history&#xD;
      and temperature readings. The third and fourth groups of participants will include&#xD;
      seronegative infants and children. Each of these two groups will receive different doses of&#xD;
      the vaccine or placebo vaccine. They will attend study visits on Days 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14,&#xD;
      17, 19, 21, 28, and 56, and they will undergo the same study procedures as the other&#xD;
      participants. Parents of seronegative infants and children will receive telephone calls or&#xD;
      e-mails from study staff on Days 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22 to 27, and 29.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff will call all participants at Month 6 for a medical history review and follow up.&#xD;
