  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with special needs require complex, individualized therapy to maximize their&#xD;
      long-term quality of life. One subset of children with special needs includes those with both&#xD;
      developmental delays and deafness. Currently, there is little compelling evidence supporting&#xD;
      the idea that cochlear implantation provides benefit to children that don't have the&#xD;
      cognitive potential to develop normal speech and language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will perform a prospective, randomized clinical trial to answer the question of which&#xD;
      intervention provides more benefit to this population of children using validated,&#xD;
      norm-referenced tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our long-term goal is to develop guidelines that may help when selecting a treatment for&#xD;
      hearing loss in a child with developmental delays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal is significant because children with special needs are deserving of evidence&#xD;
      upon which to base treatment decision-making, but remain under-represented in the medical&#xD;
      literature and are often not studied. This research is designed to meet the criteria for the&#xD;
      National Institutes of Health road map because it will generate this type of objective&#xD;
      evidence that can directly improve patient care.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, randomized clinical trial. Deaf children (and their parent or&#xD;
      guardians) who meet the criteria for developmental delays (as well as the other inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria) will be randomly assigned to receive either hearing aids (group 1) or a&#xD;
      cochlear implant (group 2) and followed longitudinally for two years. If one intervention&#xD;
      provides improved development and quality of life over the other, this study will provide&#xD;
      essential evidence to support clinical decision-making in this population. Children with&#xD;
      normal cognition undergoing cochlear implantation will be studied as a control cohort (group&#xD;
      3) in order to demonstrate to what extent the gains after cochlear implantation in children&#xD;
      with developmental delays parallel the gains seen in children without developmental delays.&#xD;
      There is no placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 1: We will compare the changes in development between the groups. If our&#xD;
      hypothesis is true, auditory, linguistic, and cognitive development should demonstrate more&#xD;
      improvement in deaf children with developmental delays treated with cochlear implantation&#xD;
      compared to those treated with hearing aids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 2: We will compare the changes in quality of life between the groups. If our&#xD;
      hypothesis is true, quality of life should demonstrate more improvement in patients treated&#xD;
      with cochlear implantation compared to those treated with hearing aids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening will be performed by the Principal Investigator (PI), his collaborators, and his&#xD;
      research staff at the Children's Hearing Center at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital (LPCH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to minimize investigator selection bias and in an attempt to produce study groups&#xD;
      that are comparable, this is a randomized study. Randomization does not guarantee comparable&#xD;
      study groups, particularly in a small trial like this. In order to improve the odds of&#xD;
      achieving comparable study groups, we have elected to stratify the randomization process by&#xD;
      age. Also, a block randomization process will be used. Lastly, we will compare the groups at&#xD;
      the end of the study by looking at their baseline assessment data and stratifying the&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, patients with developmental delays will be randomized into one of two groups after the&#xD;
      baseline assessment. This randomization will occur through a specific process in order to&#xD;
      assure it is unbiased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome variables: Four general outcomes will be measured at baseline, one year after the&#xD;
      intervention, and two years after the intervention. The first three reflect measures of&#xD;
      development (auditory, linguistic, and cognitive; specific aim 1) and the last one is quality&#xD;
      of life (specific aim 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data collection will be performed during routine clinic appointments and will not require&#xD;
      any special appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All tests will be administered in either English or Spanish, depending on the patient's or&#xD;
      their parent's primary language. We have bilingual audiology, speech pathology, and&#xD;
      psychology personnel in our center specifically for this purpose. For self-report&#xD;
      questionnaires, a Spanish-interpreter provided by the hospital will be used to translate the&#xD;
      written materials if a Spanish version of the test is not available. If a parent is not able&#xD;
      to read the questionnaire (it is at a 5th grade level), it will be read to them by the&#xD;
      testing personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Auditory development will be assessed by our cochlear implant audiologists using two&#xD;
           different techniques. Behavioral thresholds to speech will be assessed according to&#xD;
           standard clinical audiological guidelines. While children hearing through only one&#xD;
           cochlear implant cannot localize the sound (two ears are required for this), they will&#xD;
           typically demonstrate a behavioral response that indicates cortical perception of the&#xD;
           sound. Thus, this data will provide information regarding the ability of the child to&#xD;
           hear a sound and then generate a change in behavior. As well, auditory-evoked brainstem&#xD;
           response (ABR) or electrically-evoked compound action potential (eCAP) thresholds will&#xD;
           be measured in patients wearing their hearing aids or cochlear implant, respectively.&#xD;
           These data will also be collected according to standard clinical guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Linguistic development will be assessed by standardized speech and language testing as&#xD;
           well as by Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts (SALT) coding. The standardized&#xD;
           tests include the Preschool Language Scale (PLS) and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test&#xD;
           (PPVT). All testing will be performed by our cochlear implant speech pathologists&#xD;
           according to standard clinical guidelines and we already routinely conduct the PLS and&#xD;
           PPVT in our clinic. The PLS is used in patients with minimal vocabulary, typically young&#xD;
           children, and has been validated from birth to 6 years, 11 months of age. In contrast,&#xD;
           the PPVT is more useful in older children who have more vocabulary. It has been&#xD;
           validated for children older than 2 years, 6 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Another way we propose to study language is through the use of language transcript&#xD;
           (SALT) coding. One benefit of this technique is that it permits the test to be adapted&#xD;
           to each child's abilities. Thus, there will be follow-up speech and language data on&#xD;
           every patient. Importantly, this technique has been used previously to assess the effect&#xD;
           of mild-moderate hearing loss and deafness on language development. We will videotape&#xD;
           the 30 minute session of the child with one of our speech therapists. This will be&#xD;
           performed within a speech therapy room designed for videotaping pediatric patients. The&#xD;
           session will be organized by the speech therapist to showcase the child's language&#xD;
           abilities according to standard clinical guidelines. These will include the&#xD;
           administration of vocabulary tests and either a narrative sample or a conversation and&#xD;
           expository sample. The videotape will be coded with no patient identifiers and sent to a&#xD;
           collaborator with expertise in infant and child language development who will perform an&#xD;
           independent analysis of the tape using SALT coding. The measures that will be will be&#xD;
           coded include the Number of Different Words (NDW), Total Number of words (TNW), Mean&#xD;
           Length of Utterance (MLU), and nonverbal indicators of comprehension (e.g., via pointing&#xD;
           and eyegaze). SALT coding of the videotapes will assess both verbal and non-verbal&#xD;
           communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cognitive level will be assessed via standardized testing. The Mullen Scales of Early&#xD;
           Learning (MSEL) (Pearson, Bloomington, MN) is an objective measure designed for young&#xD;
           children to estimate intelligence. The age range for the Mullen is birth to 5 years, 8&#xD;
           months, though it also can be used in older children with significant cognitive&#xD;
           impairment such as those included in this study. Items administered for this test load&#xD;
           onto 5 different domains (Visual Reception, Gross Motor, Fine Motor, Expressive&#xD;
           Language, and Receptive Language). Because verbal and nonverbal domains are assessed&#xD;
           separately, this measure is particularly useful in the assessment of children who have&#xD;
           suspected language delays and/or hearing loss. We will perform the complete test and&#xD;
           analyze the change in each domain (i.e. measured before and after the intervention). The&#xD;
           raw scores will be used in order to have the most sensitivity in detecting changes in&#xD;
           patients with MR who otherwise would tend to be on the low end of the percentile range.&#xD;
           The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) (Pearson, Bloomington, MN) provides a&#xD;
           measure of a child's adaptive functioning. This describes the child's ability to cope&#xD;
           and function effectively within their environment. This measure is a structured parent&#xD;
           interview and can be performed with caregivers of children from birth to adulthood. In&#xD;
           its entirety, the measure provides information regarding a child's functioning across&#xD;
           several domains including Communication, Socialization, Motor Skills, and Daily Living&#xD;
           Skills. We will perform the complete test and analyze the change in each subscore (i.e.&#xD;
           measured before and after the intervention). It is important to note that these are&#xD;
           psychological tests that have to be given by a highly-trained pediatric psychologist in&#xD;
           the proper environment. The rationale for this precaution is to minimize investigator&#xD;
           bias. The neurocognitive data will be collected during a single 3-4 hour visit with our&#xD;
           psychologist, who also measured these variables prior to the intervention as part of the&#xD;
           Baseline Assessment. Because this testing will always take place by the Psychology&#xD;
           Service and in all likelihood by the same examiner, variability will be minimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quality of life will be assessed using three standardized techniques. The Parenting&#xD;
           Stress Index (PSI) identifies factors increasing the stress in the child-parent system&#xD;
           according to parental perception. We have substantial experience using this test measure&#xD;
           and have used it with our cochlear implant patients for the last several years. The&#xD;
           parental responses are scored and interpreted by the psychologist. The CARE-Index will&#xD;
           also be measured with the help of a consultant who originally developed the CARE-Index&#xD;
           and has tremendous experience with it. This involves videotaping and analyzing a 3-5&#xD;
           minute &quot;free play&quot; interaction between mother and child. The recording is later coded&#xD;
           for maternal attentiveness, infant responsiveness and dyadic interactions using a&#xD;
           14-point sensitivity scale in the CARE-Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention for study participants will be performed by dedicated cochlear implant&#xD;
      audiologists that will do the cochlear implant or hearing aid programming for this trial.&#xD;
      These are highly-trained pediatric audiologists skilled in managing children with complex and&#xD;
      severe hearing losses. Thus, the quality of the intervention will be of the highest level,&#xD;
      whether it is a cochlear implant or hearing aids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in group 1 will be fit with bilateral hearing aids. These will be programmed&#xD;
      individually for the severity and frequency distribution of hearing loss. The type of hearing&#xD;
      aids used will be fit in the most appropriate fashion according to standard audiometric&#xD;
      criteria and our clinic norms. Patients in groups 2 and 3 will undergo cochlear implantation.&#xD;
      According to Food and Drug Administration guidelines, this can only occur after they reach 12&#xD;
      months of age, unless an extenuating situation exists. As well, all appropriate vaccinations&#xD;
      will be in place prior to the surgery, per the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control&#xD;
      (CDC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, we will only implant one ear. This is the current standard of care and is all that&#xD;
      many insurance companies will pay for. The choice of ear will be made on an individual basis,&#xD;
      as determined per the routine of the cochlear implant team. This choice depends on the&#xD;
      anatomy of the inner ear or auditory nerve and the level of residual hearing in the ears. As&#xD;
      well, other factors such as the handedness of the child, the tendency of the child to rest&#xD;
      their head on one side or the other, or parental desires also occasionally play into this&#xD;
      decision. If the family desires to have a second implant placed in the contralateral ear, we&#xD;
      will work with them and their insurance company to try and arrange this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in all three groups will require frequent follow-up visits to the audiology clinic&#xD;
      for device programming. Typically, these visits are more frequent for those patients with a&#xD;
      cochlear implant than those with hearing aids, but not always. The schedule for these&#xD;
      appointments is made on an individual basis because some children need more frequent changes&#xD;
      in device programming than others. If hearing aid molds need to be polished or re-made as the&#xD;
      child grows, this will be performed per clinic routine. If cochlear implant software or&#xD;
      hardware needs to be updated as new technology emerges, this too will occur per clinic&#xD;
      routine. Thus, all patients will be receiving the highest level of care according to current&#xD;
      standards. Lost or damaged equipment will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As well, patients in all three groups will undergo thorough counseling about hearing loss,and&#xD;
      communication strategies. Contact with the child's teachers, therapists, and caregivers will&#xD;
      be made in an effort to organize a comprehensive strategy of regular communication therapy.&#xD;
      As is our routine, every patient will be offered the opportunity to have supplementary weekly&#xD;
      auditory therapy sessions with one of the speech pathologists that are part of our cochlear&#xD;
      implant team or through one of our satellite speech pathology clinics. Our speech&#xD;
      pathologists can provide auditory-verbal therapy (AVT), although they typically modify the&#xD;
      therapy structure to meet the needs of the individual child. Just as with the audiology&#xD;
      services, speech pathology services will be of the highest level and quality for children in&#xD;
      all groups. However, it should be noted that many families chose not to obtain speech therapy&#xD;
      services through our program. Instead, as a matter of convenience, most families choose to&#xD;
      have therapy only in their home through free/low cost Early Childhood Intervention (ECI)&#xD;
      services or their local school district.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of time the hearing aids or cochlear implant are used and the amount and quality&#xD;
      of therapy will be assessed by regular phone calls. Every three months the study coordinator&#xD;
      will call the parents/caregiver and ask four questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have there been any complications of the hearing aids or cochlear implant in the last&#xD;
           three months (i.e. ear infections, ear drainage, meningitis), and if so, what therapy&#xD;
           was needed for the complication?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How many hours per day are the hearing aids or cochlear implant are left on the child?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How many hours per week is the child of communication therapy (defined as auditory,&#xD;
           speech, and language therapies) is the child receiving?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How many hours per week of non-communication therapy (defined as physical, occupational,&#xD;
           and cognitive therapies) is the child receiving?&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data will be recorded in the database. The reasons for asking these questions are to&#xD;
      identify adverse events related to the interventions and to help identify reasons why one&#xD;
      intervention may work better or worse than the other. For example, decreased benefit might be&#xD;
      expected if a child treated with hearing aids continuously gets chronic ear drainage that&#xD;
      plugs the hearing aids so badly they have to be left off most of the time or if a child&#xD;
      treated with a cochlear implant gets meningitis. Alternatively, if receiving a cochlear&#xD;
      implant increases the enthusiasm of the parents and they participate in more therapy, there&#xD;
      may be increased benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also be asking participants if they are willing to be contacted regarding future&#xD;
      research studies that may be of interest to them.&#xD;
