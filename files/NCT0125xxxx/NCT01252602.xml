      The purpose of this prospective cohort study is to search for a relationship between maternal&#xD;
      depression in the third trimester, as indicated by a score of &gt; 12 on the EPDS, and a choice&#xD;
      not to breastfeed at all, defined as no breastfeeding after dismissal from the hospital. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that women who screen positive for prenatal depression will be&#xD;
      significantly less likely to breastfeed their babies after discharge from the hospital&#xD;
      following childbirth.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postpartum depression (PPD) is a form of major depressive disorder (MDD) and affects about&#xD;
      15% of mothers following birth (1). This condition is a serious medical matter, not only&#xD;
      because of the suffering it causes the women, but because it can negatively affect the infant&#xD;
      emotionally, socially, and even cognitively, sometimes far beyond the time of the depression&#xD;
      (2). Many physicians now routinely screen for PPD at the traditional 4-6 week postpartum&#xD;
      visit, and such screening has been the policy at OSU clinics for the past decade. However,&#xD;
      Kim et al (2008) recently reported that testing pregnant women at 24-28 weeks gestation for&#xD;
      depression resulted in a risk status that was identical with risk status after delivery for&#xD;
      90% of patients studied (3). The author concluded that prenatal screening for possible later&#xD;
      PPD seemed clinically useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various studies have investigated a possible relationship between PPD and failure to&#xD;
      breastfeed, with mixed results. Misri et al (1997) reported that 83% of their subjects with&#xD;
      PPD experienced onset after discontinuing breastfeeding (4). Henderson et al (2003) reported&#xD;
      that a study of 1,745 Australian women revealed that subjects with PPD were more likely to&#xD;
      stop breastfeeding than non-depressed ones (5). In addition, they found that the women tended&#xD;
      to wean after onset of PPD (5). However, McKee et al (2004) found no association between PPD&#xD;
      and beginning or duration of breastfeeding (6). Further, Hatton et al (2005) found that&#xD;
      although women with more depressive symptoms were less likely to breastfeed at 6 weeks&#xD;
      postpartum than their counterparts without symptoms, this difference could not be found at 12&#xD;
      weeks postpartum (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here at OSU, Dr. Sarah McCoy published two studies on breastfeeding and PPD in 2006 and 2008,&#xD;
      both of which were retrospective reviews of records (8, 9). The first one was a more&#xD;
      selective and smaller sample than the second, because at the time the data were collected,&#xD;
      PPD screening had not quite become universal. In that first study of 209 subjects, a&#xD;
      significant relationship was found between breastfeeding and scores above 12 on the Edinburgh&#xD;
      Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), which indicated PPD (8). However, the second&#xD;
      similarly-designed study of 588 subjects, which was a more representative sample of the&#xD;
      clinic population, failed to confirm those results (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, little if any studies have been published that deal directly with the topic of&#xD;
      prenatal depression and its relationship to whether a woman chooses to breastfeed after&#xD;
      giving birth. However, McCarter-Spaulding and Horowitz (2007) recently recommended prenatal&#xD;
      screening for PPD in anticipation of potential roadblocks to breastfeeding (10). If it could&#xD;
      be shown that women with prenatal depressive symptoms are less likely to choose&#xD;
      breastfeeding, perhaps early intervention could increase the number of infants that are&#xD;
      breastfed, which is an important public-health goal (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose The purpose of this prospective cohort study is to search for a relationship between&#xD;
      maternal depression in the third trimester, as indicated by a score of &gt; 12 on the EPDS, and&#xD;
      a choice not to breastfeed at all, defined as no breastfeeding after dismissal from the&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The investigators plan to collect data from women that are receiving prenatal care at&#xD;
      the OSU Houston Parke clinic. Upon obtaining informed consent at a prenatal appointment&#xD;
      between 34 weeks + 0 days gestation and 37 weeks + 6 days, (should consent be deemed&#xD;
      necessary), the investigators will ask the subjects to fill out the same EPDS screen that OSU&#xD;
      obstetrics patients already typically fill out at the four-week postpartum appointment.&#xD;
      Filling out that scale at a prenatal appointment is the only activity that the test subjects&#xD;
      will be asked to do that is not already a standard part of their obstetrics' treatment. In&#xD;
      addition, the investigators will note these women's EPDS score at the four-week postpartum&#xD;
      visit and whether or not they choose to breastfeed, as well as the other information listed&#xD;
      under &quot;Data Collection&quot;, most of which are already routinely recorded in the chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early Termination Criteria Patient will also be terminated if they do not follow up at their&#xD;
      postpartum visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs and Dosages No drugs are used in this project. Devices The only device used in this&#xD;
      study is the EPDS. Surgical Procedures This study does not include any surgical procedures.&#xD;
      Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information recorded for the study will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Gestational age at prenatal EPDS screen&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prenatal EPDS score&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Use of any antidepressants at the time of the prenatal screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Use of any antidepressants after the prenatal screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Age of patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Whether infant was stillborn yes/no&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Whether infant had birth defects yes/no&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Whether infant had illness that prevented breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Whether infant breastfed at all after leaving the hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Whether infant was still breastfeeding at the four-week postnatal appointment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality Data will be de-identified after the four-week postpartum visit by conversion&#xD;
      to numbers. It will be recorded on an Excel spreadsheet.&#xD;
