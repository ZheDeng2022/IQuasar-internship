  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is intended to test the idea, based upon current knowledge of the biology&#xD;
      and physiology of corneal ulceration in SJS/TENS patients who receive a keratoprosthesis, and&#xD;
      on the known effects of infliximab on matrix metalloproteinases, that infliximab therapy for&#xD;
      such patients may reduce the likelihood of corneal ulceration, and hence extend the period of&#xD;
      prosthesis retention and vision recovery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The closely related disorders, Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis&#xD;
      Syndrome (TENS), represent rare but severe hypersensitivity responses to a systemic&#xD;
      medication, and cause severe sloughing of the skin and mucous membranes. Approximately half&#xD;
      of affected patients experience ocular involvement, which can lead to corneal opacity and&#xD;
      vascularization, and in some patients, blindness. Corneal transplantation (corneal allograft)&#xD;
      is typically unsuccessful in SJS/TENS, because of chronic inflammation at the ocular surface,&#xD;
      leading to corneal neovascularization and opacity, tissue melt, ulceration, and perforation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Boston keratoprosthesis, an artificial cornea developed at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear&#xD;
      Infirmary (MEEI) over the last 40 years, is an FDA approved device for patients with corneal&#xD;
      blindness not amenable to corneal transplantation, and has restored the sight of thousands of&#xD;
      such patients, but in SJS/TENS patients remains associated with tissue melts (tissue&#xD;
      ulceration), perforation, and ultimately in some, loss of the eye. K-Pro surgery is currently&#xD;
      the best option for patients with SJS or TENS and corneal blindness, but these patients also&#xD;
      have the worst prognosis after surgery. While the outcomes of these surgeries for patients&#xD;
      with SJS or TENS have improved dramatically in the past ten years, they are still&#xD;
      unsatisfactory. Remicade® has been used in a small group of patients with SJS or TENS&#xD;
      undergoing K-Pro surgery, with one remarkable success. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      explore this treatment more fully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a case report detailing the use of infliximab in one patient, see the following article:&#xD;
      Dohlman JG, Foster CS, Dohlman CH. &quot;Boston Keratoprosthesis in Stevens-Johnson Syndrome: A&#xD;
      case of using infliximab to prevent tissue necrosis.&quot; Digital Journal of Ophthalmology. 2009,&#xD;
      Volume 15, Number 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently developed biologics have dramatically improved functional outcomes and quality of&#xD;
      life in patients with autoimmune diseases. One such agent, infliximab, acts by blocking TNF&#xD;
      alpha, a protein associated with tissue melting in the cornea, and is increasingly being used&#xD;
      for autoimmune eye conditions, in addition to its FDA approved indication for recalcitrant&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will determine the feasibility of combining infliximab with&#xD;
      keratoprosthesis surgery, and will closely monitor patients for episodes of corneal melting:&#xD;
      the primary outcome of the study.&#xD;
