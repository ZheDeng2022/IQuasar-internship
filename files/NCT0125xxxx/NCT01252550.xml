      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a wide variety of symptoms in IBS, irritable bowel syndrome, both among individuals&#xD;
      and in the symptoms of a specific individual. Pathophysiological factors that are of&#xD;
      importance have been identified in IBS, but all of the factors do not occur in the&#xD;
      symptomatology of all patients. Visceral hypersensitivity, deviant motor and secretion&#xD;
      function in the gastrointestinal tract as well as psychological factors are believed to be of&#xD;
      importance. However the relative importance of specific factors in the symptomatology is not&#xD;
      elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deviations in the autonomic and central nerve function have also been demonstrated in IBS,&#xD;
      along with low grad inflammation, immunological anomalies, and changes in the microbiological&#xD;
      gut flora. The importance of these factors in developing the more established&#xD;
      pathophysiological factors, visceral hypersensitivity, and deviated gastrointestinal motor&#xD;
      and secretion functions have not yet been studied. Neither have the interactions between the&#xD;
      autonomic and central nerve functions or the significance of these functions in IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response to the recent findings, regarding deviant microbiological gut flora in IBS, the&#xD;
      use of probiotics as treatment has been tested, with altering outcome. The effects of some&#xD;
      products are positive, but far from all the patients with IBS get sufficient relief. The&#xD;
      response of treatment with probiotics cannot be predicted with the methods available today;&#xD;
      in example it is not possible to predict which patient will respond to the treatment and what&#xD;
      the mechanisms behind the symptom relief are.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What affects the symptomatology in IBS?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visceral hypersensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Deviant colonic motor function&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Autonomic nerve dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Central nerve dysfunction (especially in the level of the brain stem)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Psychological factors&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Coping&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Demography (sex, age)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Immunological deviations in peripheral blood/intestine&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Deviations in the composition of the microbiological gut flora&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sexual/physical abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What are the interactions between pathophysiological deviations in IBS?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can the treatment response of probiotics be predicted?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Why do probiotics give relief to some of the patients with IBS?&#xD;
&#xD;
      INVESTIGATION&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A structured investigational model, covering the most important pathophysiological&#xD;
           factors in IBS and clarifying the symptomatology of the patients in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A randomized, double blinded placebo controlled study, evaluating the effects of&#xD;
           probiotics (Bifidobacterium lactis) on the symptomatology in IBS as well as measuring&#xD;
           the effect probiotics have on the fermentation in the intestines, immunological&#xD;
           variables and the composition of the microbiological gut flora.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients are thoroughly informed regarding the context of the study and a written&#xD;
           consent is signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples are taken to rule out any organic disease (Hb, LPK, TPK, Na, K, Crea,&#xD;
           Liver status, CRP, Transglutaminase antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Validated questionnaires are completed&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  IBS Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS) - gastrointestinal and extra intestinal&#xD;
                symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale - IBS (GSRS-IBS) - IBS specific GI-symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) - general anxiety and depression&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visceral Sensitivity Index (VSI) - GI-specific anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) - severity of somatisation, depression,&#xD;
                anxiety (panic anxiety, eating disorders and alcohol problems)&#xD;
&#xD;

                quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS) - impact of fatigue on quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Abuse Questionnaire - physical and sexual abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sense of Coherence Index - sense of coherence, coping&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ABR (Auditory Brain stem Response audiometry) - brain stem audiometry measuring the&#xD;
           electric activity in level of the brain stem while listening to different audio stimuli&#xD;
           (listening to sounds of clicks through headphones). Through this test the function of&#xD;
           the brain stem can be measured, its ability to mask the effect of disturbing noises etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Holter-ECG (24 h) - spectrum analysis to evaluate the autonomic nerve function; the&#xD;
           balance between parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Permeability test of the intestine - the patient drinks a liquid solution of water and&#xD;
           sugars (50.0 g sucrose, 5.0 g mannitol, 10.0 g lactulose and 1.0 g sucralose in 200 ml&#xD;
           tap water), thereafter urine is collected during the following 9 h. The amount of sugars&#xD;
           found in the urine is a measurement of the permeability in the intestines. The urine&#xD;
           will be collected in separate containers depending on what time of the day it is, and&#xD;
           depending on the time the permeability in the small intestine respectively in the large&#xD;
           intestine can be measured separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Registration of stool consistency and frequency over the following 2-3 weeks, until&#xD;
           visit 3, using the &quot;Bristol Stool Form Scale&quot; (BSF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Food journal are handed out - food intake over three consecutive days will be registered&#xD;
           by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Handing in urine - the last of the urine collected on visit 1 is being handed in by the&#xD;
           patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Returning EKG-material - the Holter, recording EKG, is returned by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Salivary sample - test to measure the levels of cortisol, an important stress marker.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oro-anal transit time - 60 markers that can be seen through x-ray examination are being&#xD;
           swallowed prior to the visit (10 markers/day during 6 days) and in the examination it is&#xD;
           possible to see how many of the markers remain in the GI-tract and where in the tract&#xD;
           they are positioned. This is a way to measure the oro-anal transit time, which mainly is&#xD;
           determined by the colonic transit time. Thereby this is an indirect measurement of the&#xD;
           motor function in colon. Regional transit in different colonic parts can be assessed by&#xD;
           evaluating where in the colon the markers are.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rectal sensitivity testing - a balloon is placed in the rectum and is through a tube&#xD;
           attached to a so called barostat. By using the barostat it is possible to inflate and&#xD;
           deflate the balloon in a controlled matter and also to measure compression and volume in&#xD;
           the balloon. The compression and volume is being increased in a predetermined way and&#xD;
           the patient is asked to state how it feels by using VAS-scales; symptoms noted and the&#xD;
           intensity of these symptoms. The sensitivity in the rectum (large intestine) can be&#xD;
           described by valuing the levels of compression and volume that give rise to the&#xD;
           symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 4&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sigmoidoscopy with biopsies. Macroscopic evaluation of the mucosa of the large&#xD;
           intestine, to rule out inflammatory bowel disease as a cause of the patients symptoms.&#xD;
           Biopsies from the rectum and sigmoid are collected to be analyzed in regards of&#xD;
           inflammatory cell populations and interleukins in the colonic mucosa, as well as amount&#xD;
           of bacteria in the mucosa. Molecular techniques will be used, such as 16sRNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stool sample - analysis of immunological and inflammatory markers in the faeces and of&#xD;
           the composition of the microbiological bacterial flora, this reflects the luminal&#xD;
           bacterial flora (16sRNA technique will be used).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples - various immunological analysis, for example different pro- and&#xD;
           anti-inflammatory interleukins and different food related antibodies (IgE, IgG), are&#xD;
           done to evaluate toe immunological activity and propensity to react in an unfavorable&#xD;
           way when for instance consuming certain food items.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptom protocol (IBS-SSS) and journal of stool consistency and frequency (Bristol Stool&#xD;
           Form Scale (BSF)) are handed out. Symptoms and stools will be registered during 1-3&#xD;
           weeks and will be used as basal values prior to the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 5&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lactulose challenge test - evaluation of symptoms and excretion of hydrogen and methane&#xD;
           gas in the exhaled air after intake of a liquid meal (400ml Nutridrink®, 1.5 kcal/ml)&#xD;
           containing 25 mg lactulose. Hydrogen and methane gas in the exhaled air is a measurement&#xD;
           of the degree of fermentation in the intestines, and indirectly can a bacterial&#xD;
           overgrowth in the small intestine be detected. This &quot;challenge&quot; test is more of a&#xD;
           physiological test to study the sensitivity of the GI-tract. The symptoms and excretion&#xD;
           of gas will be registered during 4 h.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stool sample - analysis of immunological and inflammatory markers in the faeces and of&#xD;
           the composition of the microbiological bacterial flora, this reflects the luminal&#xD;
           bacterial flora (16sRNA technique will be used).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Salivary sample - test to measure the levels of cortisol, an important stress marker.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization of the patients as they are included in the treatment part of the study.&#xD;
           The patients will during 14 days have a daily intake of a yoghurt containing probiotics&#xD;
           (Bifidobacterium lactis, Activia®) or a yoghurt without probiotics (placebo), 125 g 2&#xD;
           times a day (morning and evening). During the treatment part the patients register&#xD;
           symptoms (Symptom protocol (IBS-SSS)) and stool consistency and frequency (Bristol Stool&#xD;
           Form Scale (BSF)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit takes place on the last day of the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lactulose challenge test is being repeated to evaluate potential differences in symptoms&#xD;
           and excretion of hydrogen and methane gas in the exhaled air after intake of a liquid&#xD;
           meal (400ml Nutridrink®, 1.5 kcal/ml) containing 25 mg lactulose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stool sample - analysis of immunological and inflammatory markers in the faeces and of&#xD;
           the composition of the microbiological bacterial flora, this reflects the luminal&#xD;
           bacterial flora (16sRNA technique will be used).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples - various immunological analysis, for example different pro- and&#xD;
           anti-inflammatory interleukins and different food related antibodies (IgE, IgG), are&#xD;
           done to evaluate toe immunological activity and propensity to react in an unfavorable&#xD;
           way when for instance consuming certain food items. Will be compared with previous blood&#xD;
           samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 7&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Summarizing visit - visit at a doctor specialized in functional GI-disorders. The results&#xD;
      from the tests and analysis of the previous visits are being evaluated and any potential&#xD;
      treatment is based on these results. The patients are offered a telephone based follow-up if&#xD;
      they want to, otherwise they are recommitted to the primary health care.&#xD;
