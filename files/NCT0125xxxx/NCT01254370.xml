      The purpose of this study is to compare:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the effect of Catioprost® and Travatan Z® on the ocular surface disease (OSD) in&#xD;
           subjects with glaucoma or ocular hypertension and ocular surface disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering effect and safety of Catioprost® and Travatan Z®&#xD;
           in subjects with glaucoma or ocular hypertension and ocular surface disease.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be at least 18 years of age at Visit 1 (IOP Screening), of either sex and any race or&#xD;
             ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to any study procedures&#xD;
             being performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing and able to follow all instructions and attend all study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a documented diagnosis of ocular hypertension, open angle glaucoma (with or&#xD;
             without pseudoexfoliation or pigment dispersion component) or chronic angle closure&#xD;
             glaucoma with a patent iridotomy requiring treatment with an ocular hypertensive&#xD;
             therapy in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to submit to a pregnancy test at Visit 1 and at Visit 4, or not be of&#xD;
             childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to use an acceptable method of contraception for the duration of the study or&#xD;
             not be of childbearing potential. Acceptable methods of birth control include:&#xD;
             spermicide with barrier, oral, transdermal, injectable, or implantable contraception,&#xD;
             IUD, abstinence, and surgical sterilization of partner. Female subjects are not of&#xD;
             childbearing potential if they have had a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy,&#xD;
             bilateral tubal ligation, or are post-menopausal by at least 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have known sensitivity or poor tolerance to latanoprost or travoprost or any other&#xD;
             component of the study medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any form of glaucoma other than open angle glaucoma (with or without a pigment&#xD;
             dispersion or pseudoexfoliation component), ocular hypertension or chronic angle&#xD;
             closure glaucoma with patent iridotomy in either eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an IOP at any time point during the Screening or Baseline visits (Visits 1 or 2)&#xD;
             of &gt; 34 mmHg in either eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be currently pregnant, nursing, or planning a pregnancy during the study period; or be&#xD;
             a woman that has a positive pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a history of any significant ocular condition(s) in either eye that would&#xD;
             contraindicate the use of latanoprost or travoprost, or that might affect the study&#xD;
             conduct or the interpretation of the study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any abnormality preventing reliable Goldmann applanation tonometry of either eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been previously non-responsive to prostaglandin analog therapy for reduction of&#xD;
             IOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have prior (within 30 days of Visit 1) or anticipated concurrent use of an&#xD;
             investigational drug or device during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a condition or a situation, which in the Investigator's opinion, may put the&#xD;
             subject at increased risk, confound study data, or interfere significantly with the&#xD;
             subject's study participation.&#xD;
