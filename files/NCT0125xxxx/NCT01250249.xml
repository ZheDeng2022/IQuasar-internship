      To compare Safety and Reactogenecity of BCG vaccine of Green Signal Biopharma Private Limited&#xD;
      India with BCG vaccine of serum institute of India limited (SIIL), India in 120 healthy&#xD;
      children.&#xD;

      The study was conducted in the objective to compare the safety and reactogenecity of BCG&#xD;
      Vaccine of Green Signal Bio pharma Private Limited India(Test) with BCG vaccine of Serum&#xD;
      Institute of India(Reference) in 120 healthy children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above study was conducted in multi centers(2 centers - Chennai &amp; Bangalore). The study&#xD;
      was conducted as per the protocol approved by DCGI and Madras ethical Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single dose was administedred to all the subjects and it was inferred that all the 120&#xD;
      subjects vaccinated were safe. Further, the reactogenecity was confirmed after 90th day by&#xD;
      PPD administration to all the subjects. Based on the above observations it was well&#xD;
      identified that test vaccine can be safely administered to children and it is well tolerated&#xD;
      and accepted by the subjects. More over statistically it is inferred that there is no&#xD;
      significant variation between the test and reference vaccine.&#xD;
