    <textblock>
      In this study, 80 coronary artery disease patients with successful coronary revascularisation&#xD;
      (by CABG or PCI) will be included. Patients are excluded in case of: congestive heart&#xD;
      failure, ICD or pacemaker, any disability limiting exercise participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients are attending phase 2-3 cardiac rehabilitation, and have completed 6 weeks of&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Next, subjects are randomly assigned to a control group or an intervention&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome parameters: physical activity, exercise capacity, blood glucose, insulin level and&#xD;
      lipid profile, body weight and waist circumference, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: telemonitoring of physical activity will increase physical activity, and improve&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease risk factors, in CAD patients attending phase 2-3 cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;

      We included patients that suffered from an acute coronary syndrome for which a percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients had access to a computer with internet connection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that (i) were more than 80 years old, (ii) had an implantable cardioverter&#xD;
      defibrillator or pacemaker, (iii) suffered from severe arrhythmias, or (iv) had persistent&#xD;
      exertional ischaemia after revascularization therapy, were not invited to participate in this&#xD;
      study. Patients with severe heart failure (NYHA class III and IV), or neurological or&#xD;
      orthopaedic disability limiting their capability to exercise, were also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was a prospective randomized controlled trial, including an 18-week intervention.&#xD;
      All patients were included after week six of their conventional phase II cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation (CR). During phase II of conventional CR, all patients (those in the&#xD;
      intervention and control group) were educated about the core components of CR including&#xD;
      healthy nutrition, risk factor management (lipids, hypertension, weight, diabetes, and&#xD;
      smoking), psychosocial management and physical activity counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first six weeks of the intervention, patients in the intervention group continued&#xD;
      exercising in the hospital's rehabilitation centre using an outpatient service, in&#xD;
      combination with an exercise training program with telemonitoring support. Patients in the&#xD;
      control group continued exercising in the hospital's rehabilitation centre using an&#xD;
      out-patient service, without participating in the exercise training program with&#xD;
      telemonitoring support. Starting from the seventh week in the study period, patients in the&#xD;
      intervention group finished their phase II CR in the hospital's rehabilitation centre but&#xD;
      continued their exercise training program with telemonitoring support; patients in the&#xD;
      control group finished their phase II CR in the hospital's rehabilitation centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients underwent a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) and a clinical&#xD;
      examination (with determination of waist circumference, blood pressure, body mass index)&#xD;
      after randomization, and also during the sixth and 18th week of the Telerehab II study&#xD;
      period. A fasting blood sampling was taken from all patients during the first and 18th week&#xD;
      of the Telerehab II study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis was that telemonitoring of physical activity will increase physical activity,&#xD;
      and improve cardiovascular disease risk factors, in CAD patients attending phase 2-3 cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;
