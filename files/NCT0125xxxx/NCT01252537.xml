    <textblock>
      Background: Tuberculosis (TB) and HIV are leading causes of disease and death in Subsaharan&#xD;
      Africa. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) dramatically improves prognosis in HIV infection, but TB&#xD;
      is still a common complication in HIV-infected subjects. Management of TB-HIV co-infection is&#xD;
      complex, both with regard to diagnosis and treatment. Since scaling-up of ART requires&#xD;
      management of most patients in primary health care, it is critical to achieve better&#xD;
      strategies for TB-HIV co-infection at peripheral levels of the health care system in endemic&#xD;
      regions. This includes development of new methods to assess the severity of HIV disease and&#xD;
      the need to start ART during TB treatment in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To compare a scoring system for clinical signs of immunosuppression with CD4 cell&#xD;
      counts to assess HIV disease severity and indications for ART initiation, and to correlate&#xD;
      immunosuppression status with treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Workplan: CD4 cell levels and results of clinical scoring has been compared in 1100 patients&#xD;
      with TB, using HIV-negative subjects with TB treatment for control. Inclusion was closed in&#xD;
      February 2012, and follow-up of participants completed in August 2012. Plasma levels of&#xD;
      immune activation and inflammatory markers will be correlated with the degree of&#xD;
      immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: TB is the most significant clinical challenge to the successful scaling-up of&#xD;
      ART in Africa. In order to improve management in primary health care it is necessary to find&#xD;
      robust and reliable techniques for determining disease severity and identification of&#xD;
      patients who need to start ART during TB treatment. This study may contribute to increased&#xD;
      knowledge in this field and help to modify guidelines for management of TB-HIV co-infection&#xD;
      in Ethiopia as well as in other resource-limited settings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) remains as the leading opportunistic infection and cause of death among&#xD;
      HIV-infected subjects in resource-limited settings (1). The management of TB-HIV co-infection&#xD;
      constitutes a great challenge for health care systems. Often, HIV infection is first detected&#xD;
      when patients are diagnosed with active TB, and many such patients have advanced&#xD;
      immunosuppression (2, 3). However, TB can also occur in individuals with relatively well&#xD;
      preserved CD4 cell counts, especially in areas with high TB endemicity (4). In settings where&#xD;
      both TB and HIV infection are common, a high proportion of patients are in need both of&#xD;
      anti-TB treatment (ATT) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) at diagnosis. Combined ART and ATT&#xD;
      is associated with risks of drug-drug interactions, overlapping side effects, immune&#xD;
      reconstitution disease and poor adherence, but at least in patients with severe&#xD;
      immunodeficiency, these risks are outweighed by decreased mortality (5-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the optimal timing for when to start ART in patients receiving ATT is not completely&#xD;
      understood, CD4 cell count thresholds are currently often used to guide clinicians on when to&#xD;
      start ART in co-infected patients (8). Briefly, initiation of ART during ATT is indicated for&#xD;
      patients with CD4 counts lower than 350 cells/mm3, whereas it is usually recommended to defer&#xD;
      ART for patients without other clinical signs of immunodeficiency and CD4 cell counts higher&#xD;
      than 350 cells/mm3. In a recently published WHO document, initiation of ART is proposed for&#xD;
      all patients with active TB, but timing of ART remains uncertain, as well as the need for ART&#xD;
      in subjects with CD4 cell counts exceeding 350 cells/mm3 (9). Studies aiming at defining&#xD;
      optimal time points for ART initiation in patients receiving ATT are ongoing, and might lead&#xD;
      to revised recommendations with regard to co-administration of these therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of HIV-infected subjects initiating ART has increased impressively over recent&#xD;
      years, especially in Subsaharan Africa. Still, it is estimated that less than half of all&#xD;
      patients in need of ART currently receive such treatment (10). In order to improve access, it&#xD;
      is necessary to decentralize treatment and integrate ART into the primary health care system.&#xD;
      In such settings, CD4 cell count analysis is rarely available, and patients are usually&#xD;
      managed by health care workers with limited knowledge and experience of HIV-TB co-infection.&#xD;
      Finding simple alternative tools to identify immunosuppressed patients in these circumstances&#xD;
      could therefore lead to significant improvements in care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a structured scoring system based on clinical symptoms and&#xD;
      signs could be used to assess the degree of immunosuppression in HIV-infected patients with&#xD;
      TB, and thus help to categorize patients to determine when ART should be initiated in&#xD;
      settings with limited access to laboratory resources. The principal aim of the project is to&#xD;
      investigate how clinical scoring correlates with CD4 cell levels and specific CD4 cell&#xD;
      cut-off points that are used to identify patients who fulfil criteria for starting ART during&#xD;
      ATT (specifically for thresholds of 200, 350 and 500 cells/mm3), and to compare these results&#xD;
      with scoring in TB patients without HIV co-infection. The study will also evaluate whether&#xD;
      scoring results can predict short term mortality and treatment outcome. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to investigate a panel of alternative immunological surrogate markers that&#xD;
      could be used to measure HIV-related immunosuppression in patients co-infected with TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work plan Methods: Patients diagnosed with active tuberculosis in health care facilities in&#xD;
      the Oromia region, Ethiopia are eligible for inclusion. The study has been performed in the&#xD;
      district hospital of Bishofto and in 4 health centres providing integrated care for TB and&#xD;
      HIV (Adama, Welenchity, Mojo and Dukam health centres). Approximately 1 112 patients have&#xD;
      been included. In these regions, approximately 40% of patients newly diagnosed with TB are&#xD;
      HIV seropositive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are: age over 18 years, written informed consent to participate, consent&#xD;
      to HIV testing, residence in the catchment area of the study site, no previous treatment with&#xD;
      ART (except for treatment for prevention of mother-to-child transmission), and diagnosis of&#xD;
      active TB (either pulmonary or extrapulmonary according to current national Ethiopian&#xD;
      guidelines based on WHO definitions). Patients having received ATT within the preceding 6&#xD;
      months and those who have received ATT for more than two weeks for their current episode of&#xD;
      TB have not been included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scoring system contains 15 items, including reported symptoms (history of dysphagia,&#xD;
      fever or diarrhoea of &gt;1 month's duration) and clinical findings (anaemia, low body mass&#xD;
      index and mid-upper arm circumference, oral candidiasis, oral hairy leukoplakia, gingivitis,&#xD;
      dermatitis, Kaposi's sarcoma, herpes zoster scar).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scoring has been performed at the time of initiation of ATT (irrespective of HIV status) by&#xD;
      either a trained nurse or a health officer. HIV testing has been done at the same time&#xD;
      according to local routine. Blood for CD4 cell counts and immunological markers have been&#xD;
      obtained from all consenting participants, irrespective of HIV status (in total, 10 ml of&#xD;
      blood). During follow-up, scoring has been repeated by study staff. CD4 cell counts as well&#xD;
      as haemoglobin measurements for validation of clinical evaluation of anaemia in the score has&#xD;
      been determined using local laboratory equipment already in place at the study sites. Plasma&#xD;
      for further analyses of immune activation markers is stored at -80 ° C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicians in charge of the patients determine when ART should be started following existing&#xD;
      national criteria (based on CD4 cell counts and WHO clinical staging). The result of the&#xD;
      scoring under investigation has thus not been used for determining the time point for&#xD;
      starting ART in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up: On initiation of ATT and at HIV diagnosis, patients have been evaluated according&#xD;
      to the clinical score. Treatment outcome according to the WHO (cure, treatment completion,&#xD;
      default, death, treatment failure) will be assessed for all patients. Defaulters will be&#xD;
      traced to ascertain rates of mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients have been longitudinally followed up with repeated clinical scoring and CD4&#xD;
      count after two months of TB treatment and at the end of TB treatment, with recording of&#xD;
      mortality, new AIDS-defining conditions, paradoxical reactions occurring during ATT, and&#xD;
      start of ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Results of the scoring system has been correlated with CD4 cell counts.&#xD;
      Specifically, scoring results are compared with recommended CD4 cell thresholds for when ART&#xD;
      should be started in relation to ATT, in order to investigate whether scoring cut-offs may be&#xD;
      defined to identify patients correctly. Results of scoring in HIV-negative TB patients have&#xD;
      been used to assess how specific total results and different included items are for&#xD;
      HIV-related immunosuppression among co-infected individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, results of the scoring system will be compared to the clinician's decision with&#xD;
      regard to the patient's indication for starting ART or not. All data will be managed under&#xD;
      code for study purposes. Immune activation markers (neopterin and C-reactive protein) have&#xD;
      been analyzed after completion of patient inclusion in reference laboratories in Ethiopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For statistical evaluation, logistic and linear regression analysis of each separate item in&#xD;
      the scoring system will initially be performed to determine its relative importance,&#xD;
      existence of interactions with other variables and to define relevant cut-offs for continuous&#xD;
      variables. Different models of weighing separate scoring items will be evaluated to assess&#xD;
      positive and negative predictive values for the respective outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For comparison of inflammatory markers in the general population living in the geographical&#xD;
      study area, demographic data, CD4 cell counts and plasma samples for storage has been&#xD;
      obtained from 400 healthy adults at Mojo health centre. These persons have been recruited&#xD;
      from a voluntary counselling and testing service, with negative HIV test result and no&#xD;
      clinical signs of active TB. Persons in this comparison group have provided written consent&#xD;
      to participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary results and public health significance 1112 TB patients have been included in&#xD;
      this study (307 co-infected with HIV). Inclusion of new participants was terminated in&#xD;
      February 2012, with continued follow-up until the end of August 2012. Analysis of baseline&#xD;
      data for the primary outcome has been completed and the resulting scoring system has been&#xD;
      published in 2014. Testing of baseline samples for inflammatory markers (neopterin and&#xD;
      C-reactive protein) was completed in November 2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No similar system has been studied. It is of critical importance to improve the management of&#xD;
      patients co-infected with TB and HIV in resource-limited countries, especially in settings&#xD;
      with access to ART. Initiating ART during ATT is challenging under existing conditions in&#xD;
      Subsaharan Africa, where the majority of these patients are diagnosed and treated. If the&#xD;
      clinical scoring system can provide a reasonably reliable substitute for CD4 cell counts to&#xD;
      estimate the degree of immunosuppression in co-infected patients, and can be used to define&#xD;
      cut-off points for optimal time points for initiation of ART, it could become a robust and&#xD;
      simple tool to be used at peripheral levels of health care systems. This would help to&#xD;
      identify and monitor immunosuppressed patients who need to start ART in parallel to ATT, and&#xD;
      could lead to improved treatment outcomes and decreased mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval from the review boards of Lund University, the Oromia Regional Health Bureau&#xD;
      and the National Research Ethics Review Committee of Ethiopia has been received.&#xD;
