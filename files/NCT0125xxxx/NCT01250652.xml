    <textblock>
      Allen Kaplan is a prominent American allergist with the reputation of leader in the field of&#xD;
      chronic urticaria. He advocates treatment with first generation hydroxyzine, which he&#xD;
      considers at least as effective as modern second generation H1-blockers in suppressing the&#xD;
      symptoms of difficult-to-treat / systemic-steroid-dependant cases of chronic urticaria. He&#xD;
      further speculates that hydroxyzine may have the advantage to better suppress itch and&#xD;
      improve nighttime sleep. This has prompted many practitioners around the world to believe&#xD;
      that adding hydroxyzine to the treatment regimen at bed time at night may be beneficial to&#xD;
      patients. At the same time European guidelines indicate modern second generation H1-blockers&#xD;
      in higher than conventional doses as drugs of choice for such cases. However, there is no&#xD;
      evidence from clinical trials addressing this controversy. The investigators' previous&#xD;
      studies suggest that levocetirizine at quadruple doses may be beneficial in difficult to&#xD;
      treat urticaria by reducing lesions and itch, improving quality of life and night time sleep,&#xD;
      while not causing day time somnolence. First generation H1-receptor antagonists and&#xD;
      hydroxyzine among them are known to penetrate the blood / brain barrier and to cause&#xD;
      sedation. The question stays whether this sedation is beneficial to the subjects with chronic&#xD;
      urticaria at night, whether it has any hang-over unwanted effects the following day and&#xD;
      whether this has any influence on the overall urticaria-specific quality of life.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve two distinct parts (flow chart):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In-hospital assessment of effectiveness and tolerability of 10 &amp; 20 mg levocetirizine&#xD;
           vs. 100 &amp; 200 mg hydroxyzine in subjects to be weaned off corticosteroid treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subsequent ambulatory treatment of the same patients with 20 mg levocetirizine alone and&#xD;
           15 mg levocetirizine + 50 hydroxyzine at night&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol description Patients with chronic urticaria treated with systemic steroids are&#xD;
      traditionally admitted to the Clinic of Allergy and Asthma in Sofia to try to wean them off&#xD;
      this class of drugs. Hospitalized patients will be invited to take part in the study and will&#xD;
      sign an informed consent. They will be assessed by standard questionnaire and by objective&#xD;
      assessment of the urticarial lesions, QoLQ will be filled in, discomfort due to urticaria,&#xD;
      day time somnolence and night time sleep quality will be assessed on a visual analogue scale.&#xD;
      Systemic steroids will be withheld and patients would be given 10 mg levocetirizine on Days 1&#xD;
      &amp; 2; after a new assessment of quality of night time sleep and day time somnolence, 100 mg&#xD;
      hydroxyzine will be given on Days 3 &amp; 4. The cycle will be repeated on Days 5 &amp; 6 and Days 7&#xD;
      &amp; 8 with 20 mg levocetirizine and 200 hydroxyzine respectively. At this point patients will&#xD;
      be discharged and randomized to two treatment arms: levocetirizine 20 mg per day and&#xD;
      levocetirizine 15 mg + hydroxyzine 50 mg as evening dose for 5 days. Diaries will be given to&#xD;
      patients for assessment of daily SS, day time somnolence score, quality of night time sleep,&#xD;
      facial tissue swelling, rescue medication with oral prednisolone, adverse events, intake of&#xD;
      any other medications. After 5 days the patients from arm 1 and 2 will be crossed over to the&#xD;
      alternative treatment. QoLQ questionnaire will be filled out at onset, at cross over (day 5)&#xD;
      and at the end of the 10 day treatment period. On completion of the study subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to state there preference for one treatment or the other.&#xD;
