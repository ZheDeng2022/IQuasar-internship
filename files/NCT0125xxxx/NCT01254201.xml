    <textblock>
      Dry eyes are a very common complaint. In some patients, we can identify the reason for the&#xD;
      dryness; however, in others the dryness has no clear cause. Dryness can lead to eye&#xD;
      irritation, redness, and sometimes changes in vision. Fibromyalgia is a condition of chronic&#xD;
      pain that is poorly understood but seems to have a component of altered sensory processing.&#xD;
      People with fibromyalgia tend to complain of dry and irritated eyes at a higher rate than the&#xD;
      general population. We plan to evaluate patients with dry eye symptoms for abnormalities in&#xD;
      sensory processing and in their autonomic nervous system. We hope to learn about possible&#xD;
      relationships between dry eye symptoms and fibromyalgia in order to better understand and&#xD;
      treat these conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye and fibromyalgia syndromes are most prevalent in women. Therefore, female patients&#xD;
      seen in Kellogg Eye Center for ocular complaints of dryness, grittiness, irritation, or&#xD;
      related symptoms, without any identifiable cause, will be offered enrollment into the study.&#xD;
      These individuals will be compared to both a &quot;positive control&quot; group (fibromyalgia patients)&#xD;
      and a healthy control group. We hypothesize that the patients seen with irritative symptoms&#xD;
      will have autonomic and sensory processing profiles similar to fibromyalgia patients, and&#xD;
      both groups will differ from healthy controls. All study participants will have an extensive&#xD;
      ophthalmological exam in addition to autonomic and sensory testing, in order to more fully&#xD;
      characterize the underlying mechanism(s) of these symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Female patients over the age of 18 with the above mentioned complaints will be told of the&#xD;
      study at the time of their visit. They will be given a copy of the study consent form to take&#xD;
      home with them or one will be mailed to them. Additionally, from CareWeb billing records, or&#xD;
      from other University of Michigan Ophthalmologists, a list of patients who have previously&#xD;
      been seen (within the last year) in the Ophthalmology Comprehensive Clinic for dry eyes&#xD;
      complaints will be identified and contacted by US mail with a recruitment letter uploaded. If&#xD;
      the patient is interested, the letter will list research staff contact information, who&#xD;
      patients may then contact. If the patient does not contact research staff by phone or email,&#xD;
      research staff may follow-up the letter by phone no earlier than one week after it is mailed.&#xD;
      If patients are not interested, a phone number will be listed allowing patients to opt-out of&#xD;
      being contacted about the study by phone in the future. Follow-up phone calls will utilize a&#xD;
      phone script.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are interested in participating will be contacted by the study coordinator for&#xD;
      further discussion to see if they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria and to schedule a&#xD;
      visit to the Cornea Clinic for an ophthalmic evaluation. At the time of this visit, patients&#xD;
      will be asked to sign the consent form and be given a study identification number that will&#xD;
      be used exclusively in patient identification in study materials. These patients will then be&#xD;
      scheduled to be seen at the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center at Dominos Farms for the&#xD;
      remaining sensory and autonomic testing. All patient study information will be collected and&#xD;
      encoded according to HIPAA guidelines and institutional review board approval. The plan is to&#xD;
      enroll 50 patients into Group 1 over a 12 month enrollment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study group will be compared to two groups of age matched patients, 25 with known FM&#xD;
      (Group 2) and 25 healthy controls (Group 3). These patients will be identified by searching&#xD;
      the patient registry that includes more than 400 FM and healthy control patients who have&#xD;
      already undergone the standardized sensory and autonomic evaluations at the Chronic Pain and&#xD;
      Fatigue Research Center. The study coordinator will then contact the individuals that are&#xD;
      identified in the registry that meet these criteria, and they will be asked if they are&#xD;
      interested in enrolling in this particular study (all individuals in the registry have given&#xD;
      consent to be contacted for additional studies for which they are eligible). FM patients and&#xD;
      controls who agree to participate will be asked to sign the consent form and be scheduled for&#xD;
      the ophthalmic evaluation at the Cornea Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ophthalmic Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals in all three groups will be seen in the Cornea Clinic at the Kellogg Eye Center&#xD;
      and will receive a complete ophthalmic evaluation including the following objective measures&#xD;
      of ocular and visual sensation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual acuity will be assessed in each eye separately, using a Snellen acuity chart for&#xD;
           distance and a Jaegar reading card for near vision. Additional notations will be made&#xD;
           for subjective evaluation of patient's level of satisfaction with corrected acuity&#xD;
           during testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shirmer's testing with anesthesia will be performed on all patients. This test involves&#xD;
           the use of small strips of filter paper placed in the lower eyelids after instillation&#xD;
           of anesthetic eyedrops for the assessment of tear production.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Corneal fluorescein and conjunctival lissamine green staining patterns will be assessed&#xD;
           as a measure of ocular surface integrity. Staining will be measured using the Oxford&#xD;
           grading scale from 0 (no staining) to 5 (severe staining)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tear break up time is evaluated while fluorescein stain is still in the eye. The patient&#xD;
           is instructed not to blink and the tear film is observed through the slit lamp. If the&#xD;
           smooth layer tear film begins to visibly break up prior to 10 seconds, the patient's&#xD;
           tear film is considered abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ocular complaints will be quantified with the use of the Ocular Surface Disease Index&#xD;
           Questionnaire - a validated 15 question survey that evaluates dry eye symptoms as well&#xD;
           as the National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire - a validated 25 question&#xD;
           survey that evaluates overall visual function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accommodation, or the ability to shift visual focus from distance to near, will be&#xD;
           measured with the Marco auto-refractor separately for each eye. Accommodation is a&#xD;
           physiologic measure of the eye's ability to shift focus and naturally decreases with&#xD;
           age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Central corneal sensation will be measured using Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometry. The&#xD;
           esthesiometer is an instrument that comprises a slender nylon filament that is retracted&#xD;
           in 0.5 cm increments until the filament is sensed on the cornea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confocal Microscopy - The patients' eyes will be viewed using a high power microscope to&#xD;
           carefully evaluate the corneal nerve layer. This microscope looks at the layers of the&#xD;
           cornea (or window) of the eye. After numbing drops are placed in eye, a gel to lubricate&#xD;
           will also be placed in the eye. The microscope comes into close proximity to the eye.&#xD;
           The patient will feel the microscope against his/her eyelashes while looking at a red&#xD;
           light. Three scans providing a clear view of the sub-epithelial corneal nerve layer will&#xD;
           be performed on each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory and Autonomic Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients seen in the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center at Dominos Farms will be&#xD;
      evaluated by several modalities for measures of altered sensory processing and autonomic&#xD;
      dysfunction:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires of demographic and disease status information will be collected using a&#xD;
           general form that includes age, sex, race, marital status, education level, ethnicity,&#xD;
           chronicity of pain, believed cause of pain, and events associated with the onset of&#xD;
           pain. Participants will also complete a battery of self-report questionnaires that&#xD;
           characterize their functional status, pain and fatigue symptoms, cognitive difficulties,&#xD;
           affective status, pain beliefs, perceived stress, perceived social support, coping&#xD;
           strategies, sleep quality, and history of abuse. The questionnaire battery takes&#xD;
           approximately 1 hour to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pressure pain sensitivity is assessed at the thumbnail using a hydraulic device that&#xD;
           consists of a plastic housing and piston driving a hard rubber 1 cm2 probe. After&#xD;
           positioning the device on the left thumb, subjects will receive an ascending series of&#xD;
           discrete 3 second-duration pressure stimuli beginning at 0.5 kg and increasing in 0.5 kg&#xD;
           steps to a maximum of 10 kg (or subjective maximum less than 10 kg). Subjects will rate&#xD;
           the intensity of the evoked sensations using the sensory intensity Box scale, a combined&#xD;
           analog descriptor scale that superimposes verbal descriptors, spaced according to&#xD;
           ratio-scale values, on a 0-20 graphical numerical category scale.22,23 The pain testing&#xD;
           session lasts about 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tender point assessment: a standard means of confirming the diagnosis of fibromyalgia.&#xD;
           During this assessment, the examiner will use their thumb to apply minimal pressure on&#xD;
           pre-designated body points (such as the base of the neck, or back of the arm) and ask if&#xD;
           the patient is sensitive or 'tender' at these various points. Most individuals do not&#xD;
           describe this assessment as painful.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Auditory sensitivity testing involves a hearing screening performed according to the&#xD;
           American Speech-Language-Hearing Association guidelines.24 This includes a brief case&#xD;
           history, otoscopic inspection, and a 25 dB HL pure-tone screen at 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz&#xD;
           and 35 dB HL at 500 Hz. This testing is to assure that there are no hearing&#xD;
           abnormalities that would cause abnormalities on the research test of interest, the&#xD;
           Judgment of Loudness Discomfort Levels (LDLs). This testing is performed using pure tone&#xD;
           acoustic stimuli at an octave frequency of 2000 Hz and signal range from 40 to 100 dB.&#xD;
           The patient is instructed to indicate a rating of discomfort for each volume at which&#xD;
           the acoustic signal is presented. This test will be performed in both ascending&#xD;
           step-wise and random order patterns, and takes approximately 45 minutes. Each patient&#xD;
           will also complete a hyperacusis questionnaire,25 through which they will indicate their&#xD;
           experiences of real-life auditory sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dysautonomia will be assessed centrally by monitoring variations in heart rate. Heart&#xD;
           rate variability information is obtained by use of a Holter monitor. Individuals will&#xD;
           remain supine for the first 5 minutes of the examination. For the remaining time period&#xD;
           (total: approximately 60 minutes), the Holter monitor will record a continuous&#xD;
           electrocardiogram (ECG) of the heart's electrical activity in response to varying but&#xD;
           standardized study related tasks such as questionnaire completion, discussions with&#xD;
           study personnel, and listening to instructions. Frequency domain analysis using fast&#xD;
           Fourier transformations yields information about the amount of the variance (power) in&#xD;
           the heart's rhythm explained by periodic oscillations of the heart rate at various&#xD;
           bands, including the high, low, and very low frequencies.26 Fluctuations over time in&#xD;
           the interval between normal heartbeats is recorded and quantified by analysis of&#xD;
           variability between beats.&#xD;
