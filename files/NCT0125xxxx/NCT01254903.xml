  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical study is to learn the feasibility of using a single session of&#xD;
      radiation, known as spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SSRS), to treat metastatic epidural&#xD;
      spinal cord compression.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord compression is often treated with surgery followed by radiation in small doses&#xD;
      everyday for a number of days. When a patient cannot or will not have surgery, radiation is&#xD;
      given daily. With increased accuracy and precision, higher doses of radiation can be given in&#xD;
      a single session. Giving a higher dose in a single session may increase the chance that the&#xD;
      tumor will stop growing into the spinal canal and will prevent spinal cord injury. This study&#xD;
      will also help to identify the tolerance of the spinal cord to radiation in a single session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spine Stereotactic Radiosurgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will lie in the mold that was made for you for 45-120 minutes while you receive your&#xD;
      radiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have follow-up visits at Months 3 (+/-2 weeks ), 6 (+/-4 weeks), 9 (+/-4 weeks), 12&#xD;
      (+/-8 weeks), 18 (+/-8 weeks), and 24 (+/-8 weeks) and then every 6 months after that. At&#xD;
      each follow-up visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded, including any use of steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a neurological exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the 3 questionnaires about health, symptoms you may be having, and&#xD;
           about pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an MRI of the spine (except for Month 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are unable to return for follow-up clinic visits, you will be called and asked about&#xD;
      your medical history, and you will complete the 3 questionnaires about your health, symptoms&#xD;
      you may be having, and about pain. This call should take about 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your treatment will last 1 day. You will continue having follow-up visits or phone calls for&#xD;
      as long as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. SSRS is FDA approved. The use of SSRS to treat metastatic&#xD;
      epidural spinal cord compression is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 36 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;

             resonance imaging (MRI) within 4 weeks of registration, defined radiographically,&#xD;
             ranging from minimal canal compromise and thecal indentation to actual displacement of&#xD;
             the spinal cord.&#xD;
