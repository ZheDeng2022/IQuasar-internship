      Classical chemotherapeutic agents include the class of alkylating agents with covalent&#xD;
      modification of biopolymers and in particular, bases of DNA, as proposed mechanism of&#xD;
      cytotoxic action. Bifunctional alkylating agents, which yield inter- or intrastrand&#xD;
      cross-links include nitrogen mustards, mitomycin C and platinum complexes. In contrast,&#xD;
      monofunctional alkylating agents act by reacting with single electron-rich sites in bases of&#xD;
      DNA strands. The most prominent class of the latter group is the triazene, which is based on&#xD;
      nitrogen-rich chemistry. It is generally accepted that triazenes, upon metabolic activation&#xD;
      via N demethylation, yield highly reactive carbocations, which covalently bind to&#xD;
      biopolymers. The novel triazene TriN 2755 differs from other triazenes through its&#xD;
      physicochemical properties such as high hydrophilicity and photostability, and in particular&#xD;
      by its potent, dose dependent antitumor activity in a spectrum of cancers including&#xD;
      dacarbazine-resistant tumors, where treatment options for metastatic disease are still not&#xD;
      satisfactory and medical needs exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, parallel-group, two-center, safety, activity and pharmacokinetic study&#xD;
      of TriN 2755 given at increasing dose levels as intravenous infusions administered over 4&#xD;
      hours. The study is divided into two parts: Part I a dose escalation phase and Part II an&#xD;
      extension phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I of the Study (Dose Escalation Phase):&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first part of the study, two treatment schedules will be investigated in parallel:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment schedule A: The study medication will be infused once every 28 days in a 4-week&#xD;
      cycle (Group A) Treatment schedule B: The study medication will be infused once every 7 days&#xD;
      in a 4-week cycle (Group B)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In treatment schedule A (Group A), the planned starting dose to be investigated is 25 mg TriN&#xD;
      2755 given once followed by a recovery period of 4 weeks. Subsequent patients can only be&#xD;
      included on a new dose level when the safety review from all patients included at the&#xD;
      preceding dose level(s) at Day 28 after infusion (end of Cycle 1) does not indicate relevant&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In treatment schedule B (Group B), the planned starting dose to be investigated is 800mg,&#xD;
      given once every 7 days in a 4 week cycle. Subsequent patients can only be included on a new&#xD;
      dose level when the safety review from all patients included at the preceding dose level(s)&#xD;
      at Day 28 after the start of the first infusion (end of Cycle 1) does not indicate relevant&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma samples to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of TriN 2755 are collected at predefined&#xD;
      schedules after the first administration at each dose level and at pre-dose and at expected&#xD;
      peak times during the subsequent administrations within the first treatment cycle only (Group&#xD;
      B). Urine samples are collected over 24 hours after the first administration at each dose&#xD;
      level within the first treatment cycle only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD is reached, two expanded cohorts of patients are treated with the Maximum&#xD;
      Recommended Dose (MRD) which is one dose level below the MTD or at lower dose levels, if&#xD;
      indicated. This second part of the study (expansion) allows for enrolment of approximately&#xD;
      additional 9 patients per treatment schedule, at the chosen dose, in order to better assess&#xD;
      the safety and possible antitumor activity of TriN 2755. The exact number of patients to be&#xD;
      enrolled in this expanded phase is decided by a Monitoring Board. The patients are treated at&#xD;
      or near the planned phase II dose, without expanding or prolonging the study excessively.&#xD;
