    <textblock>
      You are being asked to take part in this study because you have prostate cancer that has&#xD;
      spread to other parts of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Prednisone is FDA-approved and commercially available.&#xD;
      Abiraterone acetate is FDA-approved and commercially available, but is still being&#xD;
      researched. Sunitinib malate is FDA-approved for the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors and&#xD;
      renal cell carcinoma, and dasatinib is FDA approved and commercially available for certain&#xD;
      types of leukemia. The use of these drugs in prostate cancer and in combination with&#xD;
      abiraterone acetate and prednisone is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 180 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abiraterone acetate is designed to block male hormones in the body that may cause prostate&#xD;
      cancer to grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prednisone is commonly given in combination with other drugs to patients with prostate&#xD;
      cancer. In this study, it is being used in combination with abiraterone acetate in order to&#xD;
      help prevent side effects that abiraterone acetate may cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sunitinib malate is designed to block pathways that control important events such as the&#xD;
      growth of blood vessels that are essential for the growth of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dasatinib is designed to change the function of genes. By changing the function of these&#xD;
      genes, it may prevent cancer from growing and spreading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take 4 tablets of&#xD;
      abiraterone acetate by mouth every day. The tablets should be taken all at once, at least 1&#xD;
      hour before a meal or 2 hours after a meal. You will also take 1 tablet of prednisone by&#xD;
      mouth 2 times each day. You will take both of these drugs throughout the entire study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease gets worse while you are taking abiraterone acetate and prednisone, you will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are assigned to Group 1, you will start taking sunitinib malate. You will take 3&#xD;
           capsules by mouth 1 time each day, while continuing to take abiraterone acetate and&#xD;
           prednisone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are assigned to Group 2, you will start taking dasatinib. You will take 2 tablets&#xD;
           by mouth 1 time each day, while continuing to take abiraterone acetate and prednisone.&#xD;
           Dasatinib tablets should be swallowed whole, with or without a meal. If you accidentally&#xD;
           miss taking a dose of dasatinib, it may be taken within 12 hours later. If you vomit&#xD;
           within 30 minutes of taking the tablets, that dose may be repeated. If you miss a dose&#xD;
           due to side effects, the dose should not be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease gets worse after you have been assigned to a group, and you are still eligible&#xD;
      to continue taking the study drugs, you will &quot;crossover&quot; to the other group. If you were in&#xD;
      Group 1, you would stop taking sunitinib malate and begin taking dasatinib. If you were in&#xD;
      Group 2, you would stop taking dasatinib and begin taking sunitinib malate. No matter which&#xD;
      group you crossover to, you will continue taking abiraterone acetate and prednisone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each study visit, you will be asked about any other drugs you may be receiving and about&#xD;
      any side effects you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 2 weeks during the first 12 weeks of taking abiraterone acetate and prednisone and&#xD;
      during the first 3 cycles (9-12 weeks) of each new treatment combination, blood (about 1-2&#xD;
      tablespoons) will be collected to test your liver function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 4 weeks, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. Part of&#xD;
           this blood will be used to measure your PSA and your levels of a specific marker of&#xD;
           prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked questions about how you are feeling and about any side effects you may&#xD;
           have had since your last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any other drugs you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease gets worse (or you change treatments) at any point in the study, the following&#xD;
      tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy or a tumor tissue biopsy to collect&#xD;
           tumor tissue from places to which the tumor has spread to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG and an echocardiogram or a MUGA scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a chest x-ray, CT scans of your abdomen and pelvis, and a bone scan to&#xD;
           check the status of your disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your doctor thinks it is necessary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Â°You will have a chest x-ray, CT scans of your abdomen and pelvis, and a bone scan to check&#xD;
      the status of your disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best&#xD;
      interest. You will be taken off study if the disease gets worse after crossover, if you&#xD;
      experience intolerable side effects, or if the doctor thinks that it is in your best&#xD;
      interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you stop receiving the study drugs for any reason, the following tests and procedures&#xD;
      will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your PSA&#xD;
           level, your level of a specific marker of prostate cancer, and to check for a protein&#xD;
           related to cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked questions about how you are feeling and about any side effects you may&#xD;
           have had since your last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any other drugs you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy or a tumor tissue biopsy to collect&#xD;
           tumor tissue from places to which the tumor has spread to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Treatment (Safety) Follow-Up Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 30 days after your last dose of study drugs, the following tests and procedures will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including a measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have experienced since your last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any other drugs you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A member of the study staff will check up on you about every 6 months after your&#xD;
      Post-Treatment (Safety) Follow-Up Visit. This will consist of a phone call, an e-mail, or a&#xD;
      review of your medical and/or other records. If you are contacted by phone, the call will&#xD;
      only last a few minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After your End-of-Treatment visit, the study staff will contact you by phone, e-mail, or you&#xD;
      will come in for a clinic visit. You will be asked about how you are feeling and any side&#xD;
      effects you may have had. Each follow-up will take about 5 minutes. Follow-up will take place&#xD;
      every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for the third year, and 1 time a year&#xD;
      after that. The last follow-up will be about 5 years after the last patient is enrolled.&#xD;
