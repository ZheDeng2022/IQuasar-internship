  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Annual incidence of severe traumatic brain injuries (TBI) varies from 180 to 300 out of&#xD;
      100.000. Mortality or severe sequelae risk is increased 8 fold after a TBI. Studies in adults&#xD;
      showed an ante-hypophyseal deficit in 28 to 68 % of patients with a TBI. The most common&#xD;
      deficit is Growth Hormone Deficit (GHD); followed by gonadotropic and corticotropic&#xD;
      (AdrenoCorticoTropic Hormone (ACTH)) insufficiencies. Thyrotropic deficits&#xD;
      (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH)) are less frequent. From a pathophysiological point of&#xD;
      view, the lesional mechanism responsible for hypopituitarisms would be a damage of&#xD;
      hypophyseal vessels or hypothalamic-pituitary vessels. The frequency of pituitary deficits&#xD;
      and the potential beneficial effects of replacement therapy on quality of life, tiredness,&#xD;
      loss of energy and productivity, justify the systematic detection of the deficits in patients&#xD;
      with moderate to severe TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypotheses :&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the present time, the lack of data in children does not give us the opportunity to affirm&#xD;
      that one part of the symptoms showed by children with post-TBI neuropsychological sequelae,&#xD;
      are linked to pituitary deficiency and that they can be improved with a replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, it is essential to better understand the natural history of post-TBI pituitary&#xD;
      deficiencies, studying the connexion between observed deficiencies in acute and late phase of&#xD;
      sequelae.&#xD;
