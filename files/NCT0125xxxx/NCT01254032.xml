  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a major health concern, with a substantial&#xD;
      impact on a patient's life. However, the impact of COPD is currently under-recognised and, as&#xD;
      a result, COPD is under-treated. An exacerbation of COPD is a major element that causes poor&#xD;
      quality of life and loss of productivity. Therefore, minimizing the frequency of&#xD;
      exacerbations is a short term treatment goal in COPD management and could improve Quality of&#xD;
      Life (QoL) significantly in all severity groups of COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the use of spirometry for the determination of disease severity in COPD is supported&#xD;
      by guidelines, a lung function test alone does not provide a measurement of the overall&#xD;
      impact of COPD on health status and is not generally available especially in primary care&#xD;
      centre. Therefore, a standardised and effective dialogue between patients and physicians in a&#xD;
      consultation could address the impact of COPD on a patient's QoL in this situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COPD Assessment Test (CAT), recently launched in 2009, is a short and simple,&#xD;
      self-administered questionnaire designed to assess the condition of patients and overall&#xD;
      impact of COPD, and to improve patient-physician communication. It has been proven that the&#xD;
      CAT has good repeatability and discriminative properties which suggest that it is sensitive&#xD;
      to treatment effects at a group level. The CAT score with its better ability to assess the&#xD;
      impact of COPD on patients, suggests potential to predict a significant change in COPD status&#xD;
      such as acute exacerbations of COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the CAT is designed to assess the impact of COPD on the patient by measuring overall&#xD;
      impairment, it has better correlations with other instruments, such as the Clinical COPD&#xD;
      Questionnaire (CCQ), MRC (Medical Research Council) dyspnoea scale, St George's Respiratory&#xD;
      Questionnaire (SGRQ),and the 6-minute walk test. However, it does not correlate well with&#xD;
      FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the CAT shares some similarities with other questionnaires, there are several important&#xD;
      differences. For example, the SGRQ is substantially longer than the CAT, is complex to&#xD;
      administer and requires the use of a computer for scoring. The CAT is designed to provide a&#xD;
      holistic measure of the impact of COPD on the patient, whereas the MRC dyspnoea scale only&#xD;
      measures dyspnoea, and the CCQ only assesses clinical disease control. Thus, the CAT is the&#xD;
      only validated, short and simple assessment test which can provide a holistic measure of the&#xD;
      impact of COPD on patients, ensuring both the physicians and the patients gain the&#xD;
      understanding needed to manage COPD optimally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QoL is defined as an individual's perception of their position in their life in the context&#xD;
      of the culture and value systems. Therefore, the extent of understanding of the questionnaire&#xD;
      might be influenced by language and ethnicities. Since the validation findings so far have&#xD;
      been based on data from the US and Europe, PACE may provide better quality of data across&#xD;
      ethnic groups given that mainly Asian subjects will participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PACE is designed to evaluate whether the CAT has a high predictive value in detecting&#xD;
      subsequent exacerbations of COPD. If so, this result might enable both patients and&#xD;
      physicians to better target and optimise management. The primary objective is to evaluate the&#xD;
      predictability of the CAT to have subsequent exacerbations in COPD patients. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to evaluate the predictability of the CAT to have moderate to severe&#xD;
      exacerbations or time to the first exacerbation, to identify risk predictors for COPD&#xD;
      exacerbations, and to evaluate correlations between CAT scores and FEV1 values, or MRC&#xD;
      dyspnea scores. An experimental objective is to evaluate the correlation between the CAT&#xD;
      score between 2 consecutive follow-ups (e.g. Week 8 &amp; baseline, Week 16 &amp; Week 8) and a COPD&#xD;
      exacerbation over the following treatment period adjusting for demographics, MRC scores, lung&#xD;
      function parameters, medical history, and therapy history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PACE is a multicentre, prospective, observational study designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      predictability of the CAT score to have COPD exacerbations over 24 weeks. During the study,&#xD;
      subjects continue taking their regular prescribed treatment. Investigators are free to make&#xD;
      medication adjustments where required. Eligible subjects will have a clinic visit every 8&#xD;
      weeks, during which they will complete the CAT questionnaire, the Exacerbation Check List&#xD;
      (ECL), MRC dyspnea scale, and spirometry. A regular phone call is placed every 8 weeks in&#xD;
      between clinic visits to collect data for the ECL.There is no follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      550 male and female outpatient subjects will be recruited for PACE to obtain approximately&#xD;
      300 exacerbation events. This study will capture the winter periods in Australia, China,&#xD;
      Korea and Taiwan, when incidence of exacerbations is at its peak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed on subjects' data to derive the PACE end-points.&#xD;

&#xD;
      550 male and female outpatient subjects will be recruited for PACE to obtain approximately&#xD;
      300 exacerbation events. This study will capture the winter periods in Australia, China,&#xD;
      Korea and Taiwan, when incidence of exacerbations is at its peak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed on subjects' data to derive the PACE end-points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary endpoint, the incidence of COPD exacerbations over 24 weeks according to the&#xD;
      baseline CAT quartiles, an adjusted model using logistic regression taking into account&#xD;
      demographics, lung function test parameters, medical history and therapy history will be&#xD;
      performed. This analysis also allows the risk predictors to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For quartiles of baseline CAT scores, it is expected not to have strict four equal intervals&#xD;
      for the CAT scores since the shape of the distribution curve of the CAT scores was not&#xD;
      linear, but sigmoidal [Jones, 2009]. The HEED data has also shown that the CAT scores were&#xD;
      not distributed evenly. Therefore, subjects will be categorized into quartiles after the&#xD;
      baseline CAT scores are collected to ensure an equal number of subjects in each group. The&#xD;
      quartile 1 will be a reference group. Odds ratios will be calculated for comparing between&#xD;
      group 1 and other groups (group 2, 3, and 4, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above analyses will also be performed for the incidence of moderate to severe COPD&#xD;
      exacerbations over 24 weeks and by the CAT quartiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to the first exacerbation according to the baseline CAT quartiles will be performed&#xD;
      using Cox-regression, adjusting for demographics, lung function test parameters, medical and&#xD;
      therapy history. Hazard ratios will be calculated for comparing between each group (group 2,&#xD;
      3, and 4) and group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the risk predictors for incidence of COPD exacerbations, a GEE (Generalised&#xD;
      Estimating Equations, a repeated measure analysis for categorical outcomes) will be&#xD;
      performed. A sensitivity analysis on the various dichotomized definitions for the number of&#xD;
      COPD exacerbations (at least 1 incident, more than 1 incident, etc) will also be performed&#xD;
      for the ROC (Receiver Operator Characteristics) and GEE analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The correlation between CAT scores with FEV1 and MRC dyspnea scores will be assessed using&#xD;
      Pearson's correlation if normality assumptions are satisfied. Otherwise the non-parametric&#xD;
      Spearman's correlation will be presented.&#xD;
