  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recombinant human fusion protein L19TNFα was created with the intention to overcome the&#xD;
      systemic toxicity of TNFα by directly targeting it to tumor tissues. Tumor-targeted L19TNFα&#xD;
      would result in high and sustained intralesional bioactive TNFα concentrations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this Phase I/II study is to define a safe and potentially active&#xD;
      treatment regimen of L19TNFα as a monotherapy and to evaluate the antitumor activity of this&#xD;
      regimen in relapsed metastatic colorectal cancer subjects, for whom standard treatment&#xD;
      options are exhausted. L19TNFα is an investigational drug that specifically and effectively&#xD;
      binds to ED-B, which is abundantly expressed in cancer tissue. Accordingly, treatment should&#xD;
      result in a high and long-lasting intratumoral accumulation of biologically active rh-TNFα.&#xD;
      Although combined therapies of TNFα with cytotoxic drugs (e.g. melphalan) seem to be&#xD;
      strikingly more active against sarcoma and melanoma than with TNFα alone - at least for the&#xD;
      ILP setting it seems possible that the repeated intratumoral delivery of TNFα via L19TNFα&#xD;
      might produce additional biologic effects, such as the induction of an immunologic antitumor&#xD;
      response or the sustained inhibition of tumor-associated angiogenesis (Lejeune, 2006), that&#xD;
      potentially could benefit advanced cancer subjects.&#xD;
