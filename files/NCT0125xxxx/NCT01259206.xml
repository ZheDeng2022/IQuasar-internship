      Obesity is a risk factor for calcaneal spur (CS) formation which is supposed to originate&#xD;
      from chronic plantar fasciitis. Diabetes mellitus may contribute to the risk of CS by&#xD;
      decreased ability of tissue repair and increased reactive ossification. Thus, the&#xD;
      investigators aimed to determine CS incidence in asymptomatic obese subjects with and without&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE-Obesity is a risk factor for calcaneal spur (CS) formation which is supposed to&#xD;
      originate from chronic plantar fasciitis. Diabetes mellitus may contribute to the risk of CS&#xD;
      by decreased ability of tissue repair and increased reactive ossification. Thus, the&#xD;
      investigators aimed to determine CS incidence in asymptomatic obese subjects with and without&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-Ninety-three obese patients with T2DM and forty-two obese&#xD;
      subjects without any metabolic disturbances as control were evaluated with lateral calcaneal&#xD;
      x-ray in blinded fashion by a radiologist. All participants were informed and written&#xD;
      consents have been obtained. Control cases were subjected to 75g glucose challenge test and&#xD;
      glucose intolerant subjects were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESULTS-T2DM and control groups were statistically similar in mean age (59±10.5 vs. 55±8 yrs,&#xD;
      P=0.196, respectively) and mean body mass index (BMI)(35.1±4.3 vs. 33.1±3.3 kg/m2, P=0.073,&#xD;
      respectively). Existence of calcaneal spur was 72% in 93 patients (77%) in T2DM group and 24&#xD;
      in 42 (57%) in control group. Groups were significantly different according to existence of&#xD;
      CS (P=0.023). Mean age and mean BMI were significantly higher in diabetic patients with&#xD;
      calcaneal spur than diabetic patients without calcaneal spur (p=0.001 and p=0.015,&#xD;
      respectively). There was positive correlation between existence of calcaneal spur and&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy (p=0,043) in diabetics but no significant relation between existence of&#xD;
      CS and glycolysed hemoglobin levels or diabetes duration (all P&gt;0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONCLUSIONS-Clinicians should pay attention the increased incidence of CS in patients with&#xD;
      T2DM to avoid foot complications.&#xD;
