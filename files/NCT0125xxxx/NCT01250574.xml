    <textblock>
      Postoperative complications, especially bacterial infections, are relatively common and cause&#xD;
      increased morbidity and mortality. Effective and timely antimicrobial treatment is important&#xD;
      for prognosis, and delayed diagnosis and treatment substantially increase mortality. The&#xD;
      early diagnosis of infection and sepsis are today based on diagnostic tests that have been&#xD;
      available for years, like WBC count, SR and CRP. These markers suffer from several drawbacks;&#xD;
      their sensitivity and specificity for infection and sepsis are not good enough and their&#xD;
      kinetics are rather slow in terms of both increase and decrease. A major disadvantage of CRP&#xD;
      is that after surgery and trauma this marker generally increases for several days, reaching a&#xD;
      plateau typically on day 2-4 following the event, and therefore, in most cases do not offer&#xD;
      the needed guidance for early treatment of bacterial infection. More recently, other&#xD;
      biomarkers for infection and sepsis have become available, some of which appear acceptable&#xD;
      for diagnostic use. Procalcitonin (PCT) and neutrophil CD64 are both promising new markers&#xD;
      for the early detection of infection. They do both have their pros and cons compared to each&#xD;
      other and compared to the traditional markers, such as CRP and WBC count. It is a general&#xD;
      view that further research is needed before these markers will be accepted as part of the&#xD;
      routine protocol for the diagnosis of infections, especially in relation to postoperative&#xD;
      complications. The aim of the present study is to investigate the clinical utility of&#xD;
      procalcitonin (PCT) and neutrophil CD64 as markers for infection and inflammation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate if it is possible to detect early phase postoperative infections by using&#xD;
           these tests versus traditional markers such as CRP, SR and WBC count (with&#xD;
           differential).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to differentiate between systemic bacterial infection and systemic inflammation due to&#xD;
           the surgical trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that PCT and neutrophil CD64 are more sensitive and specific analysis for&#xD;
      the early detection of infection after abdominal surgery than CRP (and other widely used&#xD;
      tests for inflammation and infection), and that neutrophil CD64 is more specific than PCT.&#xD;
      Patients admitted to the Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Akershus University&#xD;
      Hospital for elective abdominal surgery will be included in the study after informed consent.&#xD;
      Initially consecutive series of 150 patients will be included, but this number may be&#xD;
      increased depending on the number of observed infections during the course of the study. All&#xD;
      patients will be monitored and treated by the formal protocol related to clinical signs of&#xD;
      infection, such as abcess, peritonitis, pneumonia, sepsis and septic shock. In addition to&#xD;
      the analytical parameters routinely used today in order to discover infections (CRP, WBC&#xD;
      count etc), blood samples for PCT and neutrophil CD64 will be analyzed before surgery and&#xD;
      daily during the stay at the hospital. In the case of signs of infection, locally or&#xD;
      systemic, the frequencies of analysing PCT and CD64 will be increased according to the&#xD;
      severity of the changes in the clinical condition. The expression of CD64 will be measured by&#xD;
      flow-cytometry and PCT will be measured by an immunochemical method.&#xD;
