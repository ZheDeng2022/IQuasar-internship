    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if ofatumumab can control CLL or SLL&#xD;
      that is left after chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy. The safety of the drug will also be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ofatumumab is designed to bind to the surface of some white blood cells (B-cells) and to kill&#xD;
      these cells. It can destroy cancer cells that come from B-cells, and can be used to treat&#xD;
      cancers of B-cells such as B-CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you&#xD;
      will receive ofatumumab up to 20 times during this study. You will receive 8 weekly infusions&#xD;
      and then an infusion every 2 months for 2 years or until the disease gets worse. You will&#xD;
      receive ofatumumab by vein over about 6 Â½ hours the first time and over 4 hours for all the&#xD;
      following infusions. The first infusion will be the smallest dose. The second and later&#xD;
      infusions will be 3 times larger than the first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you receive the study drug each time, you will receive Tylenol (acetaminophen) by&#xD;
      mouth to reduce the risk of fever. You will receive Benadryl (diphenhydramine) by mouth or&#xD;
      vein and prednisolone (a steroid) by vein over about 30 minutes to reduce the risk of an&#xD;
      allergic reaction or an infusion reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the infusions, you will be monitored closely. You will be expected to stay in clinic&#xD;
      for about 71/2 hours on the day of the first infusion and 5 hours for all other infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be seen at MD Anderson for mandatory visits for enrollment, ofatumumab infusions,&#xD;
      for response assessment after 8 weekly ofatumumab doses (Month 3), during maintenance every 6&#xD;
      months and for follow-up at least once a year. Your local doctor may perform other visits and&#xD;
      laboratory studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you decide to have your local doctor perform study visits and laboratory studies, a letter&#xD;
      will be sent to your doctor, describing your participation in this study and asking for your&#xD;
      doctor's agreement to help manage your care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tests and procedures will be performed every other week during Weeks 1- 8&#xD;
      (Weeks 1, 3, 5 and 7):&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a complete physical exam including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your medical history will be recorded. Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting at Month 3, you will have the following tests and procedures every 2 Months:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a complete physical exam including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your medical history will be recorded. Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting at Month 3, you will also have the following tests and procedures every 6 months, in&#xD;
      addition to the ones performed every 2 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about an additional 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for other routine tests. You may have CT&#xD;
      scans to check the status of the disease, if your doctor thinks that this test is needed (at&#xD;
      Month 3 only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Information Depending on the results of your hepatitis tests performed at the&#xD;
      screening visit, you may have additional hepatitis tests. The study staff will tell you if&#xD;
      you will have these tests performed. If you do have the additional hepatitis tests, blood&#xD;
      (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn during Months 3-24. The blood will be drawn at the same&#xD;
      time of the routine blood draws to prevent unnecessary needle sticks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study You may continue taking the study drug for up to 20 doses (up to 24 months).&#xD;
      You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse or intolerable&#xD;
      side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the follow-up visits,&#xD;
      which will last until you begin receiving any other treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow Up Visits Every 3 Months You will have a complete physical exam including measurement&#xD;
      of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your medical history will be recorded. Blood (about 2 teaspoons every 3 months, about 1&#xD;
      teaspoon every 6 months) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for hepatitis&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 6 Months, you will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy to check the status of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Ofatumumab is FDA approved for CLL resistant to standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Ofatumumab's use in patients with residual CLL or SLL is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ofatumumab will be provided at no cost to you while you are on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 42 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
