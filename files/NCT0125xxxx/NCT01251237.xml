  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is particularly important that thorough gut cleansing is achieved prior to the colonoscopy&#xD;
      for the procedure to be successful. Polyethylene glycol plus electrolyte (PEG+E) solutions&#xD;
      are well established as safe and effective agents for gut cleansing and Norgine has&#xD;
      successfully developed a low volume (2 litre) PEG+E gut lavage solution. The efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of this solution is similar to the standard 4 litre PEG+E, but with improved patient&#xD;
      acceptance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolerance, acceptability and satisfaction with the cleansing agent plays an important role in&#xD;
      subjects' compliance with gut preparation procedure. The study medication NRL0706 is&#xD;
      identical to the PEG+E-containing gut lavage solution commonly used in clinical practice,&#xD;
      with the exception that the flavour has been modified from lemon to orange. This study is to&#xD;
      investigate the tolerability, acceptability, safety and efficacy of a single dose of NRL0706&#xD;
      (MOVIPREP Orange) in subjects without gastrointestinal symptoms undergoing colonoscopy for&#xD;
      colon cancer screening.&#xD;
