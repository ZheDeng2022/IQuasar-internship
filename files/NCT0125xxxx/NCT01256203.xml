  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a combination of a drug, porfimer sodium, and a light from a&#xD;
      non heated laser. The activation of the drug is done by illuminating abnormal areas using a&#xD;
      fiber optic device. The fiber optic device is a very fine fiber (like fishing line) that&#xD;
      permits transmission of light. By itself, porfimer sodium is inactive. However it becomes&#xD;
      active when it is put in the presence of a light source such as sunlight, very intense indoor&#xD;
      light, or laser. Therefore, the main risk with this therapy is that the skin will be more&#xD;
      sensitive to light, and this sensibility can last up to 90 days. The skin reaction is similar&#xD;
      to sunburn and is called phototoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no product on the market has shown protection against visible light, and therefore,&#xD;
      no product has been demonstrated to protect against the skin phototoxicity to visible light.&#xD;
      A sunscreen sold under the brand name Solar Protection Formula® SPF 60 in the United States&#xD;
      contains ingredients that provide maximum ultraviolet (UV) protection, as well as a&#xD;
      formulation that could provide visible light protection. The product could potentially&#xD;
      prevent the skin phototoxicity due to visible light, the most frequently reported side effect&#xD;
      in patients receiving PDT with porfimer sodium. Therefore, this study is designed to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy of topical application of Solar Protection Formula® SPF 60 as skin protector&#xD;
      against visible light-induced skin redness and swelling following injection of porfimer&#xD;
      sodium. It will involve 17 to 20 human subjects in the United States for whom PDT with&#xD;
      porfimer sodium is planned for the treatment of high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus&#xD;
      (pre-cancerous change in the food pipe tissue), lung cancer, or cancer of the esophagus (food&#xD;
      pipe).&#xD;

      Human subjects with planned PDT course will be evaluated to confirm eligibility. Prior to&#xD;
      enrollment, all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be verified. Medical procedures&#xD;
      including demographic information (age, sex, race, smoking and drinking habits),&#xD;
      medical/surgical history, physical exam (including vital signs, body weight, height, and skin&#xD;
      color), clinical laboratory testing, concomitant medication intake and other therapy uses&#xD;
      will be collected. The study procedures will begin after the intravenous injection of&#xD;
      porfimer sodium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin photobiological testing will consist of four 2-day periods performed over three months&#xD;
      after the injection of porfimer sodium at a dose of 2 mg/kg of body weight. Each period will&#xD;
      include a Skin Illumination session and a Skin Evaluation session. During the Skin&#xD;
      Illumination session, the Solar Protection Formula® SPF 60 will be randomly applied at a dose&#xD;
      of 2 mg/cm² on a skin subunit area of the back 30 minutes before illumination. A second skin&#xD;
      subunit will be used as a &quot;no-treatment&quot; observational area. Therefore, each subject will be&#xD;
      her/his own control. Illumination will be performed using a visible light source. During the&#xD;
      Skin Evaluation session, skin reactions will be scored by an outcome assessor 24 hours after&#xD;
      illumination according to a pre-determined rating scale. The outcome assessor will be blinded&#xD;
      to the active treatment sequence applications. All subjects will be followed for three&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
