      Brief Summary Study investigating the efficacy of oral administration of VHH antibody&#xD;
      fragment derived from antibodies as found in milk of llamas and camels via a prototype food&#xD;
      product in reducing the severity of rotavirus diarrhoea in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed Description&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction Rotavirus is the leading viral enteropathogen, which is responsible for 11-71%&#xD;
      of all diarrhoea episodes in infants and children worldwide. In developing countries,&#xD;
      rotavirus is associated with more than 125 million episodes of diarrhoea each year (Cook et&#xD;
      al. 1990), leading to an estimated 600,000 deaths. It is responsible for 60% of all&#xD;
      diarrhoeal episodes, 20-60% of diarrhoeal hospitalizations, and 20% of diarrhoea-related&#xD;
      deaths in children &lt;5 years of age (Perez-Schael et al. 1997). In the United States of&#xD;
      America alone, rotavirus is associated with 3% of all hospitalizations of children younger&#xD;
      than 5 years with medical and indirect costs of over US$ 1 billion each year (Glass et al.&#xD;
      1991). In many localities deaths from rotavirus infections persist despite national programs&#xD;
      to encourage the use of oral rehydration therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current management of rotavirus gastroenteritis Current management of rotavirus diarrhoea&#xD;
      includes prevention of dehydration, or management of dehydration using oral or intravenous&#xD;
      rehydration, as appropriate, and continued feeding. Early resumption of normal feeding is&#xD;
      encouraged to enhance mucosal repair and to minimize nutritional consequences of infection.&#xD;
      The children of developing countries might benefit from zinc supplementation, but its mode of&#xD;
      delivery and cost effectiveness are yet to be decided in rotavirus diarrhoea. No specific&#xD;
      treatment is currently available to reduce the duration or severity of this illness.&#xD;
      Therefore, rotavirus-induced diarrhoea, which is considered to be a self-limited disease, is&#xD;
      responsible for significant childhood deaths in the developing countries (Glass et al. 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active immunization against rotavirus infection The development, testing and eventual use of&#xD;
      an effective, safe and inexpensive rotavirus vaccine would be the most efficient method for&#xD;
      preventing severe disease and deaths in developing countries. Rapid progress has been made,&#xD;
      and several candidate rotavirus vaccines have been developed and tested. Two rotavirus&#xD;
      vaccines, Rotarix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Belgium) and RotaTeq (Merck &amp; Co., USA) have&#xD;
      recently entered the market in the developed world. Both vaccines appear to be safe with&#xD;
      respect to intussusception, and are highly efficacious in preventing severe gastroenteritis&#xD;
      due to rotavirus strains carrying predominantly serotype G1 (Cunliffe &amp; Nakagomi 2005).&#xD;
      Confirmation of the safety and efficacy of both vaccines in developing countries is still&#xD;
      needed. Moreover, assessment of the ability of each vaccine to provide protection against&#xD;
      increasingly diverse population of rotavirus strains will depend on continuous surveillance&#xD;
      on the strain and development of newer vaccines as newer serotypes predominate in different&#xD;
      geographical locations, which may not be easy for the developing countries. There thus is a&#xD;
      clear need to define improved, cost effective interventions in the management of rotavirus&#xD;
      diarrhoea until the time an effective, safe and inexpensive vaccine, affordable to the&#xD;
      developing countries, is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Passive immunisation for rotavirus-induced diarrhoea; There are good reasons to hypothesize&#xD;
      that passive immunisation could be useful in the management of human rotavirus diarrhoea. For&#xD;
      example, oral administration of rotavirus-neutralizing antibodies has been found to modulate&#xD;
      the rotavirus-induced diarrhoea in children. Beneficial prophylactic (Barnes et al. 1982) and&#xD;
      therapeutic effects (Guarino et al. 1991), in terms of reduction of duration and severity of&#xD;
      rotavirus diarrhoea, have also been observed in association with orally administered human&#xD;
      IgG preparations. The use of human antibody preparation, however, is limited due to the risk&#xD;
      of viral contamination and high production and supply chain costs of such product(s) and very&#xD;
      low bio-availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative source of antibodies, safe and easy to produce, was later developed in hyper&#xD;
      immunized bovine colostrums by vaccinating pregnant cows against human strains of rotavirus.&#xD;
      This approach has also been effectively used for prophylactic (Davidsson et al. 1989) and&#xD;
      therapeutic benefits (Mitra et al. 1995, Sarker et al. 1998) in rotavirus diarrhoea in&#xD;
      hospitalized children. In a recently concluded study in children with rotavirus diarrhoea in&#xD;
      Bangladesh, we have observed a modest benefit from oral administration of immunoglobulin&#xD;
      extracted from eggs of chicken immunized with human strains of rotavirus (Sarker et al.&#xD;
      2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Passive immunization for prevention or treatment of enteric infections generally requires&#xD;
      relatively large amounts of antibody, particularly at the mucosal sites where antibodies are&#xD;
      rapidly cleared. Therefore, these modalities, although proven to be effective, become&#xD;
      expensive due to requirement of larger doses of antibodies. The other limitations of the&#xD;
      conventional IgG antibodies include their poor stability and complex nature that limits their&#xD;
      large-scale production. A promising solution for these problems in large-scale antibody&#xD;
      production came, rather unexpectedly, from the nature itself- camels and llama posses an&#xD;
      unusual type of IgG antibodies (IgG2 and IgG3) that are devoid of light chains- the &quot;heavy&#xD;
      chain&quot; antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of heavy chain antibody fragments In llama and camel, the &quot;heavy chain&quot; IgG&#xD;
      antibodies co-exist with the &quot;conventional&quot; IgG (IgG1) (Hamers-Casterman et al. 1993). In&#xD;
      contrast to conventional antibodies, the heavy chain antibodies are devoid of the light&#xD;
      chains. Therefore, the binding domain of the heavy chain antibodies consists only of the&#xD;
      variable domain of the heavy chain (VHH) in contrast to the binding domain of the&#xD;
      conventional antibodies which consists of a variable domain of the heavy chain (VH) and one&#xD;
      of the light chain (VL). The biochemical properties of llama VHH antibody fragments are&#xD;
      superior to the Fv fragments (VH + VL) of conventional IgG antibodies. Although the VHH&#xD;
      antibody fragments have a simple antigen binding structure with only one domain, it possesses&#xD;
      high affinity, and is extremely thermostable (van der Linden et al., 1999). Furthermore, they&#xD;
      are well expressed and secreted by the bakers yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, allowing for a&#xD;
      large-scale cost effective production (Frenken et al., 2000). This process will make the VHH&#xD;
      fragments an affordable ingredient for food products and will widen their availability to the&#xD;
      general population of developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VHH as a potential food ingredient Many people in African/Arabic countries regularly consume&#xD;
      camel milk. In 1992, it was observed that camel milk contains high titres of antibodies&#xD;
      against rotavirus (el Agamy et al 1992).The antibody fragment in VHH batch 203027 is a&#xD;
      fragment of those antibodies assumed to be present in camel/llama milk. Thus, the&#xD;
      investigational product can be classified as a food ingredient As from its start in 1999, the&#xD;
      aim of Unilever's &quot;VHH&quot; project was to develop an affordable food for developing countries,&#xD;
      which &quot;may help in reducing the risk for rotavirus infections&quot;. This type of claim fits very&#xD;
      well into the definitions put forward by the European Union-sponsored Concerted Action on&#xD;
      Functional Foods Science in Europe (FUFOSE) (Diplock et al 1999). The FUFOSE terminology's&#xD;
      for 'enhanced function' (type A) and 'reduction of risk of disease' (type B) claims are now&#xD;
      widely adapted by many national and international codes of practice, including Codex&#xD;
      Alimentarius. It was especially developed in the 1990's to allow the delineation between&#xD;
      functional foods from drugs. In this context, we would also like to refer to the EC&#xD;
      Regulation No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 1997&#xD;
      concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients and the EU regulation 1924/2006 on&#xD;
      nutrition and health claims made for foods. The efficacy of VHH fragments in reducing the&#xD;
      risk for developing rotavirus diarrhoea when supplied in a food format will be tested in an&#xD;
      additional trial Safety of application of VHH antibody fragment Safety of oral application of&#xD;
      VHH antibody fragment has been proven in two studies executed in the Netherlands and&#xD;
      Bangladesh, including adult and children above the age of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will compare with the effect of VHH antibody fragment against placebo in children with&#xD;
      proven rotavirus diarrhoea hospitalized at the ICDDR,B. This intervention will be on top of&#xD;
      the standard treatment, including oral rehydration treatment.&#xD;
