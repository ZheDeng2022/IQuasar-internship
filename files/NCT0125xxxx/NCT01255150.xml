      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Research has shown that the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) gene is an important&#xD;
      target for personalized lung cancer treatment. Individuals who have mutations in the EGFR&#xD;
      gene have better responses when treated with certain personalized or targeted therapies&#xD;
      compared with conventional chemotherapy. These mutations are more frequent in females with&#xD;
      lung cancer who have never smoked, and different ethnic groups have different levels of&#xD;
      frequency of the mutations. Researchers are interested in collecting more information on EGFR&#xD;
      genetic mutations in Hispanics/Latinos with lung cancer, comparing the frequency of these&#xD;
      mutations in males and females and smokers and nonsmokers. This study may lead to better,&#xD;
      more personalized care approaches for all individuals with lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the frequency of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor mutations in Hispanic/Latino&#xD;
      individuals who have been diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Hispanic or Latino individuals who have been diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer and&#xD;
      who have lung tissue from a previous biopsy or surgery available for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide consent for researchers to examine lung tissue collected from&#xD;
           a previous biopsy or surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this protocol.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is a growing body of evidence that points to genetic heterogeneity of the EGFR&#xD;
           pathway in non-small cell lung cancer among different ethnic groups and that underscores&#xD;
           the need for consideration of these differences in patient management and in the design&#xD;
           of future trials of agents that target the EGFR pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activating mutations in EGFR have been found in about 15% of NSCLC patients from North&#xD;
           America and Europe, 40% of Asian and 2% in African-Americans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  However, there is no data on the frequency of EGFR mutations in U.S. Hispanic and Latin&#xD;
           American patients with NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Protocol Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the frequency of EGFR mutations in Hispanic/Latinos with non-small cell&#xD;
           lung cancer according to gender and smoking status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the association between the frequency of EGFR mutations and the percentage of&#xD;
           American Indian ancestry, as defined by genetic ancestry analysis, in Hispanic/Latinos&#xD;
           with non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Protocol Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To evaluate the association between EGFR mutations and other clinical variables such as wood&#xD;
      smoke exposure, age, stage at presentation, nationality and response to EGFR TKIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hispanic or Latino patients with histologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue samples from Hispanic or Latino individuals with histologically confirmed&#xD;
           non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paraffin embedded tumor samples from Latino patients with non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
           will be collected at the NIH s clinical center and the participating institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Samples and clinical data will then be sent to the molecular pathology laboratory for&#xD;
           EGFR mutation analyses. The remainder DNA will then used for genetic ancestry analysis.&#xD;
