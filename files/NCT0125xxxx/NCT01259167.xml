      The purpose of this study was to assess whether a training program based on Joba® Core&#xD;
      Trainer is effective in reducing pain and improving physical function and quality of life of&#xD;
      subjects suffering from Chronic Low Back Pain.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background and rational&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Definition Low back pain is a clinical condition characterized by pain felt between the&#xD;
           bottom edge of the costal arch and the inferior gluteus folds, sometimes radiating to&#xD;
           the back side of the thigh.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It may be responsible for functional limitation and inability to perform normal&#xD;
           activities of daily living. Low back pain is defined as acute if symptoms have a&#xD;
           duration less than 4 weeks, sub-acute if the duration is between 4 weeks and 3 months,&#xD;
           and chronic if it lasts beyond 3 months. It is considered recurrent when episodes&#xD;
           shorter than 4 weeks alternate with periods of relief from pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Epidemiology Low Back Pain is the most common musculo-skeletal disorder, and, along with&#xD;
           common cold, is the most frequent disease among humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Up to 60-80% of population is expected to suffer from Low Back Pain at some time in&#xD;
           life. Annual prevalence of Low Back Pain ranges from 30 to 50% amongst people in the&#xD;
           working period of their life; out of these individuals, a percentage between 15 and 20%&#xD;
           do necessitate medical assistance. Low Back Pain is the fifth-ranking cause of medical&#xD;
           referral and the second symptomatic condition. A proportion ranging from 25 and 50% of&#xD;
           patients with acute Low Back Pain will suffer from new pain episodes in the following&#xD;
           year and 6-10% will progress toward a chronic form.Chronic Low Back Pain is responsible&#xD;
           for about 75% of all medical expenses made for the treatment of all types of Low Back&#xD;
           Pain. Direct annual costs (medications, medical visits, physiotherapy, hospitalizations)&#xD;
           of Chronic Low Back Pain have been estimated to be approximately € 3.100 for patients&#xD;
           (year 2002); indirect costs, mainly due to absence from work, represent about 85% of&#xD;
           total costs and match up about € 17.600 for patient for year. In conclusion, Chronic Low&#xD;
           Back Pain is a disease with very high prevalence and incidence, evenly affecting men and&#xD;
           women in their 30's and 50's, which is extremely costly for individuals and society,&#xD;
           both in terms of diagnostic interventions and treatments, and of reduction of&#xD;
           productivity and functional limitation in everyday life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Non-Pharmacologic treatments Non-Pharmacologic treatments of Chronic Low Back Pain&#xD;
           include: acupuncture, back school, psychological interventions, functional restoration,&#xD;
           interdisciplinary rehabilitation, interferential therapy, low-level laser therapy,&#xD;
           lumbar support, massage, short wave diathermy, spinal manipulations, tractions,&#xD;
           superficial heat, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulations (TENS), ultrasound&#xD;
           therapy, yoga and physical exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A recent meta-analysis based on 43 clinical controlled trials involving 3.907 subjects&#xD;
           with Chronic Low Back Pain demonstrated that physical exercise is effective in reducing&#xD;
           pain and improving functional level. The most recent Guidelines, published in October&#xD;
           20007, underline that, along with cognitive-behavioural therapy, spinal manipulations&#xD;
           and interdisciplinary rehabilitation, physical exercise is the only non pharmacologic&#xD;
           treatment having a positive effect on Chronic (or subacute) Low Back Pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Vertebral instability and physical exercise Several theories link the etiology of Low&#xD;
           Back Pain clinical signs and symptoms to the mechanical instability of the lumbar spine.&#xD;
           Stability of the lumbar spine requires both passive stiffness, through the osseous and&#xD;
           ligamentous structures, and active stiffness, through &quot;core&quot; muscles, such as rectus&#xD;
           abdominis, external oblique, internal oblique, transversus abdominis, quadratus&#xD;
           lumborum, multifidi, psoas major, iliocostalis, gluteus major. It has been shown that&#xD;
           therapeutic exercise improves vertebral stability through stretching and strengthening&#xD;
           of &quot;core&quot; muscles, but also by enhancing neuromuscular proprioceptive facilitation. This&#xD;
           is the reason why physical exercise programs usually do include strengthening and&#xD;
           trunk-stabilizing exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Joba® Core Trainer Joba® Core Trainer is a gym equipment which makes use of the&#xD;
           counterbalance principle to efficiently engage trunk muscles, including both abdominals&#xD;
           and trunk extensors. This equipment has been proved to be effective in improving&#xD;
           cardio-respiratory fitness level, increasing resting energy expenditure, reducing weight&#xD;
           and enhancing glycaemic control in diabetic patients. Furthermore it significantly&#xD;
           strengthens diverse muscular groups (abdominals, trunk extensors, abductors, thigh&#xD;
           flexors and extensors).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thus Core Trainer Joba® may represent a valuable alternative to traditional physical&#xD;
           exercise protocols in the treatment of subjects with Chronic Low Back Pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Study purpose The purpose of this study was to assess whether a training program based&#xD;
           on Joba® Core Trainer is effective in reducing pain and improving physical function and&#xD;
           quality of life of subjects suffering from Chronic Low Back Pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Materials and Methods 7a)Study design Randomized, one centre, single-blinded, clinical&#xD;
           trial with three arms: JOBA group (training with JOBA® Core Trainer), BACK group&#xD;
           (training with a traditional protocol of Therapeutic Physical Exercise) and Control&#xD;
           group with sedentary people undergoing usual care (C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      7b)Subjects Subject attending the Physiatrist and Geriatric Outpatient Clinics of the&#xD;
      Department of Gerontology, Geriatric and Physiatrist Sciences of the University Hospital&#xD;
      &quot;Agostino Gemelli&quot; (Rome, Italy) with non-specific Low Back Pain, with or without sciatic&#xD;
      irradiation, from at least 3 months. Exclusion criteria: functional or neurosensorial&#xD;
      limitations which contraindicate or impede attending a physical exercise program&#xD;
      (spondilolystesis higher than first degree, disk herniation more recent than 6 months, disk&#xD;
      herniation for which surgical intervention is indicated, previous surgical intervention on&#xD;
      spine, cognitive deterioration, terminal prognosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      7c)Main outcome Perceived pain intensity. 7d)Secondary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Level of physical function&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Level of physical activity in everyday life&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Neuro-muscular proprioceptive control of trunk-stabilizing muscles&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Medication use/medical visits. 7e)Duration Twelve weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8)Study phases 8a)Screening visit and enrolment Subjects to be enrolled into the study will&#xD;
      be individuated during visits carried out at the Physiatrist and Geriatric Outpatient Clinics&#xD;
      of the Department. Eligible subjects will be informed about the scope and methods of the&#xD;
      study; those who will accept to participate will sign informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8b)Baseline assessment Patients will undergo a thorough medical visit (medical history,&#xD;
      medication use, physical examination). The intensity of perceived low back pain, the level of&#xD;
      physical functioning, and the quality of life will be measured (Mc Gill Pain&#xD;
      Questionnaire-Short Form, Visual Analogue Scale, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire,&#xD;
      Short-Form 36, respectively).The level of physical activity in everyday life (daily energy&#xD;
      expenditure, physical activity &gt;3 METs duration, active energy expenditure, average METs,&#xD;
      number of steps, etc.) will be assessed by means of Metabolic Holter (Armband®) for a period&#xD;
      of at least five consecutive days.Proprioceptive and neuro-muscular control of trunk muscles&#xD;
      will be evaluated by means of a stabilometric, computerized table(Libra®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      8c)Randomization Subjects will be allocated to one of the three study groups according to a&#xD;
      computerized randomization procedure with block of variable length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8d)Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. JOBA Group: 3 sessions per week with JOBA® Core Trainer. Each session will last about 45&#xD;
           minutes (5-7 minute stretching exercises, 31' minutes with JOBA, 5-7 minute of&#xD;
           stretching exercises). Speed of JOBA movements will progressively increase during the&#xD;
           study period. All training session will take place in the Fitness Centre of the&#xD;
           University Hospital &quot;A. Gemelli&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. BACK Group: 2 sessions per week (55 minutes each) of calistenic gymnastic with&#xD;
           stretching, dynamic stabilization, and strengthening of trunk-stabilizing muscles,&#xD;
           according to a standardized training protocol under the supervision of qualified&#xD;
           technical personnel at the Fitness Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Control Group (C): usual medical care according to the fore mentioned Outpatient Clinic&#xD;
           standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8e)Intermediate assessment After 6 weeks, pain intensity, physical functioning, and quality&#xD;
      of life will be re-evaluated; drug use and medical visits occurred from the baseline will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8f)Final assessment After 12 weeks, subjects will undergo a complete medical visit and a new&#xD;
      functional evaluation accordin to procedures already depicted for baseline (pain, physical&#xD;
      function, quality of life, physical activity, proprioceptive control of the trunk,&#xD;
      care-associated costs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding Due to the characteristics of the intervention, participants will be aware of the&#xD;
      specific group the are allocated to (either traditional training or JOBA or usual care).&#xD;
      However, baseline, intermediate, and final assessment will be carried out by a field&#xD;
      researcher (a medicine doctor) uninformed of the allocation arm of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size According to literature data it has been hypothesized that the intervention will&#xD;
      produce a 20 (per cent) points increase in pain scale with respect to controls; using a&#xD;
      probability of type I error of 5% (alfa=0.05, single-sided) and a power of 80% (beta=0.20),&#xD;
      it can be estimated that each group should include 12 subjects (total sample size 12x3=36).&#xD;
&#xD;
      9)Analisi statistica Statistical analysis will be carried out on an intention-to-treat&#xD;
      approach. Statistical analysis will be carried out using statistical software package SPSS/PC&#xD;
      Vers. 18.&#xD;
