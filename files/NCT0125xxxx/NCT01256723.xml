      The main purpose of this study is to observe the incidence of major adverse cardiac and&#xD;
      cerebrovascular events (MACCE), target vessel failure (TVF), target vessel revascularization&#xD;
      (TVR) and stent thrombosis out to 5 years after the procedure in patients who underwent&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with everolimus-eluting stents for unprotected left&#xD;
      main coronary artery (ULMCA) disease and lesions involving the ULMCA in Japan. The&#xD;
      investigators will also establish a method of adjustment to the Japanese version of the&#xD;
      SYNTAX score by conducting an assessment using the SYNTAX score recently reported in the US&#xD;
      and Europe as well as the EuroSCORE, and by clarifying the differences of PCI procedures and&#xD;
      treatment results in Japan with those reported in the US and Europe.&#xD;
