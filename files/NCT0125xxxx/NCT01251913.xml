      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - An important new area of brain tumor research is the development of tumor and brain stem&#xD;
      cell lines. Successful growth of these cell lines requires obtaining large volumes of fresh&#xD;
      tumor and brain tissue, which is best accomplished by harvesting whole brains from recently&#xD;
      deceased patients. These cell lines will help researchers understand how these tumors develop&#xD;
      and will also help identify new targets for treatment. Researchers are interested in&#xD;
      conducting a pilot study of planned inpatient hospice care with timely brain tumor tissue&#xD;
      harvest at the time of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide high-quality end of life inpatient hospice care for patients with untreatable&#xD;
           brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To procure brain and tumor tissue shortly after time of death in order to derive viable&#xD;
           tumor and neural stem cell lines for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have an untreatable primary brain or central&#xD;
           nervous system tumor, are able to give informed consent (either their own or through a&#xD;
           designated power of attorney), and have agreed to a Do Not Resuscitate order and Consent&#xD;
           for Autopsy as part of the end-of-life care plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV-positive individuals or those suspected of having infectious cerebritis are not&#xD;
           eligible because of the potential for contamination of brain tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be enrolled in inpatient hospice admission to the National Institutes&#xD;
           of Health Clinical Center either from home or from an outside hospital once a study&#xD;
           investigator estimates an expected survival of less than 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive palliative care at the Clinical Center. Care will be tailored&#xD;
           to each participant depending on the information provided in the individual's&#xD;
           end-of-life care plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supportive medications such as antiseizure medications and pain relievers will be&#xD;
           administered as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the time of death, researchers will follow standard procedures for notifying next of&#xD;
           kin and will collect brain tissue and tumor samples from the deceased.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following tissue collection, the deceased will be released for autopsy and funeral&#xD;
           procedures.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Patients treated by the Neuro-Oncology Branch (NOB) for their brain tumors unfortunately&#xD;
      and commonly succumb to their disease. They and their loved ones often seek a way of adding&#xD;
      meaning and utility to their death by agreeing to donate brain tumor tissue for laboratory&#xD;
      research that may serve the medical community, and ultimately other patients, through better&#xD;
      understanding of these rare diseases. Important new avenues of brain tumor research includes&#xD;
      the molecular characterization of tumor tissue, and the development of tumor and neural stem&#xD;
      cell lines. Successful growth of these cell lines requires acquisition of large volumes of&#xD;
      fresh tumor and brain tissue that can best be accomplished by harvesting whole brains from&#xD;
      recently deceased patients. In an effort to provide high quality end of life care, with the&#xD;
      additional intent of facilitating efficient donation of brain tumor tissue at the time of&#xD;
      death, we are conducting a pilot study of planned inpatient hospice care incorporating timely&#xD;
      brain tumor tissue procurement at the time of expiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide high quality end of life inpatient hospice care for patients dying with&#xD;
           untreatable brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procure brain and tumor tissue shortly after time of death in order to derive viable&#xD;
           tumor and neural stem cell lines for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adult patients with primary brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - This is a pilot study to assess feasibility of procuring viable brain and tumor tissue&#xD;
      proximal to the time of death. Target accrual is 10 patients for brain harvest.&#xD;
