  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind placebo controlled phase 2 trial. Patient will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned 1:1 between 2 treatment arms. They will receive either docetaxel 75mg/m2 IV and&#xD;
      placebo given bd, or AZD6244 75mg bd daily with docetaxel 75mg/m2 IV. Docetaxel will be&#xD;
      administered every 3 weeks for a maximum 6 cycles, but AZD6244/placebo may be continued&#xD;
      beyond this, until disease progression. The objective is to assess whether the combination of&#xD;
      AZD6244 with docetaxel is worthy of evaluation in a definitive randomised study, with the&#xD;
      null hypothesis being that the combination has activity similar to that of docetaxel alone in&#xD;
      this population. After consent has been obtained mutational analysis of tumour BRAF will be&#xD;
      performed on archival tumour tissue, where this information is not already known, to assess&#xD;
      eligibility for the study. If there is no archival tissue a fresh biopsy will be requested&#xD;
      from the patient. A blood sample will also be taken for future genetic analysis. Once taking&#xD;
      part in the trial patients will need to attend their oncology unit regularly for monitoring&#xD;
      and the delivery of treatment. Patients will undergo complete physical examination at&#xD;
      screening, on C1D1, C1D8, C1D15, C2D1, C2D8 and day 1 of every subsequent cycle. Blood for&#xD;
      haematology, biochemistry and clotting will be taken at each of these visits. A 12 lead ECG&#xD;
      will be performed at screening . Disease assessment will be by CT scanning using modified&#xD;
      RECIST criteria after 9 and 18 weeks, then every 3 months until disease progression.&#xD;
