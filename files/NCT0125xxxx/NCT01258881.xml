    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer, especially epithelial ovarian carcinoma, has the highest mortality rate among&#xD;
      the gynecologic malignancies. The majority of patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma are&#xD;
      diagnosed at advanced stage which has the overall survival rates of only 19-30%. As the&#xD;
      advance in the managements which prolonged the overall survival, metastatic lesion in rare&#xD;
      location such as brain was noted in few patients of ovarian cancer in recent years. In the&#xD;
      retrospective study, the investigators will review the medical records of the ovarian cancer&#xD;
      patients with brain metastasis in the investigators hospital to investigate the incidence,&#xD;
      clinical courses, optimal managements and possible prognostic factors in the rare condition.&#xD;

      The ovarian cancer patient treated at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the&#xD;
      National Taiwan University Hospital were retrospectively collected. The cancer registration&#xD;
      database was searched for the patients with ovarian carcinoma who brain metastases were also&#xD;
      diagnosed. The medical records of these patients were reviewed with particular attention to&#xD;
      the results of histo-pathological and radiologic reports. Patients with other synchronous&#xD;
      primary brain tumor were excluded. The initial management of primary tumor, including the&#xD;
      surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, and the clinical courses and disease status, such as&#xD;
      remission, recurrence and progression, were all carefully reviewed. The intra-cranial lesions&#xD;
      were all diagnosed by imaging studies, including brain computed tomography (CT) and magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Therapeutic strategies for the metastatic lesions in the brain&#xD;
      were also reviewed. All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 13.0 statistical&#xD;
      software for Windows. P&lt;0.05 was defined as statistical significance. Survival was measured&#xD;
      from the time of initial diagnosis of brain metastasis until the date of death or last&#xD;
      contact, and was presented by Kaplan-Meier curves.&#xD;
