      BACKGROUND:- Phacochop techniques have been categorized as either horizontal or vertical.&#xD;
      These approaches are thought to be among the best techniques for managing hard cataracts. In&#xD;
      vertical chop technique proper placement of the phaco tip is crucial. It must be embedded&#xD;
      deeply into the centre of the nucleus , pointing toward the optic nerve , with high vacuum&#xD;
      and burst mode.Inadequate penetration of phacotip may result in partial thickness nuclear&#xD;
      crack with residual posterior plate and overzealous penetration may result in posterior&#xD;
      capsular rupture.This may be avoided if some estimate can be made preoperatively of the depth&#xD;
      of penetration required to achieve full thickness crack. With this in mind the study intends&#xD;
      to make a preoperative assessment of the depth required to reach the centre of the nuclei and&#xD;
      observe the actual depth of penetration required for a safe and effective vertical chop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATHEMATICAL BASIS :- The cross section of a lens nucleus is ellipsoidal . A geometrical&#xD;
      estimate of the radius of the ellipse (x )traversed by the phacotip to reach the centre can&#xD;
      be made preoperatively.The calculation would depend largely on three parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major axis of the ellipse ( namely the lens diameter[b] ) The minor axis of the ellipse&#xD;
      (namely lens thickness[a] ) The point of entry on the surface of the lens.This defines an&#xD;
      angle Ø which this radius makes with the vertical axis and in turn can be approximated by the&#xD;
      length of the arc from centre of lens surface to entry point[y].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult human crystalline lens varies in thickness from 4.2+/-0.5 mm and has a diameter of&#xD;
      9.6+/- 0.4mm. Assuming the lens diameter (b) to be from 9.2 mm to 10.0mm , the lens thickness&#xD;
      ( a) varying from 3.7mm to 4.7mm and the point of entry of phacotip 2.0mm to 3.0mm from&#xD;
      centre of anterior lens surface ( y ) , this distance (x) would vary from 2.59mm to&#xD;
      3.2mm.(using Online Wolfram calculator) in thinnest to thickest nuclei. This would be&#xD;
      increased with increase in ( a ) as well as ( y ) .In cataractous lens the harder a nucleus&#xD;
      the deeper it may be required to penetrate to achieve a full thickness crack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the investigators make a note of all three variables i.e lens thickness , nuclear hardness&#xD;
      and point of entry at the time of surgery and correlate with the actual depth required at the&#xD;
      time of surgery the investigators may be able to recommend an effective and safe phacodepth&#xD;
      for achieving full thickness nuclear crack in various grades of hard cataract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Till now it was not possible to measure the length of penetration of phacotip during surgery.&#xD;
      The investigators have designed a calibrated phacotip with visible markings on 0.2mm scale&#xD;
      from 2 to 3. 4mm to enable measurements and recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus the investigators aim to identify a safe and effective phacodepth required in each grade&#xD;
      of cataract {3.0 - 6.9 according to Lens Opacities Classification System( LOCS-III )}to&#xD;
      achieve successful nuclear crack . At the same time any correlation between different nuclear&#xD;
      grades and the effective phacodepth would be analysed to find any association between them.&#xD;
