      The primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      *To measure the difference in the number of Ranibizumab therapies needed in 12 months in the&#xD;
      Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD) positive and Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD) negative&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the mean change in visual acuity from Baseline to Month 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the mean change in central retinal thickness per OCT from Baseline to Month&#xD;
           12&#xD;

      This is an open-label study, of intravitreally administered Ranibizumab in eyes with&#xD;
      Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), specifically looking at the correlation between the&#xD;
      presence of Posterior Vitreous Detachment(PVD) and the number of intravitreal injections of&#xD;
      Ranibizumab required. 40 subjects from the offices of Vision Research Foundation will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study. Subjects will be assigned to either a Posterior Vitreous Detachment&#xD;
      (PVD) positive group or a Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD) negative group based on a&#xD;
      pre-treatment ultrasound. A maximum of 20 subjects in each group will be enrolled. Subject&#xD;
      accrual into the trial is expected to be completed within 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study eyes will receive 0.5mg, of intravitreous monthly injections of Ranibizumab, for&#xD;
      four initial doses,(Day 0, Month 1, Month 2, and Month 3),with scheduled follow-up visits&#xD;
      monthly for 12 months. Re-treatment after the first 4 injections, will be on an as needed&#xD;
      basis, based on predefined criteria. Eyes will be evaluated with a full ocular examination,&#xD;
      visual acuity measurement (ETDRS chart at a distance of 4 meters),OCT,FA,Fundus Photos,&#xD;
      B-scan Ultrasound and subject adverse event monitoring.&#xD;
