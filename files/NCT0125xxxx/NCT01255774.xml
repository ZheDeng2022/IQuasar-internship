  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for evaluating LucentisTM (a recombinant humanized anti-human Vascular&#xD;
      Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody (Fab) in patients with neovascular (wet)&#xD;
      Age related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is based on the strong correlation between VEGF levels&#xD;
      in aqueous and vitreous humor and active blood vessel formation. LucentisTM has been shown to&#xD;
      maintain or improve vision in wet AMD. Since the treatments do not halt the loss of visual&#xD;
      acuity in wet AMD, it is important to accurately measure anatomic response to treatments&#xD;
      thereby enhancing the ability to understand patterns of response and predict the necessity&#xD;
      for continued therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the&#xD;

          -  Subfoveal choroidal neovascularization, secondary to age related macular degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any subretinal hemorrhage must comprise no more than 50% of total lesion size.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clear ocular media and adequate papillary dilation to permit good quality stereoscopic&#xD;
             fundus photography&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men must use barrier contraception or abstinence throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had ocular surgery within the past 60 days in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had previous refractive eye surgery (RK, PRK, LASIK, ALK, etc.) within the past 3&#xD;
             months for the study eye.&#xD;
