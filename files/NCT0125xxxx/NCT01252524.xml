    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a form of fiber if effective in improving&#xD;
      the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Measurements of other possible medical benefits will&#xD;
      include blood pressure, cholesterol, weight, and the number/dosage of medications used for&#xD;
      diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There have been several publications in the medical literature linking the use of various&#xD;
      types of fiber and the beneficial effects on lipid panel, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c,&#xD;
      weight, blood pressure, and cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      or those at risk for diabetes1-5. Most of these studies utilize fiber sources from dietary&#xD;
      food intake or psyllium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, diet modification and psyllium intake are difficult for patients to comply on daily&#xD;
      basis and many patients do not continue to follow through on these interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polycarbophil is a bulk forming agent which is used for similar indications as psyllium for&#xD;
      the treatment of constipation and irritable bowel syndrome. Because polycarbophil comes in&#xD;
      oral tablets and capsules, patients may adhere to regular intake better compared to psyllium.&#xD;
      However, it is unknown whether polycarbophil has similar beneficial properties compared to&#xD;
      psyllium and other fiber types. Taking polycarbophil prior to each meal may improve diabetes&#xD;
      control by allowing patients to have smaller meals and decrease the absorption rate of&#xD;
      carbohydrates in the intestine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to determine whether taking calcium polycarbophil (also known as&#xD;
      over-the-counter FiberconTM) regularly will improve the diabetes control. The proposed study&#xD;
      will be a randomized, controlled, and double-blinded trial involving adult patients with type&#xD;
      2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 50 patients will be randomized to receive either calcium&#xD;
      polycarbophil or placebo from the Family Medicine Center at East Carolina University and&#xD;
      followed over 6 months. The primary outcome of the trial will be glycosylated hemoglobin A1c.&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will include weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol level.&#xD;
      Additional secondary outcome measures are the number and dosages of medications for diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential benefits of this study include improved control of diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, reflected by the improved outcomes mentioned above. Because&#xD;
      calcium polycarbophil (FiberconTM) is a commonly used over-the-counter fiber product for&#xD;
      constipation, and the dosage used in this study is well within the typical use recommended by&#xD;
      the manufacturers, the potential adverse effects of this product is thought to be identical&#xD;
      to that described for FiberconTM. Patients will receive their usual medical care by their own&#xD;
      primary physicians regardless of their participation in this study. After the randomization&#xD;
      to the intervention or the control group, the study team will only monitor the outcome&#xD;
      measures and will not alter the medical care that the patients receive.&#xD;

      Study title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effects of calcium polycarbophil on type II diabetes mellitus control: a randomized&#xD;
      double-blinded study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      East Carolina University Family Medicine Center (ECU FMC) outpatient clinic patients Age&#xD;
      above 18 Diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus (DM) for at least 24 months. At least 4&#xD;
      office visits within the past 24 months for DM follow up at ECU FMC or Geriatrics Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hgb A1c within the past six months of 8% to 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dementia diagnosis or other psychiatric diagnoses that preclude the patient from being able&#xD;
      to consent for this study by him/herself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Already taking fiber supplementation (polycarbophil, psyllium, methylcellulose) Severe&#xD;
      problems with previous use of fiber supplementation (i.e. fecal impaction) Dysphagia or other&#xD;
      swallowing disorders (unable to swallow pills or 8 oz of water) Pregnancy during the study&#xD;
      period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be obtained from the patients for the study and HIPAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomize 50 patients to intervention or placebo:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: 25 patients to receive calcium polycarbophil 625mg po TID before each meal with&#xD;
      8 oz glass of water for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo control: 25 patients to receive placebo po TID before each meal with 8 oz glass of&#xD;
      water for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total of 50 participants projected from the following power calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming a difference between groups in HbA1c of 0.5%, a standard deviation of 0.5, a power&#xD;
      of 80% and an alpha of 0.05, an estimated 18 patients in each group (n = 36 pts) will be&#xD;
      needed to detect a difference. Assuming a 25% dropout rate, the goal of 25 patients in each&#xD;
      group (n=50 pts) will be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, primary physicians, and the researchers will be blinded to therapy versus placebo.&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed by the ECU FM pharmacist who will open a sealed envelope&#xD;
      which will indicate whether the patient will receive the interventional medication or&#xD;
      placebo. The tablets will be dispensed by the pharmacist without informing the patient,&#xD;
      physicians, or research team member as to which group the patient was randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient will continue with their usual DM care. The patients must follow up at 3 months&#xD;
      and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research team member will perform telephone follow up at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months for&#xD;
      adverse events and compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes will be analyzed by intention to treat analysis and analysis using patients who&#xD;
      are compliant with the trial protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HgbA1c at the time of enrollment, 3 months, and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be gathered at the time of enrollment, 3 months, and 6 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight Blood Pressure Number and dosage of medications for diabetes, hypertension, and&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia Serum LDL, HDL, triglycerides, total cholesterol Patient compliance with the&#xD;
      study medication Adverse events including GI discomfort, constipation, excessive flatulence,&#xD;
      fecal impaction, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, hypoglycemia, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential adverse events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side effects of Polycarbophil (MicroMedex 2.0): Abdominal fullness, flatus, vomiting, stomach&#xD;
      cramps. Systemic adverse effects are not expected since calcium polycarbophil is not absorbed&#xD;
