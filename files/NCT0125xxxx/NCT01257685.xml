  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has not been fully elucidated. The most&#xD;
      widely supported theory implicates insulin resistance as the key mechanism leading to hepatic&#xD;
      steatosis, and perhaps also to steatohepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selenoprotein P(SeP) is a secretory protein primarily produced by the liver. Previous studies&#xD;
      demonstrated that SeP, a liver-derived secretory protein, causes insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the different Sep levels between healthy&#xD;
      normal group and NAFLD group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a disease spectrum that includes simple steatosis,&#xD;
      nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis, has been increasingly recognized as the&#xD;
      hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Both inflammation and insulin resistance are&#xD;
      considered to be pivotal pathogenic mechanisms of NAFLD, as well as metabolic syndrome, type&#xD;
      2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis. There is mounting evidence implicating adipokines secreted&#xD;
      from adipose tissue in the pathogenesis and progression of NAFLD, in addition to the&#xD;
      development of insulin resistance and inflammation. Selenoprotein P (SeP) has recently been&#xD;
      reported as a novel hepatokine that regulates insulin resistance and systemic energy&#xD;
      metabolism in rodents and humans. Although previous studies have shown a close relationship&#xD;
      among insulin resistance, inflammation, and NAFLD, as far as we know, there is no previous&#xD;
      report evaluating the association between SeP and NAFLD. In the present study, we examined&#xD;
      serum SeP levels in subjects with increased visceral fat area (VFA) or liver fat accumulation&#xD;
      measured with computed tomography (CT). We evaluated the relationship between SeP levels and&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk factors.&#xD;
