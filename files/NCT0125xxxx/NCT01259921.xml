  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether neurofeedback (NF) training can&#xD;
      significantly reduce the symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in individuals with&#xD;
      significant affect dysregulation and chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD. The primary aims of&#xD;
      this study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine whether NF has the potential to significantly reduce symptoms of PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine whether NF training can specifically target the area of affect regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine the mechanism of NF through elucidating the relationship between affect&#xD;
           regulation and PTSD symptom change.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deficits in affect regulation are associated with a high rate of treatment failure to&#xD;
      well-established evidence-based treatments for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and&#xD;
      deficits in this domain are most frequently found in individuals with chronic&#xD;
      treatment-resistant PTSD. Aside from one psychological treatment intervention for adult&#xD;
      female survivors of child sexual abuse, no published study has targeted improving affect&#xD;
      regulation in treatment refractory PTSD. The aim of this study is to test and refine EEG&#xD;
      neurofeedback (NF) as an effective treatment for PTSD associated with high levels of affect&#xD;
      dysregulation. We believe improved affect regulation will lead to an overall improvement in&#xD;
      functioning by addressing deficits in executive functioning in PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim: The primary goal of the research is to refine and evaluate NF training for&#xD;
      adults with treatment-resistant PTSD, specifically targeting the domain of affect regulation.&#xD;
      We will evaluate the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Will NF decrease chronic PTSD symptoms in a treatment-resistant sample of adults with&#xD;
           childhood onset PTSD, as measured with the CAPS and the DTS? Hypothesis 1: Subjects in&#xD;
           the active treatment condition will show significantly greater decreases on the CAPS and&#xD;
           DTS than subjects in the placebo condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Will NF improve affect regulation, as measured by the IASC? Hypothesis 2: Subjects in&#xD;
           the active treatment condition will show significantly greater improvement on the affect&#xD;
           dysregulation subscale of the IASC than individuals in the placebo condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Will affect regulation, as measured by the IASC, mediate the relationship of NF training&#xD;
           and PTSD, as measured with the DTS? Hypothesis 3: The affect dysregulation subscale of&#xD;
           the IASC will significantly mediate the relationship between NF and DTS scores while DTS&#xD;
           scores will not significantly mediate affect dysregulation.&#xD;

    <description>The CAPS is considered the gold standard for the assessment of PTSD (National Center for PTSD Research). It is a clinician administered 30-item interview that corresponds to DSM-IV criteria for PTSD. Each item of the CAPS has two parts, frequency and intensity, which are both scored on a 5-point scale from 0 to 4. A general cut-off rule of frequency greater than or equal to 1 and intensity greater than or equal to 2 for a symptom to count towards diagnosis will be employed in assigning PTSD diagnosis.</description>

    <time_frame>Participants are assessed at baseline (prior to beginning training), every 4 weeks (corresponding to 8 sessions of training), post-treatment (corresponding to 20 weeks), and at follow-up (1 year post treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a well validated self-report measure of PTSD with clinical reference norms for adults.</description>

    <description>The IASC is a 63-item standardized measure of disturbed functioning in relation to self and others. The IASC measures seven domains of functioning: Interpersonal Conflicts, Idealization-Disillusionment, Abandonment Concerns, Identity Impairment, Susceptibility to Influence, Affect Dysregulation, and Tension Reduction Activities.</description>
