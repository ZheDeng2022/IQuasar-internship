  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori infection of the gastric epithelium is the most common bacterial&#xD;
      infection worldwide. Its global prevalence is estimated at 50%, though the burden falls&#xD;
      disproportionately on the developing world, where the prevalence in some areas is 80%. H.&#xD;
      pylori infection is generally acquired during childhood, and without specific antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment can persist for life. The infection is generally clinically asymptomatic during&#xD;
      childhood, and even in adulthood 80-90% of infected individuals will remain asymptomatic&#xD;
      (although they may transmit the bacteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SQ109 is a new, small molecule antibiotic with characteristics that make it particularly&#xD;
      attractive to evaluate against H. pylori. In brief, SQ109 is orally bioavailable,&#xD;
      acid-stable, has in vitro activity against H. pylori and achieves high intracellular&#xD;
      concentration (which may be important to effect bacterial eradication).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the antimicrobial activity and clinical safety, SQ109 will be evaluated in this&#xD;
      clinical trial to assess safety and antimicrobial activity in adults infected with H. pylori.&#xD;
      Data from this study will help determine whether larger safety and efficacy studies in&#xD;
      individuals with H. pylori-associated duodenal ulcer disease are warranted.&#xD;

      A total of 30 Urea Breath Test (UBT)-Positive volunteers will be enrolled. Each subject will&#xD;
      receive SQ109 150 mg bid with PPI or 300 mg qd by mouth daily for 14 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subject must be 18 to 45 years of age (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subject must have 2 positive Urea Breath Tests (UBT) obtaining during screening, and no&#xD;
           other clinically significant disease (i.e., hematology, clinical chemistry and&#xD;
           urinalysis tests must be within study-defined ranges. Clinical tests must be performed&#xD;
           within 14 days of receiving first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Body Mass Index (BMI) must be between 18 and 33 kg/m2 inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Subject must be able to give voluntary written informed consent before any study related&#xD;
           procedure is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the safety and tolerability of SQ109 administered daily for 14 consecutive&#xD;
           days in male and female Urea Breath Test (UBT)-positive subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess antimicrobial activity against H. pylori of SQ109 administered daily for 14&#xD;
           days in UBT-positive subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Each subject will undergo screening evaluations within 14 days of study entry (Day 1)&#xD;
      and baseline evaluations Day -14 and Day -2 to Day 1 (up to 14 days prior to the first dose).&#xD;
      On Day 1 (first day of dosing), the subject will be administered study drug and undergo the&#xD;
      Day 1 procedures. Throughout the 14 days of treatment phase of the study each subject will be&#xD;
      assessed daily for adverse events (AEs). Laboratory safety evaluations will be performed on&#xD;
      Day 7, 8, 9, or 10, and on Day 14, and Day 21. On Days 1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 each&#xD;
      subject will have a UBT. On Follow-up Days 21 and 28 each subject will return to the study&#xD;
      unit to have safety assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by a review of physical examinations, neurological&#xD;
      examinations, vital signs assessments, 12-lead ECGs, routine clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
      (including chemistry and hematology data), and AE assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Outcome Measures consist of serial UBT assessments for evidence of H. pylori in the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract collected at baseline, during the 14 days of SQ109 administration, and&#xD;
      during the 14 day follow-up period.&#xD;
