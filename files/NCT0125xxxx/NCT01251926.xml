      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The anticancer drug bevacizumab works by reducing the formation of new blood vessels in&#xD;
      tumors, which can slow or stop the growth of cancer cells and supporting blood vessels. The&#xD;
      experimental drug EZN-2208 works by limiting how well cancer cells can divide. Drugs similar&#xD;
      to EZN-2208 also work by turning off the production of the HIF protein, which otherwise can&#xD;
      help cancer cells to grow even when blood supply is limited. Researchers are interested in&#xD;
      determining if EZN-2208 turns off HIF in patient tumors, and whether combining it with&#xD;
      bevacizumab is an effective treatment for cancers that have not responded to standard&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To assess the safety and effectiveness of the combination of EZN-2208 and bevacizumab for&#xD;
      solid tumors that have not responded to standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have solid tumors that have not responded to&#xD;
      standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a full physical examination and medical history,&#xD;
           blood and urine samples, and tumor imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive EZN-2208 and bevacizumab intravenously on an outpatient basis&#xD;
           in 4-week cycles (with the exception of the first cycle, which will be 5 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cycle 1: Participants will receive EZN-2208 once a week for 3 weeks in a row (days 1, 8,&#xD;
           and 15), followed by 1 week without the drug. Participants will receive bevacizumab 1&#xD;
           week before EZN-2208 (day - 7) and then 3 weeks later (day 15).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subsequent cycles: Participants will receive EZN-2208 once a week for 3 weeks in a row&#xD;
           (days 1, 8, and 15), followed by 1 week without the drug. Participants will receive&#xD;
           bevacizumab every 2 weeks (days 1 and 15).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have clinic visits with physical examinations and blood tests in the&#xD;
           first 3 weeks of each cycle. Clinic visits may also include tumor imaging studies and&#xD;
           tumor biopsies as directed by the study researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will continue to take the study drugs for as long as the tumor shrinks or&#xD;
           does not grow, and as long as they do not experience intolerable or unsafe side effects&#xD;
           from the drugs.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      One reason postulated for the limited efficacy of anti-angiogenic or anti-VEGF agents such as&#xD;
      bevacizumab is that they cause intra-tumoral hypoxia, resulting in the induction and&#xD;
      up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) such as HIF-1Alpha. These in turn play a&#xD;
      central role in tumor progression by acting as master regulators of how cancer cells adapt to&#xD;
      hypoxic conditions. HIF-1Alpha therefore represents an attractive target in oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Camptothecin analogues (including SN-38, topotecan, and irinotecan) have been shown to&#xD;
      consistently reduce the translation, expression, and transcriptional activity of HIF-1Alpha&#xD;
      in vitro and in vivo, and therefore have the potential to inhibit the HIF-1? induction that&#xD;
      occurs with anti-angiogenic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central rationale of this study is that HIF-1alpha induction by bevacizumab will be&#xD;
      offset by weekly administration of EZN-2208 (PEGylated SN-38), and that this will result in&#xD;
      synergistic anti-tumor effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the modulation of HIF-1alpha protein (by ELISA) in solid tumors after treatment&#xD;
      with EZN-2208 and bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of EZN-2208 and bevacizumab with&#xD;
      EZN-2208 administered weekly times 3 (Days 1, 8, and 15) and bevacizumab administered every 2&#xD;
      weeks in 28-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perform correlative studies to assess changes in angiogenesis in tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate antitumor responses as determined by RECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults with histologically documented solid tumors, whose disease has progressed following&#xD;
      standard therapy or who have no acceptable standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performance status ECOG 0-2; adequate organ function; life expectancy at least 3 months; no&#xD;
      major surgery, radiation or chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to study enrollment; recovered&#xD;
      from toxicities of prior therapies to at least eligibility levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Willingness to undergo tumor biopsies for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-arm pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive EZN-2208 IV on Day 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle at a dose of 9&#xD;
      mg/m(2); bevacizumab will be administered IV every 2 weeks at a dose of 5 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cycle 1: Bevacizumab will be administered on Day -7 (i.e., 1 week prior to EZN-2208) and&#xD;
      Day 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subsequent cycles: Bevacizumab will be administered on Day 1 and 15.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have histologically confirmed (by the Laboratory of Pathology, NCI) solid&#xD;
        tumors that are metastatic or unresectable and for which standard therapies do not exist or&#xD;
        are no longer effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        There are no restrictions on prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age greater than or equal to18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently&#xD;
        available on the use of EZN-2208 in combination with bevacizumab in patients less than 18&#xD;
        years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future&#xD;
        pediatric Phase I combination trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to 60%&#xD;
&#xD;
        Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        leukocytes greater than or equal to 3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
        absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
        platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
        total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
        AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
        creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for patients with&#xD;
        creatinine levels above institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The effects of EZN-2208 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and&#xD;
        because bevacizumab is known to be teratogenic, women of childbearing potential and men&#xD;
        must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
        abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 3 months&#xD;
        after completion of study. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
        participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Disease amenable to biopsy, and willingness to undergo biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas&#xD;
        or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse&#xD;
        events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. Patients must be (Bullet) 2&#xD;
        weeks since receiving study drug as a participant in a Phase 0 study (also referred to as&#xD;
        an early Phase I study where a subtherapeutic dose of drug is administered).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a diagnosis of colorectal cancer, who have previously failed treatment with a&#xD;
        topoisomerase I inhibitor. Patients with all other types of malignancies will be considered&#xD;
        for eligibility regardless of prior exposure to topoisomerase 1 inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
        composition to EZN-2208 or bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, clinically significant&#xD;
        cardiovascular disease as defined below, or psychiatric illness/social situations that&#xD;
        would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women are excluded from this study because bevacizumab is an antiangiogenic agent&#xD;
        with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown&#xD;
        but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
        mother with EZN-2208, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
        EZN-2208.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the&#xD;
        potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with EZN-2208. In addition, these patients are&#xD;
        at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrowsuppressive therapy.&#xD;
        Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral&#xD;
        therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Urine protein should be screened by urine analysis. If protein is 2+ or higher, 24-hour&#xD;
        urine protein should be obtained and the level should be &lt;1000 mg for patient enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Serious or non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture. History of abdominal fistula,&#xD;
        gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess within the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Invasive procedures defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within the past&#xD;
             28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anticipation of need for major surgical procedures during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm, requiring surgical repair or recent&#xD;
        peripheral arterial thrombosis) within the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Known CNS disease except for treated brain metastasis. Treated brain metastases are defined&#xD;
        as having no ongoing requirement for steroids and no evidence of progression or hemorrhage&#xD;
        after treatment for at least 3 months, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain&#xD;
        imaging (MRI or CT). Patients receiving EIAED anticonvulsants will not be eligible to&#xD;
        participate (Appendix B). Patients on non-EIAED may be enrolled at the discretion of the&#xD;
        PI. Treatment for brain metastases may include whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT),&#xD;
        radiosurgery (RS; Gamma Knife, LINAC, or equivalent), or a combination as deemed&#xD;
        appropriate by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inadequately controlled hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mm Hg and/or&#xD;
             diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mm Hg despite antihypertensive medication)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of stroke/cerebrovascular accident within 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  New York Heart Association grade II or greater congestive heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious and inadequately controlled cardiac arrhythmia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm, history of aortic dissection)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy. Patients on therapeutic anticoagulation&#xD;
        will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or other&#xD;
        recombinant human antibodies.&#xD;
