      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations have been linked to a higher risk of developing breast&#xD;
      cancer and other cancers, and may be associated with types of breast cancer that are more&#xD;
      difficult to treat and more likely to recur. New cancer treatments are being developed&#xD;
      specifically to treat individuals who have these gene mutations. However, more information is&#xD;
      needed about the prevalence of these mutations in minority populations, including&#xD;
      Hispanic/Latino populations. To study these populations, researchers are interested in&#xD;
      collecting genetic material (DNA) and medical history information from Hispanic/Latino women&#xD;
      who have been diagnosed with breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect saliva samples and medical and family history information from Hispanic/Latino&#xD;
      women with breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Hispanic/Latino women at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete a questionnaire with information about place of birth,&#xD;
           languages spoken by parents and grandparents, and information about their breast cancer&#xD;
           diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide a saliva sample (2 to 3 tablespoons) for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this protocol.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes predispose to breast and ovarian cancer, and are&#xD;
           increasingly recognized in prostate and pancreatic cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Basal/ Triple negative breast cancer is associated with BRCA mutations in some&#xD;
           ethnicities.However the link between BRCA gene mutations and Basil/ triple negative&#xD;
           disease in Hispanic/ Latino women is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Common recurrent mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 exist in Hispanic/ Latino communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  New therapies such as PARP inhibitors may be particularly effective in BRCA mutation&#xD;
           carriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Therefore a unique opportunity exists to identify women in this underserved minority&#xD;
           that may be eligible for and benefit from new targeted therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The primary objective is to collect saliva samples and histology data from up to 2000&#xD;
      Hispanic/ Latino subjects with breast cancer as a source of DNA, and to analyze the BRCA1 and&#xD;
      BRCA2 genes..&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - All Hispanics females, over the age of 18, with breast cancer will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Natural history study of 2000 Hispanic/Latino women with breast cancer, 1000 with triple&#xD;
&#xD;
      negative disease, 1000 without.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain clinical pathology reports and relevant history data on all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyze recurrent BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations&#xD;
