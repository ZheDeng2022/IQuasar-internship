    <textblock>
      Both Billroth II and Roux en Y are acceptable techniques of reconstruction after subtotal&#xD;
      gastrectomy, however the debate one which is better remains unanswered. The aim of this study&#xD;
      is to compare Billroth II and Roux en Y reconstruction techniques after radical distal&#xD;
      subtotal gastrectomy for gastric cancer in terms of postoperative outcomes and quality of&#xD;
      life. The investigators hypothesize that Roux en Y will have lesser gastrointestinal symptoms&#xD;
      and reflux problems when compared to Billroth II reconstruction. Patients with resectable&#xD;
      gastric cancer meeting the inclusion criteria will be consented and enrolled. Data on&#xD;
      demographics, nutrition, gastrointestinal symptoms, and quality of life will be collected.&#xD;
      They will be randomized after completion of distal subtotal gastrectomy to under go either&#xD;
      Roux en Y or Billroth II reconstruction. Surgery data will be collected post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6 months follow up a repeat nutritional assessment using clinical and biochemical&#xD;
      parameters will be carried out. The biochemical markers are part of routine follow up. The&#xD;
      final assessment will be at the one year post surgery visit when by interview using EORTC 30&#xD;
      questionnaire quality of life data, gastrointestinal symptoms and nutritional assessment and&#xD;
      surgery data for recurrence will be repeated. At one year patients will also have upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal endoscopy, which is part of routine follow up. At endoscopy stump gastritis&#xD;
      will be graded and esophageal reflux assessed as per Los Angeles classification. It is&#xD;
      postulated that 5% of the patients on Roux en Y reconstruction will experience poor clinical&#xD;
      symptoms compared to 25% of those on Billroth II based on reflux symptoms. To achieve a&#xD;
      statistical significance with 95% power and a 2-sided test of 5% for this 20% clinical&#xD;
      difference, 80 subjects for each arm will be required. Factoring a 10% attrition rate for&#xD;
      mortality and lost to follow up, a total of 160 subjects to be randomized equally will be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subtotal distal gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy offers the best chance of cure either alone&#xD;
      or in conjunction with other modalities for patients with operable distal gastric cancer.&#xD;
      After a subtotal gastrectomy the gastrointestinal continuity can be restored by various&#xD;
      techniques. Billroth I, Billroth II and Roux-en-Y reconstruction are all acceptable procedure&#xD;
      with each having its merits and demerits. The choice of reconstructive procedure varies&#xD;
      depending on individual Surgeons preference and institutional practice. There is geographical&#xD;
      difference in practice with majority of surgeons in the east favoring Billroth I, while in&#xD;
      the west; Roux-en-Y is more commonly employed (1). Billroth I vs Roux-en-Y reconstruction has&#xD;
      been extensively studied with a prospective series by Sounya Nunobe et al that reported&#xD;
      superior symptomatic and functional outcomes of Roux-en-Y procedure (2). However a randomised&#xD;
      trial by Makoto Ishikawa et al found limited advantages of Roux-en-Y over Billroth I&#xD;
      reconstruction (3). In this study Roux-en-Y had fewer problems related to reflux of bile but&#xD;
      a higher incidence of stasis in the Roux limb resulting in longer hospital stay. Another&#xD;
      reason that some surgeon avoids doing Roux-en-Y is a triad of post operative symptoms&#xD;
      including abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea called Roux-en-Y loop syndrome (4,5). Billroth&#xD;
      II reconstruction in comparison to Roux-en-Y is a simpler operation with only one anastomosis&#xD;
      and faster operating time (6). This has implications while managing gastric cancer patients&#xD;
      who may be malnourished and a simpler procedure may have lesser risk of complications and&#xD;
      yield better outcomes. Billroth II has been criticized for increased reflux associated&#xD;
      problem like esophagitis and gastritis, also noteworthy are risk of afferent loop and dumping&#xD;
      syndrome. Long term nutritional outcomes are similar for both procedures (7).&#xD;
