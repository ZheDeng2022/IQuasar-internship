  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II clinical trial studies how well Akt inhibitor MK2206 works in treating patients&#xD;
      with relapsed lymphoma. Akt inhibitor MK2206 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the objective response rate (ORR) of MK-2206 (Akt inhibitor MK2206) in patients&#xD;
      with relapsed/refractory lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the progression free survival (PFS) of MK-2206 in patients with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess the safety and tolerability of MK-2206 monotherapy. III. Examine pretreatment&#xD;
      phosphorylated v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (pAkt) protein expression by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry, and correlate the results with treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Examine the effect of therapy on serum cytokines and chemokines that regulate the&#xD;
      tumor-promoting inflammatory process and/or immunity in patients with relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      lymphoma, and correlate the results with treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) once weekly. Treatment repeats every 28&#xD;
      days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;
