  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myocardial infarction (MI) causes loss of myocytes and may lead to loss of ventricular&#xD;
      function, morbidity and mortality. The most effective therapy is early reperfusion of the&#xD;
      ischemic myocardium by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Reperfusion limits&#xD;
      myocardial ischaemic necrosis, but also induces inflammation, oxidative stress and calcium&#xD;
      overload: a process referred to as reperfusion injury leading to necrosis and apotosis.&#xD;
      Glucagon Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone that has shown to activate&#xD;
      anti-apoptotic enzymes, reducing reperfusion injury. GLP-1 agonists have been demonstrated to&#xD;
      be cardioprotective in several animal studies and in a single small non-randomized clinical&#xD;
      study. In this pilot study we will assess the safety and efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonist&#xD;
      Exenatide infusion compared to placebo in patients with an acute myocardial infarction&#xD;
      undergoing primary PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 40 patients will be included in this single centre prospective randomised placebo&#xD;
      controlled two-arm pilot study. Patients who are to undergo a primary PCI for a first acute&#xD;
      ST elevation myocardial infarction are randomly assigned to placebo or Exenatide 5ug bolus in&#xD;
      30 minutes, followed by a continuous Exenatide infusion of 20ug/ 24 hours for 72 hours. Blood&#xD;
      samples are obtained for assessment of enzymatic infarct size and Exenatide levels. Side&#xD;
      effects of Exenatide are stringently monitored. Cardiac function will be measured using&#xD;
      Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMRI) and 3D echocardiography at 1 week and 4 months post&#xD;
      MI. Infarct size will be assessed by means of the final infarct size at 4 months post MI as a&#xD;
      percentage of the area at risk at 1 week post MI. Furthermore we will compare the RNA profile&#xD;
      of both groups.&#xD;

    <description>On arrival to our cardiac care unit (CCU) and after informed consent patients will be randomized to Exenatide infusion or Placebo infusion. Patients in the Exenatide group will immediately be treated be with Exenatide iv, 5ug bolus in 30 minutes, followed by a continuous Exenatide infusion of 20ug/ 24 hours.&#xD;
Exenatide preparation: Byetta injection pens containing 1,2 ml (concentration 0,25 mg/ml; 60 doses of 5 μg) will be obtained. 3 doses (15 μg) will be diluted in 49 ml saline and 1 ml Human Serum Albumen (Cealb 200g/L, 10ml) to get a total of 50 ml containing 15 μg exenatide (or 300 ng exenatide / ml). A 50cc syringe will be placed in a pump system that is connected with a cannula in the patient's vein. The infusionrate will be 33,3 ml/hr for the first 30 minutes, followed by an infusion rate of 2,8 ml/hr for 72 hours. New 50cc syringes will be made every 8 hours.</description>
