  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Recent research has shown that causing an immune response to tumor cells may help slow or&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumors. One treatment that has come from this research involves collecting&#xD;
      and modifying a cancer patient's tumor cells in the laboratory, then returning the cells to&#xD;
      the patient as a vaccine to encourage the immune system to respond to them. Researchers are&#xD;
      interested in testing tumor cell vaccines with an experimental drug called ISCOMATRIX , which&#xD;
      can be added to a vaccine in order to elicit a stronger immune response in the body.&#xD;
      ISCOMATRIX has not been approved for sale and use in any country and its use is still&#xD;
      experimental, though it has been tested and used safely in other clinical studies.&#xD;
      Researchers are also interested in determining whether the anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib&#xD;
      will improve the body's immune reaction if given with the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To assess the safety and effectiveness of tumor cell vaccines given with ISCOMATRIX and&#xD;
      celecoxib in the treatment of lung and esophagus cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have primary small cell or non-small cell lung&#xD;
           cancer, esophageal cancer, or pleural mesothelioma that can be removed by surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Only individuals whose tumor cells are able to produce a tumor cell line for vaccine&#xD;
           development will be eligible for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, and will&#xD;
           have tumor tissue collected during their surgery to determine whether the tumor cells&#xD;
           can be used to produce a vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take celecoxib twice daily for 7 days before having the first tumor&#xD;
           cell vaccination. Participants will also have leukapheresis to collect blood cells for&#xD;
           testing before the first vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive one vaccine (which may be given in two shots) monthly for 6&#xD;
           months, and will continue to take celecoxib twice daily. One month after the 6th vaccine&#xD;
           shot, participants will have another leukapheresis and skin test. If these tests show&#xD;
           that a participant is responding to the vaccine, additional vaccines will be given every&#xD;
           3 months for up to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a physical exam and lab tests before each vaccination, blood&#xD;
           samples and imaging studies every 3 months, and a skin test every 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have regular followup visits with imaging studies and blood samples&#xD;
           for up to 5 years after the first vaccination, or until a new tumor develops.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cancer-testis (CT) antigens have emerged as attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy.&#xD;
           Whereas lung and esophageal cancers, thymic Neoplasms, primary thoracic sarcomas, as&#xD;
           well as malignant pleural mesotheliomas express a variety of CT antigens, primary or&#xD;
           vaccine-induced immune responses to these antigens appear uncommon in patients with&#xD;
           these malignancies, possibly due to low-level, heterogeneous antigen expression, and&#xD;
           inadequate vaccination strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Because numerous CT antigens can be induced in tumor cells by DNA demethylating agents&#xD;
           and HDAC inhibitors, it is conceivable that vaccination of cancer patients with&#xD;
           autologous tumor cells exposed to chromatin remodeling agents will enhance anti-tumor&#xD;
           immunity in these individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In order to examine this issue, patients with resectable primary neoplasms involving the&#xD;
           lungs, esophagus, or pleura will be vaccinated with autologous tumor cells exposed&#xD;
           exvivo to decitabine and radiation following completion of appropriate combined modality&#xD;
           therapy. Vaccine will be administered in conjunction with ISCOMATRIX adjuvant and oral&#xD;
           celecoxib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To assess the safety of an epigenetically modified autologous tumor cell vaccine in&#xD;
      conjunction with celecoxib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with histologically or cytologically proven or clinically evident primary&#xD;
           pulmonary carcinoma or sarcoma, esophageal cancer, thymic carcinoma or malignant pleural&#xD;
           mesothelioma undergoing resection of their neoplasms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be 18 years or older with an ECOG performance status of 0 2, with adequate&#xD;
           pulmonary and cardiac function and laboratory values within normal limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with operable lung and esophageal carcinoma/sarcoma, thymoma, thymic carcinoma&#xD;
           or malignant pleural mesothelioma will undergo resection of their malignancies at the&#xD;
           NCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Portions of the resected tumors will be transferred to the Thoracic Oncology Laboratory&#xD;
           and cells will be processed to establish a cancer cell line.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following recovery from surgery and appropriate adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation,&#xD;
           patients will be vaccinated with epigenetically-modified autologous tumor cells&#xD;
           periodically over 6 months in conjunction with oral celecoxib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systemic toxicities and delayed type hypersensitivity responses to autologous tumor&#xD;
           cells and serologic responses to a variety of CT antigens will be assessed before and&#xD;
           after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be followed with routine staging scans until disease recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As the exact set of comparisons and analyses to be performed will be determined&#xD;
           following completion of the trial, and will be based on limited numbers of patients, the&#xD;
           analyses will be considered exploratory and hypothesis generating rather than&#xD;
           definitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 120 patients will be accrued to this trial in order to obtain up to 30&#xD;
           evaluable patients.&#xD;
