  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study of an investigational agent, brivanib, in patients with refractory&#xD;
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      brivanib in renal cell carcinoma, and explore the activity of this drug in this population to&#xD;
      determine whether imaging and molecular features of the tumors can be used to predict&#xD;
      response. Approximately 30 people with advanced kidney cancer will be enrolled on this study&#xD;
      at the University of Pennsylvania.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to determine the efficacy of brivanib in the&#xD;
      treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) in&#xD;
      patients who have progressed on treatment with sunitinib, sorafenib, bevacizumab, or&#xD;
      pazopanib. The primary endpoint of the trial will be PFS at 16 weeks. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to further examine the safety and tolerability profile of brivanib, to examine&#xD;
      the efficacy of brivanib in this population in terms of best overall response, response rate,&#xD;
      progression-free survival, and overall survival, to describe baseline and changes in I-cG250&#xD;
      PET/CT in relation to observed therapeutic effects, to describe novel baseline histologic&#xD;
      features of these tumors in relation to observed therapeutic effects. Modalities will include&#xD;
      Von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 gene (HIF-1) expression&#xD;
      assessment and a novel histo-cytometric assessment of the tumor microenvironment in terms of&#xD;
      p-STAT3, p-ERK, Ki67, VEGFR2, FGFR1 expression, to describe changes in circulating collagen&#xD;
      IV on brivanib in relation to therapeutic effects, to explore the relationship between single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphisms in angiogenesis-related genes and the activity of brivanib in the&#xD;
      treatment of these patients.&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    In November 2012, this study was permanently closed to new accrual at the request of the drug&#xD;
    manufacturer (BMS), who decided not to pursue additional research activity in this patient&#xD;
    population.&#xD;
