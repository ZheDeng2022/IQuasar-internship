      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether topical ophthalmic anesthetics&#xD;
      lower the intraocular pressure in the eye.&#xD;

      Each day almost all patients in an ophthalmology clinic get their intraocular pressure of&#xD;
      each eye measured. This measurement is used to make important decisions regarding risk of&#xD;
      dilation and also is essential in the management of glaucoma patients, as intraocular&#xD;
      pressure (IOP) remains one of the only modifiable factors in glaucoma. The intraocular&#xD;
      pressure is also measured in an eye that has undergone an operative procedure where pressures&#xD;
      can increase to dangerous levels signaling the need for immediate intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most ophthalmology clinics the intraocular pressure is measured via Goldmann applanation&#xD;
      tonometry, which is considered the standard method of measurement. The Goldmann tonometer is&#xD;
      a device that uses an applanation prism to flatten a small portion of the cornea to measure&#xD;
      the eye. The pressure within the eye is determined by how much force is needed to flatten the&#xD;
      cornea. In order to perform the test the subject receives a topical anesthetic and&#xD;
      fluorescein sodium dye on the surface of the eye. The intraocular pressure is all frequently&#xD;
      measured in ophthalmology by pneumatonometry and the Tonopen. These two additional methods of&#xD;
      contact tonometry measure the amount of force needed to displace the cornea and then&#xD;
      calculate the intraocular pressure1. Both require instillation of topical anesthetic eye&#xD;
      drops prior to measuring the pressure, cut these latter two methods require no dye. The&#xD;
      principal anesthetics used in the United States are proparacaine or benoxinate. For Goldmann&#xD;
      applanation, these anesthetics must be combined with a fluorescein dye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both proparacaine and benoxinate are esters of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) that are used&#xD;
      for topical ophthalmic anesthesia. Both have onset of action in approximately 10-20 seconds&#xD;
      and both duration of action of 10-20 minutes. They provide sufficient anesthesia to permit&#xD;
      minor procedures involving the superficial cornea and conjunctiva. Proparacaine is commonly&#xD;
      used alone, but can be purchased pre-mixed with fluorescein dye, whereas, benoxinate is only&#xD;
      available in combination with fluorescein dye1. Fluorescein sodium is a yellow acid dye from&#xD;
      the xanthenes family that absorbs light of the 493 nanometer wavelength (blue) and then emits&#xD;
      or fluoresces light of 520 nanometer wavelength (yellow-green). This dye is ubiquitous in&#xD;
      ophthalmologic practices as it is used both intravenously and topically to assist in making&#xD;
      ophthalmologic diagnoses1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For contact tonometry, one of these topical anesthetics is traditionally instilled in each&#xD;
      eye and the intraocular pressure is then measured. This is typically done by a technician&#xD;
      first, and if there is any question regarding the measurement it is repeated again by the&#xD;
      physician seeing the patient. In academic institutions the intraocular pressure may also be&#xD;
      routinely checked additional times by the resident. For certain patients suspected of having&#xD;
      glaucoma the intraocular pressure variation throughout the day is monitored in what is called&#xD;
      a diurnal curve measurement. With this test, the intraocular pressure may be checked upwards&#xD;
      of ten (10) times in a single day (each measurement with an additional instillation of&#xD;
      topical anesthetic). All of these examinations are done with minimal danger and with little&#xD;
      discomfort for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this standard protocol for measurement of the intraocular pressure, it has been&#xD;
      suggested that the very anesthetic agents we use to measure the pressure may actually cause&#xD;
      some lowering of the intraocular pressure. In rabbits proparacaine has recently been shown to&#xD;
      reduce episcleral venous pressure, an important component of the intraocular pressure, and&#xD;
      the intraocular pressure itself (Zamora). Attempts to show the pressure lowering effect of&#xD;
      these frequently used topical anesthetics in humans using our traditional intraocular&#xD;
      measurement devices has been difficult as all three methods mentioned above require topical&#xD;
      anesthetic. Some European studies have used non-contact tonometry to verify these findings.&#xD;
      For example, Montero et al used non-contact tonometry to determine the effect of the topical&#xD;
      anesthetics and found that there was a statistically significant decrease in the intraocular&#xD;
      pressure after application of topical anesthetic3. Baudouin et al also found that, when&#xD;
      measured via non-contact tonometry, some topical anesthetics lower the intraocular pressure4.&#xD;
      In their study the topical anesthetics, oxybuprocaine and betoxycaine used more frequently in&#xD;
      the United States. Both of these studies were done using non-contact tonometry. Traditionally&#xD;
      with non-contact tonometry, a puff of air is directed towards the corneal surface and the&#xD;
      displacement of the corneal surface is measured and used to estimate the intraocular&#xD;
      pressure. However, in the United States most ophthalmology offices rely on contact tonometry&#xD;
      to evaluate the intraocular pressure rather than non-contact tonometry. Based on our review&#xD;
      of the literature, no one has yet measured the intraocular pressure lowering effects of these&#xD;
      topical anesthetics with contact tonometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a currently a device on the market which is approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration that is able to measure intraocular pressure via contact tonometry that does&#xD;
      not require use of topical anesthetic drops. This device is sold as the ICare tonometer. The&#xD;
      ICare is a tonometer that uses a rebound technology in which a very light-weight probe is&#xD;
      used to make momentary contact with the cornea. In rebound technology, the motion parameters&#xD;
      of the probe are recorded during the measurement. An induction based coil system and advanced&#xD;
      algorithms analyze the probe deceleration, contact time and other parameters as the probe&#xD;
      touches the cornea. The deceleration and rebound parameters change as a function of the&#xD;
      intraocular pressure. The tonometer is preprogrammed for six measurements, discarding the&#xD;
      highest and lowest intraocular pressure readings, and calculating the average pressure value.&#xD;
      The pressure is recorded in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). No anesthesia is involved because&#xD;
      the touch of the probe is so gentle that intraocular pressure measurement is barely noticed&#xD;
      by the subject5. The ICare is currently used on patients in our clinic for whom the&#xD;
      traditional intraocular pressure measurement devices have not been appropriate like newborns&#xD;
      and infants. It does not require topical anesthesia and recent data supports that its&#xD;
      intraocular pressure measurements are reliable6,7. Thus, the ICare tonometer finally provides&#xD;
      a way to use contact tonometry to verify whether or not the two most commonly used topical&#xD;
      anesthetics lower intraocular pressure.&#xD;
