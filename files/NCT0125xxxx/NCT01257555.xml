      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a photopneumatic therapy&#xD;
      for the treatment of acne and concomitant symptoms associated with the disease, including&#xD;
      erythema.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aims of the study will be to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of using a&#xD;
      photopneumatic system for treatment of mild to moderate acne on the face or body - including&#xD;
      neck, chest, and back - of up to 24 subjects. To support this clinical assessment, the&#xD;
      affected areas to be treated will be documented at baseline, at each subsequent treatment&#xD;
      visit (up to 6 treatments), and at one (1) month and three (3) months following final&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
