      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cisplatin and carboplatin are standard cancer treatment drugs used for various childhood&#xD;
           cancers, including brain tumors. Both drugs frequently have severe side effects that may&#xD;
           reduce their effectiveness, particularly in children, and new treatments are needed that&#xD;
           may be similarly effective but less toxic for cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Satraplatin is an experimental drug, similar to cisplatin and carboplatin, that has not&#xD;
           yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Satraplatin has been shown to&#xD;
           treat cancer by interfering with genetic material (DNA) in cancer cells. Some adults&#xD;
           with cancer who have received satraplatin had slowing of the growth or shrinkage of&#xD;
           their tumor. Researchers are interested in determining whether satraplatin can be&#xD;
           effective for cancers that occur in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of satraplatin as a treatment for children and&#xD;
           young adults who have solid tumors that have not responded to standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the effects of satraplatin on the body in terms of side effects and blood&#xD;
           chemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the effect that genetic variations may have on the effectiveness of&#xD;
           satraplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Children, adolescents, and young adults between 3 and 21 years of age who have solid tumors&#xD;
      (including brain tumors) that have not responded to standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a full physical examination and medical history,&#xD;
           blood tests, and tumor imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive satraplatin pills to be taken every day in the morning for 5&#xD;
           consecutive days, with no food for 2 hours before or 1 hour after the dose. Participants&#xD;
           will then have 23 days without the drug to complete a 28-day cycle of treatment.&#xD;
           Participants will also receive medication to prevent nausea and vomiting 30 minutes&#xD;
           before the first dose of satraplatin. Following the first dose of satraplatin,&#xD;
           medication for nausea will be given if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Satraplatin doses will be adjusted based on response to treatment, including potential&#xD;
           side effects. Participants will have frequent blood tests and imaging studies to&#xD;
           evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment and monitor any side effects, as well as&#xD;
           hearing tests and other examinations as required by the study researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive satraplatin every 4 weeks for up to 2 years until serious side&#xD;
           effects occur or the tumor stops responding to treatment.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      The platinum compounds cisplatin and carboplatin are standard agents in the treatment of a&#xD;
      variety of childhood cancers. However, cumulative and long-term renal and ototoxicity are a&#xD;
      concern related to cisplatin administration, particularly in young children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several mechanisms of resistance to platinum compounds have been described including&#xD;
      decreased drug accumulation due to altered drug uptake or the presence of a membrane efflux&#xD;
      pump, increased intracellular levels of thiol-containing groups that detoxify and modulate&#xD;
      platinum, and removal of the platinum-DNA adducts by DNA repair pathways called nucleotide&#xD;
      excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes have been shown in some cancers to predict better treatment&#xD;
      response to platinum treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Satraplatin is an oral platinum analog with similar preclinical in vitro and in vivo activity&#xD;
      to that of cisplatin and carboplatin, and with activity in platinum resistant models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose-limiting satraplatin toxicities in adults include nausea, vomiting, and&#xD;
      myelosuppression. Neither renal nor neurologic toxicities have been described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Satraplatin has demonstrated clinical activity in adult refractory tumors at the recommended&#xD;
      phase II and III dose of 80 mg/m2/dose daily for 5 days every 28 or 35 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral satraplatin administered on a once&#xD;
      daily for 5 days every 28 days schedule in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      solid tumors including brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To define the toxicities of oral satraplatin and characterize the pharmacokinetics of oral&#xD;
      satraplatin in children with refractory cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the preliminary antitumor activity of satraplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the pharmacogenomic expression of DNA repair genes in peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients greater than or equal to 3 years and less than or equal to 25 years at enrollment&#xD;
      with relapsed or refractory solid tumors including brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase I trial of satraplatin administered once daily orally for 5 days every 28&#xD;
      days. A cycle of therapy is considered to be 28 days. The starting dose level is 60&#xD;
      mg/m(2)/dose with escalations to 80, 110, 140 mg/m(2)/dose. The MTD will be defined based on&#xD;
      satraplatin tolerability during cycle one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease status will be evaluated prior to every odd treatment cycle and therapy may continue&#xD;
      for up to 2 years in the absence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics will be evaluated during the first treatment&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;

               1. the NCI, POB screening protocol,&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. an IRB-approved institutional screening protocol or&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. the study-specific protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Documentation of the informed consent for screening will be maintained in the&#xD;
                  patient s research chart. Studies or procedures that were performed for clinical&#xD;
                  indications (not exclusively to determine eligibility) may be used for baseline&#xD;
                  values even if the studies were done before informed consent was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  10. Durable Power of Attorney (DPA): All patients &gt;18 years of age will be&#xD;
                  offered the opportunity to assign DPA so that another person can make decisions&#xD;
                  about their medical care if they become incapacitated or cognitively impaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Pregnant or breast-feeding females are excluded due to potential risks of&#xD;

                       method. Abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Last dose of any investigational agent given within the past 30 days. 3.&#xD;
                       Ongoing radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy directed at the&#xD;
