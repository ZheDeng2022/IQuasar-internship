      The main purpose of this randomized phase II trial is to evaluate the clinical feasibility&#xD;
      and activity of administering adjuvant chemotherapy of pemetrexed/carboplatin compared with&#xD;
      vinorelbine/carboplatin in patients with completely resected non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pemetrexed, a multi-target folate antimetabolite, shows clear activity in non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC). In a phase III study for patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC, the&#xD;
      efficacy of single-agent pemetrexed, as determined by overall survival, was similar to that&#xD;
      of docetaxel. (Hanna et al, 2004) The combination of carboplatin and pemetrexed has been of&#xD;
      particular interest because it has demonstrated both good efficacy and a tolerable side&#xD;
      effect profile. Phase I studies evaluated pemetrexed plus carboplatin in patients with&#xD;
      malignant pleural mesothelioma, showed the regimen was efficacious and well tolerated.&#xD;
      (Hughes et al, 2002) The combination of oxaliplatin and pemetrexed was compared with&#xD;
      carboplatin and pemetrexed as first-line therapy for advanced NSCLC in a randomized phase II&#xD;
      study. Response rates were 27 and 33%, respectively, and not statistically different.&#xD;
      Toxicity in the carboplatin/pemetrexed arm was low, this doublet can be delivered easily and&#xD;
      is well tolerated. Dose reductions occur only in 3.7% cycles. (Scagliotti et al, 2005)&#xD;
      Therefore, it seems reasonable to test a less toxic regimen in patients with NSCLC after&#xD;
      complete (R0) resection of the tumor, where reduced toxicities might improve the feasibility&#xD;
      of drug delivery, compliance and the convenience of treatment for the patient and hence&#xD;
      perhaps improve survival. The main purpose of this randomized phase II trial is to evaluate&#xD;
      the clinical feasibility and activity of administering adjuvant chemotherapy of&#xD;
      pemetrexed/carboplatin compared with vinorelbine/carboplatin in patients with completely&#xD;
      resected NSCLC.&#xD;

    <description>For patients in arm pemetrexed/carboplatin, folic acid (350-1000 μg) must be given daily beginning approximately 5-7 days prior to first dose of pemetrexed and continuing daily until 3 weeks after the last dose of study therapy. Vitamin B12 (1000 μg) will be administered as an intramuscular injection approximately 1 to 2 weeks prior to first dose of pemetrexed and repeated approximately every 9 weeks until 3 weeks after the last dose of study therapy. Dexamethasone (4 mg of oral or equivalent) given twice daily should be taken on the day before, the day of, and the day after each dose of pemetrexed, for rash prophylaxis unless medically contraindicated. Patients must receive pemetrexed at day 1 at the dose of 500 mg/m2 as an IV infusion over approximately 10 minutes, then carboplatin target area under the concentration curve (AUC) 6 (i.v. infusion over 30 minutes) on day 1 of a 21-day cycle. A total of four cycles is intended.</description>
