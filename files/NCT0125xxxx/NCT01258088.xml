        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of serious adverse reactions or hypersensitivity to any drug; or known allergy&#xD;
             to any of the test product(s) or any components in the test product(s) or history of&#xD;

             pulmonary, metabolic, renal, hepatic or gastrointestinal conditions or history of such&#xD;
             conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator may place the subject at an&#xD;
             unacceptable risk as a participant in this trial or may interfere with the&#xD;
             distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal physical findings of clinical significance at the Screening examination or&#xD;
             Baseline which would interfere with the objectives of the study.&#xD;

             Hg drop in SBP and/or ≥10 mm Hg drop in DBP) present at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values (as determined by the Investigator)&#xD;

             bradycardia (&lt;50 bpm) or clinically significant minor ST wave changes on the Screening&#xD;
             ECG, or any other changes on the Screening ECG that would interfere with measurement&#xD;
             of the QT interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgical interventions within 6 months of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen; positive Hepatitis C (HCV)&#xD;
             antibody or detectable HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA); or positive HIV antibody result.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamin supplements, herbal&#xD;

             the first dose of study medication. However, the Investigator and study team can&#xD;
             review medication use on a case by case basis to determine if its use would compromise&#xD;
             subject safety or interfere with study procedures or data interpretation. By&#xD;
             exception, the subject may take paracetamol or acetaminophen (≤2 g/day) or ibuprofen&#xD;

             within 6 months of the Screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Loss of 500 mL blood or more during the 3 month period before the study, e.g., blood&#xD;

             study.&#xD;

             therapy (e.g., alefacept, etanercept, adalimumab, ustekinumab) within four weeks prior&#xD;
             to enrollment or concurrently during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
