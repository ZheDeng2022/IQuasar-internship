      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test the safety of a new investigational drug called MK-8669 (ridaforolimus)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of MK-8669&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the effectiveness of the maximum tolerated dose of MK-8669&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1A/1B study. Phase 1A is designed to determine the maximal tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) and toxicity of ridaforolimus in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in&#xD;
      patients with advanced or recurrent solid tumors. The MTD determined in this study will be&#xD;
      the recommended dose to study in the phase 1B or in future phase 2 trials.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have measurable disease or evaluable disease. Measurable disease is defined as at&#xD;
             least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest&#xD;
             dimension to be recorded). Each lesion must be a minimum size of 10 mm by CT scan (CT&#xD;
             scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm), 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam&#xD;
             or 20 mm by chest X-ray. Lymph node must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT&#xD;
             scan. Evaluable disease is disease evident on imaging that does not meet Response&#xD;
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria 1.1, however, meets tumor marker&#xD;
             evaluation, e.g., Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) criteria. Notes: i) If the&#xD;
             patient's only disease is confined to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature must be&#xD;
             confirmed by histology or cytology unless it is accompanied by GCIG criteria or can be&#xD;
             clearly be shown as new disease when compared to prior imaging. ii) Disease in a&#xD;
             previously irradiated field is acceptable as the only site of measurable disease only&#xD;
             if there has been clear progression since completion of radiotherapy.&#xD;

             equal to 2.5 x ULN (CTCAE v4.0 grade 1).; Neurologic function: Neuropathy (sensory and&#xD;
             motor) less than or equal to CTCAE v4.0 grade 1.; No chemotherapy, radiotherapy,&#xD;
