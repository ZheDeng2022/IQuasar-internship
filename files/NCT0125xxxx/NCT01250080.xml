  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glutamine is the most abundant nonessential amino acid in the human body. Besides its role as&#xD;
      a constituent of proteins and its importance in amino acid transamination, glutamine may&#xD;
      modulate immune cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The innate immune system is the first line of host defence against pathogens and in most&#xD;
      cases sufficient to eliminate invading microbes. Mammalian Toll-like receptors (TLR) comprise&#xD;
      a family of germ line-encoded trans-membrane receptors which activation leads to the&#xD;
      induction of inflammatory responses, phagocytosis but also to the development of antigen&#xD;
      specific adapative immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been postulated though not formally proven yet that glutamine beneficial effect could&#xD;
      be due to a positive effect on the innate immune system. Given the importance of TLRs and&#xD;
      TLRs-dependent signalling in host defence against infections we hypothesized that glutamine&#xD;
      may increase the expression and/or functionality of TLRs which in turn may have beneficial&#xD;
      effects to clear infections.&#xD;

      Objective: To evaluate whether glutamine supplementation alters the expression and&#xD;
      functionality of TLR2 and TLR4 in circulating monocytes of trauma patients admitted to the&#xD;
      ICU. Specifically the next variables were measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in peripheral blood monocytes was determined by flow&#xD;
           cytometry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the functionality of TLR2 and TLR4, monocytes were stimulated with TLR specific&#xD;
           agonists and cytokines were measured in cell culture supernatants. We determined the&#xD;
           concentration of IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα and IL-10 in cell culture supernatants using a bead&#xD;
           array ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the phagocytic capability of monocytes, live Escherichia coli expressing&#xD;
           green fluorescent protein was added to 100 μL of whole blood collected in&#xD;
           K2-anticoagulation medium tubes. Bacteria were added at a ratio of 100 bacteria per&#xD;
           monocyte. The analyses were carried out in an Epics XL flow cytometer.&#xD;
