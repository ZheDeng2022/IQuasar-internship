    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether fluid administration in patients undergoing&#xD;
      colonoscopy should affect acid-base disorder in term of the strong ion differences.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized control trial. The study enrolls 90&#xD;
      consecutive outpatients, well-prepared bowel, scheduled to undergo routine colonoscopy for&#xD;
      screening, surveillance, or diagnosis of colorectal diseases. At the outpatient clinic, the&#xD;
      co-researcher invites patients who meet the inclusion criteria to join the study. The process&#xD;
      of the project is explained to the interested patients in details before an informed consent&#xD;
      is obtained and the first blood sample is conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of colonoscopy, all participants are randomized equally into three groups: Normal&#xD;
      saline solution (NSS, n = 30) as control group, lactated Ringer's solution (LRS, n = 30) and&#xD;
      acetated Ringer's solution (ARS, n = 30) as treatment groups. The second blood sample is&#xD;
      obtained from patients via 20-gauge needle in either forearm immediately before an allocated&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) fluid administered on the same site. The volume of fluid is calculated by&#xD;
      means of Holliday and Segar formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The colonoscopy under total intravenous anesthesia is performed between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00&#xD;
      p.m. At the end of colonoscopy, the patients spontaneously wake up in the recovery room.&#xD;
      After they gain conscious and all vital signs are stable; the intravenous fluid is off and&#xD;
      the third blood sample is taken in the other forearm. After completion of the procedure, the&#xD;
      patient is advised to follow the discharge instructions.&#xD;
