  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to look at two conditions, Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) and&#xD;
      Polycythemia Vera (PV). ET causes people to produce too many blood cells called platelets and&#xD;
      PV causes too many platelets and red blood cells to be made. Platelets are particles which&#xD;
      circulate in the blood stream and normally prevent bleeding and bruising. Having too many&#xD;
      platelets in the blood increases the risk of developing blood clots, which can result in life&#xD;
      threatening events like heart attacks and strokes. When the number of red blood cells is&#xD;
      increased in PV this will slow the speed of blood flow in the body and increases the risk of&#xD;
      developing blood clots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important for patients with ET or PV who are at risk of blood clots to receive drugs&#xD;
      which will minimize the risks of developing these blood clots but at the moment the&#xD;
      investigators are not sure which drugs will best control the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to look at the effectiveness of giving patients who have been&#xD;
      diagnosed with ET and PV a study drug regimen using Aspirin and PEGASYS (also known as&#xD;
      Pegylated interferon alfa-2a, instead of the standard treatment drug called Hydroxyurea (or&#xD;
      hydroxycarbamide or Hydroxyurea), for whom this drug may not be suitable. The drug may not be&#xD;
      suitable either because it is not adequately controlling the number of blood cells or some&#xD;
      specific side effects occur.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) are clonal hematologic diseases characterized by the&#xD;
      excess production of one or more lineages of mature blood cells, a predisposition to bleeding&#xD;
      and thrombotic complications, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and a variable progression to&#xD;
      acute leukemia. The classical Philadelphia chromosome-negative MPDs are polycythemia vera&#xD;
      (PV), characterized by an expansion in red blood cell production; essential thrombocythemia&#xD;
      (ET), characterized by an isolated elevation in the platelet count; and myelofibrosis,&#xD;
      distinguished by a fibrotic bone marrow and peripheral blood cytopenias, and accompanied by&#xD;
      the highest risk of leukemic transformation. Myelofibrosis can arise de novo, as primary&#xD;
      myelofibrosis (PMF), or can evolve out of PV or ET as those diseases progress (so called&#xD;
      post-PV MF and post-ET MF). Amongst the MPDs, those characterized by myelofibrosis (PMF&#xD;
      together with post-PV and post-ET MF) carry the worst prognosis, with a median survival on&#xD;
      the order of 3 to 5 years. Patients typically present with anemia, often requiring&#xD;
      transfusions, symptomatic splenomegaly and severe constitutional symptoms. Donor stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation is the only potentially curative therapy. To date there is no therapy for&#xD;
      myelofibrosis that has been shown to offer a survival benefit, and all other therapies for&#xD;
      myelofibrosis are palliative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2005, a major breakthrough in understanding the pathophysiology of MPDs came when 4 groups&#xD;
      described a recurrent somatic mutation in Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) in the majority of patients&#xD;
      with MPDs. The point mutation in JAK2 encodes a valine to phenylalanine change at position&#xD;
      617 (JAK2 V617F), and confers constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. Introducing the mutation&#xD;
      into the bone marrow of mouse models recapitulates the PV phenotype (complete with evolution&#xD;
      to bone marrow fibrosis) and inhibitors of JAK2 attenuate the growth of cell lines bearing&#xD;
      the mutation in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that JAK2 V617F is a pathophysiologically&#xD;
      relevant therapeutic target. It is estimated that 95% of PV cases carry JAK2 V617F, while 50&#xD;
      to 60% of ET and PMF cases are JAK2 V617F+. The discovery of the JAK2V617F mutation in nearly&#xD;
      all patients with PV and half those with ET and PMF have redefined the classification and&#xD;
      possibly the management of MPNs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the discovery of the JAK2V617F mutation, many of the clinical questions in the&#xD;
      management of MPNs remain unanswered. In PV, for example, cardiovascular mortality remains&#xD;
      1.4 to 1.6 times that of the reference normal population with leukemia and myelofibrosis&#xD;
      rates many times increased over baseline. Debate continues over the role of venesection&#xD;
      versus cytoreduction as first-line therapy, and whether hydroxycarbamide (Hydroxyurea) is&#xD;
      associated with better thrombotic prophylaxis and/or a higher rate of leukemic&#xD;
      transformation. Interferons may produce molecular responses in PV patients. In high-risk ET,&#xD;
      while Hydroxyurea and aspirin appear to be more optimal than anagrelide and aspirin, vascular&#xD;
      complications remain the most significant cause of mortality and morbidity, suggesting that&#xD;
      targeting vascular risk factors may be worthwhile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore while Hydroxyurea is regarded as the first-choice therapy in most of high risk&#xD;
      patients with ET and PV; up to 10% of the patients do not attain the desired reduction of&#xD;
      platelet number or hematocrit with the recommended dose of the drug, exhibiting clinical&#xD;
      resistance, whereas some will develop unacceptable side effects, demonstrating clinical&#xD;
      intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitation of the JAK2V617F allele burden provides for the first time the opportunity to&#xD;
      monitor the effect of potential therapeutic agents on the malignant clone in patients with&#xD;
      PV. Great enthusiasm has been expressed for the use of small molecule inhibitors of JAK2 for&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with MPN. Phase 1/2 trials have indicated greater than expected&#xD;
      toxicity, non specificity of action and an inability of these compounds to dramatically alter&#xD;
      the JAK2V617F allele burden. Interferon (rIFN -2b), is a drug that appears to be&#xD;
      non-leukemogenic (contrary to 32P, alkylating agents, and possibly Hydroxyurea), and may have&#xD;
      a preferential activity on the malignant clone in PV, as suggested by cytogenetic remissions&#xD;
      obtained in patients treated with rIFN -2b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial was designed as open-label phase 2 study conducted in two strata of patients with&#xD;
      high risk PV or ET who were intolerant of hydroxyurea. Patients with ET or PV with Splanchnic&#xD;
      Vein Thrombosis (regardless of prior hydroxyurea) are enrolled in separate strata.&#xD;
