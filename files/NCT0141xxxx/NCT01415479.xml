  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fifty thousand people die from colorectal cancer (CRC) every year, making it the second&#xD;
      leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. And although there are multiple&#xD;
      screening tests that reduce the morbidity and mortality of this disease, less than 60% of&#xD;
      eligible individuals are up to date with recommended screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the challenges to improving screening is helping patients understand the range of&#xD;
      approved tests, including colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, and stool testing (such as fecal&#xD;
      immunochemical testing (FIT)). Patients rarely consider all their options, partly due to the&#xD;
      limited time they have to learn about them during busy doctor's visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer-based presentations, including decision aids, are a promising tool for improving&#xD;
      patient understanding in this and other areas, by giving patients significant amounts of&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But there are important questions about how to design such presentations, including whether&#xD;
      they should provide quantitative data about the risks and benefits of screening. Some experts&#xD;
      feel that these numbers and graphs are necessary for fully informed decision-making, while&#xD;
      others are concerned that they may confuse patients or dissuade them from screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have created and pilot tested a computer-based presentation of quantitative&#xD;
      information about CRC screening. The investigators found that subjects who viewed the program&#xD;
      in a non-healthcare setting exhibited significantly increased interest in screening. In&#xD;
      addition, the investigators tested a version of the program that includes a &quot;nudge&quot; towards&#xD;
      stool testing with FIT, as a way of encouraging individuals who are confused to undergo some&#xD;
      form of screening. In our testing, receiving the nudge was associated with a significant&#xD;
      increase in interest in FIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators now seek to conduct a randomized, controlled study of our computer-based&#xD;
      presentation with Clarian patients who are due for CRC screening. All subjects will first&#xD;
      view a general video about CRC screening and then will be randomly placed into four groups&#xD;
      (using a 2x2 design), to receive quantitative information (or not), and a nudge towards FIT&#xD;
      (or not).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will determine whether a presentation of quantitative information can increase&#xD;
      patient understanding, quality of decision-making, and uptake of CRC screening. The results&#xD;
      will serve as pilot data for a larger, externally funded study of the effect of&#xD;
      individualized (&quot;personalized&quot;) quantitative information in this area&#xD;
