    <textblock>
      Ovarian insufficiency is common in Turner syndrome related to premature and rapid follicular&#xD;
      apoptosis and spontaneous pregnancies are rare in this population. Ovarian cryopreservation&#xD;
      has been used in an effort to preserve fertility in patients undergoing treatments which lead&#xD;
      to premature and severe ovarian insufficiency. This study aims to assess the relevance of&#xD;
      ovarian tissue cryopreservation in girls with Turner syndrome. Based on ovarian follicular&#xD;
      density as primary outcome and karyotypic, clinical and hormonal markers as secondary&#xD;
      outcomes, analysis of the study will allow to select the patients to whom the procedure would&#xD;
      benefit the most.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Turner syndrome (TS) is characterized by the absence of all or part of a normal second X&#xD;
      chromosome and occurs in about 1/2,500 live-born girls. Spontaneous fertility is rare among&#xD;
      patients with TS related to premature apoptosis of ovarian follicles. Spontaneous puberty and&#xD;
      fertility has been reported mostly in patients with mosaic karyotype or small X deletions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is robust evidence that follicles can be observed in ovaries in girls with TS. However,&#xD;
      follicular density and quality seems to be largely influenced by karyotype, ovarian&#xD;
      morphology and endocrine competence. There are no clear-cut clinical or hormonal markers to&#xD;
      assess the ovarian reserve in girls with TS but markers of ovarian function used in women&#xD;
      with premature ovarian insufficiency are measured. In TS, it is now fundamental to be able to&#xD;
      evaluate the prognosis of the ovarian function and the degree of fertility to provide the&#xD;
      relevant information to girls and their parents and to discuss possibilities of motherhood if&#xD;
      any.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovarian cryopreservation has been used in an effort to preserve fertility in patients&#xD;
      undergoing treatments which lead to premature and severe ovarian insufficiency. This study&#xD;
      aims to assess the relevance of ovarian tissue cryopreservation in girls with Turner&#xD;
      syndrome. Based on ovarian follicular density as primary outcome and karyotypic, clinical and&#xD;
      hormonal markers as secondary outcomes, analysis of the study will allow to screen the&#xD;
      patients to whom the procedure would benefit the most.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Girls who will be operated will accept to come for a follow-up visit at one and 12 months&#xD;
      after the surgery. It is expected to have clinical and hormonal information through a long&#xD;
      follow up performed by the referred paediatrician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the study will allow us to select patients with TS who will benefit the most of&#xD;
      this fertility preservation procedure based on karyotypic, clinical and hormonal profile.&#xD;
