  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is needed to assess the feasibility of integrating this therapy with current&#xD;
      treatment regimens. If this study shows success a formal phase II test study to conduct&#xD;
      feasibility will be the next step. The first dose level chosen for this study is 66Gy of&#xD;
      radiation to the tumor between LET and standard photon therapy. This dose is the current&#xD;
      standard of care for stage III . If this dose is found to be feasible then the dose of LET&#xD;
      will escalate to the total dose of 74Gy.&#xD;

    <description>Concurrent chemo and photon radiation therapy will start within 7 days of completing neutron therapy. There will be a Day 1 of neutron therapy and a Day 1 of concurrent therapy.Photon radiation therapy will begin within 24 hours of the first cycle of chemotherapy and will be delivered 5 days per week, one fraction per day, in 1.8 Gy per fraction. High LET radiotherapy will be delivered in 1 NGy per fraction five days per week. High LET radiotherapy will be delivered first followed by combined chemoradiotherapy.</description>
