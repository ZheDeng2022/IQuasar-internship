    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ixazomib citrate works in treating patients with&#xD;
      multiple myeloma that has returned after a period of improvement (relapsed) but is not&#xD;
      resistant to bortezomib (refractory). Ixazomib citrate may stop the growth of cancer cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the confirmed overall response rate (&gt;= partial response [PR]) of ixazomib&#xD;
      [ixazomib citrate], used as a single agent in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma, who&#xD;
      are proteasome inhibitor naive (including bortezomib) naive OR have received less than 6&#xD;
      cycles of therapy with bortezomib and had a better than PR with no progression at the time of&#xD;
      discontinuation. (Arm A - Permanently closed to accrual as of Addendum 5) II. To determine&#xD;
      the confirmed overall response rate (&gt;= PR) of ixazomib at a 4 mg dose level in combination&#xD;
      with dexamethasone in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma, who are proteasome inhibitor&#xD;
      naive (including bortezomib) naive OR have received less than 6 cycles of therapy with&#xD;
      bortezomib and had a better than PR with no progression at the time of discontinuation. (Arm&#xD;
      B) III. To determine the confirmed overall response rate (&gt;= PR) of ixazomib at a 5.5 mg dose&#xD;
      level in combination with dexamethasone in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma, who are&#xD;
      proteasome inhibitor naive (including bortezomib) naive OR have received less than 6 cycles&#xD;
      of therapy with bortezomib and had a better than PR with no progression at the time of&#xD;
      discontinuation. (Arm C) IV. To determine the confirmed overall response rate (&gt;= PR) of&#xD;
      ixazomib in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed&#xD;
      multiple myeloma, who are proteasome inhibitor naive (including bortezomib) naive OR have&#xD;
      received less than 6 cycles of therapy with bortezomib and had a better than PR with no&#xD;
      progression at the time of discontinuation. (Arm D) V. To determine the confirmed overall&#xD;
      response rate (&gt;= PR) of ixazomib in combination with cyclophosphamide, daratumumab, and&#xD;
      dexamethasone in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma. (Arm E)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate of ixazomib in combination with dexamethasone, when&#xD;
      dexamethasone is added to ixazomib for lack of response or for progression. (Arm A) II. To&#xD;
      determine the event free survival and overall survival among patients with relapsed myeloma&#xD;
      following treatment with ixazomib with dexamethasone added for lack of response or&#xD;
      progression. (Arm A) III. To determine the event free survival and overall survival among&#xD;
      patients with relapsed myeloma following treatment with ixazomib at two different doses, in&#xD;
      combination with dexamethasone. (Arms B and C) IV. To determine the event free survival and&#xD;
      overall survival among patients with relapsed myeloma following treatment with ixazomib in&#xD;
      combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone. (Arm D) V. To determine the event free&#xD;
      survival and overall survival among patients with relapsed myeloma following treatment with&#xD;
      ixazomib in combination with cyclophosphamide, daratumumab, and dexamethasone. (Arm E)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms (Arm A permanently closed to&#xD;
      accrual as of Addendum 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients with lack&#xD;
      of minor response by the end of the second cycle or lack of partial response by the end of&#xD;
      the fourth cycle also receive dexamethasone PO on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive ixazomib citrate PO on days 1, 8, and 15 and dexamethasone PO on days&#xD;
      1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM C: Patients receive higher dose of ixazomib citrate PO on days 1, 8, and 15 and&#xD;
      dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM D: Patients receive ixazomib citrate PO on days 1, 8, and 15 and cyclophosphamide PO&#xD;
      (cycles 1-18 only) and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Cycles repeat every 28 days&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM E: Patients receive ixazomib citrate PO on days 1, 8, and 15, cyclophosphamide PO (cycles&#xD;
      1-12 only) on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and daratumumab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, 22&#xD;
      (cycles 1-2), days 1 and 15 (cycles 3-6), and day 1 in all subsequent cycles. Patients also&#xD;
      receive dexamethasone IV or PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 or 12 months for 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
