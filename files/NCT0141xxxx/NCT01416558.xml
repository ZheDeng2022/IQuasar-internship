  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nab-paclitaxel has demonstrated to be an active agent in breast cancer and probably a less&#xD;
      toxic alternative to solvent based taxanes. It is indicated in metastatic breast cancer after&#xD;
      failure of anthracyclines. However, most patients receive anthracyclines as well as taxanes&#xD;
      as part of their (neo-)adjuvant therapy. There is currently no standard treatment for&#xD;
      patients with an early relapse (&lt;12 months) after a taxane containing (neo-)adjuvant therapy.&#xD;
      Nab-paclitaxel, a novel nano-particle encapsulated paclitaxel is expected to have only&#xD;
      limited cross-resistant to solvent-based taxanes and might therefore be indicated in this&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine overall response rate (ORR) and to exclude that it is 20% or lower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine compliance and toxicity of the therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine clinical benefit rate (CBR) in patients with measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine duration of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To assess biomarkers, e.g. SPARC expression in the tissue of the primary or metastatic&#xD;
           tumor.&#xD;
