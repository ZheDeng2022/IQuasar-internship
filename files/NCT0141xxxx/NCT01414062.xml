  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hispanic women are 20% more likely to die of breast cancer than non Hispanic white women who&#xD;
      are diagnosed at a similar age and stage. One reason for this disparity may be differences in&#xD;
      post diagnosis dietary behaviors. In order to reduce this disparity, and to improve overall&#xD;
      survivorship, culturally appropriate dietary interventions that teach women how to eat a diet&#xD;
      high in fruits and vegetables and low in saturated fat need to be developed for Hispanic&#xD;
      breast cancer survivors. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled study&#xD;
      (n=70, 35 per arm) to test the effects of the ¡Cocinar para su salud! program on changing&#xD;
      dietary behaviors among Hispanic breast cancer survivors who have recently completed&#xD;
      treatment. The ¡Cocinar para su salud! program is a 12 week course that provides hands on&#xD;
      education and instruction in nutrition education, meal preparation, and food shopping in a&#xD;
      group setting. All participants will be followed for a total of 12 months, have clinical&#xD;
      assessments at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months, and monthly telephone contacts using&#xD;
      motivational interview techniques. The Primary Aims are to determine the effect of the&#xD;
      dietary intervention (¡Cocinar para su salud! program) vs. control (standard written&#xD;
      nutrition education materials for cancer survivors) on 1) daily servings of fruit/vegetable,&#xD;
      and 2) daily servings of fat intake from baseline to 6 months. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that the dietary intervention will result in a larger increase of fruit and vegetable intake&#xD;
      and a larger reduction of fat intake, when compared to the control group. Secondary Aims are&#xD;
      to determine the effect of the dietary intervention vs. control on 1) biomarkers of fruit and&#xD;
      vegetable intake, molecular biomarkers associated with breast cancer risk, and anthropometric&#xD;
      measures at 6 and 12 months; 2) fruit/vegetable and fat intake at 12 months; 3) mediators of&#xD;
      dietary change, including readiness to change, outcome expectations, perceived self efficacy,&#xD;
      food and nutrition skills, self regulation skills, and barriers to adherence; and 4) changes&#xD;
      in quality of life and anxiety/depression at 6 and 12 months.&#xD;

      This trial is a randomized, controlled 2-arm study of a 3-month dietary change counseling and&#xD;
      instruction intervention among Hispanic breast cancer survivors (n=70, 35 per arm). The study&#xD;
      is comparing Arm A: standard of care written dietary recommendations for cancer survivors,&#xD;
      with Arm B: the 12-week ¡Cocinar para su salud!. ¡Cocinar para su salud! will provide&#xD;
      hands-on education and instruction to Hispanic breast cancer survivors in nutrition&#xD;
      education, food shopping, and meal preparation in a group setting. Participants will be&#xD;
      followed for a total of 12 months, have clinical assessments at baseline, 6 months, and 12&#xD;
      months, and will have monthly telephone contacts using motivational interviewing. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint is at 6 months because the investigators hypothesize that it will take participants&#xD;
      at least 3 months to adapt some of the dietary behaviors taught in the 3-month intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 70 women with a history of histologically-confirmed early stage breast cancer will&#xD;
      be randomized to Arm A or Arm B. Assuming an accrual rate of approximately 2-4 participants&#xD;
      per month, the investigators expect to complete enrollment within 24 months.&#xD;
