  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cerebral oximeter is a device that uses light to measure the amount of oxygen within the&#xD;
      brain. It is similar to the device that measures the level of oxygen in the tip of the&#xD;
      finger, known as a pulse oximeter. The cerebral oximeter consists of a sensor placed on the&#xD;
      forehead that both emits and detects the amount of light absorbed. This study will determine&#xD;
      how accurate the device is by comparing the displayed value on the monitor with blood samples&#xD;
      taken simultaneously from the arterial blood in the wrist and venous blood in the neck. In&#xD;
      order to test the device over a suitable range, the level of oxygen within the blood will be&#xD;
      reduced in a controlled manner by reduction of the inspired oxygen concentration. This is the&#xD;
      equivalent of ascending to an altitude of 16,000 feet. The study will be conducted in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;

      This is a calibration and validation study of a near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device&#xD;
      designed to measure the cerebral tissue oxygen saturation non-invasively. This is achieved by&#xD;
      comparing NIRS-derived cerebral tissue oxygen saturation with a calculated value derived from&#xD;
      simultaneous arterial and jugular venous blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present the FDA have adopted the standards published in 2005 by the International&#xD;
      Organization for Standardization (ISO), entitled ISO 9919. This is a set of technical&#xD;
      specifications and guidelines for pulse oximeters, which share certain technical similarities&#xD;
      to cerebral oximeters. In particular, Annex EE details the conduct of a controlled&#xD;
      desaturation study for the calibration of pulse oximeter equipment. Specifically, the&#xD;
      fraction of inspired oxygen delivered to test subjects is varied to achieve a series of&#xD;
      targeted steady state saturation periods over a range of arterial oxygen saturation of 70 -&#xD;
      100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While cerebral oximeters differ from pulse oximeters in terms of the what is being measured&#xD;
      (brain tissue versus arterial blood) the FDA have maintained the requirement to examine data&#xD;
      from human volunteer studies in which the arterial oxygen saturation ranges from 70 - 100%.&#xD;
      Several FDA-approved cerebral oximeters were validated in a similar manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device controlling the inspired gas concentration is the RespirAct, which permits precise&#xD;
      reduction in the arterial oxygen saturation while also maintaining the arterial carbon&#xD;
      dioxide level at a precise level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 2 sequences:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First sequence: reduction in arterial oxygen saturation in approximately 5% increments&#xD;
           from 100 to 70%, while maintaining the arterial carbon dioxide level at 40 mmHg,&#xD;
           followed by return to room air and then a period of supplemental oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second sequence: reduction in arterial oxygen saturation in approximately 5% increments&#xD;
           from 100 to 70%, while maintaining the arterial carbon dioxide level at a different&#xD;
           level, followed by return to room air and then a period of supplemental oxygen.&#xD;
