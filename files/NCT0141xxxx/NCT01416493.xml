      This is a proof of concept study asking if alkaline phosphatase injections can reduce acute&#xD;
      inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof of concept study to establish the safety of subcutaneous (sc) treatment and&#xD;
      the efficacy of alkaline phosphatase (AP) in reducing specific pro-inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      during and after 3 days of twice daily s.c. treatment. A total dose of 12000 Units AP will be&#xD;
      administered by 2000 IU s.c. injection twice daily for 3 days. Subjects will be closely&#xD;
      followed for 8 days and regular clinical observations will be made during 3 months. Close out&#xD;
      will be 3 months after initiation of treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The anticipated effects of bIAP will be short lived, within 4 days. However, in order to capture durable clinical responses or any late adverse effects, patients will be followed through 3 months at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 incorporating trial observations with routine monthly care to reduce disruption to patients.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female patients of any race with an age &gt;18 years.&#xD;

        (Pregnancy tests).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1A: RA according to the 1987 revised ARA criteria (Arnett 1987) with an active disease with&#xD;
        DAS28&gt;3.2 despite the prior or concurrent use of DMARDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients may be on no active therapy or may be on continuous DMARD therapy including&#xD;
        Methotrexate, Sulphasalazine, Leflunomide, Hydroxychloroquine, Myocrisin alone or in&#xD;
        combination, or on NSAID treatment, or on steroid (prednisolone not more than 10mg/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients must have a measurable acute phase response: CRP (&gt; 10mg/dl), ESR &gt; 25. (to be&#xD;
        measured on routine lab range CRP/ ESR/AP/ standard biochemistry)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients eligible for treatment with biological TNFα blockers and who are awaiting the&#xD;
        administration of such treatment may enroll in the laboratory and safety protocols Data for&#xD;
        Clinical Phase observations will be collected but will be handled as last observation&#xD;
        carried forward for the final records prior to the administration of TNF blocking agent,&#xD;
        should that occur within the 3-month Clinical Phase. The administration of TNFα blockers&#xD;
        will not be delayed for the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients who have given written informed consent prior to participation in the trial and&#xD;
        who undertake to comply with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Patients who have an active infection or who are suspected of having systemic&#xD;
             infection and or patients that are treated with antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients whose screening blood do not reflect a sufficient cytokine or acute phase&#xD;
             response.&#xD;
&#xD;

             clinical signs or laboratory values of total bilirubin &gt; 34.2 umol/L (&gt; 2.0 mg/dL),&#xD;
             ALT (&gt;120) or AST (&gt;135) corresponding to &gt; 3X upper limit of normal.&#xD;

&#xD;

             administration, or are currently participating in a study during which the&#xD;
             administration of investigational drugs within one month is anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who have renal insufficiency (history of creatinine &gt;177umol/L or &gt;2.0 mg/dL)&#xD;
             or chronic renal failure requiring dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with severe neurological deficits (see Appendix I).&#xD;

             within the past 3 months. Patients receiving only adjuvant hormonal therapy are not&#xD;
             excluded. If the cancer has not resolved completely, the patient should not be&#xD;

         12. Patients receiving oral glucocorticoids &gt;10mg /day or any IV, IM or Intra articular&#xD;
             dosing within 30 days of commencing the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients who are vegetarians or veganists or those patients that may be expected not&#xD;
             to be tolerant to bovine proteins, or not to wish exposure to bovine proteins for&#xD;
