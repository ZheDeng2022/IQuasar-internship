  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is a life-long incurable disease with remissions and exacerbations.&#xD;
      Inflammation confined to the rectum occurs in a quarter of patients and can be extremely hard&#xD;
      to treat. Many medications have been tried in order to control the inflammation, but they do&#xD;
      not always work. One of the newer medications is the immunosuppressing medication, tacrolimus&#xD;
      that has been shown to be effective in UC when taken orally. Unfortunately, the oral use of&#xD;
      this medication can have numerous serious side effects. In order to overcome these side&#xD;
      effects, the use of topical rectal tacrolimus has been examined. Pilot studies in ulcerative&#xD;
      proctitis (inflammation confined to the rectum) resistant to conventional therapies have&#xD;
      demonstrated a clinical remission in 75% of patients and although the medication was well&#xD;
      absorbed through the lining of the bowel, the levels in the blood were very low and no&#xD;
      serious side effects were reported. The findings suggest that this preparation is indeed&#xD;
      effective for inflammation in the distal bowel and that the method of administration reduces&#xD;
      side effects. Further work, however, now needs to be undertaken to validate the original&#xD;
      findings.&#xD;

      The Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs) are life-long conditions often diagnosed between 15&#xD;
      and 35 years of age that are increasing in frequency. In developed countries, IBD prevalence&#xD;
      was about 100-220/100,000 in 2002. More recently the estimated prevalence of CD and UC in the&#xD;
      USA are 201 and 238 per 100,000 respectively. This indicates more than 620,000 CD and 730,000&#xD;
      UC patients in the USA alone. It has also been noted that the incidence of IBD has been&#xD;
      increasing in the ethnic minorities in American over the last two decades and it is predicted&#xD;
      that IBD, which was previously thought of as a 'Caucasian disease', will reach a comparable&#xD;
      levels in Asia as in the Western Countries within 10-15 years. One of the major costs in IBD&#xD;
      treatment is the need for a hospital admission. These have been falling for CD patients&#xD;
      secondary to the increasing use of the biological therapies, however, admissions for UC have&#xD;
      doubled over the last 15 years. IBD now costs the Australian economy of 22,000,000 people&#xD;
      over $2.7 billion annually and this is comparable throughout the western World.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tacrolimus and cyclosporin are classical calcineurin inhibitors and are widely used as&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medications with promising results in UC. Calcineurin, or protein&#xD;
      phosphatase 2B (PP2B), is a ubiquitously expressed cytosolic Ser/Thr protein phosphatase,&#xD;
      that is highly conserved in eukaryotes. It has the ability to dephosphorylate a broad range&#xD;
      of proteins and can regulate interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4 and interferon (IFN)γ expression, as&#xD;
      well as modulating the activity of transcription factors like NF-κB. Enhanced NF-kB activity&#xD;
      is well described in CD and UC and induces the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα&#xD;
      expression. It is primarily through the reduction in the levels of these cytokines that&#xD;
      clinical remission may be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of oral tacrolimus has been examined in the management of medication resistant&#xD;
      CD and UC. Unfortunately, the majority of these studies have been open labelled with only one&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial reported in UC. This demonstrated a short-term clinical&#xD;
      improvement but without a significant increase in the remission rate, potentially due to low&#xD;
      patient numbers. Despite this, there are numerous open labelled studies in both UC and CD&#xD;
      that suggest efficacy in the short term and with promising longer term data. The evidence&#xD;
      would suggest, however, that the blood trough level should be at least 10ug/L in order to&#xD;
      achieve the best efficacy (therapeutic range 5-20ug/L), but the higher the trough level the&#xD;
      more likely a patient will suffer an adverse effect. These, unfortunately, can be numerous&#xD;
      and include hypertension, nausea and diarrhoea, haematological abnormalities, renal&#xD;
      impairment. Increase in the rate of skin cancers is also a concern, a concern supported by&#xD;
      animal studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of topical tacrolimus has been effective in the treatment of perioral and perineal&#xD;
      inflammation in paediatric CD patients with resolution of symptoms in 75%. Work examining&#xD;
      topical perianal tacrolimus therapy in adult CD patients also demonstrated clinical efficacy,&#xD;
      and although tacrolimus is absorbed well transdermally, only low trough levels of tacrolimus&#xD;
      were detected in the blood. In these preliminary studies, the use of topical tacrolimus was&#xD;
      associated with very few side effects. Long-term topical use, as with oral formulations, may&#xD;
      be associated with an increased risk of skin cancer formation. Epidemiological evidence,&#xD;
      however, would suggest that the risk is low and localised to the tacrolimus-treated&#xD;
      sun-exposed skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent pilot study by our group demonstrated that 75% (6/8) of patients with resistant&#xD;
      distal colitis responded and achieved a remission of their disease following 4 and 8 weeks of&#xD;
      tacrolimus rectal ointment8. A dose of 0.3 to 0.5mg/ml 3ml twice a day was identified in the&#xD;
      majority of patients to induce remission. In these patients tacrolimus trough levels were&#xD;
      taken regularly and were either undetectable (&lt;1.5 μg/L) sub-therapeutic (&lt;5 μg/L) or, at&#xD;
      their highest, in the low therapeutic range (therapeutic range 5-20 μg/L). The ointment was&#xD;
      well tolerated without any systemic adverse effects. Use of the same rectal tacrolimus&#xD;
      preparation in further 8 patients was also associated with a clinical response in 6 patients&#xD;
      after 4 weeks of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of topical tacrolimus in UC is further supported by a separate pilot study that&#xD;
      examined topical tacrolimus in patients with resistant distal colitis. In this study a&#xD;
      clinical and histological improvement in 10 of 12 patients by 4 weeks without any major side&#xD;
      effects reported and the preparation was well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medication and supply:The preparation of the tacrolimus rectal ointment will be&#xD;
      undertaken in respective hospital pharmacy at each centre. Gloves and mask shall be worn when&#xD;
      making the preparation. The concentration of tacrolimus in the ointment shall be 0.5 mg⁄mL.&#xD;
      Five millilitres of propylene glycol will be slowly mixed into the desired amount of&#xD;
      tacrolimus powder on a clean glass slab. To this, 70 mL of paraffin liquid BP (LP) will be&#xD;
      gradually added by serial dilution and triturate until evenly mixed. This process will be&#xD;
      repeated with 125 mL of paraffin white soft BP (WSP). The resulting cream will be packed into&#xD;
      tubes and labelled. The preparation will be formulated using the LP ⁄WSP base for ease of&#xD;
      rectal use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication Stability: The cream expires after 30 days at room temperature or 90 days at 4-8&#xD;
      0C&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of the study medication: A total of 3ml of the study medication or placebo&#xD;
      will be applied rectally, via an applicator, twice a day by the patient over the 8-week&#xD;
      period. The application will take place prior to retiring to bed and following breakfast in&#xD;
      the morning. For shift workers application will occur just prior to retiring to bed and&#xD;
      following the first meal of the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Randomisation: Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive the&#xD;
           tacrolimus or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blinding: The trial patients and the clinical investigators will be blinded to the&#xD;
           randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant therapy: Rectal preparation will be ceased a day prior to commencing the trial.&#xD;
      Patients will be continued on the same oral medications they are on at commencement of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit: All patients will sign informed consent prior to any data collection.&#xD;
      Patient demographics will be recorded. Stool culture and microscopy, blood pressure (BP),&#xD;
      full blood count (FBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP),&#xD;
      urea,electrolytes (U&amp;E) and GFR will be taken and measured locally at each site. Results of&#xD;
      these tests will be faxed through to the central site at Fremantle hospital within 3 days of&#xD;
      collection for review. Faecal calprotectin will be taken and stored at -200C. These specimens&#xD;
      will be sent in batches on dry ice every 3 months to the central site at Fremantle Hospital&#xD;
      for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 7 days prior to week 0 a flexible sigmoidoscopy will be performed. Two sets of photos&#xD;
      will be taken at endoscopy one set distal (within 15cm of the anus) and one set proximal&#xD;
      (15-25cm from the anus). The region depicting the worse level of inflammation will 2 biopsies&#xD;
      will be taken from each region for histological analysis. Biopsies will be fixed and blocked&#xD;
      at each hospital site. All the paraffin blocks will be sent to Fremantle Hospital be noted.&#xD;
      Following the photos for histological analysis. Four additional biopsies will be taken from&#xD;
      each region for RNA isolation. The biopsies from each region will be placed immediately into&#xD;
      2 tubes labelled 'proximal' and 'distal' containing RNAlater and stored at -80oC. These will&#xD;
      then be sent in batches on dry ice every 3 months to the central site at Fremantle Hospital&#xD;
      for analysis. A full Mayo score will calculated to confirm the presence of active UC (Mayo&#xD;
      score between 6 and 12 required for inclusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 0: A Mayo score will be calculated using the screening endoscopic findings and treatment&#xD;
      initiated. Baseline IBDQ calculated and BP measured&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weeks 2, and 4: A modified Mayo score will be calculated, BP taken, and FBC, ESR, CRP, U&amp;E as&#xD;
      described above and the IBDQ assessed. The faecal calprotectin will be taken and stored at&#xD;
      -200C. Blood for the tacrolimus trough will be taken, the serum collected and this will be&#xD;
      stored at -20oC. The serum will then be sent on dry ice to the central site at Fremantle&#xD;
      Hospital for assessment within 2 days of collection. The medical monitor (CIA) at Fremantle&#xD;
      Hospital will review all the tacrolimus trough levels to ensure patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 8 or withdrawal: A flexible sigmoidoscopy will be undertaken ± 3 days of the week 8&#xD;
      visit (or at early withdrawal) and a full Mayo score calculated. Photos and biopsies will be&#xD;
      taken and processed as detailed at the screening sigmoidoscopy. Routine FBC, U&amp;E, ESR, CRP,&#xD;
      BP measured, and faecal calprotectin as described above&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 12: Follow-up phone call to assess any adverse events. Each histological specimen will&#xD;
      be assessed centrally at Fremantle Hospital by a blinded specialist gastroenterological&#xD;
      histopathologist. These findings will be correlated with the endoscopic scoring and photos&#xD;
      taken at endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early withdrawal from the study: Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time. If&#xD;
      the patient is withdrawing due to lack of efficacy of the study preparation 4 weeks or more&#xD;
      following the week 0 visit, they will be eligible for open label use topical tacrolimus&#xD;
      ointment for 4 weeks. A withdrawal flexible sigmoidoscopy will be required prior to the&#xD;
      supply of the topical tacrolimus ointment. Photos will be taken prior to the biopsies as&#xD;
      described for the week 0 and 8 procedures. Routine FBC, U&amp;E, ESR, CRP, BP measured,&#xD;
      tacrolimus trough levels and faecal calprotectin will be taken after 2 weeks of therapy as&#xD;
      described above. These patients will be eligible for analysis for the primary and secondary&#xD;
      end points&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim Analysis: An interim analysis by an independent statistician and clinician after 20&#xD;
      patients have completed the 8-week visit will be done to confirm the drug safety and to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy. This shall be required prior to allowing the study to continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      mRNA expression levels: Biopsies (x4) taken from two regions for the distal colon (within&#xD;
      15cm of the anus and 15-25cm from the anus). The region containing the worse inflammation&#xD;
      seen on endoscopic examination at weeks 0 and 8 (or at early withdrawal) will have been&#xD;
      noted. All samples will have been immediately placed in RNA later and stored at -800C prior&#xD;
      to transfer on dry ice to the central site at Fremantle Hospital. Levels of TNFα, IFN-γ,&#xD;
      IL-1β, IL-2, IL4, IL-10 and IL-6 mRNA expression will be determined on each group of samples.&#xD;
      Total RNA will be isolated and DNase-treated using the Qiagen 96 RNeasy® kit (Qiagen, Clifton&#xD;
      Hill, Australia) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The quality of the RNA samples&#xD;
      will be verified, reverse transcription performed and cDNA quantitated by real-time PCR using&#xD;
      QuantiTect SYBR Green Master Mix (Qiagen) on the ABI PRISM 7900HT (Applied Biosystems).&#xD;
      Specific primers for the mRNAs will be used. Dissociation curve analysis will confirm&#xD;
      specificity of amplification and copy numbers will be determined from plasmid or PCR product&#xD;
      standard curves. Target mRNA copy numbers will be normalised against reference gene copy&#xD;
      number for each cDNA sample. The above methods are already available in CIA's laboratory at&#xD;
      Fremantle Hospital. The limit of mRNA detection is 3pg/ml for all cytokines&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Comparisons between the mRNA expression in endoscopic biopsies taken at&#xD;
      weeks 0 and 8 (or at withdrawal) in the tacrolimus treatment arm will undertaken and compared&#xD;
      with each other and against those from the placebo control arm at the same time points. The&#xD;
      mRNA expression levels will be correlated with the endoscopic and histological inflammatory&#xD;
      scores. Differences between the groups will be assessed using one-way ANOVA on&#xD;
      log-transformed data. Statistical analysis will be conducted using the Statistical Package&#xD;
      for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17. Statistical significance is considered as p&lt;0.05&#xD;
      for all analyses.&#xD;
