  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that different inhalation profiles (inhalation flow rate versus time&#xD;
      curves) result from different forms of patient training. Furthermore, significant&#xD;
      inter-subject variability in these profiles should exist that can, under some circumstances,&#xD;
      depend on the design of different inhalation devices; this is because dry powder inhalers&#xD;
      have different airflow resistances. The investigators also hypothesize that the spread of&#xD;
      flow rate versus time profiles for inhalation can be collected. Finally, these profiles can&#xD;
      be analyzed from a group of human subjects and used to define a mean and statistical range of&#xD;
      inhalation flow rate versus time curves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to collect the inhalation profiles from 20 'inhaler na√Øve' healthy&#xD;
      volunteers after they have (a) read a typical inhaler package insert and (b) been formally&#xD;
      trained in inhaler use by a pharmacist. No drug exposure will occur. The data will be used&#xD;
      from this pilot study to (a) show the inter-subject variability in the inhalation profiles&#xD;
      used by adults inhaling through realistic airflow resistances (like those in inhalers)&#xD;
      following different types of training (b) show how formal training changes inhalation&#xD;
      technique and (c) provide a database of typical inspiratory profiles for use and improvement&#xD;
      of realistic tests of inhalers in the laboratory. Since pulmonary deposition from inhalers&#xD;
      greatly depends upon the way patients inhale through them, this research will result in a&#xD;
      database to improve the design and in vitro characterization of inhalers.&#xD;
