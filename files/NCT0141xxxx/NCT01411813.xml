    <textblock>
      This study examines the role of anxiety in food intake among patients with AN by measuring&#xD;
      caloric intake in a standardized, laboratory meal with alprazolam versus a placebo. Patients&#xD;
      will participate in two test meal sessions, one after receiving alprazolam and one after&#xD;
      receiving a placebo. Patients will be administered psychological measures of anxiety, mood,&#xD;
      and eating behavior. Primary outcomes include caloric intake in a laboratory test meal and&#xD;
      pre-meal anxiety levels.&#xD;

      30 patients with Anorexia Nervosa (hospitalized at NYSPI 4-Center for acute weight&#xD;
      restoration treatment) will be recruited to participate in this experiment. All subjects will&#xD;
      be screened on admission and provide informed consent prior to participation. At the time of&#xD;
      study procedures, participants will be medically stable and weigh ≥ 80% IBW. This minimum&#xD;
      weight has been identified for patient safety given the test meal procedures. Subjects will&#xD;
      participate in a total of two meal sessions on the BSU. Medical clearance will be determined&#xD;
      by 4-Center clinical staff prior to the meal sessions. Study participation will not prolong&#xD;
      nor interfere with the patient's treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first test meal will occur after the patient has reached 80% IBW. The second test meal&#xD;
      will occur within a week of the first. The procedures are identical for the two test&#xD;
      sessions, and were based on those described by Sysko and colleagues (9). On the morning of&#xD;
      the test meal, participants will be provided a standardized breakfast of ~300 kcal. They will&#xD;
      not consume any additional food or liquid, other than water, prior to the test meal session&#xD;
      approximately 4 hours later. Study medication will be administered at 10:00 am.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test meals will be conducted on the Biological Studies Unit (BSU) at NYSPI. Participants will&#xD;
      be escorted to and from the BSU by research staff. Participants will complete questionnaires&#xD;
      prior to receiving medication, prior to each test meal, and after the test meal is complete&#xD;
      (see Table). Participants will be presented with an 83 fluid ounce covered opaque container&#xD;
      with a straw on a table. Inside the container will be approximately 1500 grams (approximately&#xD;
      1560 kcal) of strawberry yogurt shake. Patients will be informed that the meal consists of a&#xD;
      strawberry yogurt shake, but will not be informed as to the amount provided in the container.&#xD;
      Instructions before each test meal will inform patients that they should eat as much of the&#xD;
      shake as they would like, and that the meal would serve as their lunch for the day. The&#xD;
      participant will be alone in the room. For compliance and safety, patients will be observed&#xD;
      through a closed circuit video monitor during the meal. The patient will be instructed to&#xD;
      signal completion of the meal by ringing a bell. During the course of the meal, patients will&#xD;
      be asked to rate anxiety periodically. After the test meal is complete, a staff member will&#xD;
      debrief the participant and address any questions or concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication Administration: Participants will receive active medication (alprazolam 0.75 mg)&#xD;
      on one test day and placebo on the other, in random order. Dose was selected based on the&#xD;
      findings of Evans et al (8), who demonstrated statistically significant increases in caloric&#xD;
      intake with doses of alprazolam 0.5 mg and 0.75 mg. Medication will be administered 2 hours&#xD;
      prior to the test meal, as this is the timing of estimated peak plasma concentration (8).&#xD;
