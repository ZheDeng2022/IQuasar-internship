    <textblock>
      Background: Data generated with the body composition monitor (BCM, Fresenius) show based on&#xD;
      bioimpedance technology, that chronic fluid overload in hemodialysis patients is associated&#xD;
      with poor survival. However, removing excess fluid by lowering dry weight can be accompanied&#xD;
      by intradialytic and postdialytic complications. Here, we aim at testing the hypothesis that,&#xD;
      in comparison to conventional hemodialysis, blood-volume monitored regulation of&#xD;
      ultrafiltration and dialysate conductivity (UCR) and/or regulation of ultrafiltration and&#xD;
      temperature (UTR) will decrease complications when ultrafiltration volumes are systematically&#xD;
      increased in fluid overloaded hemodialysis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/Design: BCM-measurements yield results on fluid overload (in liters), relative to&#xD;
      extracellular water (ECW). In this prospective, multicenter, triple-arm, parallel group,&#xD;
      cross-over, randomized, controlled clinical trial, we use BCM-measurements, routinely&#xD;
      introduced in our 3 maintenance hemodialysis centers shortly prior to the start of the study,&#xD;
      to recruit 60 hemodialysis patients with fluid overload (defined as ≥15% ECW). Patients are&#xD;
      randomized 1:1:1 into UCR, UTR and conventional hemodialysis groups. BCM-determined, 'final'&#xD;
      dry weight is set as -7% ECW postdialysis, and reached by reducing the previous dry weight,&#xD;
      in steps of 0.1 kg per 10 kg body weight, during 12 hemodialysis sessions (one study phase).&#xD;
      In case of intradialytic complications, dry weight reduction is decreased, according to a&#xD;
      pre-specified algorithm. A comparison of intra- and postdialytic complications among study&#xD;
      groups constitutes the primary endpoint. In addition, we will assess relative weight&#xD;
      reduction, changes in residual renal function, quality of life measures, and predialysis&#xD;
      levels of various laboratory parameters including C-reactive protein, troponin T, and&#xD;
      N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, before and after the first study phase (secondary&#xD;
      outcome parameters).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: Patients are not requested to revert to their initial degree of fluid overload&#xD;
      after each study phase, Therefore, the cross-over design of the present study merely serves&#xD;
      the purpose of secondary end-point evaluation, for example to determine patient choice of&#xD;
      treatment modality. Previous studies on blood volume monitoring have yielded inconsistent&#xD;
      results. Since we include only patients with BCM-determined fluid overload, we expect a&#xD;
      benefit for all study participants, due to strict fluid management which decreases the&#xD;
      mortality risk of hemodialysis patients.&#xD;

      Hypothesis In comparison to conventional hemodialysis, regulation of ultrafiltration and&#xD;
      dialysate conductivity (UCR) and/or regulation of ultrafiltration and temperature (UTR) will&#xD;
      decrease intra- and postdialytic complications when ultrafiltration volumes are&#xD;
      systematically increased in fluid overloaded hemodialysis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and Outcome Measures The primary objective is to demonstrate superiority of&#xD;
      ultrafiltration and dialysate conductivity regulation (UCR) and/or ultrafiltration and&#xD;
      temperature regulation (UTR) over conventional hemodialysis, in preventing intra- and&#xD;
      postdialytic complications, when fluid overloaded hemodialysis patients receive systematic&#xD;
      fluid reduction, to reach a final dry weight of 7% ECW postdialysis. The primary outcome&#xD;
      measure is the total number of hemodialysis sessions per patient that were accompanied,&#xD;
      intra- or postdialytically, by at least one symptom most likely related to fluid withdrawal&#xD;
      (as specified in Table 1), divided by the number of hemodialysis sessions at risk (as by&#xD;
      study protocol: 12 sessions per patient in study phase 1). Both groups, UCR and UTR, will be&#xD;
      compared against the conventional hemodialysis group, and afterwards against one another,&#xD;
      using the two-sided Student's t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To demonstrate superiority of ultrafiltration and dialysate conductivity regulation&#xD;
           (UCR) and/or ultrafiltration and temperature regulation (UTR) over conventional&#xD;
           hemodialysis, in preventing specific intradialytic complications:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. intradialytic cramping&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. clinically asymptomatic, intradialytic hypotension (&gt;40 mmHg drop in systolic blood&#xD;
                pressure within 30 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. clinically symptomatic, intradialytic hypotension (&gt;40 mmHg drop in systolic blood&#xD;
                pressure within 30 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. clinically symptomatic, intradialytic hypotension (even if it is not possible to&#xD;
                identify a sudden drop in blood pressure, e.g. patients may slowly move towards low&#xD;
                blood pressure values [f. ex. below 100 mmHg systolic blood pressure], and report&#xD;
                symptoms)&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. unspecified intradialytic symptoms or events, which are most likely related to&#xD;
                fluid withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. patient-reported postdialysis complication, most likely related to fluid withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
           when fluid overloaded hemodialysis patients receive systematic fluid reduction, to reach&#xD;
           a final dry weight of -7% ECW postdialysis. The secondary outcome measure for objective&#xD;
           [a] is the total number of hemodialysis sessions per patient which were accompanied by&#xD;
           the respective symptom most likely related to fluid withdrawal (1 to 6), divided by the&#xD;
           number of hemodialysis sessions at risk (as by study protocol: 12 sessions per patient&#xD;
           in study phase 1). Both groups, UCR and UTR, will be compared against the conventional&#xD;
           hemodialysis group, and afterwards against one another, using the two-sided Student's&#xD;
           t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To demonstrate superiority of UCR and/or UTR over conventional hemodialysis in allowing&#xD;
           patients to reach a lower body weight, relative to his/her postdialysis weight at the&#xD;
           beginning of study phase 1 (time zero). The secondary outcome measure for objective [b]&#xD;
           is the difference in postdialysis body weight from time zero to the end of study phase&#xD;
           1, divided by the postdialysis body weight at time zero.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Example: If a patient has a postdialysis body weight of 65 kg at time zero (the last&#xD;
           hemodialysis session before the first dry weight reduction), and reaches a postdialysis&#xD;
           body weight of 62 kg at the end of the first study phase, his difference in body weight&#xD;
           will be 65 kg - 62 kg =3 kg. Relative to this patient's postdialysis body weight at time&#xD;
           zero, weight reduction from beginning to end of study phase 1 will be 3/65*100=4.61%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The relative weight reduction in both groups, UCR and UTR, will be compared against the&#xD;
           conventional hemodialysis group, and afterwards against one another, using the two-sided&#xD;
           Student's t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess if stricter volume control in fluid overloaded patients (using UCR, UTR or&#xD;
           conventional hemodialysis) diminishes residual renal function. The secondary outcome&#xD;
           measure for objective [c] is the difference in 24h urine volume from time zero to the&#xD;
           end of study phase 1, divided by the urine volume at time zero. The relative urine&#xD;
           reduction in both groups, UCR and UTR, will be compared against the conventional&#xD;
           hemodialysis group, and afterwards against one another, using the two-sided Student's&#xD;
           t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the amount of sodium transferred to the patient or withdrawn from the patient&#xD;
           during conventional hemodialysis, UCR and UTR.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The amount of sodium removed during hemodialysis is a function of the ultrafiltration&#xD;
           volume, the effective diffusion gradient for sodium, and diffusive sodium clearance. The&#xD;
           effective diffusion gradient depends on the plasma water - dialysate sodium (DNa)&#xD;
           difference, and the Gibbs-Donnan coefficient, the latter being a function of the plasma&#xD;
           protein concentration but also being influenced by other ions in the dialysate. The&#xD;
           assumption that sodium removal by ultrafiltration is equal to the plasma water sodium&#xD;
           concentration, multiplied by the ultrafiltration volume, is a simplification.&#xD;
           Electrolyte balances may also be influenced by the membrane charge. Therefore, the&#xD;
           amount of sodium transferred will be measured on the dialysate side. Sodium transfer&#xD;
           will be calculated from the difference between the mean sodium concentration in&#xD;
           partially collected, used dialysate and the fresh DNa concentration, multiplied by the&#xD;
           total amount of dialysate used. Results will be compared to a two pool sodium model and&#xD;
           parameters of the model will be adjusted using the measured transfer data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The above described method is not applicable to the UCR group because the sodium&#xD;
           concentration of fresh dialysate is not kept constant during treatment. In order to&#xD;
           establish the model, we will measure at least 10 patients during 3 hemodialysis&#xD;
           sessions, and due to the formerly stated, we can only use the dialysate from patients in&#xD;
           the conventional hemodialysis group and in the UTR group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           However, after having established this model, sodium transfer for all patients -&#xD;
           conventional, UTR, and UCR - can be calculated using this very model.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The amount of sodium transferred to or withdrawn from the patient will be calculated for&#xD;
           each patient, according to the model established in the way stated here above. The&#xD;
           secondary outcome measure for objective [d], e.g. the sodium transferred in both groups,&#xD;
           UCR and UTR, will be compared against the conventional hemodialysis group, and&#xD;
           afterwards against one another, using the two-sided Student's t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess if stricter volume control by conventional hemodialysis, UCR and/or UTR&#xD;
           influences predialysis serum concentrations of (1) C-reactive protein, (2) D-dimer, (3)&#xD;
           fibrinogen, (4) troponin T, (5) N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide. These&#xD;
           proteins are used as read-outs for inflammation (1, 2, 3), coagulation (2, 3), and&#xD;
           cardiac function (4, 5) and are routinely determined at all three participating centers.&#xD;
           The secondary outcome measure for objective [e], e.g. the concentrations of the&#xD;
           indicated laboratory parameters in both groups, UCR and UTR, at time zero and at the end&#xD;
           of study phase 1, will be compared against the conventional hemodialysis group, and&#xD;
           afterwards against one another, using the two-sided Student's t-test. The individual&#xD;
           change in these parameters, from time zero to the end of study phase 1, will be compared&#xD;
           likewise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To assess if stricter volume control in fluid overloaded patients (using UCR, UTR or&#xD;
           conventional hemodialysis) affects the concentration of various proteins that might&#xD;
           serve as novel biomarkers (including high density lipoprotein [HDL]-associated&#xD;
           surfactant protein B, HDL-associated serum amyloid A, HDL-associated apoC-II, plasma&#xD;
           tryptophan, plasma choline, plasma trimethylanine-N-oxide; plasma endotoxin).&#xD;
&#xD;
           We have recently discovered that various proteins, including those mentioned here above,&#xD;
           may render HDL dysfunctional, in hemodialysis patients. Especially with surfactant, we&#xD;
           suspect an association with fluid overload. Moreover, plasma tryptophan, plasma choline,&#xD;
           and plasma trimethylanine-N-oxide are markers of end stage renal disease. Since one or&#xD;
           several of these proteins or molecules might serve as novel biomarkers, we would like to&#xD;
           use the context of the present trial to establish diagnostic assays and analyze&#xD;
           potential changes in the serum concentration of these proteins, before and after fluid&#xD;
           removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Endotoxin, found in the cell membranes of gram-negative bacteria, is a biomarker&#xD;
           representing the gut flora. Endotoxin has been shown to be associated with inflammation,&#xD;
           nutritional status and even mortality in hemodialysis patients. An incremental rise in&#xD;
           endotoxin levels has been shown along with the progression of chronic kidney disease,&#xD;
           and especially initiation of hemodialysis. It has been suggested that hemodialysis&#xD;
           patients might have high endotoxin levels in the blood due to repeated bacterial&#xD;
           translocation from the gut during hemodialysis, secondary to intradialytic changes in&#xD;
           blood pressure and/or tissue perfusion. An association with chronic fluid overload has&#xD;
           not yet been established, but might be suspected, as a consequence of higher&#xD;
           ultrafiltration rates and thus decreased intradialytic stability. Here we will measure&#xD;
           endotoxin levels with an amebocyte limulus assay in all study patients, at time zero and&#xD;
           at the end of study phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary outcome measure for objective [f], for example HDL-associated serum&#xD;
           amyloid A in both groups, UCR and UTR, at time zero and at the end of study phase 1,&#xD;
           will be compared against the conventional hemodialysis group, and afterwards against one&#xD;
           another, using the two-sided Student's t-test. The individual change in these&#xD;
           parameters, from time zero to the end of study phase 1, will be compared likewise. The&#xD;
           results of this secondary endpoint analysis will be published separately from the&#xD;
           clinical results of the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To assess if stricter volume control in fluid overloaded patients (using UCR, UTR or&#xD;
           conventional hemodialysis) affects quality of life measures. The secondary outcome&#xD;
           measures for objective [g] are the mental component summary (MCS) and physical component&#xD;
           summary (PCS) derived from the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form (KDQoL-SFTM).&#xD;
           The scale of both summary scores is 0-100 (higher indicating better quality of life).&#xD;
           MCS and PCS in both groups, UCR and UTR, at time zero and at the end of study phase 1,&#xD;
           will be compared against the conventional hemodialysis group, and afterwards against one&#xD;
           another, using the two-sided Student's t-test. The individual change in these&#xD;
           parameters, from time zero to the end of study phase 1, will be compared likewise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To demonstrate superiority of UCR and/or UTR over conventional hemodialysis in reducing&#xD;
           dialysis complications when previously fluid overloaded patients are entering phase 2&#xD;
           and phase 3 of the presented study. In study phases 2 and 3, patients either have to&#xD;
           reduce their dry weight further, or else have to maintain their newly reached dry&#xD;
           weight. The secondary outcome measures for objective [h] are potentially all of the&#xD;
           items described here above, and will be compared against the conventional hemodialysis&#xD;
           group, and afterwards against one another, in the same fashion as described here above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. To assess which hemodialysis treatment modality will be chosen by the patients at the&#xD;
           end of the study. The choice of treatment will be compared as follows: (1) number of&#xD;
           patients choosing UCR-treatment against number of patients choosing conventional&#xD;
           treatment; (2) number of patients choosing UTR-treatment against number of patients&#xD;
           choosing conventional treatment; (3) number of patients choosing UCR-treatment against&#xD;
           number of patients choosing UTR-treatment. The statistical test for analyses (1), (2)&#xD;
           and (3) will be the two-sided chi square test, for each analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Superiority definition For all objectives listed, superiority will be assumed if a&#xD;
      statistically significant difference between one group versus another group can be&#xD;
      determined. With regards to the primary endpoint, according to our sample size calculation&#xD;
      (see below), this study is suited to detect a minimal difference of 10% between groups.&#xD;
