      People with respiratory infection, asthmatic patients and cystic fibrosis (CF) patients&#xD;
      suffer from a multitude of pathologies of airways and are often inflicted with chronic cough.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of cough in these patients consists of many types of expectorants, cough&#xD;
      suppressors, secretion modifiers, inhaled bronchodilators etc. In addition, chest physical&#xD;
      therapy (PT) is often prescribed as part of the treatment regime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of coughing is currently subjective and based on the symptoms qualitative&#xD;
      description as expressed by the patient or parent. Quantitative and objective methods for&#xD;
      cough assessment are not available beyond the investigative laboratory and are unique to the&#xD;
      specific investigator.&#xD;

      Cough is part of the defense mechanism to protect the lung from foreign particles and remove&#xD;
      secretions from the airways . While the cough reflex is essential in protecting the lung from&#xD;
      foreign materials and infection, its excessive or chronic presence is both bothersome and&#xD;
      might interfere with the quality of life, sleep pattern and exercise tolerance of the&#xD;
      patient. Such a symptom may potentially be indicative of an on-going pathological process , .&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with respiratory infection, asthmatic patients and CF patients suffer from a multitude&#xD;
      of pathologies of airways and are often inflicted with chronic cough.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of cough in these patients consists of many types of expectorants, cough&#xD;
      suppressors, secretion modifiers, inhaled bronchodilators etc. In addition, chest physical&#xD;

&#xD;
      The assessment of coughing is currently subjective and based on the symptoms qualitative&#xD;
      description as expressed by the patient or parent. Quantitative and objective methods for&#xD;
      cough assessment are not available beyond the investigative laboratory and are unique to the&#xD;
      specific investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and validity of novel cough&#xD;
      counting device based on the WIM Technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PulmoTrack™ technology includes the PulmoTrack™ 3010/5050 devices that are intended for&#xD;
      the analysis, interpretation and recording of lung sounds, and the Automatic Cough Counting&#xD;
      Application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recording of the lung sounds will be performed by a PulmoTrack™ 3010/5050 device. The&#xD;
      lung sounds can subsequently be analyzed for the presence of wheezes and for the presence of&#xD;
      cough by the Automatic Cough Counting Application (ACCA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technology enables accurate cough count and timing as well as wheeze detection over time.&#xD;
