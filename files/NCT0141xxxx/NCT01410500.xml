    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to expand upon the safety data for carfilzomib by providing&#xD;
      expanded access to patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who are unable to&#xD;
      enroll in any other ongoing carfilzomib trial.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, expanded access, open label study of carfilzomib for patients with&#xD;
      relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. The study is designed to provide access to patients&#xD;
      with relapsed and refractory disease that have received at least 4 prior regimens and are not&#xD;
      eligible for any other enrolling carfilzomib Onyx-sponsored studies enrolling patients in the&#xD;
      United States.&#xD;

    <description>Carfilzomib was administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion over approximately 10 minutes on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of repeated 28-day cycles at a dose of 20 mg/m² on Days 1 and 2 of Cycle 1 and 27 mg/m² for all infusions thereafter until Cycle 12. For Cycle 13 and higher for those still receiving carfilzomib, the carfilzomib infusion schedule was abridged to Days 1, 2, 15, and 16 of each subsequent 28-day cycle. Carfilzomib treatment was continued until disease progression, diagnosis of a new malignancy, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or the study was terminated</description>

&#xD;
               -  Measurable plasmacytoma &gt; 2 cm as determined by clinical examination or&#xD;
                  applicable radiographs (ie, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], computed tomography&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Nonresponsive to most recent therapy (eg, stable disease only, or progressive&#xD;
                  disease while on treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Disease progression within 60 days of discontinuation of most recent therapy&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Pregnancy or breastfeeding.&#xD;
