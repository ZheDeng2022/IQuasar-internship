  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this post market clinical study is to collect prospective clinical data to&#xD;
      confirm the efficacy of RF Kyphoplasty for the treatment of pathological fractures of the&#xD;
      spine caused by multiple myeloma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myeloma is the commonest primary cancer affecting the spine. Painful vertebral compression&#xD;
      fractures (VCFs) affect approximately 30% of myeloma patients. As myeloma patients live&#xD;
      longer, it is especially relevant to provide the best available treatment for pain and reduce&#xD;
      disabilities that can result from VCFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cement delivery is a well established treatment method for treating painful vertebrae&#xD;
      compromised by tumor and/or osteoporosis. The StabiliT Vertebral Augmentation System (DFine&#xD;
      Inc.) is a unique percutaneous vertebral augmentation system designed to provide the&#xD;
      physician a means of creating targeted cavities and an ultra-high viscosity cement (using RF&#xD;
      Energy) that can be delivered over an extended period of time in order to allow for&#xD;
      controlled, targeted vertebral augmentation in multiple myeloma patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of multiple myeloma and evidence of myelomatous lesions in the spine,&#xD;
             including plasmacytomas, lytic lesions and fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. One to 6 painful (pain on palpation/percussion over fractured vertebral body) VCF(s),&#xD;
             T3-L5, with bone marrow edema imaged by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Subjects&#xD;
             with 4-6 fractures treatment will be divided into two sessions 1- 7 days apart)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of fracture related pain less than ≤ 3 months old&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pain VAS score ≥4 on a scale of 0 to 10. When the subject is newly diagnosed with&#xD;
             multiple myeloma, the pain assessment must not be done until after completion of at&#xD;
             least one pulse of steroid therapy or one week after the initiation of active multiple&#xD;
             myeloma chemotherapy. Pain represents worst pain without use of narcotic medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire score ≥ 10 on 0 to 24 scale&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects is ≥ 21 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. No change in chemotherapy regimen (change in dose(s) permitted) for 1 month prior to&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. No change in chemotherapy regimen (change in dose(s) permitted) planned for at least 1&#xD;
             month following enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject has no major surgery to the spine planned for at least 1 month following&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject has sufficient mental capacity to comply with the protocol requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject must be willing and able to comply with specified follow-up evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject understands the potential risks and benefits of participating in the study and&#xD;
             is willing to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Female subjects must either be no longer capable of reproduction or taking acceptable&#xD;
             measures to prevent pregnancy during the study&#xD;

             function&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has VCF morphology deemed unsuitable for RF Kyphoplasty (e.g. vertebral&#xD;

             chronic back pain unrelated to index VCF(s). Subjects who receive high-dose steroids&#xD;
             for treatment of their cancer (for at least 30 days) are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with a platelet count of &lt; 20,000&#xD;
