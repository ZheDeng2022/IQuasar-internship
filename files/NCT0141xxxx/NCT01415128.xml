      This study will compare the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole, rosiglitazone and desipramine&#xD;
      when administered with a single oral dose of avanafil in healthy male subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be three cohorts in this Phase I, single-center, open-label, crossover study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A (omeprazole): This is a open-label, non-randomized, one-sequence crossover study&#xD;
      design, in which 20 healthy male subjects will be enrolled and administered a single oral&#xD;
      dose of 40 mg omeprazole once daily for 8 days (Days 1-8) plus a single oral dose of 200 mg&#xD;
      avanafil on Day 8. On Days 7 and 8, avanafil and/or omeprazole doses will be administered&#xD;
      following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be confined at the Clinical Research Unit the day prior to the omeprazole&#xD;
      administration on Day 7 and will remain confined for approximately 13 hours following the&#xD;
      dosing on Day 8. Blood samples for determination of plasma omeprazole concentrations will be&#xD;
      obtained from all subjects at 0 (10 minutes pre-dose), 20, 40 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3,&#xD;
      4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 hours post-dose on Days 7 and 8. Pre-dose blood samples for determination&#xD;
      of omeprazole will also be taken in the morning on Days 5-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B (rosiglitazone): This is a randomized, open-label, two-period crossover study&#xD;
      design, in which 20 male subjects will be randomized to receive the following treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment A: a single oral dose of 8 mg rosiglitazone following an overnight fast of at&#xD;
           least 10 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment B: a single oral dose of 8 mg rosiglitazone plus a single oral dose of 200 mg&#xD;
           avanafil following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two treatments in the cohort will be separated by a washout period of at least 7 days.&#xD;
      All subjects will be confined at the Clinical Research Unit approximately from the morning of&#xD;
      Day -1 to the morning of Day 2 in both treatment periods. Blood samples for determination of&#xD;
      plasma rosiglitazone concentrations will be obtained from all subjects at 0 (10 minutes&#xD;
      pre-dose) and 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16 and 24 hours post-dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort C (desipramine): This is a randomized, open-label, two-period, crossover study design,&#xD;
      in which 20subjects identified as CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (determined by genotyping)&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive the following treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment A: a single oral dose of 50 mg desipramine following an overnight fast of at&#xD;
           least 10 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment B: a single oral dose of 50 mg desipramine plus a single oral dose of 200 mg&#xD;
           avanafil following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. The avanafil dose will be&#xD;
           administered 2 hours after the desipramine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two treatments in the cohort will be separated by a washout period of at least 10 days.&#xD;
      All subjects will be confined at the Clinical Research Unit from the morning of Day -1 to the&#xD;
      morning of Day 2 in both treatment periods. Blood samples for determination of plasma&#xD;
      desipramine concentrations will be obtained from all subjects at 0 (10 minutes pre-dose) and&#xD;
      1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post-dose. Subjects will visit the study site&#xD;
      as outpatients in the morning for their remaining PK blood sample collection on Days 3-5.&#xD;
