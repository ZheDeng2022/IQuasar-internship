  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sub-Saharan Africa is the region most affected by the global Human Immunodeficiency Virus&#xD;
      (HIV) epidemic. A vaccine is the most promising preventive approach against new HIV&#xD;
      infections. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 4&#xD;
      experimental preventive HIV vaccine regimens in HIV-uninfected adults in South Africa.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The worldwide Human Immunodeficiency Virus / Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS)&#xD;
      epidemic may only be controlled through development and utilization of a safe and effective&#xD;
      vaccine that will prevent HIV infection. Due to the high prevalence of HIV-1 subtype C in&#xD;
      southern Africa, the South African AIDS Vaccine Initiative (SAAVI), the HIV Vaccine Trials&#xD;
      Network (HVTN), Novartis, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases&#xD;
      (NIAID) are evaluating three subtype C HIV vaccines, SAAVI DNA-C2, SAAVI MVA-C, and Novartis&#xD;
      Subtype C gp140 through this study. These vaccines will be used together in four prime-boost&#xD;
      regimens. The SAAVI DNA-C2 vaccine is a multigene deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) vaccine&#xD;
      consisting of two DNA plasmids in equal amounts that express an HIV-1 subtype C polyprotein&#xD;
      comprising of Gag-Reverse Transcriptase-Tat-Nef and an HIV-1 subtype C truncated Env. SAAVI&#xD;
      MVA-C is a recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine expressing the same immunogens&#xD;
      as the SAAVI DNA-C2 vaccine. MVA is a highly attenuated vaccinia virus. The Novartis protein&#xD;
      subunit vaccine is a Subtype C oligomeric V2 loop deleted glycoprotein 140 (gp140) vaccine&#xD;
      (gp140[delta]V2.TV1), given with MF59 adjuvant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is designed to build upon the Thai RV144 HIV vaccine trial, which demonstrated an&#xD;
      efficacy of 31.2% among participants who received a different vaccine regimen of a pox prime&#xD;
      followed by a concurrently-administered protein boost. This primary purpose of HVTN 086 is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of SAAVI DNA-C2, SAAVI MVA-C and Novartis Clade C&#xD;
      gp140TV1ΔV2 with MF59 adjuvant in various vaccination regimens. The primary analysis will&#xD;
      focus on a ranking strategy of the vaccine regimens that is guided by measurements of the&#xD;
      immune responses elicited by these vaccines and their respective modes of delivery in various&#xD;
      combinations, both sequential and concurrent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will actively participate in this study for 12 months. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive either a prime-boost preventive vaccine regimen or placebo. Four&#xD;
      prime-boost preventive vaccine regimens will be compared; each participant will be randomized&#xD;
      to one of 4 groups. Participants in Group 1 will receive MVA-C at months 0 and 1, and&#xD;
      gp140/MF59 at months 3 and 6. Group 2 will receive MVA-C and gp140/MF59 at months 1 and 3.&#xD;
      Group 3 will receive DNA-C at months 0 and 1, and MVA-C at months 3 and 6. Group 4 will&#xD;
      receive DNA-C at months 0 and 1, and both MVA-C and gp140/MF59 at months 3 and 6. Additional&#xD;
      study visits will occur at Weeks 2, 6, 13, 14, 26, 28, 36, and 48. All participants will be&#xD;
      contacted once annually for 3 years and asked questions about their health. Study procedures&#xD;
      include physical exams, blood and urine collection, HIV testing, an electrocardiogram, and&#xD;
      questionnaire. Some blood collected from participants will be stored and used in future&#xD;
      research. Risk-reduction counseling will be conducted at all study visits.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. HIV vaccine(s) received in a prior HIV vaccine trial. For potential participants who&#xD;
             have received control/placebo in an HIV vaccine trial, the HVTN 086 / SAAVI 103 PSRT&#xD;
             will determine eligibility on a case-by-case basis.&#xD;

             experimental vaccine trial, the HVTN 086 / SAAVI 103 PSRT will determine eligibility&#xD;
             on a case-by-case basis. For potential participants who have received an experimental&#xD;
             vaccine(s) greater than 5 years ago, eligibility for enrollment will be determined by&#xD;

               -  If a person has been diagnosed with hypertension during screening or previously,&#xD;

&#xD;
         32. Seizure disorder (Not excluded: a participant with a history of seizures who has not&#xD;
             required medications or had a seizure within the past 3 years.)&#xD;
