      adjuvant breast cancer patients in a pre-surgical setting.&#xD;

      Primary Objective: To evaluate the molecular changes which occur in human breast cancer&#xD;
      tissue after short-term exposure to dasatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot; To evaluate the molecular effects of short term dasatinib exposure in peripheral blood and&#xD;
      on SRC (an oncogene) and EPHA2 signaling pathways in non-tumor cells (peripheral blood).&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot; To correlate the pharmacokinetic parameters with molecular changes detected in breast&#xD;
      cancer tissues and peripheral blood &quot; To evaluate the tolerability and safety of short-term&#xD;
      exposure to daily dose of 100 mg twice daily of dasatinib administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be registered to receive dasatinib 100 mg orally twice daily starting&#xD;
      within 8 days from the time of registration and continuing to the time of the definitive&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Treatment &quot; No more than 8 days should elapse from the time of registration to&#xD;
      the time of the first dose of dasatinib &quot; No more than 28 days should elapse from the time of&#xD;
      the initial diagnosis to the time of the first dose of dasatinib &quot; Minimum duration of&#xD;
      treatment with dasatinib is 14 days with a minimum of 10 consecutive days of treatment&#xD;
      immediately prior to the definitive surgery &quot; Dasatinib shall be administered until the day&#xD;
      prior to the definitive surgery &quot; No more than 45 days should elapse from the time of the&#xD;
      initial diagnosis to the time of the definitive surgery i.e. maximum duration of treatment&#xD;
      with dasatinib is 45 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core Biopsies: Tumor sample must be collected at the time of the initial diagnosis (or in a&#xD;
      subsequent procedure) either by core needle or incisional biopsy. Excisional biopsy will not&#xD;
      be allowed. A minimum of 4 core biopsies (or the equivalent with an incisional biopsy) is&#xD;
      required to perform the molecular analyses. Once the core biopsies have been removed, the&#xD;
      samples must be immediately snap-frozen, then stored in liquid nitrogen or at -70 to -80 C at&#xD;
      the site. Samples will be shipped to the UCLA laboratory within 30 days of collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor Tissue at the time of Definitive Surgery: A second tumor sample (post-dasatinib) must&#xD;
      be collected at the time of the patient's surgery in the same manner as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unstained paraffin slides: While most analyses will be performed on the frozen tissue, some&#xD;
      molecular testing may require paraffin embedded tissue. The pathology department will be&#xD;
      asked to send 4, 5 micron thick, unstained paraffin slides of each the pretreatment&#xD;
      (diagnosis biopsy) and from the definitive surgery (8 slides in total) Definitive Surgery:&#xD;
      The type of definitive surgery performed will be according to the institution's guidelines.&#xD;
      In the event that a sentinel node biopsy procedure is performed, the dye can be injected into&#xD;
      the tumor bed after tumor removal. The dye should not be injected into the tumor itself as&#xD;
      this may alter the tissue and affect the molecular analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic plasma samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cells samples will be&#xD;
      collected at the following time points (5 samples each):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline, prior to the first dose of dasatinib. Timing of collection: anytime between&#xD;
           registration and the first dose of dasatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Last day of dasatinib (= on the day prior to surgery) Timing of Collection: patient&#xD;
           should be asked to come into the clinic before taking her last morning dose of&#xD;
           dasatinib. Blood can be drawn immediately prior to her taking the tablet in the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Last day of dasatinib (= on the day prior to surgery) Timing of Collection: 2-3 hours&#xD;
           after the last morning dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Last day of dasatinib (= on the day prior to surgery) Timing of Collection: 6-8m hours&#xD;
           after the last morning dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. On the day of surgery Timing of Collection: as close as possible to the surgery (+/- 1&#xD;
           hour) Patients will be requested to document the date and time of each dose consumed as&#xD;
           well as any details concerning a drug holiday in the patient diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples from all patients are required to all for the relatively large variability in&#xD;
      dasatinib pharmacokinetics (interpatient coefficient of variation is approximately 65 %) The&#xD;
      samples will be centrifuged, processed, and shipped. Results from the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      analysis will be correlated with the molecular data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Patients: 60 evaluable patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate molecular changes occurring in breast&#xD;
      cancer tissue following short-term dasatinib administration. Based on pre-clinical data&#xD;
      supporting the role of Src in &quot;triple-negative&quot; breast cancer, the study will aim for 50% of&#xD;
      evaluable patients be of this subtype defined as being negative for ER, PR, and HER2&#xD;
      amplification. In cases where HER2 amplification is not determined by FISH at diagnosis, HER2&#xD;
      staining by IHC of 0 or 1+ will be considered negative for enrolment purposes. After 30, 40,&#xD;
      and 50 evaluable patients have been accrued, enrolment may be adjusted to reach the goal of&#xD;
      30 triple-negative patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to compare the pre- and post-treatment molecular&#xD;
      findings. A statistical Analysis Plan (SAO) will be finalized at the latest prior to database&#xD;
      lock and the analysis details will be provided in the SAP. Descriptive statistics will be&#xD;
      used to describe the incidence of adverse events and toxicity, as well as the number of&#xD;
      patients in who the study medication was permanently stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping Rules:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment is completed according to protocol planned sample size, and assessments and&#xD;
      requirements are completed as per protocol, the stated objectives of the trial are achieved,&#xD;
      recommendation by DMC. Patients may withdraw from the trial at any time at their own request,&#xD;
      or they may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor if&#xD;
      continuation of the study would be detrimental to the patient's well being, such as objective&#xD;
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance, second primary malignancy, or&#xD;
      logistical considerations&#xD;
