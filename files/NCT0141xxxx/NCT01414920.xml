    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of TAK-875, once daily&#xD;
      (QD), in combination with sitagliptin QD in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (T2DM).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TAK-875 is being developed at Takeda Global Research and Development, Inc. as an adjunct to&#xD;
      diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sitagliptin is an inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) approved as an adjunct to diet&#xD;
      and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the effects of the combination of TAK-875 with a DDP-4 inhibitor&#xD;
      on glycosylated hemoglobin reduction.&#xD;
