      Rationale for the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      (PD) profile of Avonex in Chinese healthy volunteer subjects. Data from this study will be&#xD;
      used to support registration of Avonex in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multiple-dose, single-arm, open-label, PK/PD and safety study. Four weekly&#xD;
      injections of Avonex will be administered intramuscularly (IM). Frequent (intensive) blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected with the first and fourth injections of Avonex, and a sparse blood&#xD;
      sample will be collected with the second and third injections of Avonex.&#xD;

      Rationale for the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;

      (PD) profile of Avonex in Chinese healthy volunteer subjects. Data from this study will be&#xD;
      used to support registration of Avonex in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multiple-dose, single-arm, open-label, PK/PD and safety study. Four weekly&#xD;
      injections of Avonex will be administered intramuscularly (IM). Frequent (intensive) blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected with the first and fourth injections of Avonex, and a sparse blood&#xD;
      sample will be collected with the second and third injections of Avonex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four Avonex IM injections will be administered in this study. Due to the long-term use of&#xD;
      Avonex by MS patients, a multiple-dose PK/PD study is necessary in order to provide adequate&#xD;
      information to evaluate changes in drug concentrations over time in Chinese healthy subjects.&#xD;
      Serum levels of interferon beta in Caucasian healthy volunteers have been shown to peak&#xD;
      between 3 and 15 hours after administration of Avonex IM at the dose being used in this study&#xD;
      and have been shown to decline at a rate consistent with a 10-hour elimination half-life;&#xD;
      therefore, accumulation of interferon beta following multiple weekly Avonex IM injections is&#xD;
      not anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure of healthy subjects to multiple doses of Avonex in this study is not anticipated to&#xD;
      present safety or tolerability issues based on experience from previous Avonex studies that&#xD;
      have been conducted in healthy volunteer subjects and MS patients. Flu-like symptoms&#xD;
      associated with this dose of Avonex have generally been mostly of mild-to-moderate intensity&#xD;
      and of short duration, typically experienced within the first 24 hours after injection.&#xD;
      Prophylactic analgesic medication must be administered prior to each Avonex injection during&#xD;
      the study which is a recommended practice with the use of interferon therapies in order to&#xD;
      ameliorate flu-like symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Location:&#xD;
&#xD;
      China, at 1 Phase 1 study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Treatment and Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 2 months, including a 28-day Screening and Baseline period, a 3-week Treatment&#xD;
      and blood sampling period and a 14-day Follow-Up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK/PD parameters will be calculated using non-compartmental methods. Summary statistics for&#xD;
      each PK/PD parameter will be calculated. Mean concentration values will be plotted over time&#xD;
      both on a linear and a logarithmic scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized. Vital signs will be examined to&#xD;
      determine the incidence of clinically relevant abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory evaluations will be assessed to determine the incidence of abnormalities. Changes&#xD;
      in laboratory evaluations will be summarized using shift tables and summary statistics.&#xD;
