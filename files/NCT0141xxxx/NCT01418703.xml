      In this protocol the investigators plan to demonstrate the feasibility of a modular insulin&#xD;
      management system based on continuous glucose monitoring and targeted towards the avoidance&#xD;
      of hypoglycemic and prolonged hyperglycemic episodes (i.e. control to range). The protocol is&#xD;
      designed to challenge the insulin management system with meals and mild exercise, so as to&#xD;
      demonstrate its capacity to avoid large glucose excursion with changing metabolic state. This&#xD;
      system is designed to both&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  monitor the meal boluses of the patient and correct it in case of observed/predicted&#xD;
           under insulinization (avoidance of prolonged hyperglycemia), based on a coarse and&#xD;
           subjective knowledge of the meal amount, a precise understanding of the subject's day to&#xD;
           day insulin treatment, continuous glucose monitoring, and past insulin injections;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  predict and avoid hypoglycemic events, based on continuous glucose reading and past&#xD;
           insulin injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to enroll 12 adult Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) patients (expected&#xD;
      retention 10/12) and compare glucose control performances under two treatments: standard vs.&#xD;
      the new insulin management system. The protocol will include a total of 6 admissions per&#xD;
      subject (4 out-patients and 2 in-patients): screening, effort test, CGM insertion 1,&#xD;
      inpatient 1, CGM insertion 2, and inpatient 2. During the 24h inpatient admissions, the&#xD;
      patients will be challenged with 30 minutes of mild exercise and 3 meals, insulin coverage of&#xD;
      these events will vary depending on the chosen treatment, each subject will be exposed to&#xD;
      both studied treatments (repeated measure design).The order of treatment during the inpatient&#xD;
      admissions will be randomized.&#xD;

    <description>The CLC used a computer to make recommendations for their insulin treatment. This study arm was designed to demonstrate management of glucose using a modular insulin management system based on continuous glucose monitoring and targeted towards the avoidance of hypoglycemic and prolonged hyperglycemic episodes (i.e. control to range). This system was designed to both:&#xD;
monitor the meal boluses of the patient and correct it in case of observed/predicted under insulinization (avoidance of prolonged hyperglycemia), based on a coarse and subjective knowledge of the meal amount, a precise understanding of the subject's day to day insulin treatment, continuous glucose monitoring, and past insulin injections;&#xD;

    <description>In this study, the researchers compared the management of diabetes during physical activity and meals with the closed-loop system developed at the University of Virginia. This Control to Range System uses two DexCom Seven Continuous Glucose Monitor, a computer containing an investigational control algorithm (well-defined instructions that are expressed in mathematical equations), and an OmniPod Insulin Management System, a portable subcutaneous (under the skin) insulin pump. During the closed-loop admission, the computer used CGM values to make recommendations of insulin treatment based on the algorithms.</description>

    <description>This admission was to assess the subjects' level of glucose control and created a base to compare the performance of the closed-loop system. Subjects monitored their own blood glucose values and administer their basal/bolus as they would at home. Subjects use their own pump. Otherwise, the admission remained the same as in the closed-loop admission (i.e. meals, exercise, etc...).</description>

          <description>Completed open-loop, then sCTR (Standard Control to Range ) Closed-Loop admission.&#xD;
The two modules of sCTR are the SSM (safety supervision module) and a standard range control module that avoids prolonged hyperglycemic excursions. Both modules use a real-time estimate of the patient 's metabolic state based on CGM (continuous glucose monitor) and insulin infusion data. This estimate is used for prediction of the risks of hypo-and hyperglycemia 30-45 min ahead of the event. If a risk for hypoglycemia is predicted, the SSM attenuates automatically any insulin requests proportionally to the predicted risk level. How aggressively the system attenuates insulin is determined with patient characteristics (e.g. body weight, insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio, and basal insulin delivery). If a risk for hyperglycemia is predicted, the range controller gives a correction bolus using the predicted plasma glucose and the patient's CSII (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion) parameters.</description>

          <description>Participants completed open-loop admission, then completed eCTR (Enhanced Control to Range) closed-loop admission.&#xD;
The two modules of the eCTR are the SSM and an enhanced range control module based on an MPC (model predictive control) algorithm that aims to maintain glycemia in a target range. eCTR also uses insulin-on-board constraints (29) intended to prevent insulin overdose during intensified therapy. The rationale behind MPC was presented in detail in a recent review (7). Controller aggressiveness was individualized for each subject based on readily available patient characteristics (e.g., body weight, insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio, and basal insulin delivery) (30). In this application, the MPC worked using information from the individual's conventional therapy. Premeal boluses were triggered by the patient, with the carbohydrate amount measured in the clinical research center (CRC) kitchen but automatically calculated by eCTR.</description>

          <title>sCTR Closed-Loop Control</title>
          <description>The two modules of sCTR are the SSM and a standard range control module that avoids prolonged hyperglycemic excursions. Both modules use a real-time estimate of the patient 's metabolic state based on CGM and insulin infusion data. This estimate is used for prediction of the risks of hypo-and hyperglycemia 30-45 min ahead of the event. If a risk for hypoglycemia is predicted, the SSM attenuates automatically any insulin requests proportionally to the predicted risk level. How aggressively the system attenuates insulin is determined with patient characteristics (e.g., body weight, insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio, and basal insulin delivery). If a risk for hyperglycemia is predicted, the range controller gives a correction bolus using the predicted plasma glucose and the patient's CSII parameters; the system injects only half of the computed bolus and can do so once every hour.</description>

          <title>eCTR Closed-Loop Control</title>
          <description>The two modules of the eCTR are the SSM and an enhanced range control module based on an MPC algorithm that aims to maintain glycemia in a target range. eCTR also uses insulin-on-board constraints (29) intended to prevent insulin overdose during intensified therapy. The rationale behind MPC was presented in detail in a recent review (7). Controller aggressiveness was individualized for each subject based on readily available patient characteristics (e.g., body weight, insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio, and basal insulin delivery) (30). In this application, the MPC worked using information from the individual's conventional therapy. Premeal boluses were triggered by the patient, with the carbohydrate amount measured in the CRC kitchen but automatically calculated by eCTR.</description>
