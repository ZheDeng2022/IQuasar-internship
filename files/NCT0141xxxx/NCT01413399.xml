      The objective of this study will be to assess the frequency of return of spontaneous&#xD;
      circulation (ROSC), survival to admission, survival to discharge from the hospital, and&#xD;
      neurologic function at time of discharge from the hospital among patients experiencing out of&#xD;
      hospital cardiac arrest randomized to receive either intra-arrest induction of therapeutic&#xD;
      hypothermia (IATH) or post-arrest therapeutic hypothermia (TH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Develop and test methodologies for randomizing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA)&#xD;
           patients to receive one of two therapeutic hypothermia treatments in the prehospital&#xD;
           environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Randomize patients experiencing OOHCA to receive either IATH or post-arrest TH and&#xD;
           assess the frequency of ROSC, survival to admission, survival to discharge, and&#xD;
           neurologic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Estimate the most efficacious volume of chilled saline administered during the intra&#xD;
           arrest period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Identify barriers and strategies for the successful implementation of this project as a&#xD;
           multicenter randomized trial.&#xD;

      Therapeutic hypothermia improves mortality and functional neurologic outcomes in patients&#xD;
      resuscitated from pulseless ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation (VT/VF), with several&#xD;
      studies validating the safety of prehospital induction following successful (return of&#xD;
      spontaneous circulation) ROSC by the rapid infusion of 2 liters of 4ยบC intravenous fluids.&#xD;
      However, the optimal timing for inducing hypothermia remains uncertain. Early studies&#xD;
      demonstrated the efficacy of therapeutic hypothermia despite delays of 4 to 8 hours from the&#xD;
      time of ROSC to the initiation of cooling. The post-resuscitation reperfusion injury evolves&#xD;
      quickly and was thought to be best attenuated by hypothermia induction immediately following&#xD;
      return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). This was supported by animal data which&#xD;
      demonstrated that improved neurologic outcome was associated with reduced time to goal&#xD;
      temperature following ROSC. More recently this hypothesis has been called into question by 2&#xD;
      clinical trials which suggested that time to initiation of cooling was not associated with&#xD;
      improved neurologic outcome at discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be another benefit to early therapeutic cooling. Animal data suggest that&#xD;
      intra-arrest induction of therapeutic hypothermia (IATH) improves rates of ROSC from cardiac&#xD;
      arrest. This is corroborated by a report describing an impressively high ROSC rate of 60.9%&#xD;
      among patients receiving IATH. This was a higher frequency of ROSC than reported in similar&#xD;
      patient groups. It has been demonstrated that mild hypothermia exerts a stabilizing effect on&#xD;
      the myocardium, decreasing the rate of refibrillation following ROSC. Mild hypothermia has&#xD;
      also been shown to prolong ventricular refractoriness and repolarization, possibly&#xD;
      facilitating electrical defibrillation by slowing repolarization ion currents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently we conducted a retrospective observational study that demonstrated an association&#xD;
      between the administration of IATH and ROSC.22 We found that the likelihood of ROSC with IATH&#xD;
      was 2.4 (95% CI 1.41-4.24) time higher in the subset of patients who received &gt; 700ml of 4ยบ C&#xD;
      normal saline compared to those who did not receive IATH. Our study lacked sufficient power&#xD;
      to demonstrate a difference in survival to admission or discharge; however, we noted trends&#xD;
      towards improved survival. Current intra-arrest treatments do not obtain ROSC rates greater&#xD;
      than those seen in our study with IATH. These associations were noted in all rhythms,&#xD;
      including asystole and pulseless electrical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtaining ROSC quickly with the resulting decrease in time spent in a low or no flow&#xD;
      circulation would have obvious downstream effects on both hospital mortality and neurologic&#xD;
      function, independent of the effect of mild hypothermia in the post-arrest inflammatory&#xD;
      state. Surprisingly these associations were seen even with fluid volumes that were too low to&#xD;
      change core body temperature suggesting that the benefits of therapeutic hypothermia on the&#xD;
      myocardium may be possible even at relatively low fluid volumes.&#xD;
