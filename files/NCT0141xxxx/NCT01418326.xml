      Knowledge gap: Does the choice of anaesthetic affect outcome for cancer surgery?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To retrospectively examine possible associations (Cox Multiple Regression) between&#xD;
      survival from breast-, colorectal-, or skin cancer and the choice of hypnotic used during&#xD;
      surgery, ahead of a prospective randomised controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: One- and five-year survival will be significantly higher after radical breast-,&#xD;
      colorectal-, or skin cancer surgery in patients given the intravenously administered hypnotic&#xD;
      propofol than in patients given the inhalational hypnotic sevoflurane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: To merge two registers, of which one holds demographic- anaesthetic-, and surgical&#xD;
      data from 6 303 patients operated on at the three mentioned anatomical locations at the&#xD;
      Central Hospital in Vasteras, Sweden during a twelve year period (1998-2009). Of these&#xD;
      minimum 4 500 operations would be due to cancer. This register is unique, in that it contains&#xD;
      both types of anaesthesia. The other register holds survival data (date and cause of death),&#xD;
      stored at the Regional Oncologic Center in Uppsala.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of anaesthetic will be validated by controlling each patient's anaesthetic paper&#xD;
      file, concomitantly with extraction of details from anaesthesia and surgery, such as the&#xD;
      functional classification of each patient (according to American Association of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists), co-morbidity, duration of anaesthesia and surgery, amount of blood loss&#xD;
      and possible transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current knowledge: Different anaesthetics have opposite effects on the immune system and on&#xD;
      the DNA. There is a well-established association between the state of the immune system and&#xD;
      cancer growth, which in turn will influence survival. There is also an association between&#xD;
      DNA damage and cancer development. Inhalational anaesthetics, e.g. sevoflurane, act&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory, and they are also proven to be genotoxic. Propofol is anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      anti-oxidative, and it is not genotoxic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Strengthen the hypotheses, and get statistics for a proper power calculation in&#xD;
      advance of a multi-centre, prospective, randomised, controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: General anaesthesia is an indispensable part of radical cancer surgery. Undesired&#xD;
      effects from anaesthesia on survival has strong relevance for the over all cancer treatment.&#xD;

      Purpose and aims By means of record-linkage, information from two registers will be merged to&#xD;
      retrospectively examine possible associations between survival from breast-, colorectal-, or&#xD;
      skin cancer with the choice of hypnotic used during surgical removal of the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that: the one- and five-year survival rate after radical breast-, colorectal-&#xD;
      or skin cancer surgery in general anesthesia is significantly higher in patients given the&#xD;
      intravenously administered hypnotic propofol compared with the survival in patients exposed&#xD;
      to the inhalational hypnotic sevoflurane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is based on: 1) The knowledge about the opposite effects on the immune system&#xD;
      from the two different anesthetics and from their different genotoxic potentials 2) The&#xD;
      well-established associations between the state of the immune system and cancer growth, and&#xD;
      DNA damage and cancer development, with potential influences on survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey of the field Rationale and current state of knowledge A) Immuno-modulation Converging&#xD;
      evidence from animal studies and studies of human cell-lines indicate that different&#xD;
      anesthetics have opposite effects on the immune system. Commonly used inhalational hypnotics&#xD;
      are in this context pro-inflammatory, whereas the intravenously administered hypnotic agent&#xD;
      propofol is anti-inflammatory and also anti-oxidative. A few clinical studies have indicated&#xD;
      similar effects in patients, and a recent review has suggested that &quot;tailoring an anesthetic&#xD;
      plan to patient's needs will become increasingly critical, and immunology should help in this&#xD;
      pursuit&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More specifically, previous studies have investigated the immunological effects of different&#xD;
      anesthetics on monocytes, macrophages, natural killer cells, t-cytotoxic cells, and t-helper&#xD;
      cells. By affecting t-helper cells anesthetics indirectly affects the production of&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-4 and -10. Anesthetics also affect the&#xD;
      production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, and&#xD;
      interleukin-1 and -6. Moreover, the effects could be indirect by blocking or non-blocking of&#xD;
      the surgical stress response via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic&#xD;
      nervous system. Thus, stress hormones, such as catecholamines and cortisol, mediates&#xD;
      inhibitory effects on immune functions. In a highly complex way, the neuroendocrine system&#xD;
      together with both pro-inflammatory- and anti-inflammatory cytokines augments their&#xD;
      immuno-suppressive effects. Taken together, results from previous research support that&#xD;
      inhalational hypnotics are immuno-suppressive in mice as well as in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Earlier findings also indicate other adverse effects of inhalational hypnotics that could be&#xD;
      related to immunological processes. For example, inhalational hypnotics seem to increase the&#xD;
      occurrence of cancer metastases. These adverse effects have not been found for propofol. In&#xD;
      contrast, propofol seem to inhibit tumor growth and reduce the tendency to induce metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research field of immuno-modulation from anesthetics was recently reviewed by Kurosawa&#xD;
      and Kato. They concluded, that &quot;clinical anesthesiologists should select anesthetics and&#xD;
      choose anesthetic methods with careful consideration of the clinical situation and the immune&#xD;
      status of critically ill patients, in regard to long-term mortality, morbidity, and the&#xD;
      optimal prognosis&quot;. A key note is, that &quot;many in vitro investigations have elucidated the&#xD;
      dose-dependent and time-dependent immunosuppressive effect of volatile (read inhalational)&#xD;
      anesthetics on various immune cells&quot;. It was stressed in another review by Meiler, &quot;that the&#xD;
      perioperative process could be responsible for later adverse events&quot;, and the necessity to&#xD;
      &quot;understand the underlying biology and immunology should be particularly helpful in this&#xD;
      pursuit&quot;. Thus, the choice of hypnotic may affect survival after cancer surgery. More&#xD;
      specifically, the combined effects of surgical stress and the burden of cancer and perhaps&#xD;
      other aggravating circumstances, such as high age and malnutrition, may play a salient role&#xD;
      in postoperative morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Genotoxicity Genotoxic agents may negatively affect patient's survival after cancer&#xD;
      surgery, as the connection between DNA damage and cancer development is well-known. The&#xD;
      potential genotoxicity from inhalational anesthetic agents in patients and in exposed staff&#xD;
      in operating rooms has been studied both in vitro and in vivo. A dose-response relationship&#xD;
      for inhalational agent exposure and DNA damage has been suggested. The techniques used, the&#xD;
      rate of sister chromatid exchange in lymphocytes and the alkaline comet assay, as indicators&#xD;
      of genotoxicity are well validated, and they are frequently used in other contexts.&#xD;
      Inhalational agents seem to be consistently genotoxic, whereas the less studied propofol&#xD;
      seems not to be so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project description: Retrospective, follow-up cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients We have in an administrative system demographic-, anesthetic-, and surgical data&#xD;
      logged by computer available for all patients exposed to anesthesia and surgery, dated from&#xD;
      January 1, 1998 to December 31, 2009. Data includes the choice of hypnotic. All approx. 4500&#xD;
      patients operated on for breast-, colorectal-, or skin cancer (malignant melanoma) have been&#xD;
      extracted from this register. Remaining demographic-, anesthetic-, and surgical data of&#xD;
      interest will be extracted from patient's individual paper files. A data base will be&#xD;
      constructed in the Statistical Program for Social Sciences, SPSS (Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
      Accessible outcome data are stored at the Regional Oncologic Center in Uppsala.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bias, especially potential major confounders, control of&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The risk of selection bias is an inherent major disadvantage with a retrospective study.&#xD;
           Here the risk is considered low due to the non-selective use of the hypnotics.&#xD;
           Misclassification errors will be corrected on an individual level and important&#xD;
           confounders identified at group level, c.f. down.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The distribution of different demographic characteristics between the two groups will be&#xD;
           controlled for by the thorough survey of every individual patient file. Data on type and&#xD;
           stage of the cancer, as well as different prognostic markers will also be included. Any&#xD;
           unequal distribution of such confounders will be identified. Data on alcohol consumption&#xD;
           will not be available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Opioids also affect the immune system, and they will therefore theoretically constitute&#xD;
           to be major confounders. This holds true for morphine, which we never use&#xD;
           intra-operatively. Synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, alfentanil, and remifentanil,&#xD;
           all used by us intra-operatively, have been proven not to suppress the immune response&#xD;
           like morphine does. On the contrary, the synthetic opioids may have positive effects in&#xD;
           this context. We use synthetic opioids for every surgical patient at our hospital, as&#xD;
           most other hospitals do worldwide. We have no reason to suspect an uneven administration&#xD;
           of postoperative morphine to the two study groups, but this has also to be controlled&#xD;
           for during data extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Nitrous oxide, impairs the immune defense, and it also impairs DNA production by&#xD;
           inhibition of the vitamin B12 component of methionine synthetase. Nitrous oxide will be&#xD;
           a potential confounder for a fraction of our study population. It remains to be seen&#xD;
           during a thorough survey of our data, if the use of nitrous oxide was evenly distributed&#xD;
           between our two study groups?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Red blood cell transfusion may affect survival after cancer surgery. An&#xD;
           immuno-suppressive effect from the allogenic material is one suggested cause. We will&#xD;
           identify those patients having peri-operative red blood cell transfusions, control the&#xD;
           distribution between the groups, and include them in a subgroup analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. A preceding or subsequent anesthetic given in proximity to the index procedure&#xD;
           constitutes an important confounder and must therefore be identified. An executive&#xD;
           decision was made defining this time span of ± 1 year from the index operation.&#xD;
           Patients, who were anesthetized once or more than so besides the index operation within&#xD;
           this time frame, and patients who were anesthetized from the end of the time frame to&#xD;
           inclusion in the study will constitute separate subgroups. Accordingly, they will be&#xD;
           analyzed separately. We assume that 10-20% of patients had another general anesthetic&#xD;
           within the defined time interval. This assumption is based on a small pilot&#xD;
           investigation of 100 patients in the cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Different adjuvant cancer therapies with potent toxicity and serious side-effects will&#xD;
           also be registered and controlled for from a confounding point of view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linking and matching of databases The administrative database, created as described above,&#xD;
      will be record-linked to the regional quality registers at the Regional Oncologic Center&#xD;
      (ROC) in Uppsala. The registers have been found to be &gt;97% completeness compared to the&#xD;
      Swedish Cancer Register (SCR), to which reporting is mandatory and regulated by law. The SCR&#xD;
      holds diagnoses only and contains no clinical information. The ROC includes a quality&#xD;
      register for breast cancer, which was started in 1992. A register for colon cancer was&#xD;
      started in 1995, another for melanoma was started in 1996, and one for rectal cancer was&#xD;
      created in 1997. These registers contain information on mode of detection, histopathology,&#xD;
      stage at diagnosis, other prognostic markers and complementary treatment given. Hence,&#xD;
      complete oncologic- and outcome data will be available for all types of cancer included in&#xD;
      the study within the defined period of time. Data on type and stage of the cancer, as well as&#xD;
      different prognostic markers recorded in the oncologic registers will be extracted, as well&#xD;
      as data on recurrences of disease, vital status and date and cause of death. The unique&#xD;
      personal identification number will be replaced by unidentified serial numbers, to ensure&#xD;
      anonymity for each person after data securing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis The main endpoint will be a comparison of overall survival using time to event&#xD;
      analysis. Cumulative 1- and 5-year overall survival will be assessed using the Kaplan Meier&#xD;
      method and the estimates will be compared between patients given sevoflurane or propofol. In&#xD;
      a next step, Cox Proportional hazard models will be calculated to assess the risk of death&#xD;
      adjusted for potential effect modifiers and confounders. There will also be stratifications&#xD;
      for different types of tumors, cardio-pulmonary status, ASA-class etc. Hazard ratios (HR)&#xD;
      with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) will be presented for all models. Subgroup analyses will&#xD;
      be undertaken for patients having more than one anesthetic within the defined time frame; a)&#xD;
      given the same hypnotic as during the index procedure, b) given the other hypnotic at the&#xD;
      different occasion(s); and c) for patients having one or more anesthetics outside the defined&#xD;
      time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics A clinically relevant absolute difference in five-year-survival would be 5%, e.g.&#xD;
      a difference between 85% and 80%, the latter being an average one-year-survival for the&#xD;
      period of interest for breast cancer, which constitutes the largest group in the study. With&#xD;
      more than 3000 patients anesthetized with sevoflurane, and more than 1000 patients&#xD;
      anesthetized with propofol, we will have a 95% power to detect the difference with a P-value&#xD;
      of &lt;0.05, i.e. there will be a good margin for an unanticipated loss of data or ditto&#xD;
      exclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics The project was accepted by the Regional Ethics Committee Jan 21, 2009 (2008/350). The&#xD;
      retrospective approach will not create ethical considerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance Undesired effects from anesthesia on survival have strong relevance for the&#xD;
      overall cancer treatment. Any suspicions of such a dramatic side-effect as potentially fatal&#xD;
      immuno-modulation or genotoxicity must be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the hypotheses are confirmed the results from the present study will be used for a&#xD;
      large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) at multiple centers to compare the two agents,&#xD;
      and this in turn might result in a change in practice should the results be positive. If the&#xD;
      hypothesis is ruled out, the choice between inhalation and intravenous anesthesia will not be&#xD;
      influenced by oncological considerations, which is important to know, although it also have&#xD;
      to be confirmed in a RCT.&#xD;
