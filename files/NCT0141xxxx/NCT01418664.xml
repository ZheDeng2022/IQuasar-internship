      We hypothesized that vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy can prevent adverse pregnancy&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;

      Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with many chronic diseases. These include&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, breast and prostate cancers.&#xD;
      Recently, its role in pregnancy has been explored. Vitamin D deficiency has been found to be&#xD;
      associated with adverse pregnancy outcome. These include pre eclampsia, gestational diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, preterm labor and low birth weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bodnar et al, evaluated role of vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy in PE in a nested case&#xD;
      control study. The investigators looked at the role of vitamin D at gestational age of &lt; 22&#xD;
      weeks. Women who developed PE were found to have low levels of vitamin D. These women had&#xD;
      serum levels of vitamin D &lt; 15 ng/ml, were supplemented during pregnancy with prenatal&#xD;
      vitamins, were still found to have 5 fold greater chances of developing PE (adjusted odds&#xD;
      ratio, 5.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-14.1).Children of above group of women were also&#xD;
      found to have low levels of vitamin D. The authors concluded that vitamin D deficiency may be&#xD;
      an independent factor for the development of PE.(1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an epidemiological study from Norway, involving 23,423 primigravidae, the rsik of PE was&#xD;
      found to be 27% greater in women who did not receive D supplements, compared to women who&#xD;
      received 10-15µg/day of vitamin D(2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating levels of 1-25(OH) have been found to be low in women with PE.(3) This has been&#xD;
      attributed to reduced expression and activity of 1α-hydroxylase in human placenta from&#xD;
      preeclamptic pregnancies.(4) This association with PE has also been found to be influenced by&#xD;
      VEGF (Vascular endothelial growth factor). Active forms of vitamin D have been found to&#xD;
      increase the expression of VEGF , and its release in vascular smooth cells, in in-vitro&#xD;
      studies.(5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D deficiency has also been associated with small for gestational age (SGA) (6) The&#xD;
      difference has been found to be more subtle for Caucasians as compared to African-Americans&#xD;
      in West. The investigators showed a U shaped association between D levels and SGA. After&#xD;
      confounder adjustment, compared with serum 25(OH)D 37.5-75 nmol/L, SGA odds ratios (95% CI)&#xD;
      for levels &lt;37.5 and &gt;75 nmol/L were 7.5 (1.8, 31.9) and 2.1 (1.2, 3.8), respectively. In a&#xD;
      similar study by Brooke, among Asian women resident in UK, vitamin D supplementation with&#xD;
      1000IU in third trimester, compared with placebo, was associated with decreased incidence of&#xD;
      small for gestational age (15% versus 29%). Investigators suggested supplementation with&#xD;
      vitamin D among Asians living in UK.(7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D deficiency has been related to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in pregnant&#xD;
      women. Zhang et al, found that vitamin D deficiency in early pregnancy is linked with&#xD;
      increased risk for GDM. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with a 2.66-fold (OR (95% CI):&#xD;
      2.66 (1.01-7.02)) increased GDM risk. Moreover, each 5 ng/ml decrease in 25-[OH] D&#xD;
      concentrations was related to a 1.29-fold increase in GDM risk (OR (95% CI): 1.29&#xD;
      (1.05-1.60)).(8) Similarly, in an Iranian study, women who were found to have GDM, were found&#xD;
      to have lower levels of serum 1,25 (OH), as compared to normoglycemic women. (9) Serum levels&#xD;
      of &lt;12 nmol/L were found associated with GDM. This may be linked to the fact that 1,25(OH)&#xD;
      stimulates insulin secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D deficiency has also been linked to increased risk for cesarean section. In a study&#xD;
      of 253 women, who underwent cesarean section, multivariable logistic regression analysis&#xD;
      controlling for race, age, education level, insurance status, and alcohol use, women with&#xD;
      25(OH)D less than 37.5 nmol/liter were almost 4 times as likely to have a cesarean than women&#xD;
      with 25(OH)D 37.5 nmol/liter or greater (adjusted odds ratio 3.84; 95% confidence interval&#xD;
      1.71 to 8.62).(10) Poor muscular performance due to vitamin D deficiency may be the reason&#xD;
      for the increased cesarean section rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preterm labor, is the other adverse pregnancy outcome, which is thought to be affected by&#xD;
      maternal serum levels of 1,25(OH). In a recently concluded RCT, a comparison was made between&#xD;
      400IU, 2000IU and 4000IU of daily supplementation with vitamin D. Women who were prescribed&#xD;
      highest doses had significant less chances of spontaneous preterm birth at &lt; 37 and at &lt; 32&#xD;
      weeks.(11) Inflammation plays a key role in the etiology of preterm labor. And vitamin D is&#xD;
      known to influence the production of inflammatory mediators like interleukin 1, interleukin&#xD;
      -6 and tumor necrosis factor by macrophages.(12) This may be a reason for decreased incidence&#xD;
      of preterm birth in women who received vitamin D supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Birth weight of newborn is also affected by maternal serum D levels. In a study from&#xD;
      neighboring Iran, of 449 women, birth weight, length and apgar score were significantly&#xD;
      better in women who took diet adequate in calcium and vitamin D.(13) Vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation during pregnancy leads to increased calcium stores in infants and improved&#xD;
      weight gain as well. Levels &lt; 25ng/ml are associated with rickets and osteomalacia. There is&#xD;
      positive correlation between maternal and neonatal cord levels of vitamin D. This&#xD;
      relationship has also been shown in studies from other part of world. (14-16)This indicates&#xD;
      that these newborns are entering the world, with deficiency of vitamin D, which starts in&#xD;
      utero. Apart from affecting skeletal development, it also affects the innate immune system of&#xD;
      newborn. In a case-control study, children who were deficient in vitamin D were found to be&#xD;
      more prone to acute respiratory tract infections. The mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations in&#xD;
      the study group newborns were lower than those of the control group (9.12+/-8.88 ng/ml and&#xD;
      16.33+/-13.42 ng/ml, respectively) (P=0.011). (17) It has been observed that infants born to&#xD;
      D replete mothers will become D deficient, 8 weeks after birth, unless they are supplemented&#xD;
      with vitamin D. In an earlier cross sectional study, from Karachi city Atiq M, had found low&#xD;
      levels of vitamin D in newborns who were breastfed. The age group was from 6 weeks to 11&#xD;
      months. Thirty-four (48%) mothers and 37 (52%) infants had levels less than 25 nmol/ L (i.e.&#xD;
      &lt;10ng/ml). The investigators found a significant correlation between serum 25(OH)D levels of&#xD;
      infants under three months of age and their mothers (p&lt;0.01).(18) Though this study was&#xD;
      carried out in a private university hospital, where majority of mothers belonged to upper&#xD;
      socio economic class.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Content of vitamin D in breast milk is dependant upon the serum levels in mothers.&#xD;
      Supplementation of lactating mothers has been recommended to avoid deficiency in newborn, but&#xD;
      is not a norm in our practice. There is also increased motivation for exclusive breast&#xD;
      feeding for the first 4-6 months in our society. Hence with prevalence of vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency as high as 90% in our population (data submitted for publication), our newborns&#xD;
      are more at risk for vitamin D deficient rickets&#xD;
