  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to test whether pre-operative oral supplementation with L-arginine&#xD;
      results in a significant reduction of peri-operative cardiovascular complication rate in&#xD;
      unselected patients undergoing major abdominal or thoracic (non-cardiac) surgery. The second&#xD;
      aim of the study is to assess whether pre-operative determination of plasma ADMA levels&#xD;
      allows to identify patients who are at high risk of experiencing a peri-operative&#xD;
      complication, and whether this subgroup of patients profits specifically from pre-operative&#xD;
      L-arginine supplementation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients will be recruited for this study from the participating Departments. In a previous&#xD;
      study (protocol no. UKE-KP 2002/006) we investigated the predictive role of ADMA (asymmetric&#xD;
      dimethylarginine) for peri-operative complications in unselected patients undergoing major&#xD;
      surgery. The major result of that study was that patients with pre-operative ADMA plasma&#xD;
      level within the highest quartile of the distribution had a significantly elevated risk of&#xD;
      experiencing a serious peri-operative complication within a period of 30 days after the&#xD;
      surgical intervention. These data have been published [Maas et al. 2007]. As ADMA&#xD;
      competitively displaces L-arginine from the enzyme, NO synthase, it is expected that the&#xD;
      adverse cardiovascular effects of high ADMA levels can be antagonized by supplemental&#xD;
      L-arginine. Therefore, the present study was designed to specifically address the question&#xD;
      whether dietary supplementation with L-arginine before the surgery, aiming at replenishing&#xD;
      the body's L-arginine stores, may help to reduce the peri- operative complication rate.&#xD;
      Another aim is to assess whether this occurs in all patients or specifically in the subgroup&#xD;
      with elevated baseline ADMA levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be recruited from patients who routinely visit the outpatient clinic&#xD;
      at the participating Departments of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care in advance of their&#xD;
      planned surgical intervention. Patients usually visit the clinic between five working days in&#xD;
      advance of the scheduled time of surgery, or they are admitted to in-patient treatment one or&#xD;
      two days before the surgery. They will be informed about the scope and aim of the study, and&#xD;
      after having given their informed consent, patients will receive L-arginine dietary&#xD;
      supplements or corresponding placebo according to randomisation plan for the time until&#xD;
      surgery. The last dosage of the L-arginine supplements will be taken in the morning of the&#xD;
      surgery, dissolved in a glass of tap water that patients ware required to drink with&#xD;
      premedication for anesthesia. Blood samples to measure plasma L-arginine and ADMA levels will&#xD;
      be taken at the time of inclusion, in the morning before scheduled surgery, and on days 1 and&#xD;
      3 after the surgery and will together with additional safety parameter not exceed 80ml. No&#xD;
      administration of study product will occur after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery having taken place, patients will be monitored daily for as long as they remain&#xD;
      being treated as in-patients, and all clinical events, changes in laboratory parameters, and&#xD;
      apparatively performed clinical tests as scheduled according to clinical routine will be&#xD;
      documented. No additional clinical treating will be performed on study participants, except&#xD;
      the blood samples that will be taken as described above. After discharge, patients will be&#xD;
      followed-up telephonically, for the last time at 30 days after the date of surgery. All&#xD;
      clinical events occurring in this period will be recorded. In addition, changes in laboratory&#xD;
      values, ECG recordings, and other apparative diagnostic measures will be checked for possible&#xD;
      complications, and also be recorded.&#xD;
