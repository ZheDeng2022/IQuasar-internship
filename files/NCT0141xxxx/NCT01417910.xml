      Over 3000 people each year undergo bypass operations to their lower limbs, and these&#xD;
      operations carry significant risks with approximately 1 in 20 of these people dying in&#xD;
      hospital, and another 1 in 20 having a heart attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of these patients in order to stratify their risk of both dying and having&#xD;
      significant complications aid in improving their care, enable better utilisation of scarce&#xD;
      critical care resources, and allow us to give patients better information on which to base&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims The aims of the project are to assess the feasibility of exercise testing this group of&#xD;
      patients both with cycle and arm exercise, and to identify markers of outcome in this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology This is a prospective observational study designed to test the hypothesis that a&#xD;
      combination of cardiopulmonary exercise testing and blood tests provides prognostic value on&#xD;
      outcome measures after surgery for lower limb revascularisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have 2 exercise tests, one arm and one cycle, prior to surgery at their&#xD;
      preoperative assessment appointment. From these tests we will measure how much work patients&#xD;
      can do, how much oxygen they are able to use, and when the heart is unable to deliver enough&#xD;
      oxygen to the cells. In addition they will have blood samples taken prior to the operation&#xD;
      (brain natriuretic peptide), and on days 1 and 3 (troponin I) after the operation to look at&#xD;
      cardiac markers of damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This data will be used to see if we can predict those patients that have both short and long&#xD;
      term complications, and also to see whether the different forms of exercise testing are&#xD;
      comparable, or if one type is superior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes We expect that through a combination of exercise testing and blood test we&#xD;
      will be able to identify patients at increased risk of complications after surgery. We also&#xD;
      expect to find that arm exercise will be a more feasible and informative test that cycle&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;

      Background Over 3000 people each year undergo bypass operations to their lower limbs, and&#xD;
      these operations carry significant risks with approximately 1 in 20 of these people dying in&#xD;
      hospital, and another 1 in 20 having a heart attack. The number of people having this type of&#xD;
      procedure has grown over recent years and the trend is predicted to continue. Due to this&#xD;
      significant increase in the volume of these patients, and the associated complications that&#xD;
      occur with this surgery, utilisation of more resources such as critical care is often needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of these patients in order to stratify their risk of both dying and having&#xD;
      significant complications aid in improving their care, allow better utilisation of scarce&#xD;
      critical care resources, and also allow us to provide patients with better information as&#xD;
      part of the informed consent process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A high risk group in major abdominal surgery can be identified through a simple exercise test&#xD;
      (cardiopulmonary exercise test) that looks at how the body uses oxygen, and also through a&#xD;
      blood test that look at a hormone secreted by the heart. Vascular surgical patients are at&#xD;
      risk for the development of major cardiac complications in the postoperative period but a&#xD;
      system for appropriate preoperative risk stratifications has yet to be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims The aims of the project are to assess the feasibility of exercise testing this group of&#xD;
      patients both with cycle and arm exercise, and to identify markers of outcome in this group.&#xD;
      Identification of markers that can predict how patients will fare after surgery will allow us&#xD;
      to improve the informed consent process, utilise resources more effectively and efficiently&#xD;
      and identify opportunities to attempt to modify outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology This is a prospective observational study designed to test the hypothesis that a&#xD;
      combination of cardiopulmonary exercise testing and blood tests provide prognostic value on&#xD;
      outcome measures after surgery for lower limb revascularisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 2 exercise tests, one arm and one cycle, prior to surgery at their&#xD;
      preoperative assessment appointment. From these tests we will measure how much work patients&#xD;
      can do, how much oxygen they are able to use, and when the heart is unable to deliver enough&#xD;
      oxygen to the cells. In addition they will have blood samples taken prior to the operation&#xD;
      (brain natriuretic peptide), and on days 1 and 3 (troponin I) after the operation to look at&#xD;
      cardiac markers of damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This data will be used to see if we can predict those patients that have both short and long&#xD;
      term complications, and also to see whether the different forms of exercise testing are&#xD;
      comparable, or if one type is superior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes We expect that through a combination of exercise testing and a blood test&#xD;
      we will be able to identify patients at increased risk of complications after surgery. We&#xD;
      also expect to find that arm exercise will be a more feasible and informative test that cycle&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications Identification of a high risk group would allow appropriate strategies to be&#xD;
      implemented to reduce risk, and allow better post-operative resource utilisation. This study&#xD;
      will also allow a larger multicentre study to be adequately powered and constructed.&#xD;
