  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The experimental drug NHS-IL12 may help the immune system become more active and kill&#xD;
      cancer cells that have not responded to standard treatments. NHS-IL12 has been designed to&#xD;
      cause less severe side effects than other anticancer drugs, and may be more effective. More&#xD;
      research is needed to test NHS-IL12 in people who have solid tumors that have not responded&#xD;
      to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety and effectiveness of NHS-IL12 as a treatment for solid tumors which have&#xD;
      not responded to standard treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age with solid tumors that have not responded to standard&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, blood and urine&#xD;
           tests, and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive NHS-IL12 injection every 4 weeks, and will stay in the&#xD;
           hospital for at least one day to be monitored with frequent blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have periodic blood samples taken before treatment and during the&#xD;
           first week after treatment for the first two cycles. They will then have blood samples&#xD;
           taken before treatment for the rest of the cycles.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a proinflammatory cytokine produced by activated phagocytes&#xD;
           and dendritic cells (DCs) that plays a critical role in regulating the transition from&#xD;
           innate to adaptive immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IL-12 has shown some promising clinical activity in phase I trials, including&#xD;
           stabilization of disease in renal cancer patients with partial regression of a&#xD;
           metastatic lesion, but has not proceeded further in clinical development due to&#xD;
           toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The NHS-IL12 concept is a strategy to reduce the toxicity associated with systemic&#xD;
           administration of recombinant human IL-12 by selectively targeting delivery to tumors.&#xD;
           The NHS-IL12 immunocytokine is composed of 2 IL-12 heterodimers, each fused to one of&#xD;
           the H-chains of the NHS76 antibody, which has affinity for both single- and&#xD;
           doublestranded DNA. Thus, NHS-IL12 targets delivery to regions of tumor necrosis where&#xD;
           DNA has become exposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      NHS-IL12 administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks and subcutaneously every 2 weeks in&#xD;
      participants with metastatic or locally advanced solid epithelial or mesenchymal tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults with histologically or cytologically proven metastatic or locally advanced solid&#xD;
           epithelial or mesenchymal tumors, except unstable brain metastases, for which standard&#xD;
           curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate organ function as defined by liver, kidney, and hematologic laboratory testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with acquired immune defects, systemic autoimmune disease, history of organ&#xD;
           transplant, history of chronic infections, or history of active inflammatory bowel&#xD;
           disease will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With amendment D, this is a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to&#xD;
           assess the safety, tolerability, PK, and biological and clinical activity of NHS-IL12.&#xD;
           Goals are to determine the MTD of every 4-week doses at a starting dose level of 2&#xD;
           mcg/kg of NHS IL12 and to define the biologically optimal treatment schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be enrolled in cohorts of 3 to 6 participants using a standard 3+3&#xD;
           approach until MTD is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The trial will include a planned schedule-optimization amendment with up to 12&#xD;
           participants at each of the 2 dose levels that are of greater biologic interest (MTD and&#xD;
           dose below MTD), which will be submitted as soon as a clear biological response (changes&#xD;
           in circulating cytokine levels) is measured in at least 3 participants at a given dose&#xD;
           level. With amendment L, a cohort will be enrolled evaluating NHS-IL12 at 12 mcg/kg&#xD;
           every 2 weeks with dose escalation to 16.8 mcg/kg every 2 weeks if 0 of 3 or 1 of 6 DLTS&#xD;
           are observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With a maximum accrual ceiling of 83 participants, this study will be completed within&#xD;
           1year, enrolling up to 2-3 participants per month.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants must meet the following criteria for participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or&#xD;
             unresectable locally advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have completed or had disease progression on at least one prior line&#xD;
             of disease-appropriate therapy for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
             disease, or not be a candidate for therapy of proven efficacy for their disease due to&#xD;
             an underlying physical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may have disease that is measurable or non-measurable but evaluable&#xD;
             disease (e.g. present on bone scan, rising tumor markers, non-measurable by RECIST but&#xD;
             visible on CT scan). Participants with third space fluid (for example pleural&#xD;
             effusions) as only site of disease will not be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2 at study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are&#xD;
             currently available on the use of NHS-IL12 in participants &lt;18 years of age, children&#xD;
             are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Hematological eligibility parameters (within 16 days of starting therapy):&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Absolute granulocyte count greater than or equal to 1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Absolute lymphocyte count greater than or equal to 500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Adequate hepatic function defined by a&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  total bilirubin level less than or equal to 1.5 times ULN or in participants&#xD;
                       with Gilbert s syndrome, a total bilirubin less than or equal to 3.0, and&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine-aminotransferase (ALT) levels&#xD;
                       less than or equal to 2.5 times ULN or, for participants with documented&#xD;
                       metastatic disease to the liver, AST and ALT levels less than or equal to 5&#xD;
                       times ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Adequate renal function defined by an estimated creatinine clearance greater than&#xD;
                  60 mL/min determined by 24-hour urine sampling or by the Cockcroft-Gault formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ccr = (140 age) (weight, kg) (constant)/[72 times Crserum (mg/100 mL). The constant is 1&#xD;
        for men and 0.85 for women OR Ccr = (140 age) (weight, kg) (constant)/Crserum (micro&#xD;
        mol/L). The constant is 1.23 for men and 1.04 for women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        CD4 lymphocyte count or other T lymphocyte subset count will not be used to determine&#xD;
        eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must agree to practice effective contraception (both male and female&#xD;
             subjects, if the risk of conception exists). The effects of NHS-IL12 on the developing&#xD;
             human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men&#xD;
             must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation, and for&#xD;
             30 days after the last dose. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A minimum of 4 weeks will be required from any prior therapy, including chemotherapy,&#xD;
             immunotherapy and/or radiation. In addition, recovery to Grade 1 or less from&#xD;
             reversible all reversible toxicities related to prior therapy is required at study&#xD;
             entry. Prior immune therapy (e.g. related vaccinia and fowlpox vaccines or&#xD;
             antigen-specific peptides) is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants with any of the following will not be eligible for participation in this&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational concurrent anticancer&#xD;
             treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, cytokine therapy except&#xD;
             erythropoietin) at the time of enrollment except for disease specific appropriate&#xD;
             hormonal therapies (e.g., ADT for prostate cancer, anti-estrogen for breast cancer,&#xD;
             somatostatin analogue for neuroendocrine cancer)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent use of systemic steroids (within 10 days of enrollment) will be excluded,&#xD;
             except for physiologic doses of systemic steroid replacement or local (topical, nasal,&#xD;
             or inhaled) steroid use. Limited doses of systemic steroids (e.g., in participants&#xD;
             with exacerations of reactive airway disease) must have completed at least 10 days&#xD;
             prior to enrollment. Steroid use to prevent IV contrast allergic reaction or&#xD;
             anaphylaxis in participants who have known contrast allergies is allowed at any time&#xD;
             prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have previously received rIL-12&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acquired immune defects such as HIV or innate immunodeficiency because this agent&#xD;
             requires an intact immune system. In addition, these participants are at increased&#xD;
             risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-altering therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic autoimmune disease (e.g., lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Addison&#xD;
             s disease, autoimmune disease associated with lymphoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of organ transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of or active inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn s disease, ulcerative&#xD;
             colitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic infections (e.g., hepatitis B or C, tuberculosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity or allergic reactions attributed to any compounds of similar&#xD;
             chemical or biologic composition to the study medication, such as recombinant IL-12 or&#xD;
             other monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to methotrexate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of brain metastases because of the poor prognosis of participants with brain&#xD;
             metastases and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that&#xD;
             would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease: cerebral vascular&#xD;
             accident/stroke &lt; 6 months prior to enrollment, myocardial infarction &lt; 6 months prior&#xD;
             to enrollment, unstable angina, congestive heart failure (greater than or equal to&#xD;
             NYHA III) or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pulmonary disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, may impair the patient s&#xD;
             respiratory tolerance to moderate pulmonary fluid overload (e.g., interstitial lung&#xD;
             disease, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All conditions associated with significant necrosis of nontumor-bearing tissues:&#xD;
             esophageal or gastroduodenal ulcers &lt; 6 months prior to enrollment, organ infarction &lt;&#xD;
             6 months prior to enrollment, or active ischemic bowel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of medically significant third space fluid (symptomatic pericardial effusion,&#xD;
             ascites or pleural effusion requiring repetitive paracentesis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of active alcohol or drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any significant disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, may impair the&#xD;
             patient s tolerance of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition that would&#xD;
             prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy (absence to be confirmed by beta-human chorionic gonadotropin test) or&#xD;
             lactation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pleural effusion as the only evidence of metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Expansion Cohorts only&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that&#xD;
                  can be accurately measured as greater than or equal to 5 times 5 mm.&#xD;
