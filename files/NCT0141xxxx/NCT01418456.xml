  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to investigate whether antibiotics in the treatment of clinically&#xD;
      clean neuropathic and ischaemic ulcers in diabetic foot patients could reduce the incidence&#xD;
      of infection and therefore lead to improved outcomes This is a single centre study in which&#xD;
      patients with either type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus, who consecutively present to the Diabetic&#xD;
      Foot Clinic [DFC] with clean neuropathic (NU) or ischaemic (IU) diabetic foot ulcer without&#xD;
      clinical signs of infection will be invited to take part and will express their willingness&#xD;
      to take part in the study by signing a consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will be treated and followed up in the DFC at King's College Hospital.&#xD;
           Patients will be randomised into two groups: an antibiotic group and a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The antibiotic group will receive standard treatment along with antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The control group will have standard treatment alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients from both groups will be reviewed at weekly intervals for a period of 20 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be removed from the study if they develop clinical signs of infection or&#xD;
           if their ulcer heals prior to 20 weeks but will be followed up via routine practice for&#xD;
           eventual outcomes&#xD;

      Trail Procedures Visit 0 Screening, Randomisation and Initial Treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The researcher will assign a screening number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medical history and demographics will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Physical examination including height and weight will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Vital signs (body temperature, pulse and blood pressure) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Random capillary blood glucose will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Blood investigations as per routine clinical practice in the Diabetic Foot Clinic will&#xD;
           be carried out including:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Calcium and Phosphate Renal and liver function Glycated haemoglobin C- Reactive Protein&#xD;
           (CRP) Full blood cell count Erythrocyte sedimentation rate Blood glucose Blood will also&#xD;
           be taken for high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin levels as&#xD;
           inflammatory markers. (Samples will be stored in a -80 deg C freezer, to be analysed at&#xD;
           a later date)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. A urine test for Beta human chorionic gonadotropin test for women of childbearing&#xD;
           potential will be carried out&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The foot ulcer will then be debrided of callous and any macerated tissue and details of&#xD;
           the ulcer will be recorded as follows;&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Ulcer characteristics and presence of signs of infection (redness, swelling, pain,&#xD;
           malodour, purulent discharge) .&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. In order to enter the study, the patient will need to have a clinically non- infected&#xD;
           ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If patients have more than one ulcer, each ulcer should have no clinical signs of&#xD;
           infection and the largest foot ulcer will be recorded as the target ulcer and will be&#xD;
           monitored in the study. (The remaining ulcers will be treated according to standard&#xD;
           clinical practice.)&#xD;
&#xD;
           At this stage inclusion/ exclusion criteria will be reviewed and if satisfied, the&#xD;
           patient will be admitted to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. The circumference of the ulcer selected for the study will be marked out using sterile&#xD;
           graph paper and a marker pen.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. A digital photograph will be taken. The patient will be asked to sign a consent form for&#xD;
           this as part of King's College Hospital NHS Trust policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. A tissue sample( ulcer biopsy) will be sent for culture and sensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. The foot ulcer will then be cleansed with normal saline. A sterile non adherent dressing&#xD;
           along with a surgipad dressing will be applied to the foot ulcer. If appropriate the&#xD;
           patient's usual carers can be shown the dressings to be used and be given training to&#xD;
           ensure correct application of the dressings between visits to the clinic. Dressing&#xD;
           changes should occur according to the amount of exudate discharging from the ulcer, ie.&#xD;
           every day, every second, third day or three times a week. Patients will be advised to&#xD;
           keep their ulcer dressings dry.&#xD;
&#xD;
           VASCULAR ASSESSMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. Palpation of pedal pulses namely dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial will be carried&#xD;
           out. Ulcers occurring on the foot with impalpable pedal pulses will be defined as&#xD;
           ischaemic ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
       16. If pulses are impalpable, ankle- brachial pressure index and transcutaneous oxygen&#xD;
           (TcPo2) measurements will be performed and recorded. Patients will be reviewed by the&#xD;
           vascular team together with their vascular studies. The vascular consultant, diabetes&#xD;
           consultant and the patient will make a decision regarding any vascular intervention such&#xD;
           as angioplasty or bypass or to continue with conservative management.&#xD;
&#xD;
       17. Patients who have ischaemic feet will have their TcPo2 monitored on a once monthly&#xD;
           basis. If there is any deterioration in their blood supply they will be seen by the&#xD;
           vascular team to consider vascular intervention with either by-pass or angioplasty or&#xD;
           continue with monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
       18. A scotch cast boot (SCB) to optimise offloading for the ischaemic ulcer, will be&#xD;
           manufactured for patients with impalpable pedal pulses as per standard clinical&#xD;
           practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
           NEUROLOGICAL ASSESSMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
       19. Peripheral sensation testing will be carried out using a neurothesiometer to determine&#xD;
           vibration perception threshold on the apex of the toe of the foot with the ulcer. A 10g&#xD;
           nylon monofilament will be applied to the plantar surface of the 1st toe, and to the&#xD;
           plantar surface of the 1st ,3rd and 5th metatarsal heads and heel. Patients will be&#xD;
           deemed to have neuropathy if the vibration perception threshold is abnormal or the&#xD;
           filament cannot be felt on the plantar surface at any of the sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ulcers occurring on the foot with abnormal vibration perception or 10g filament testing&#xD;
           will be defined as neuropathic ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
       20. A removable total contact cast (RTCC) to optimise offloading in the neuropathic ulcer,&#xD;
           will be manufactured as per standard clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
       21. All patients will be asked to complete:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Quality of life questionnaire SF-36 EuroQol-5 questionnaire (EQ-5D)&#xD;
&#xD;
       22. All patients in the trial will be given emergency contact details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be randomised to one of two groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The antibiotic group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The standard treatment only group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotics will be dispensed from the hospital pharmacy. Patients will be advised that there&#xD;
      will always be two teams of health care professionals monitoring them: the blinded team,&#xD;
      which is the team who do not know which treatment group the patient has been assigned, and&#xD;
      the un blinded team, which is the team who do know what treatment group to which the patient&#xD;
      has been assigned .The patient will be asked not to inform the blinded team as to which group&#xD;
      they belong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 1-19&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unblinded team will always see the patient first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be noted and assessed Adherence to treatment will be assessed and&#xD;
      recorded Details of the resources that have been used by the patient for treatment of their&#xD;
      ulcer will be recorded in order to carry out a health economic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Vital signs will be recorded (body temperature, pulse and blood pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Random capillary blood glucose will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with ischaemic ulcers will have their TcPO2 measured at four weekly intervals&#xD;
           weeks 4,8,12,16 and 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The blinded team will carry out the following assessments;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Ulcer characteristics (size, depth, site).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Presence of clinical signs of infection such as; redness, swelling, pain, malodour,&#xD;
           purulent discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. A tissue specimen from the ulcer bed will be sent for culture and sensitivity, at week&#xD;
           4,8,12,16 and 20. An ulcer swab will be taken at all other visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. A digital photograph will be taken&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The ulcer circumference will be marked out using sterile graph paper and a marker pen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. The SCB or RTCC will be checked with patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. The ulcer will be cleansed using normal saline, a standard non adherent dressing and a&#xD;
           surgipad dressing held in place with a bandage will be applied to the ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. The ulcer will be deemed infected or non- infected.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. The blinded team will inform the unblinded team whether the ulcer is healed ; if it is&#xD;
           not healed, whether it is infected or non infected, using the Infectious Disease Society&#xD;
           of America/International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot Guidelines (IDSA-IWGDF)&#xD;
           criteria for infection. This will be confirmed by two members of the blinded team If the&#xD;
           ulcer is deemed to be clinically non-infected, and patient is to continue in the study,&#xD;
           antibiotics will be rationalised by the unblinded team according to culture and&#xD;
           sensitivity results from the ulcer swab/biopsy. An appropriate clinical trial&#xD;
           prescription will be written.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Emergency contact details will be checked with the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Patients will be followed up to 20 weeks. The patient will be withdrawn from the study&#xD;
           before the 20 weeks has elapsed if a foot ulcer has developed clinical signs of&#xD;
           infection or the ulcer has healed or the patient has developed side effects&#xD;
           necessitating the patient to stop antibiotic therapy for more than 72 hours or is&#xD;
           withdrawn by the Investigator for any other reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. If the patient is withdrawn early termination procedures will be completed (as per visit&#xD;
           20 or below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient is withdrawn and experiences adverse events such as&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admission to hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amputation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ulcer non healing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Side effects of antibiotics Then details of these events will be subsequently recorded&#xD;
           from patient's notes to further complete a health economic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 20; Last treatment visit or early termination visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the ulcer has not healed after 20 weeks then Visit 20 will be the last treatment visit.&#xD;
      Early termination of the study will be carried out if the patient has healed before 20 weeks,&#xD;
      or decides to withdraw (and is willing to attend a final visit); or the patient develops a&#xD;
      foot ulcer with clinical signs of infection. If the patient has developed side effects from&#xD;
      antibiotics and has not taken the antibiotics for more than 72 hours then the patient will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unblinded team will always see the patient first.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adverse events will be noted and assessed.&#xD;

&#xD;
        4. A physical examination will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Vital signs will be recorded (body temperature, pulse and blood pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;

           taken for high sensitivity C- reactive protein and procalcitonin&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. The patients will be asked to complete Quality of life questionnaire (SF-36) EuroQol-5&#xD;
           questionnaire (EQ-5D)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visit procedures by the blinded team&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Standard ulcer treatment if the ulcer remains unhealed will be carried out. (the removal&#xD;
           of callous, any dry skin, any dead tissue in and around the ulcer with a scalpel, ulcer&#xD;
           cleansing and application of a dressing)&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. A small tissue sample or ulcer swab will be collected from the ulcer bed for culture and&#xD;
           sensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
       15. The blinded team will inform the unblinded team whether the ulcer is healed ; if it is&#xD;
           not healed whether it is infected or non infected, using the Infectious Disease Society&#xD;
           of America/International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot Guidelines (IDSA-IWGDF )&#xD;
           criteria for infection. This will be confirmed by two members of the blinded team&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient experiences adverse events such as&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admission to hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amputation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ulcer non healing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Side effects of antibiotics Then details of these events will be subsequently recorded&#xD;
           from patient's notes, to further complete a health economic evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post treatment evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient will be seen 14 days after the last treatment visit or 14 days after the visit&#xD;
      when they have been withdrawn from the study. The purpose of this visit is twofold: first to&#xD;
      act as a safety visit and secondly, in the case of those patients who had healed at their&#xD;
      previous visit to confirm healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit procedure;&#xD;
