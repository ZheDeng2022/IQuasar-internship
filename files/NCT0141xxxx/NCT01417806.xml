  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of small cell lung cancer(SCLC)(50-100%) express somatostatin receptors(type&#xD;
      1-5) with some small cell lung cancer express more than one subtypes. Stimulation of these&#xD;
      SSTR's lead to inhibition of angiogenesis and cell growth. SOM230 also lower levels of IGF&#xD;
      which is known to contribute to SCLC proliferation. Topotecan is approved for second line&#xD;
      therapy in relapsed small cell lung cancer. We hypothesized that combination of both agents&#xD;
      should yield greater antitumor activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objectives of this study is to assess the progression-free survival (PFS) with&#xD;
      the combination of SOM230 and topotecan in patients with SCLC who relapsed or progressed&#xD;
      after front-line chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide. The secondary objective is to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of SOM230 in combination with topotecan in this population.&#xD;
      The primary end point is progression free survival. The secondary objective is response rate&#xD;
      duration of response , overall survival , safety and tolerability. Patient who is eligible&#xD;
      for the study will received topotecan 1.5mg/m2 on day 1-5 and SOM230 60mg on day 1 every 28&#xD;
      days until tumor progression or toxicity limit further treatment. Contrast-enhanced CT scans&#xD;
      will be performed at baseline and every 2 months (or sooner if clinically indicated) to&#xD;
      assess the response, duration of response, and time to tumor progression Patients will be&#xD;
      allowed to remain on therapy if treatment is tolerated and if there is no evidence of&#xD;
      progression for a maximum of 1 year or unacceptable toxicity occurs.&#xD;
