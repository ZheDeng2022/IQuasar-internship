      Multicentered, randomized study of safety and efficacy of whole-body vibration (WBV) as add&#xD;
      on to standard pharmacological treatment of osteoporosis (alendronate 70 mg/ week or&#xD;
      raloxifene 60 mg/day) in post-menopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent of the patients has been obtained, each patient's potential&#xD;
      eligibility will be assessed during a &quot;Screening Visit&quot;. Eligible subjects will be stratified&#xD;
      into two groups: those that are on treatment with alendronate and those that are on treatment&#xD;
      with raloxifene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, at baseline, the patients in each group are randomised to receive either WBV or&#xD;
      no WBV during the first segment of the study. Baseline evaluation of biomarkers of bone&#xD;
      remodelling, fall risk and back pain will be performed before starting the first segment.&#xD;
      Patients will return for efficacy and safety evaluations at week 3 and week 6. At 6 weeks&#xD;
      after baseline the second segment of the study starts: patients that were on WBV during&#xD;
      segment I will be observed for another 6 weeks without WBV, whereas the patients that did not&#xD;
      receive WBV during segment I will now be treated with WBV for 6 weeks in segment II. All&#xD;
      patients will return for additional visits at week 9 and 12 for safety and efficacy&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;

      Objectives Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish the effect of whole-body vibration (WBV) on biomarkers of bone remodelling&#xD;
           in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To establish the effect of whole-body vibration (WBV) on fall risk and low back pain in&#xD;
           postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the effects of WBV treatment to the effects of treatment without WBV on&#xD;
           biomarkers of bone remodelling, fall risk and low back pain, while keeping standard&#xD;
           pharmacotherapy as a constant parameter&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the effects of WBV in combination with alendronate to the effects of WBV in&#xD;
           combination with raloxifene on biomarkers of bone remodelling, fall risk and low back&#xD;
           pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the long-term effects of WBV on biomarkers of bone remodelling, fall risk&#xD;
           and low back pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Safety of WBV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Multicentered, randomized study of safety and efficacy of whole-body vibration&#xD;

      Investigational Medical Device (IMD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole Body Vibration procedure (WBV) will be performed using Fitvibe® medical (Manufacturer:&#xD;
      Uniphy Elektromedizin GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Germany), a certified medical device, in the following&#xD;

&#xD;
      Three Sessions per week of treatment, with a minimum of 15 sessions within a period of 6&#xD;
      weeks One session consists of 10 runs each containing 30 sec vibration intervals with a 15&#xD;
      sec plateau, interrupted by 30 sec pauses Frequency of 30 Hz Amplitude of 2 mm&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Endpoints Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Changes in biomarkers of bone formation (Bone specific alcalic phosphatase - Ostase) and&#xD;
           bone resorption (cross links of N-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen - N-Tx) during&#xD;
           treatment with WBV&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Changes in fall risk (Tinetti Mobility test) and low back pain (11 point NAS) during&#xD;
           treatment with WBV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Changes in Ostase and N-Tx biomarkers during the first 3 weeks of treatment with WBV&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Changes in Ostase and N-Tx biomarkers during Segment II in Group I a and II a&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Changes in fall risk (Tinetti Mobility test) and low back pain (11 point NAS) during the&#xD;
           first 3 weeks of treatment with WBV&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Changes in fall risk (Tinetti Mobility test) and low back pain (11 point NAS) during&#xD;
           Segment II in Group I a and II a&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Variables Routine physical examinations, monitoring of vital signs, body height and&#xD;
      adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods The confirmatory analysis is based on the primary criterion &quot;Effect of&#xD;
      WBV&quot;, measured with the changes in markers of bone formation Ostase and N-Tx as well as fall&#xD;
      risk and low back pain from start to end of WBV segment of the study (within group&#xD;
      comparison). Since normal distribution cannot be assumed for the test variables, the&#xD;
      Wilcoxon-rank-test will be used as two-sided test on difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final evaluation of the primary criteria will be performed hierarchically in the&#xD;
      following order:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. &quot;changes in marker Ostase during treatment with WBV&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. &quot;changes in marker N-Tx during treatment with WBV&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. &quot;changes in fall risk during treatment with WBV&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. &quot;changes in low back pain during treatment with WBV&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis for the four tests on difference are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: µ1-µ2 = 0 H1: µ1-µ2 = 0 The experiment wise multiple level alpha is defined as alpha =&#xD;
      0.05 two-sided respectively as required for confirmatory studies. If the primary hypothesis&#xD;
      tests are performed in the given order (1. to 4.) the test can be performed with full alpha&#xD;
      as long as the result for the previous test turns to be significant (Principle of a priori&#xD;
      ordered hypotheses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The confirmatory analysis is performed using the ITT population (intention-to-treat).&#xD;
