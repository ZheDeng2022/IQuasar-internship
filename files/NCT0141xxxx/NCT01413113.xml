      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of iodine I 131 when given&#xD;
      together with pazopanib hydrochloride in treating patients with recurrent and/or metastatic&#xD;
      thyroid cancer previously treated with iodine I 131 that cannot be removed by surgery.&#xD;
      Radioactive drugs, such as iodine I 131, may carry radiation directly to cancer cells and not&#xD;
      harm normal cells. Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving iodine I 131 together with pazopanib&#xD;
      hydrochloride may be an effective treatment for thyroid cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety, tolerability and feasibility of administrating escalating doses&#xD;
      of 131I (iodine I 131) in combination with concurrent pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride)&#xD;
      therapy in order to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase II dose (RP2D)&#xD;
      in patients with radioiodine (RAI)-refractory disease with minor RAI-uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effects of pazopanib in combination with 131I on RAI-avidity, uptake and&#xD;
      tumor response rate (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the time to tumor progression (TTP) or recurrence (progression will be&#xD;
      determined by RECIST criteria and by increases in suppressed thyroglobulin levels &gt; 50% as&#xD;
      compared to tumor imaging and suppressed thyroglobulin levels performed within 1 week of the&#xD;
      last dose of pazopanib).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of iodine I 131.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive iodine I 131 intramuscularly (IM) once daily (QD) 5 days a week in weeks&#xD;
      5-6. Patients also receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) QD beginning in week 1 and&#xD;
      continuing for 8 weeks post-radioactive iodine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days.&#xD;
