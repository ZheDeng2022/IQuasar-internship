      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Erdheim Chester Disease (ECD) is a very rare disease in which abnormal white blood cells&#xD;
      start growing and affect the bones, kidneys, skin, and brain. ECD can cause severe lung&#xD;
      disease, kidney failure, heart disease, and other complications that lead to death. Because&#xD;
      ECD is a rare disease, found mostly in men over 40 years of age, there is no standard&#xD;
      treatment for it. More information is needed to find out what genes can cause ECD and how&#xD;
      best to treat it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect study samples and medical information on people with Erdheim Chester Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals 2 to 80 year of age who have been diagnosed with Erdheim Chester Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a study visit to provide samples for study, including blood,&#xD;
           urine, and skin tissue samples. Participants will also have lung, heart, and muscle&#xD;
           function tests; imaging studies of the brain, chest, and whole body; a treadmill running&#xD;
           stress test; an eye exam; and other tests as needed by the study doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to return for a similar set of tests every 2 years, and to&#xD;
           remain in contact for possible treatment options.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rare and potentially lethal, Erdheim-Chester Disease (ECD) is a histiocytic neoplasm about&#xD;
      which little is known, and for which there remains a paucity of effective treatments.&#xD;
      Histologically, it is categorized as a non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and most commonly&#xD;
      occurs in men between the ages of 50 and 70, although cases have been reported in women, and&#xD;
      rarely, children. Worldwide about 600 cases have been reported, and the disorder remains&#xD;
      difficult to diagnose due to its rarity and protean manifestations. The phenotype of ECD&#xD;
      ranges from almost asymptomatic patients diagnosed incidentally when imaging studies are done&#xD;
      for other reasons, to patients presenting with multiple organ failure who die shortly after&#xD;
      diagnosis. These multifarious presentations, and the subsequent response to therapy, have not&#xD;
      been well documented and create the need for a prospective study to learn more about this&#xD;
      devastating disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol 11-HG-0207, &quot;Clinical and Pathophysiological Investigations into Erdheim-Chester&#xD;
      Disease,&quot; is a natural history study designed to better understand and describe the natural&#xD;
      history, pathophysiology, and response to therapy, of this devastating disorder. We will use&#xD;
      a prospective design to enroll and follow qualified men and women, of all ethnic groups, ages&#xD;
      2 to 80 years, who will be screened for candidacy prior to enrollment. If appropriate for the&#xD;
      study, patients may opt to be evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center, or may opt to send tissue&#xD;
      and records for analysis. The NIH Clinical Center will be the only center for this study, and&#xD;
      patients may return for follow-up visits every two to three years, or send copies of test&#xD;
      results in lieu of an admission. The enrollment ceiling is 100 patients and we may close the&#xD;
      study to new recruitment at that time, but keep the study open to see established patients&#xD;
      and to analyze data. Thus, we do not have a definite time-period for the completion of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the prospective design, we will collect data from medical histories and physical&#xD;
      exams, lab tests, imaging studies, organ-function studies, various measurement tools, and&#xD;
      medical consultations. Data will be collated into spreadsheets and divided into functional&#xD;
      categories such as organ system complications, to facilitate analysis. We will analyze the&#xD;
      data with the assistance of an NIH statistician using parametric and non-parametric methods&#xD;
      to assess overall trends in survival, and to look for patterns in organ involvement, patterns&#xD;
      in response to various therapeutic regimens, and, lastly, to look for an association between&#xD;
      the BRAF V600E mutation and disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient safety and privacy, and respect for the autonomy of the patients, are our top&#xD;
      priorities. All patients will be carefully screened prior to participation, and we follow&#xD;
      Clinical Center policies regarding informed consent. Data will be stored electronically and&#xD;
      in hard copy, in password protected computers and locked cabinets, respectively. Only the PI,&#xD;
      the responsible physician, and select AIs, will have access. Patients will be closely&#xD;
      monitored during NIH admissions, and the investigators will track all adverse events&#xD;
      according to NIH policy. The investigators will keep patients apprised of test results and&#xD;
      will reiterate the risks and benefits of procedures during NIH evaluations. Lastly, the&#xD;
      investigators will respect patients rights to refuse testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will disseminate the results of our analyses in publications and presentations intended to&#xD;
      educate the medical community regarding the diagnosis and management of ECD, and to spur&#xD;
      research. We hope our efforts will eventually lead to better outcomes for patients.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECD patients of any gender and ethnicity age 2-80 years are eligible to enroll in this&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be diagnosed as having ECD based upon pathologic evaluations of affected&#xD;
             organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any child older than 2 years with confirmed ECD by pathology will be enrolled in our&#xD;
             study since childhood cases are so rare. The child must be clinically stable prior to&#xD;
             visiting the NIHCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that agree to be part of this research study are expected to undergo the&#xD;
             evaluations and testing of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be excluded if they have a suspected diagnosis of ECD not confirmed by&#xD;
             biopsy or another form of histiocytosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             --If the patients cannot travel to the NIH because of their medical condition, they&#xD;
             can still participate in our study by submitting tissue and blood for research&#xD;
             purposes after consent has been obtained and diagnosis of ECD has been confirmed&#xD;
             through tissue-biopsy evaluation. This exception applies to all patients aged 2-80&#xD;
             years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children under age two years are excluded because there is no urgency for a very early&#xD;
             diagnosis and care is more readily provided to older children at the Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women will not take part in this study because of the fetal risks, unless&#xD;
             they will be participating by only submitting samples of previously collected tissue.&#xD;
             We will not encourage pregnant women to undergo affected organ surgery or biopsy to&#xD;
             participate in this study, unless clinically indicated and recommended by their&#xD;
             private physicians.&#xD;
