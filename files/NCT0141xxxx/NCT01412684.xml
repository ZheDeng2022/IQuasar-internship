  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most resectable tumors arising in the body or tail of the pancreas are malignancies or&#xD;
      premalignancies which are surgically treated with distal pancreatectomy in combination with&#xD;
      splenectomy. Retrieval of the lymph node tissue which lies along the splenic vessels is&#xD;
      necessary to complete an oncologically sound operation. Two techniques for spleen preserving&#xD;
      distal pancreatectomy have been described, but only a small number of lesions are amenable to&#xD;
      spleen preserving pancreas surgery because these operation compromise oncologic principles.&#xD;
      Removal of a normal spleen usually does not cause immediate consequences but can make&#xD;
      patients vulnerable to life threatening infections. Asplenic patients must be vigilant for&#xD;
      these infections and antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended anytime a fever occurs.&#xD;
      Splenectomy results in measurable changes in the cellular components of the blood. If&#xD;
      thrombocytosis occurs as a result of splenectomy, it requires life-long antiplatelet&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some childhood hematologic disorders such as hereditary spherocytosis are successfully&#xD;
      treated with partial splenectomy. The post-surgical remnant spleen has been shown to be&#xD;
      viable and functional. Both hematologic and immunologic function of the spleen seems to be&#xD;
      preserved in most patients. Partial splenectomy has also been successful ly employed to treat&#xD;
      benign and malignant lesions of the spleen. Unfortunately these indications for surgery are&#xD;
      rare and so the experience with partial splenectomy is small.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, distal pancreatectomy with partial splenectomy has not been described in the medical&#xD;
      literature. The investigators have devised a surgical procedure combining distal&#xD;
      pancreatectomy with partial splenectomy, in principal allowing preservation of splenic&#xD;
      function without compromise of oncologic principles. This procedure is possible now because&#xD;
      of new technology which allows for near bloodless transection of solid organs. These&#xD;
      instruments are routinely used in liver, kidney and pancreas surgery. There are scattered&#xD;
      reports of successful use of these instruments in splenic transection, but there is no large&#xD;
      experience to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study intends to answer the question, is the proposed procedure, distal pancreatectomy&#xD;
      and partial splenectomy, a viable alternative to the current standard of care, distal&#xD;
      pancreatectomy with total splenectomy, for patients who will undergo surgical treatment of&#xD;
      pancreas lesions arising in the body or tail of the pancreas?&#xD;
