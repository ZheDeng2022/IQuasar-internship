      The aim of this study is to determine the yield of 3 weeks outpatient mobile cardiac&#xD;
      monitoring for detection of atrial fibrillation in patients with history of stroke of known&#xD;
      cause.&#xD;

      Patients will be recruited to wear a outpatient mobile cardiac monitoring device for&#xD;
      detection of atrial fibrillation in patients with a history of stroke of known case. Their&#xD;
      are not study treatments or interventions, this is an observational trial. Eligible patients&#xD;
      must be &gt;50 years old, have a history of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack with a&#xD;
      documented brain infarction within the prior 12 months. If patients are on anticoagulation&#xD;
      therapies, they are eligible for enrollment if the long-term strategy for stroke prevention&#xD;
      is anti-platelet therapy and not the oral anti-coagulant itself. Patients must not have an&#xD;
      detection of AF and then must successfully activate the lifeStar device for enrollment. At&#xD;
      the end of three weeks, the LifeStar device will be over-read and scored for the presence of&#xD;
      AF and other clinically significant arrhythmias by the study electrophysiologist, who will&#xD;
      determine the occurrence and burden of AF.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age &gt; 50&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Ischemic stroke, or transient ischemic attack with documented acute brain infarction,&#xD;
             within prior 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient does not merit indefinite oral anticoagulation. (Patients requiring temporary&#xD;
             OAC for purposes other than recurrent stroke prevention, such as treatment of a deep&#xD;
             venous thrombosis, are eligible for enrollment if the long-term secondary stroke&#xD;
             preventive strategy is anti-platelet therapy and not OAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Stroke mechanism is determined to be lacunar stroke, large vessel intracranial&#xD;
             atherosclerosis, large vessel extracranial atherosclerosis, or a combination thereof.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient has been evaluated with at least a 12 lead EKG and at least one day of&#xD;
             in-patient or out-patient cardiac telemetry, with no detection of AF or atrial&#xD;
             flutter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Detection of AF or atrial flutter would change secondary prevention antithrombotic&#xD;
             strategy (eg to indefinite OAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient receives and successfully activates LifeStar ACT device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient or legally authorized representative signs informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Known history of AF or atrial flutter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has defibrillator or pacemaker capable of detecting AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has indication for indefinite OAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has indefinite contra-indication to OAC. (Patients with temporary&#xD;
             ineligibility for OAC, for example due to the need for invasive medical procedures or&#xD;
             large acute brain infarction, are eligible for enrollment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Stroke due to known cause not listed in inclusion criterion 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Cardioembolic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Inability to comply with LifeStar ACT monitoring regimen.&#xD;
