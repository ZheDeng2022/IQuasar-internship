    <textblock>
      Healthcare associated infections increase morbidity and mortality among all hospitalized&#xD;
      patients, especially in those who are immunocompromised, in both developed and in countries&#xD;
      with limited resources. However, when resources are limited, infection prevention and control&#xD;
      measures are often overlooked by personnel and institutions. Hand hygiene has been shown&#xD;
      numerous times to be the most effective way to prevent infections in the healthcare setting.&#xD;
      In Unidad Nacional de Oncologia Pediatrica (UNOP) in Guatemala City, Guatemala, there have&#xD;
      been several infrastructural improvements and periodic education and promotion activities.&#xD;
      Still, acceptable hand hygiene compliance has not yet been sustainably achieved. The&#xD;
      investigators wish to study reasons why staff at UNOP do or do not practice hand hygiene when&#xD;
      it is indicated through the use of focus groups and interviews.&#xD;

      Healthcare associated infections (HAI) are a concern in all parts of the world. Patients who&#xD;
      are immune-compromised by chemotherapy, HIV/AIDS, or organ transplant are especially&#xD;
      susceptible to infection. In addition to the opportunistic infections that these patients are&#xD;
      at risk of acquiring, the emergence of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and&#xD;
      vancomycin resistant Enterococcus species pose a risk to healthy individuals as well. Hand&#xD;
      hygiene is one of the most important infection prevention practices for everyone in a&#xD;
      hospital. In resource-poor countries, infection prevention and control programs are often&#xD;
      neglected due to a lack of funding and organizational priorities. The Division of Infectious&#xD;
      Diseases - International Outreach (ID-IO) has partnered with several hospitals in Latin&#xD;
      America to mentor healthcare providers and provide key supplies so that they deliver the best&#xD;
      care and prevent infection in units where the patients have the greatest risk of acquiring&#xD;
      and dying from infections. Because of its importance, ID-IO has focused on hand hygiene as a&#xD;
      building block for safe care at these hospitals; therefore, each year, at these hospitals, a&#xD;
      hospital-wide education and promotion effort on hand hygiene is completed. The topics covered&#xD;
      are general hospital hygiene, access to hand hygiene stations, and ensuring that adequate&#xD;
      supplies for hand hygiene are available. Observation of hand hygiene practices before,&#xD;
      during, and after bedside clinical activities shows there is a temporary improvement in&#xD;
      compliance with current hand hygiene guidelines; however, the rates of compliance decline&#xD;
      again as HAIs increase. In this study, the investigators propose to use already available&#xD;
      hand hygiene practice surveillance and healthcare associated infection documentation and&#xD;
      obtain the healthcare professionals' opinions and experiences that affect the practice of&#xD;
      hand hygiene. Because motivation and barriers to practice hand hygiene derive from more than&#xD;
      just education and adequate supplies, the investigators would like to understand the reasons&#xD;
      why the healthcare providers do and do not practice hand hygiene when indicated. The methods&#xD;
      to be used in this study are focus group meetings and structured interviews with staff of&#xD;
      Unidad Nacional de Oncologia Pediatrica in Guatemala City, Guatemala.&#xD;
