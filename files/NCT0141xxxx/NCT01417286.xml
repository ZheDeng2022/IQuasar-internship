    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well giving accelerated radiation therapy (RT) after surgery&#xD;
      works in treating patients with breast cancer. RT uses high energy x rays to kill tumor&#xD;
      cells. Giving RT after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Freedom from local failure and freedom from regional failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Acute toxicity and late toxicity using previously published toxicity scales. II. To&#xD;
      identify co-variates responsible for poor cosmetic outcome in women with reconstructed chest&#xD;
      walls when treated with accelerated, hypofractionated radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate toxicity, cosmesis, and local control with molecular markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo hypofractionated accelerated RT over 11 weekdays (for 15 elapsed days)&#xD;
      within 21-63 days after last surgery or last course of chemotherapy. Treatment continues in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2-8 weeks, every 3-6 months&#xD;
      for 3 years, every 6-12 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;
