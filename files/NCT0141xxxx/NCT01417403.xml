      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of hydroxychloroquine in treating&#xD;
      patients with solid tumors undergoing radiation therapy for bone metastases. Drugs, such as&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine, may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of hydroxychloroquine that can safely be&#xD;
      administered to cancer patients in association with radiation prior to developing this&#xD;
      approach for disease treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning 3 days before the initiation of radiotherapy, patients receive hydroxychloroquine&#xD;
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID). Treatment continues until completion of&#xD;
      radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Recently published data that has shown HCQ to be safe when combined with chemo and or radiation&#xD;
    at even higher doses than what is used in this study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a histologically confirmed solid tumor with radiographic evidence&#xD;
             of bony metastatic disease and symptoms requiring palliative radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase&#xD;
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT])&#xD;
             =&lt;2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 60&#xD;
             mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with calculated creatinine levels above institutional&#xD;
             normal limits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study or those&#xD;
             who have not recovered from acute adverse events due to agents administered more than&#xD;
             4 weeks earlier&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have received prior radiotherapy to the intended site&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from acute adverse events due to previous radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are neurologically unstable due to uncontrolled brain metastases are&#xD;
             excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they&#xD;
             often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of&#xD;
             neurologic and other adverse events. - - History of allergic reactions attributed to&#xD;
             compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to hydroxychloroquine&#xD;

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant or may become pregnant during treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with severe psoriasis who may experience a flare of disease with&#xD;
             hydroxychloroquine use&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known liver dysfunction (elevated transaminases or abnormal coagulation&#xD;
             studies); patients with metastatic disease to the liver with normal liver function&#xD;
             studies may be enrolled&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with retinopathy&#xD;
