      Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin following exposure to UVB light from the sun or artificial&#xD;
      sources, and occurs naturally in a small range of foods.More recently, several reports&#xD;
      underlined the impact of vitamin D on the prevalence and consequences of inadequate vitamin D&#xD;
      intake and the research supporting its benefits for alleviating chronic musculoskeletal pain&#xD;
      and fatigue syndromes in outpatients. Experts have recommended that vitamin D inadequacy&#xD;
      should be addressed in all patients with bone or joint pain, myalgia, fibromyalgia, or&#xD;
      chronic fatigue syndrome. It appears that soothing the daily musculoskeletal pain by&#xD;
      supplementation of vitamin D may be a simple, well tolerated, and cost-effective modality.&#xD;

      The immune and clinical impacts of vitamin D in patients with chronic musculo-skeletal pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Vitamin D is a group of fat-soluble secosteroids, the two major physiologically&#xD;
      relevant forms are vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). Vitamin D&#xD;
      without a subscript refers to either D2 or D3 or both. Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin&#xD;
      following exposure to UVB light from the sun or artificial sources, and occurs naturally in a&#xD;
      small range of foods. Vitamin D is carried in the bloodstream to the liver, where it is&#xD;
      converted into the prohormone calcidiol. Circulating calcidiol may then be converted into&#xD;
      calcitriol, the biologically active form of vitamin D, either in the kidneys or by&#xD;
      monocyte-macrophages in the immune system. When synthesized by monocyte-macrophages,&#xD;
      calcitriol acts locally as a cytokine, defending the body against microbial invaders (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When synthesized in the kidneys, calcitriol circulates as a hormone, regulating among other&#xD;
      things, the concentration of calcium and phosphate in the bloodstream, promoting the healthy&#xD;
      mineralization, growth and remodeling of bone, and also vital to the normal function of the&#xD;
      different arms of the immune system (1;2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D receptor activation in the intestine, bone, kidney, and parathyroid gland cells&#xD;
      leads to the maintenance of calcium and phosphorus levels in the blood (with the assistance&#xD;
      of parathyroid hormone and calcitonin) and to the maintenance of bone content. Vitamin D&#xD;
      increases expression of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene in adrenal medullary cells. Vitamin D&#xD;
      is involved in the biosynthesis of neurotrophic factors, synthesis of nitric oxide synthase,&#xD;
      and increased glutathione levels. Adequate vitamin D may also be associated with healthy hair&#xD;
      follicle growth cycles (3). Vitamin D insufficiency can result in thin and brittle bones,&#xD;
      whereas sufficiency prevents rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults and helps to&#xD;
      protect elderly from osteoporosis. Vitamin D has also direct on muscle strength and function&#xD;
      (4;5). Nevertheless, there is no persuasive evidence of lower vitamin D status in chronic&#xD;
      pain sufferers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are also associations between low 25(OH)D levels and peripheral vascular disease (6),&#xD;
      certain cancers (7-10), multiple sclerosis (11), rheumatoid arthritis (12-15), juvenile&#xD;
      diabetes (16-18), Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease (19;20). However these associations&#xD;
      were found in observational studies and vitamin D vitamin supplements have not been&#xD;
      demonstrated to reduce the risks of these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, several reports underlined the impact of vitamin D on the prevalence and&#xD;
      consequences of inadequate vitamin D intake and the research supporting its benefits for&#xD;
      alleviating chronic musculoskeletal pain and fatigue syndromes in outpatients. There are&#xD;
      extensive reports of pain worldwide and much of it is chronic, lasting 3 or more months,&#xD;
      primarily involving muscles, bones and joints. In the United States, more than half of all&#xD;
      adults participating in surveys have reported long term persistent or intermittent pain, with&#xD;
      the lower and upper back, neck, shoulders, hips, and knees mentioned most frequently (21).&#xD;
      For lower-back pain alone, an annual incidence of 50% and a lifetime prevalence of up to 80%&#xD;
      have been reported (22). In more than 8 out of 10 cases, the causes are nonspecific, without&#xD;
      evidence of injury, disease, or anatomical defect (23;24). More than a quarter (28%) of&#xD;
      patients with chronic pain rate the effectiveness of medical treatments as poor, and most&#xD;
      (77%) believe that new options are needed to treat their pain (25-27). It appears that&#xD;
      soothing the daily musculoskeletal pain by supplementation of vitamin D may be a simple, well&#xD;
      tolerated, and cost-effective modality. Experts have recommended that vitamin D inadequacy&#xD;
      should be addressed in all patients with bone or joint pain, myalgia, fibromyalgia, or&#xD;
      chronic fatigue syndrome (28;29). However, this seems to be unknown or overlooked by many&#xD;
      healthcare providers. Research on vitamin D is still an emerging field, and there are&#xD;
      divergent opinions among experts regarding many aspects of vitamin D pharmacology, function,&#xD;
      and adequate intake needed for good health. While further research is needed, the clinical&#xD;
      evidence to date recommending vitamin D supplementation for musculoskeletal pain and&#xD;
      associated symptoms seems to be growing. In 3670 patients taking part in different studies&#xD;
      with musculoskeletal pain significant vitamin D inadequacies were found in 48% to 100%. A&#xD;
      study from the Mayo Clinic reported that a whopping 93% of patients with &quot;chronic nonspecific&#xD;
      pain syndromes&quot; had deficient levels of vitamin D (30). When supplementation was provided for&#xD;
      improving vitamin D status, pain and/or muscle weakness were resolved or at least subsided in&#xD;
      most cases, and there were associated improvements in physical functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recently reported prospective study of 51 patients with type 2 diabetes and associated&#xD;
      chronic, painful neuropathy found that conservative vitamin D supplementation (about 2000&#xD;
      IU/day) for 3 months resulted in nearly a 50% decrease in pain scores, with symptoms&#xD;
      improving from &quot;distressing&quot; to &quot;mild&quot; on average (31). There had been an earlier case report&#xD;
      of a patient with type 1 diabetes whose severe neuropathy had confined her to a wheelchair.&#xD;
      This patient's aches and pains were resolved by high-dose vitamin D supplementation, and she&#xD;
      reportedly was able to walk unassisted within 4 weeks (32). Other therapies need not be&#xD;
      discontinued during a trial of vitamin D &quot;analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Miller et al (33) evaluated in a cohort from the Baltimore Hip Studies, women aged &gt;65 years&#xD;
      were at baseline and 2, 6, and 12 months after hip fracture repair. Serum at baseline was&#xD;
      analyzed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and serum from all time points was analyzed for&#xD;
      IL-6, women with vitamin D deficiency at the time of hip fracture had higher serum IL-6&#xD;
      levels in the year after hip fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of study To study the potential therapeutic effects of vitamin D supplementation on&#xD;
      patients with persistent musculo-skeletal pain. Clinical and laboratory parameters will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods We enrolled 80 patients of the age 18-80 years suffering from chronic&#xD;
      musculo-skeletal pain (low back pain, fibromyalgia, chronic widespread pain) at least 6&#xD;
      months. The enrollees will be randomized in a double-blinded manner into the two following&#xD;
      groups: Group 1 will receive daily doses of 4000 units of vitamin D ( 4 drops of 1,000 each)&#xD;
      and Group 2 will receive a placebo. Written informed consent will be obtained from all&#xD;
      participating patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of recruitment blood will be drawn in order to determine the levels of 25&#xD;
      OH-Vitamin D, CRP, IL-6, IL-8, TNF and prostaglandin E2. Vitamin D or placebo will be taken&#xD;
      for 6 weeks on top of the individual's daily medications. A second blood analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted following the 6 week duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional outcome measures pain intensity assessed by visual analog score (VAS) (0 = no&#xD;
      pain, 10 = worst imaginable pain), short form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SMPQ), patient&#xD;
      global perceived effect (PGPE), scored by the patient on a 7-point Likert scale (from very&#xD;
      bad to very good), quality of life assessed by SF-36 Questionnaire will be evaluated at base&#xD;
      line, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 6 months after the inclusion . At 12 weeks period a third 25&#xD;
      OH-Vitamin D blood level will be measured. Rescue medication will be provided as paracetamol&#xD;
      325mg+codein 15 mg. Consumption of pain medication will be recorded during the study and 2&#xD;
      week intervals. Adverse events will be recorded on each 6 weeks period and on patient report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vitamin D levels will be assessed by using the commercial kit, LIAISON® 25-OH vitamin D&#xD;
      Assay (310900) (Cardinal Health, Inc., Dublin, OH, USA). The method for quantitative&#xD;
      determination of 25-OH vitamin D is a direct, competitive chemiluminescence immunoassay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other assays will be assessed by ELISA kits. Statistics will be performed using the SPSS&#xD;
      18th edition using the Student's t-test or the Chi-Square test and if appropriate with&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test. To adjust for differences in the baseline values, the analyses will be&#xD;
      performed by using a multivariate logistic regression model. Consumption of medication will&#xD;
      be compared using the Man-Whitney U test. Significance will be regarded if the p values will&#xD;
      be lower than 0.05.&#xD;
