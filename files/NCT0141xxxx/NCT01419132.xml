  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High values of cardiac troponin (Ct) in acute heart failure (ADHF) identify patients (pts) at&#xD;
      higher risk and worsened prognosis. A Ct increase during therapy indicates the need for more&#xD;
      appropriate intervention, aimed at compensating cardiac disease and effectively minimizing&#xD;
      myocardial wall stress and subsequent cytolysis. This study evaluated the effects of an&#xD;
      intravenous high-dose of furosemide with or without small-volume hypertonic saline solution&#xD;
      (HSS)on myocardial cytolysis in ADHF pts.&#xD;

      After randomization, all patients included in the study underwent a complete physical&#xD;
      examination, including a careful check of HF signs and symptoms, including BW measurement (in&#xD;
      the morning before breakfast), supine and standing blood pressure (BP [the mean of 3&#xD;
      measurements]), and heart rate (HR). Fasting blood samples were drawn to determine the serum&#xD;
      levels of Na, K, Cl, bicarbonate, albumin, uric acid, creatinine, urea, and glycemia on a&#xD;
      daily basis during hospitalization, and this was continued until a clinically compensated&#xD;
      state was obtained. The total daily output of urine was collected for measuring levels of&#xD;
      creatinine clearance, urinary Na and K. A chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and&#xD;
      echocardiogram (prior to commencing therapy and again when discharged. In addition, BNP and&#xD;
      TNI plasma levels will be evaluated for all patients on entry and at discharge. Each patient&#xD;
      provided written informed consent prior to participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine GFR, the MDRD formula (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease),&#xD;
      involving 4 parameters, was deployed. It provides an estimate of GFR comparable or superior&#xD;
      to other formulae, with the advantage of not requiring any anthropometric measurements.&#xD;
      According to the MDRD, GFR can be estimated using the following formula: GFR (ml/min/1.73m2)&#xD;
      = 175 x {[serum creatinine (mg / dL or Î¼mol/L/88.4)] -1.154 x {age (years) }-0.203 x 0.742 if&#xD;
      female and 1.21 if Afro-American. The estimating of GFR by means of the MDRD formula is a&#xD;
      useful and valid tool with which to obtain an index of kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The echocardiography M / B mode color Doppler will be performed with a Vivid 7&#xD;
      echocardiograph, with patients in a supine position and slightly left lateral decubitus. The&#xD;
      mitral flow and the time taken for the wave to return to baseline (DTE) were evaluated from&#xD;
      the apical 4 room positions, placing the sample volume of pulsed Doppler at the peak of the&#xD;
      valve leaflets during the opening. Subsequently, the speed of early diastolic movement (Ea)&#xD;
      of mitral annulus, obtained from the 4 room projection placing the sample volume of pulsed&#xD;
      tissue Doppler onto lateral corner of the annulus, was assessed as an index of left&#xD;
      ventricular relaxation. By measuring the Ea wave and the E / Ea ratio, the PCWP was evaluated&#xD;
      in a quantitative way according to the following formulae:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCWP = 1.24 E / Ea + 1.91 for those in sinus rhythm PCWP = 0.821 E / Ea + 6.489 for those in&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation. Calculating dp/dt. The calculating of dp/dt was performed by a spectral&#xD;
      analysis of mitral regurgitation at CW Doppler. Two points were chosen on the mitral&#xD;
      regurgitation curve for the correct calculation of echocardiographic dp / dt: A: speed 1 m /&#xD;
      sec = 4 mm Hg; and B: speed 3 m / sec = 36 mm Hg. The pressure gradient between these two&#xD;
      point was reported to be 32 mmHg (A - B = 36 - 4 = 32). dP/dT was calculated by dividing the&#xD;
      pressure gradient between the two points for the temporal distance between them: dP / dT =&#xD;
      32mmHg / T msec.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioelectrical impedance variables will be detected with an impedance plethysmograph using a&#xD;
      previously-described methodology (18). This emitted an alternating sinusoidal electric&#xD;
      current of 800 mA and an operating single frequency of 50 kHz; it which was calibrated each&#xD;
      morning using a standard resistor supplied by the manufacturer. BIA is a method for detecting&#xD;
      whole-body fluid overload and pulmonary congestion, based on the theory that the accumulation&#xD;
      of whole-body or intrathoracic fluid will conduct an electrical current passing across the&#xD;
      body or trunk more easily, leading to a decrease in whole-body or pulmonary bioimpedance.&#xD;
      Bioimpedance is a combination of resistance (Rz) (ie, the opposition of an alternating&#xD;
      current flowing through intra- and extra-cellular ionic solutions) and reactance (Xc) (ie,&#xD;
      the capacitative component of tissue interfaces, cell membranes, and organelles). As previous&#xD;
      described, in standard whole-body tetrapolar BIA, sensing electrodes were placed on: the&#xD;
      dorsum of the wrist, a line between the radial and ulnar styloid processes, the dorsum of the&#xD;
      ipsilateral foot, and on a line between the medial and lateral malleoli. Source electrodes&#xD;
      were placed to overlie the head of the third metacarpal on the dorsum of the hand and the&#xD;
      third metatarsal on the dorsum of the foot, on the same side as the sensing electrodes. The&#xD;
      measurements will be performed on the right side of the body with the patients in a&#xD;
      semi-orthopneic or supine position. According to the RzXc graph method of the BIA vector, the&#xD;
      impedance measurement will be standardized according to the height (H) of the subject,&#xD;
      expressing both Rz/H and Xc/H in ohm/meters, to establish the hydration state. Bioelectrical&#xD;
      impedance measurements will be assessed twice by the same experienced operator and paired&#xD;
      measurements for each patient were used in the analysis.&#xD;
