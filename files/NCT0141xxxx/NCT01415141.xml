  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis C is a major cause of liver disease and is thus an important public health&#xD;
      problem. Although some strains (genotypes) of the hepatitis C virus are highly responsive to&#xD;
      treatment with a combination of peginterferon and ribavirin, the most common form of the&#xD;
      virus (genotype 1) is relatively resistant to this treatment. Recently, telaprevir has been&#xD;
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration to be given in combination with peginterferon&#xD;
      and ribavirin. This 3-drug combination boosts the remission rate for genotype 1 hepatitis C&#xD;
      to that seen with other more responsive hepatitis C genotypes treated with only peginterferon&#xD;
      and ribavirin. However, telaprevir has additional side affects such as rash and anemia that&#xD;
      may limit its usefulness. Intriguingly, about one third of patients infected with genotype 1&#xD;
      hepatitis C, who have a specific variation (polymorphism) in the DNA sequence (CC) near an&#xD;
      immune response gene (IL28B), in fact are highly responsive to 2-drug treatment with&#xD;
      peginterferon and ribavirin. This raises the possibility that individuals who have the IL28B&#xD;
      CC polymorphism may not need to be treated with the addition of telaprevir and could&#xD;
      therefore be spared unnecessary side effects. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine&#xD;
      among genotype 1 hepatitis C patients with the IL28B CC polymorphism the success rate and&#xD;
      side effects of 3-drug treatment compared with 2-drug treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C who have the IL28B CC&#xD;
      polymorphism will be randomly assigned to be treated with telaprevir, peginterferon, and&#xD;
      ribavirin or with only peginterferon with ribavirin. These medications and the procedures&#xD;
      involved, including patient history, physical examination, and obtaining small volume blood&#xD;
      specimens (less than 4 teaspoons) for laboratory testing, are within the scope of standard&#xD;
      management of hepatitis C treatment. All patients will be monitored during treatment with&#xD;
      periodic blood testing (weeks 2, 4, and every 4 weeks thereafter while on treatment, and 24&#xD;
      weeks after stopping treatment) and office visits (weeks 5, 12, 25, 49 while on treatment and&#xD;
      25 weeks after stopping treatment). The success of treatment will be judged by the presence&#xD;
      or absence of detectable virus in blood, as measured by a sensitive diagnostic test (PCR).&#xD;
      The data to be generated will include measurement by PCR of hepatitis C viral loads before,&#xD;
      during, and after treatment, as well as reporting of adverse drug effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which affects 1-2% of adults in the&#xD;
      United States, is a major risk factor for liver failure due to cirrhosis and/or&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (Davis 2010). Epidemiological information suggests that the&#xD;
      frequency of these HCV-related sequelae is likely to continue to increase over the next 10-15&#xD;
      years unless effective and well-tolerated treatments become available. Development of&#xD;
      improved antiviral therapy is thus an important public health priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently, the most effective treatment for chronic HCV infection has been a combination&#xD;
      of peginterferon and ribavirin, given for up to 48 weeks. With this regimen, the sustained&#xD;
      virological response (SVR), defined as undetectable HCV RNA 24 weeks after completion of&#xD;
      antiviral treatment, is approximately 50-60% (Hoofnagle 2006). Not all patients are able to&#xD;
      complete therapy however; up to 10% will discontinue this prematurely as a result of&#xD;
      intolerable side effects, predominantly depression and/or fatigue (Seeff 2010). The major&#xD;
      determinants of responsiveness to antiviral therapy are viral genotype and selected host&#xD;
      characteristics. Hepatitis C genotype 1 (HCV-1), which accounts for approximately 70% of&#xD;
      chronic infections in North America, and is relatively resistant to treatment with&#xD;
      peginterferon and ribavirin. SVR with treatment for HCV-1 is approximately 40% (Hoofnagle&#xD;
      2006). That said, among HCV-1-infected individuals, there is diversity in SVR, which is&#xD;
      correlated with a dinucleotide polymorphism at a locus upstream of the interleukin 28B&#xD;
      (IL28B) gene. Specifically, with 48 weeks of peginterferon and ribavirin therapy, 70% of&#xD;
      individuals with the IL28B CC polymorphism achieve SVR, compared with only 30% of individuals&#xD;
      with other IL28B polymorphisms (Thompson 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      New treatments for chronic HCV-1 infection are now available. In May 2011, the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) approved telaprevir, an orally available small molecule inhibitor of the&#xD;
      HCV-1 protease, for treatment of chronic HCV-1, to be given in combination with peginterferon&#xD;
      and ribavirin. In HCV-1-infected patients, this three-drug regimen has been shown to confer&#xD;
      an SVR of 75% (Jacobson 2011). However, this regimen appears to be associated with up to a&#xD;
      nearly 1.5-fold increase in premature drug discontinuation, in comparison with a regimen of&#xD;
      peginterferon, and ribavirin alone, largely influenced by the development of&#xD;
      telaprevir-associated rash. Given the high responsiveness to conventional peginterferon and&#xD;
      ribavirin among HCV-1-infected individuals with the IL28B CC polymorphism, we hypothesize SVR&#xD;
      will not be enhanced in such individuals by the addition of telaprevir to peginterferon and&#xD;
      ribavirin therapy. If this is correct, HCV-1-infected patients with the IL28B CC polymorphism&#xD;
      can then be treated with comparable success with peginterferon and ribavirin alone and will&#xD;
      therefore be spared telaprevir-associated adverse affects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study, which is a prospective randomized open label trial (in HCV-1-infected&#xD;
      subjects with the IL28B CC polymorphism) of treatment with telaprevir (T), peginterferon (P),&#xD;
      and ribavirin (R) versus PR alone, will test the working hypothesis. The study design takes&#xD;
      advantage of the concept of response-guided treatment, a strategy in which the duration of&#xD;
      antiviral treatment is based upon the presence or absence of a rapid virological response&#xD;
      (RVR), defined as loss of detectable serum HCV RNA within the first 4 weeks of therapy. In&#xD;
      particular, it has been shown that HCV-1 patients who achieve RVR (and maintain undetectable&#xD;
      HCV RNA at 12 weeks (defined as eRVR), with either PR-containing or TPR-containing regimens&#xD;
      have comparable SVR with 24 weeks, compared with 48 weeks, of total treatment (Mangia 2008,&#xD;
      Jacobson 2011).&#xD;
