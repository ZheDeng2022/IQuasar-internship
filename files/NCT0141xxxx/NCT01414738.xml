  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that avoidance of the hippocampal region with WBRT (Whole-Brain&#xD;
      Radiotherapy ) may delay or reduce the onset, frequency, and/or severity of NCF&#xD;
      (neurocognitive function) decline, as measured with clinical neurocognitive tools.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to use conformal avoidance of the hippocampal region during whole brain&#xD;
      radiotherapy to reduce the dose to the hippocampi, thereby putatively limiting the&#xD;
      radiation-induced inflammation of the hippocampal region and subsequent alteration of the&#xD;
      microenvironment of the neural progenitor cells&#xD;

    <measure>Mean Change in *Delayed* Recall Score by Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R DR) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The HVLT-R is a validated test to assess neurocognitive function and it incorporates 6 different forms, each including 12 nouns (targets) with 4 words drawn from 3 semantic categories.&#xD;
*Delayed*recall was measured by recalling the 12 targets after a 20-minute delay.&#xD;
1 point is awarded for each successfully recalled target. There is no range- recalling more is more memory.&#xD;
Mean change was calculated by the following formula: 100*(3 month - baseline) / baseline</description>

    <measure>Health-related Quality of Life as Assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy With Brain Subscale (FACT-BR)</measure>
    <time_frame>39 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy with Brain Subscale (FACT-BR). The FACT-BR is a multidimensional, self-report quality of life instrument specifically designed and validated for use with brain malignancy patients. It is written at the 4th grade reading level and can be completed in 5-10 minutes with little or no assistance in patients who are not neurologically incapacitated. It measures quality of life related to symptoms or problems across 5 scales: physical well-being (7 items); social/family well-being (7 items);emotional well-being (6 items); functional well-being (7 items); and concerns relevant to patients with brain tumors (23 items).&#xD;
Items are rated on a 5-point scale (0-5): 0-&quot;not at all&quot;, 1- &quot;a little bit&quot;, 2-&quot;somewhat&quot;, 3-&quot;quite a bit&quot; and 4-&quot;very much&quot;, with HIGHER scores indicating a better quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>39 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ (Euroqol)-5D (5 Dimension) health related quality of life questionnaire is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome.&#xD;
Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. . The US version of the EQ-5D will be used, to enable mapping of general HR-QoL (Health-related quality of life) scores from EQ-5D scores into health state utility scores (ranging from 0 to 1) for the US population.&#xD;
Possible scores range from 0 to 1, with HIGHER scores indicating a better quality of life.</description>

        <description>The HVLT-R is a validated test to assess neurocognitive function and it incorporates 6 different forms, each including 12 nouns (targets) with 4 words drawn from 3 semantic categories.&#xD;
*Delayed*recall was measured by recalling the 12 targets after a 20-minute delay.&#xD;
1 point is awarded for each successfully recalled target. There is no range- recalling more is more memory.&#xD;
Mean change was calculated by the following formula: 100*(3 month - baseline) / baseline</description>

        <description>Trail Making Test (TMT) is a measure of visuospatial scanning, attention, sequencing, and speed and executive function. Patients must &quot;connect the dots&quot; either in a numbered sequence or alternating letters and numbers.&#xD;
The TMT has two parts that are referred to as the Trail Making Test Part A and the Trail Making Test Part B.&#xD;
In Part A, the circles are numbered 1 - 25, and the patient should draw lines to connect the numbers in ascending order.&#xD;
Possible score ranges from 0-3 minutes with higher score (more seconds/minutes) indicating significant cognitive impairment.&#xD;

        <title>Health-related Quality of Life as Assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy With Brain Subscale (FACT-BR)</title>
        <description>Quality of life will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy with Brain Subscale (FACT-BR). The FACT-BR is a multidimensional, self-report quality of life instrument specifically designed and validated for use with brain malignancy patients. It is written at the 4th grade reading level and can be completed in 5-10 minutes with little or no assistance in patients who are not neurologically incapacitated. It measures quality of life related to symptoms or problems across 5 scales: physical well-being (7 items); social/family well-being (7 items);emotional well-being (6 items); functional well-being (7 items); and concerns relevant to patients with brain tumors (23 items).&#xD;
Items are rated on a 5-point scale (0-5): 0-&quot;not at all&quot;, 1- &quot;a little bit&quot;, 2-&quot;somewhat&quot;, 3-&quot;quite a bit&quot; and 4-&quot;very much&quot;, with HIGHER scores indicating a better quality of life.</description>

        <description>The EQ (Euroqol)-5D (5 Dimension) health related quality of life questionnaire is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome.&#xD;
Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. . The US version of the EQ-5D will be used, to enable mapping of general HR-QoL (Health-related quality of life) scores from EQ-5D scores into health state utility scores (ranging from 0 to 1) for the US population.&#xD;
Possible scores range from 0 to 1, with HIGHER scores indicating a better quality of life.</description>
