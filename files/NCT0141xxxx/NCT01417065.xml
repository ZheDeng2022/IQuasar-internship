  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research trial is to study the effects of the FDA-approved drug,&#xD;
      temsirolimus, using a new type of clinical study design called a &quot;Phase 0.&quot; This type of&#xD;
      study may be able to predict if a drug can affect cancer and may be able to prevent&#xD;
      potentially useful study drugs from being discarded before they are fully tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is not to treat the cancer, but to help improve general cancer&#xD;
      treatment knowledge.&#xD;

      Study Drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temsirolimus is designed to block the growth of cancer cells, which may cause the cancer&#xD;
      cells to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive temsirolimus by&#xD;
      vein over about 60 minutes on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be assigned to a dose level of temsirolimus based on when you join this study. Up to&#xD;
      5 dose levels of temsirolimus will be tested. Up to 3 participants will be enrolled at each&#xD;
      dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new&#xD;
      group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, until the drug is found to affect&#xD;
      the enzyme that was tested for at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each study visit, you will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and about any side&#xD;
      effects you may be having.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn before you receive the study drug and 5&#xD;
      times over the 24 hours after you receive the study drug for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. PK&#xD;
      testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about 4 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for pharmacodynamic (PD) testing. PD&#xD;
      testing measures how the level of study drug in your body may affect the disease. This blood&#xD;
      will be drawn at 1 or more of the following times, but if the doctor thinks it is needed,&#xD;
      blood will be drawn at 2 or all 3 of the following times:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 4 hours (+/- 2 hours) after the dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 24 hours (+/- 3 hours) after the dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 72 hours (+/- 24 hours) after the dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the blood for PD testing has been tested and the tests show that the study drug may be&#xD;
      causing changes to the tumor cells in at least 2 out of 3 participants, future participants&#xD;
      will have tumor tissue collected before and after dosing for testing. Leftover tissue from an&#xD;
      earlier biopsy can be used instead of a fresh biopsy before dosing, if it is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be on study for up to 4 days. You will be taken off study early if you have&#xD;
      intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because it takes 4 days for temsirolimus to be completely processed by the body, you will not&#xD;
      be able to begin receiving drugs in any other study until 4 days after the dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Temsirolimus is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of advanced renal cancer. Its use in other types of cancer is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

    <description>PD response, significant S6 Kinase 1 (S6K1) inhibition, is defined at both the patient level and the dose level, 1) as compared with baseline, at least 50% reductions of S6K1 after treatment (biological criterion); 2) differences in log transformed S6K1 activity between post-treatment and baseline should be greater than threshold of 1.8 times standard deviation (SD) of baseline, which yields a 90% statistical confidence that it is not due to chance variation (statistical criterion).</description>

             However, patients may also be allowed on protocol if they are undergoing screening for&#xD;
