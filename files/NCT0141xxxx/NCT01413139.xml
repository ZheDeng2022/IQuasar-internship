  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate puncture site complication rate&#xD;
      as well as the short- and long-term (up to 24 months) outcome of treatment by means of Astron&#xD;
      Pulsar / Astron Pulsar-18 stent implantation in symptomatic (Rutherford 2-4) femoro-popliteal&#xD;
      arterial stenotic or occlusive lesions, using 4F compatible devices of BIOTRONIK and without&#xD;
      the use of a closure device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the primary patency at 12 months is non-inferior to the primary&#xD;
      patency obtained in the Durability study (72.2%).&#xD;
