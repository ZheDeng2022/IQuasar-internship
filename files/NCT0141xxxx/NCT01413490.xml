  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus is one of the leading causes of liver failure and liver cancer worldwide.&#xD;
      Current treatment of hepatitis C infection is only successful in about half of those who are&#xD;
      eligible. The current treatment aims to boost the host immune system but does not directly&#xD;
      act on the virus. Many drugs are in various stages of development that target the virus&#xD;
      directly - their specific mode of action is confirmed by showing the virus is forced to adapt&#xD;
      in the presence of the drug. As with many viruses, treating with only one specific drug would&#xD;
      quickly lead to the virus adapting and becoming resistant. We therefore need to find new&#xD;
      combinations of directly acting drugs. Rimantadine has already been shown in the laboratory&#xD;
      to target hepatitis C directly. We have designed this study to see if it happens in real life&#xD;
      as well. If so, we could use rimantadine to help fight hepatitis c more effectively.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a diagnosis of HCV infection, genotype 1 or genotype 3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be eligible for standard combination therapy with pegylated IFN and ribavirin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be at least 18 but no more than 65 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have signed an informed consent indicating that the patient is aware of the infectious&#xD;
             nature of their disease and have been informed of the procedures of the protocol, the&#xD;
             experimental nature of the therapy, alternatives, potential benefits, side effects,&#xD;
             risks, and discomforts&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, the treatment plan, and&#xD;
             laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have no contraindications to receiving rimantadine therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have blood results within defined acceptable haematological and biochemical parameters&#xD;
             (haemoglobin &gt;10 g/dl, platelet count &gt;150 x 109/L, bilirubin &lt;25 umol/L, albumin &gt;35&#xD;
             g/L, creatinine &lt;150 umol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have dementia or altered mental status that would prohibit informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have previously received treatment for HCV infection (i.e. are currently treatment&#xD;
             na√Øve)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any condition which would deem the patient ineligible for combination therapy&#xD;
             with pegylated IFN or ribavirin. This includes pregnancy, significant cardiac, renal&#xD;
             or autoimmune disease, severe depression or psychosis, and previous organ&#xD;
             transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cirrhosis or liver failure as evidenced by clinical (cutaneous stigmata of chronic&#xD;
             liver disease, ascites, encephalopathy), ultrasonic (cirrhotic appearance of liver,&#xD;
             ascites) or biochemical (platelet count &gt;150 x 109/L, bilirubin &lt;25 umol/L, albumin&#xD;
             &gt;35 g/L) evidence, routinely collated in all patients diagnosed with HCV&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition which would preclude the use of rimantadine. This comprises significant&#xD;
             renal impairment (creatinine &gt;150), pregnancy, epilepsy or history of unexplained&#xD;
             seizures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any other severe, acute, or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or&#xD;
             laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation&#xD;
             or study drug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results&#xD;
             and, in the judgment of the Chief Investigators, would make the patient inappropriate&#xD;
             for this study. This includes the presence of end stage liver disease (cirrhosis), and&#xD;
             HIV infection&#xD;
