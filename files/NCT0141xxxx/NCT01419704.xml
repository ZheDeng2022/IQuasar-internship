    <textblock>
      This proposal is a phase I/II feasibility study to demonstrate that mixed chimerism can be&#xD;
      established with minimal risk in recipients with hemoglobinopathies treated with&#xD;
      Campath-1H-based nonmyeloablative conditioning and graft engineering to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD), but preserve engraftment of donor cells.&#xD;
