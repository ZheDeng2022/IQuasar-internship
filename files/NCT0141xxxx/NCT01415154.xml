      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of scheduled maintenance Transcranial&#xD;
      Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) treatment compared to on-demand TMS treatment for symptomatic&#xD;
      worsening in patients who have shown a clinical response to acute TMS treatment.&#xD;

      This is a 12-month maintenance treatment study for patients who have responded to a 6 week&#xD;
      course of acute TMS treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). The study will seek to&#xD;
      assess the change in depressive symptomatology across the duration of maintenance treatment&#xD;
      using observer and self-administered efficacy measures. Describe the efficacy of TMS&#xD;
      re-introduction in patients not receiving maintenance pharmacotherapy who show a recurrence&#xD;
      of depressive symptoms. Assess the safety and durability of acute TMS therapy followed by&#xD;
      maintenance TMS treatment for up to 12 months.&#xD;
