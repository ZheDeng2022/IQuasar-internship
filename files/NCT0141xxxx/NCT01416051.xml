  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today's obesogenic environment, favors behavioral choices that lead to an excess of energy&#xD;
      intake over expenditure, and consequently weight gain. Intervention strategies that harness&#xD;
      the body's own appetite and satiety regulating signals could provide an effective means of&#xD;
      countering excessive energy intake. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a&#xD;
      vegetable oil emulsion (Olibra) would result in weight loss that was associated with a&#xD;
      reduction in food intake.&#xD;

      71 healthy subjects were enrolled (60 females, 11 males; Age: 18 - 60 years, BMI 25 - 40&#xD;
      kg/m2) in a two-phased, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel trial. During&#xD;
      a 12-week period, Olibra was compared with a placebo (milk fat). Food intake testing was&#xD;
      conducted on three days and anthropometric data was collected on 7 days. Key outcome measures&#xD;
      were, body weight, body composition, energy intake, and appetite ratings.&#xD;
