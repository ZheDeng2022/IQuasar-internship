  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is one of the most common manifestations of myofascial pain&#xD;
      syndromes. The total annual cost of FMS is $2298 per patient in Canada. A Canadian study&#xD;
      suggests that FMS-related productivity loss costs per year are $10,068 per patient. The&#xD;
      average cost of health resources in Canada is 30% higher in FMS patients compared to non-FMS&#xD;
      patients and the prevalence of FMS in Canada is 1.1%, leading to a total of over 340 thousand&#xD;
      Canadians suffering from FMS. As a result, the annual economic burden of FMS to the Canadian&#xD;
      healthcare system is more than $425 million.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typically, FMS patients have widespread musculoskeletal pain with associated non-specific&#xD;
      tender points. There is an increase in prevalence in active myofascial trigger points (MTrPs)&#xD;
      contributing to the widespread musculoskeletal pain associated with FMS patients. MTrPs are&#xD;
      identified as hyperirritable muscular nodules located within taut bands of skeletal muscle&#xD;
      and can be classified as latent or active. Studies have shown that active and latent MTrPs&#xD;
      can play a determinant role in the not yet fully understood pathogenesis of FMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many common pathophysiological theories that exist for MTrP formation including&#xD;
      metabolic, biochemical, motor endplate dysfunction, and the neurogenic phenomenon. MTrPs may&#xD;
      be initiated by a sensitization within the common neurologic segment of the specific tissue&#xD;
      containing the MTrP. The physiological changes that occur at the MTrP are secondary to an&#xD;
      increased responsiveness of the neurons within the central nervous system leading to&#xD;
      increased nociception and increased perception of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there are a variety of therapeutic techniques established to treat MTrPs including&#xD;
      spinal manipulative therapy (SMT). SMT may attenuate the nociceptive component of spinal pain&#xD;
      and MTrPs. SMT increases pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) leading to mechanical hypoalgesia of&#xD;
      MTrPs in paraspinal muscles. Preliminary data collected by Srbely et al. has shown that there&#xD;
      is a significant increase in PPTs in infraspinatus MTrPs after cSMT to the C5-C6 spinal&#xD;
      segments compared to a sham procedure. The measure of PPT is a method of quantifying a&#xD;
      patient's perception of pain in a MTrP. PPTs can be defined as the least amount of pressure&#xD;
      stimulus at which a subject perceives pain upon the application of pressure in the form of&#xD;
      force.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The appropriate dosage (frequency of application) of SMT needed to achieve optimal pain&#xD;
      relief for patients with MTrPs has not been established. Haas et al. performed a pilot&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial to examine the dose response relationship between SMT and&#xD;
      cervicogenic headaches. The results showed there is a dose-response relationship, increasing&#xD;
      the dose of SMT leads to a decreased frequency and intensity of headaches. Additionally, Haas&#xD;
      and colleagues conducted a pilot study to make a preliminary identification of the number of&#xD;
      chiropractic manipulations required to decrease chronic low back pain and disability. The&#xD;
      results showed a positive dose-response relationship between SMT and low back pain.&#xD;
      Dose-response for MTrPs has yet to be established in the current literature. This preliminary&#xD;
      work will determine the proper dose-response for cSMT in the treatment of MTrPs in one single&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if the effect of cervical SMT on the PPT in a MTrP in the infraspinatus muscle&#xD;
      can be enhanced and/or extended after a 2nd cSMT is given during a single subject visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: There will be a statistically significant increase in PPTs in the MTrP in the&#xD;
      infraspinatus muscle after the second cervical SMT, as compared to the first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if the effect of two cervical SMTs on PPTs in a MTrP in the infraspinatus muscle&#xD;
      will be present at 48 hours follow-up. Data will be collected for descriptive purposes and&#xD;
      hypothesis generation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies show that manual therapy including SMT, is a cost effective method for treating&#xD;
      chronic pain and FMS. Currently, treatment protocols are arbitrarily selected based on&#xD;
      opinion or clinical experience. Providing proper guidelines for MTrP and SMT can increase the&#xD;
      effectiveness of treatment plans and decrease the financial cost of FMS on patients and the&#xD;
      healthcare system. For this preliminary work, looking at MTrP mechanism is best done in&#xD;
      isolation of FMS and therefore subjects without FMS will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Process Subjects will be recruited via convenience sampling from the Canadian&#xD;
      Memorial Chiropractic College campus and main campus clinic through announcements,&#xD;
      advertising, educating the student body and clinicians on the specific aims of this&#xD;
      particular study, by emailing the student body asking for volunteers, and by direct&#xD;
      recruitment through personal contact&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Screening The research assistant will assess all volunteers for eligibility. The&#xD;
      demographics of all of the volunteers will be collected including gender, age, height,&#xD;
      weight, hand dominance, and ethnicity. Demographics will be collected so that this&#xD;
      information can be compared to subjects that do have MTrPs in the infraspinatus muscle. All&#xD;
      volunteers meeting the eligibility criteria will be included. Reasons for exclusion will be&#xD;
      collected. Eligible healthy subjects will move on to a physical examination of the cervical&#xD;
      spine. The physical assessment will include a cervical range of motion screen, palpation of&#xD;
      the cervical spine, palpation of the infraspinatus muscle bilaterally, and an upper limb&#xD;
      neurological examination. Documentation if there was pain on palpation of the infraspinatus&#xD;
      MTrP occurred, if there was referral to the lateral aspect of the shoulder with or without&#xD;
      palpation of the infraspinatus MTrP, and if there was a local twitch response in the&#xD;
      infraspinatus MTrP for baseline information. Documentation if the MTrP is active or latent&#xD;
      will be performed at baseline and if there is failure of randomization a statistical analysis&#xD;
      will be performed. If, during the assessment the subject reports pain with cervical range of&#xD;
      motion, or cervical palpation, the presence of arm pain, decreased motor examination,&#xD;
      abnormal sensation, or the presence of hyper-reflexia or hypo-reflexia, the examination will&#xD;
      be terminated and the subject will be excluded from the study. Subjects with a MTrP in the&#xD;
      infraspinatus muscle will have a baseline PPT measurement performed with an algometer to&#xD;
      ensure the MTrP meets the inclusion of no more than 35N. Subjects that have no cervical spine&#xD;
      pain, no arm pain, and no neurological symptoms and a MTrP in the infraspinatus muscle no&#xD;
      more than 35N will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those included in the study will be randomly allocated to two separate groups. A&#xD;
      predetermined computer generated random allocation sequence will be used to separate&#xD;
      individuals into two groups, those who receive two rcSMT and those who receive one rcSMT and&#xD;
      one scSMT. The statistician will hold the randomization scheme. To ensure proper concealment&#xD;
      the statistician will not be involved in the experiment and the clinician and research&#xD;
      assistant will not be involved in the randomization scheme. The individual group allocations&#xD;
      will be printed by the research assistant and placed into blank white opaque numbered&#xD;
      envelopes. The white opaque envelopes will be numbered 001→ 013 for males and 014→026 for&#xD;
      females. The research assistant will record the number from the envelope on the subject&#xD;
      information sheet. The research assistant will give the participant an envelope to give to&#xD;
      the clinician. The research assistant will be blinded but the clinician will be educated what&#xD;
      the codes mean. The clinician will open the opaque numbered envelope and discretely look at&#xD;
      the randomization scheme printed on the white card inside, ensuring that the subject does not&#xD;
      see the randomization scheme. The card with the randomization scheme on it will then be&#xD;
      placed back in the opaque numbered envelope. For quality control purposes cavitation of the&#xD;
      rcSMT and scSMT will be monitored by the clinician, any cavitation in the scSMT will be&#xD;
      documented and accounted for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compensation The participants will receive compensation totaling $35.00 in the form of two&#xD;
      Tim Horton's gift cards (one for 10 dollars one for 25 dollars) in recognition of the&#xD;
      subject's time, parking, and gasoline. Subjects will receive a 5-dollar gift card if they&#xD;
      volunteer and are found not to have a MTrP in the infraspinatus muscle. A 10-dollar gift card&#xD;
      will be provided to those that complete the first day of the experiment and 25-dollar gift&#xD;
      card will be provided to those that follow-up after 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods related to both Specific Aims Eligible subjects will be asked to first read an&#xD;
      information letter and then sign an informed consent form for cSMT after all questions are&#xD;
      answered prior to the physical examination. The research assistant will then give the&#xD;
      subjects a gown to change into, all clothes covering the upper thorax, abdomen, and upper&#xD;
      extremities must be removed including but not limited to earrings, necklaces, bras,&#xD;
      undershirts, t-shirts, and sweaters. The subjects will be instructed by the research&#xD;
      assistant to place the gown on with the ties facing the back to facilitate palpation of the&#xD;
      infraspinatus muscle. Subjects will then be instructed to enter the lab and lie prone on the&#xD;
      chiropractic table. A black non-toxic marker will be used to indicate the exact location of&#xD;
      the MTrP in the infraspinatus muscle. The baseline PPT of the infraspinatus muscle will be&#xD;
      taken with a handheld algometer by the research assistant. For reliability PPT measures will&#xD;
      be taken 3 consecutive times at each time point. Following the baseline procedures, subjects&#xD;
      will move into the supine position on the chiropractic table with the head on a drop piece.&#xD;
      The clinician will be at the end of the chiropractic table where the subject's head will rest&#xD;
      on the drop headpiece. The clinician will perform either an intervention of two consecutive&#xD;
      rcSMT or one scSMT followed by one rcSMT on the ipsilateral side of the infraspinatus MTrP.&#xD;
      Manipulation of the cervical spine will be applied to the C5-C6 segments with a force&#xD;
      indicated for gapping the joint. After the intervention each subject will be asked to fill&#xD;
      out a questionnaire to address subject treatment expected bias. The subjects will fill out&#xD;
      the questionnaire and place it in a sealed numbered envelope and give it to the research&#xD;
      assistant. Prior to leaving all subjects will be reminded by the research assistant to&#xD;
      retrain from any musculoskeletal treatments or use of any medications not previously&#xD;
      prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two rcSMT Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A rcSMT will be performed contacting the C5-C6 segment. The subject's head will be supported&#xD;
      by the clinician's forearm. The contact hand of the clinician will contact the C5-C6 spinal&#xD;
      segment. A thrust maneuver will then be given by the contact hand of the clinician to the&#xD;
      C5-C6 segment with the supportive hand resting on the zygoma of the subject. A rotational&#xD;
      inferior drop thrust maneuver will be completed19. Immediately after the first rcSMT the&#xD;
      subject will turn over on the chiropractic table to lie in the prone position for a&#xD;
      post-rcSMT PPT measurement with the same algometer performed by the research assistant. This&#xD;
      post-rcSMT PPT measurement will be taken at 5-minute intervals after the first rcSMT. Once&#xD;
      the PPT measurement is taken the subject will be asked to rest quietly in the supine position&#xD;
      with the head resting on the drop headpiece. A second rcSMT will be performed at 30 minutes&#xD;
      after the first rcSMT. The same invention protocol will be repeated. Successive rcSMT will be&#xD;
      30 minutes part based on the results from Ross et al. showing that a second cavitation of the&#xD;
      same joint cannot occur before 20 minutes. Thus, 30 minutes will be used so that another&#xD;
      cavitation of the C5-C6 segment is possible with a 10-minute buffer to account for any&#xD;
      possible technical difficulties. The subject will turn over to the prone position for repeat&#xD;
      PPT measurements at 5-minute intervals post-rcSMT for 30 mins. Once the PPT measurements are&#xD;
      taken the subject will be free to leave and will be compensated. Once the subject has left&#xD;
      the treatment area the clinician will mark on the treatment card whether the rcSMT was&#xD;
      performed with or without cavitation for quality control purposes and place the treatment&#xD;
      card back in its specified numbered envelope and drop it in a drop box that will be place in&#xD;
      the treatment area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One scSMT + One rcSMT Group A scSMT will be performed with the contact hand of the clinician&#xD;
      resting lightly on the paraspinal area of the neck of the subject. The subject's head will be&#xD;
      rotated to 45 degrees and will be supported by the clinician's forearm, which will lie on top&#xD;
      if the headpiece. A thrust maneuver will then be given by the contact hand of the treating&#xD;
      clinician to the drop piece with the hand beside the paraspinal musculature simulating a real&#xD;
      thrust, the supportive hand will be resting on the zygoma of the subject. A inferior drop&#xD;
      thrust will be applied to the drop piece (no thrust is made by the contact hand on the&#xD;
      cervical spine) (Figure 3 and 4)19. Immediately after the first scSMT maneuver the subject&#xD;
      will turn over on the chiropractic table to lie in the prone position for a post-scSMT PPT&#xD;
      measurement with the same algometer performed by the research assistant. This post-scSMT PPT&#xD;
      measurement will be taken at 5-minute intervals for 30 minutes after the first scSMT. A rcSMT&#xD;
      will be performed 30 minutes after the first scSMT. The subject will turn over to the prone&#xD;
      position for repeat PPT measurements in 5-minute intervals for 30 minutes post-rcSMT. Once&#xD;
      the PPT measurement is taken the subject will be free to leave the treatment area. Once the&#xD;
      subject has left the treatment area the clinician will mark on the treatment card weather the&#xD;
      scSMT was performed adequately without cavitation and whether a cavitation occurred with the&#xD;
      rcSMT or not and place the treatment card back in its specified numbered envelope and drop it&#xD;
      in a drop box that will be place in the treatment area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2 All subjects regardless of the group will be required to attend a 48-hour&#xD;
      follow-up after the intervention. The purpose of the follow-up will be to determine the how&#xD;
      long the effect of the cSMT will last on PPT measurements taken on the infraspinatus MTrP.&#xD;
      Subjects will be called for a follow-up reminder by the research assistant 1 day prior to&#xD;
      follow-up to increase compliance. Subjects will present to the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic&#xD;
      College and will be greeted by the same research assistant (See Specific Aim #1 methods). The&#xD;
      permanent black mark will be identified for proper infraspinatus MTrP PPT measurement. A&#xD;
      permanent black will be used to ensure same MTrP will be measured to set the same scene as 48&#xD;
      hours prior to follow-up. The research assistant will then take one PPT measurement with a&#xD;
      handheld algometer on the same MTrP. The subjects will be asked to change back into clothing&#xD;
      and provided with compensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding and Minimization of Bias This study will be a single-blinded RCT in that the&#xD;
      subjects, statistician providing the randomization scheme, and the research assistant&#xD;
      performing the physical examination will all be blinded. The experienced clinician providing&#xD;
      the rcSMT or scSMT procedure will not be blinded. The experienced clinician will have to know&#xD;
      which group the subject is in to be able to perform the proper intervention (two rcSMT or one&#xD;
      scSMT and one rcSMT). The bias in administering the SMT intervention in this study will be&#xD;
      minimized by employing a validated sham procedure created by Vernon et al. in 2005. The&#xD;
      subject treatment expected bias will be accounted for by recording patient perceptions of the&#xD;
      treatment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance and Co-intervention For the primary specific aim of this study compliance will not&#xD;
      be a problem due to the limited time needed for the experiment. Compliance for the secondary&#xD;
      aim where a 2-day follow-up is required for data collection may be more challenging. However,&#xD;
      the follow-up will be very short consisting of one PPT measurement with a hand held&#xD;
      algometer. Thus, the time requirement will be approximately 10 minutes in length. Further,&#xD;
      subjects involved in the experiment will be students and faculty at the Canadian Memorial&#xD;
      Chiropractic College the same institution that data collection will occur making the&#xD;
      follow-up more convenient for subjects. Compliance will be increased by a phone call made by&#xD;
      the research assistant to the subject one day prior to follow-up for a friendly reminder.&#xD;
      Also, a gift card will be given out upon study completion to increase subject compliance.&#xD;
      Co-intervention will be avoided by employing the specified eligibility criteria.&#xD;
      Co-intervention will be avoided due to the short time span of the experimental maneuver.&#xD;
      Study participates cannot have had any SMT in the pervious month. This washout period of&#xD;
      treatment is needed to avoid co-intervention. Subjects will be instructed not to have any&#xD;
      manual treatment between the experiment and the 48-hour follow-up to avoid co-intervention.&#xD;
      If treatment of the cervical spine occurs data analysis will be modified to account for this.&#xD;
      Documentation if treatment occurred between intervention and follow-up will be used to see if&#xD;
      there is a significant outcome from non-compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis A 2F repeated measures ANOVA will be performed using STATA version 11 software&#xD;
      (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas, USA). The within groups analysis will look at time&#xD;
      points and the between groups analysis will look at group differences. A Post Hoc analysis&#xD;
      will be performed. All raw PPT measures will be normalized to baseline to account for subject&#xD;
      variability. A statistician will be conducting the data analysis with the STATA software.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used for the secondary aim of this study.&#xD;
