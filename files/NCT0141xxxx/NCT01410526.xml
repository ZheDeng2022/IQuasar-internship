      1.0 INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe abdominal sepsis is defined as sepsis plus organ dysfunction caused by a condition&#xD;
      deriving from the peritoneal cavity [1]. The essentials of the management of patients with&#xD;
      severe sepsis remain unchanged and can be divided broadly into sepsis control, antimicrobial&#xD;
      therapy and hemodynamic stabilization [2]. Infection control mainly involves surgical&#xD;
      exploration and temporary or permanent resolution of the septic agent [3]. Open abdomen&#xD;
      treatment remains one of the most valid approaches of patients with severe abdominal sepsis&#xD;
      [4]. Open abdomen management is mandated to avoid abdominal compartment syndrome, in cases&#xD;
      with inability to re-approximate the abdominal fascia regardless to viscera oedema and&#xD;
      intra-abdominal pressure and in cases with unclear or inadequate source control [5]. Topical&#xD;
      negative pressure with the abdominal vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) device has been&#xD;
      introduced, providing a new option to manage an open abdomen [6-8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytokines are a group of proteins produced by a variety of cells playing an active role in&#xD;
      the immune system. Sepsis syndrome seems to result from overwhelming systemic inflammation&#xD;
      which is caused by excessive release of cytokines into systemic circulation [9]. During the&#xD;
      last decade many clinical studies assess the cytokines concentration in serum plasma in&#xD;
      patients with SIRS and sepsis [10-13]. Despite the board study and analysis of cytokines&#xD;
      response in serum plasma, literature is poor about peritoneum immune response in&#xD;
      intra-abdominal sepsis [14-15], whereas the majority of these studies concerned patients with&#xD;
      elective surgery [16-18].&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is designed to assess the cytokines levels in the peritoneal cavity in severe&#xD;
      intra-abdominal sepsis and to compare these levels with the corresponding values in serum&#xD;
      plasma. Additionally, the cytokines values in serum plasma and peritoneum are compared&#xD;
      between patients with and without sepsis that underwent major elective laparotomy (middle&#xD;
      line incision &gt;15cm). Moreover, cytokines levels are correlated to morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 STUDY PROTOCOL In all patients that the origin of sepsis confirmed pre-operative as&#xD;
      abdominal, laparotomy will be required. After incision and confirmation of intra-abdominal&#xD;
      sepsis, involving the whole peritoneal cavity, peritoneal fluid will be sampled for&#xD;
      microbiology culture and cytokines assessment. The appropriate source control interventions&#xD;
      will be made and peritoneal lavage will be performed using sterile isotonic sodium chloride&#xD;
      solution. At the end of operation a decision for open abdomen will be made by the surgeon,&#xD;
      based on the severity of sepsis. If laparostomy will be decided, temporary abdominal closure&#xD;
      will be performed with the Vacuum Assisted Closure (VAC) system plus the dynamic sutures&#xD;
      [19].&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a two-day application of the VAC, the previous existing dressing will be removed.&#xD;
      Peritoneal fluid samples and blood samples will be obtained for cytokines assessment. The&#xD;
      abdominal cavity will carefully be rinsed with saline solution and the various abdominal&#xD;
      spaces will be inspected for any collections. Additionally, peritoneal fluid sample will be&#xD;
      obtained for culture and quantitive analysis. Sequentially, the VAC dressing application will&#xD;
      be performed based on previously described protocol [19]. Patients will return to the&#xD;
      operating room for sequential fascial closure and replacement of the sponge and sutures every&#xD;
      2 days until the final open abdomen closure. Peritoneal fluid and blood serum samples will be&#xD;
      obtained in every VAC change until the permanent abdominal closure or patient's decease. A&#xD;
      piece of polyurethane sponge of VAC system will be sent to microbiology department for&#xD;
      detection of biofilm formation.&#xD;
&#xD;

      5.5 Blood and peritoneal fluid sampling protocol Blood sample will draw from an indwelling&#xD;
      arterial line (10ml) in every VAC dressing change. Aspiration of 5 ml of peritoneal fluid&#xD;
      from the Douglas space will be carried out with a syringe prior the lavage. Blood samples&#xD;
      allow clotting in glass tubes in room temperature. Peritoneal sample collect in glass tubes.&#xD;
      Both blood and peritoneal samples will be centrifuged and the resulting serum will be stored&#xD;
      at -70o until processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.6 Bacteriological sampling and cultures At initial explorative laparotomy an aspiration of&#xD;
      5 ml of fluid from the Douglas space will be carried out with a syringe. The sample will be&#xD;
      emptied into a rubber membrane-sealed sterile glass tube and will be transported immediately&#xD;
      to the laboratory, where it will be directly processed. The same process will be repeated at&#xD;
      each change of dressings. Moreover, in every VAC dressing change a piece of the polyurethane&#xD;
      sponge will be sent in the microbiology department for detection of biofilm formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.7 Antimicrobic prophylactic regime According to the Greek national guidelines for the&#xD;
      antimicrobic therapy, a second generation cephalosporin (750 mg) combined with metronidazole&#xD;
      (500 mg) will be empirically used against community acquired peritonitis, 30 minutes prior to&#xD;
      induction of anaesthesia. Against postoperative peritonitis, piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g)&#xD;
      will be employed. The antibiotic schema will be later adjusted according to the peritoneal&#xD;
      fluid culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.8 Control group Thirty patients without sepsis scheduled for major elective surgery will&#xD;
      constitute the control group. Blood sample and peritoneal fluid sample will be obtained at&#xD;
      the end of operation before abdominal closure. Subsequently, blood samples will be obtained&#xD;
      at first and third postoperative day for serum plasma cytokines assessment.&#xD;

&#xD;
      7.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The objective of this study is: a) to assess the peritoneal immune&#xD;
      response in patients with severe intra-abdominal sepsis, b) to compare the serum plasma&#xD;
      cytokines values in patients with severe intra-abdominal sepsis with the corresponding values&#xD;
      in the peritoneal fluid and c) to compare the cytokines values in serum plasma and peritoneal&#xD;
      fluid between patients with severe intra-abdominal sepsis and patients without sepsis&#xD;
      underwent major elective laparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis included description of these pre-operative intraoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative outcomes, and indication of patient characteristics associated with these&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to efficiently compare the results in patients with severe intra-abdominal sepsis, a&#xD;
      control group without sepsis underwent major abdominal surgery was employed (Group A=sepsis&#xD;
      and Group B=elective surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the study does not have pre-specified hypotheses all statistical analyses are&#xD;
      exploratory and interpretation of results should be within this context.&#xD;

      appropriate population of patients to this study and will be approved by the local IRB.&#xD;
      Screening for these criteria will be conducted by the coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients or the closest relatives will be educated about the research proposal by a&#xD;
      study investigator. To determine whether the patient or the relatives has understood the&#xD;
      issues, he/she will be asked to describe what the research entails and whether they have any&#xD;
      questions. All questions will be addressed prior to enrolment. The patient or his legal&#xD;
      representative can refuse participation in the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A written informed consent form will be generated. For each patient, a case report form (CRF)&#xD;
      will be completed, providing general medical information and history.&#xD;
