  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to consolidate the cross-protection offered by influenza&#xD;
      vaccines against circulating influenza A or B viruses that are not antigenically well-matched&#xD;
      to vaccine strains and to determine the degree of cross-protection separately for influenza A&#xD;
      and influenza B, through a systematic review of the literature.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research question of this project is: &quot;what is the cross-protection afforded by&#xD;
      vaccination (using an LAIV, TIV, or other type of vaccine) against influenza A or B and their&#xD;
      subtypes and lineages?&quot; The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and&#xD;
      Meta-analyses (PRISMA) Statement will be used to guide the reporting of this review. Studies&#xD;
      reporting cross-protection data after vaccination with approved formulations of influenza&#xD;
      vaccines with influenza A or B will be included. Inclusion will not be limited by publication&#xD;
      status, or year of dissemination but will be limited to randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and&#xD;
      quasi-RCTs comparing influenza vaccine(s) with placebo. Only RCTs written in English will be&#xD;
      included. A meta-analysis will be conducted if there is sufficient data.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy children, adults or the elderly will be included that participated in&#xD;
             randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing influenza vaccine(s) with&#xD;
             placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials (RCTs) reporting laboratory-confirmed&#xD;
             influenza among healthy participants vaccinated with antigens of influenza strains&#xD;
             that differed from those circulating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All influenza vaccines will be included, and will be categorized as TIV, LAIV, and&#xD;
             others (that is, non-TIV or non-LAIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only RCTs written in English will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  RCTs which are not providing any data will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Studies using rapid influenza diagnostic tests will not be included, as their&#xD;
             sensitivity is low (especially during flu season) and false positives are common&#xD;
             during low activity seasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory-confirmed influenza through antibody assay as part of the primary outcome&#xD;
             will not be included, as this is a less sensitive test than PCR and viral culture.&#xD;
