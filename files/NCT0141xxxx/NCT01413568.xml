      Determine the safety and tolerability of POL6326 when used as a single mobilization agent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current protocols use G-CSF to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells from matched sibling&#xD;
      donors. This process requires from four to six days of G-CSF injection and is associated with&#xD;
      significant morbidity, most notably bone pain. POL6326 is associated with few side effects&#xD;
      and collection of cells occurs on the same day as POL6326 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of this novel agent for hematopoietic&#xD;
      progenitor cell mobilization and allogeneic transplantation based on the following&#xD;
      hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Donors mobilized with intravenous POL6326 will require fewer collections than have&#xD;
           previously been seen for donors mobilized with subcutaneous plerixafor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Healthy HLA-matched donors receiving one or two infusions of POL6326 will mobilize&#xD;
           sufficient CD34+ cells (at least 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg recipient weights) following&#xD;
           leukapheresis to support a hematopoietic cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. IV POL6326 will result in more rapid kinetics and a higher maximum (peak) of human CD34+&#xD;
           stem cells mobilized from human normal allogeneic donors compared to previous donors who&#xD;
           were mobilized with plerixafor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The hematopoietic cells mobilized by IV POL6326 will be functional and will result in&#xD;
           prompt and durable hematopoietic engraftment following transplantation into&#xD;
           HLA-identical siblings with advanced hematological malignancies using various&#xD;
           non-myeloablative and myeloablative conditioning regimens and regimens for routine GVHD&#xD;
           prophylaxis.&#xD;
