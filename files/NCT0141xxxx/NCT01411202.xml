    <textblock>
      Patients with cancer may experience problems with their breathing due to a fluid accumulation&#xD;
      around their lungs called malignant pleural effusion (MPE). This fluid can be drained but&#xD;
      draining may not stop the fluid from accumulating again. MPE can cause shortness of breath&#xD;
      during activity and at rest leaving patients feeling as though they cannot catch their breath&#xD;
      enough to be comfortable. Other symptoms can include pain, cough and weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One way to stop the fluid from accumulating is to create scar tissue between the lung and&#xD;
      chest wall so there is no more room for fluid accumulation. This procedure is called&#xD;
      pleurodesis. Pleurodesis is the standard of care at most centres across Canada. This&#xD;
      procedure is done by injecting a drug into the space between the lung and chest wall through&#xD;
      a catheter, Doxycycline is one of the drugs currently used for this purpose. Traditionally,&#xD;
      patients are admitted for pleurodesis, mostly because the size of the catheter used to inject&#xD;
      the medication is very large but also because of the potential complications that can happen&#xD;
      with these larger chest tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At our centre, most patients with MPE are managed at home with a smaller sized catheter known&#xD;
      as a Pleurx catheter. The Pleurx catheter allows patients to remain at home for treatment and&#xD;
      trained staff come into the home to both drain the MPE and monitor the patient. Sometimes,&#xD;
      patients experience pleurodesis through use of the Pleurx catheter alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pleurodesis with doxycycline can happen faster than with the Pleurx catheter alone. It has&#xD;
      been our experience with a limited number of patients that it is safe to perform pleurodesis&#xD;
      using the Pleurx catheter for doxycycline injection in an outpatient setting.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Malignant pleural effusions (MPE) occur in 25 - 50% of malignancies, represent advanced&#xD;
      disease and carry with it significant morbidity. It is estimated that 75% of malignant&#xD;
      effusions are symptomatic at the time of presentation, with dyspnea being the most common&#xD;
      complaint. Cough, weight loss and chest pain may also be presenting symptoms. The diagnosis&#xD;
      of MPE often carries with it a poor prognosis with an average survival of 3-9 months. Thus,&#xD;
      management of MPE is generally palliative, aimed at alleviating the associated symptoms,&#xD;
      while incurring minimal discomfort and disruption of patients activities of daily living.&#xD;
      Limiting the number of days spent hospitalized ia also a consideration. Currently, the most&#xD;
      common treatment for MPE involves tube thoracostomy and pleurodesis using a sclerosing agent.&#xD;
      Use of Doxycycline as a sclerosing agent has been shown to be both safe and efficacious with&#xD;
      only minor complications. Traditionally, pleurodesis with Doxycycline has been performed in&#xD;
      the inpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pleurx catheter (Cardinal Biomedical) is the only small bore catheter commercially&#xD;
      available that has been specifically designed for long term indwelling drainage of MPE. In&#xD;
      order to reduce the chance of dislodgement and minimize infection rates, it is tunnelled&#xD;
      under the skin for approximately 5 cm before entering the pleural space. These indwelling&#xD;
      catheters can provide excellent symptom control and have also been associated with&#xD;
      spontaneous pleurodesis rates comparable to many chemical pleurodesis rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pleurx has been compared to inpatient doxycycline pleurodesis via chest tube with no&#xD;
      difference in survival, safety or efficacy noted. However, hospital stay was significantly&#xD;
      shorter in the Pleurx group, 1 day versus 6.5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of outpatient pleurodesis, using&#xD;
      doxycycline administered via Pleurx catheter. This will be a randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      comparing the time to pleurodesis in patients with malignant pleural effusion receiving&#xD;
      doxycycline + Pleurx catheter versus Pleurx catheter alone.&#xD;
