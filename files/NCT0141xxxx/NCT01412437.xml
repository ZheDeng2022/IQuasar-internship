  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will use different types of brain imaging (MRI) in patients with&#xD;
      Phenylketonuria (PKU) who are currently not on a strict diet to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      there is improvement in brain circuitry and biochemistry after return to diet and/or&#xD;
      sapropterin dihydrochloride (Kuvan).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We plan to enroll 36 subjects with PKU. They will all be counseled to follow the PKU diet.&#xD;
      They will be randomized to receive Kuvan. We will plan to enroll 12 in the diet alone group&#xD;
      and 24 in the Kuvan group with the hope of 12 being responders (as defined by a 30% drop in&#xD;
      blood phe levels). Those who do not have a blood response with decreased Phe will still be&#xD;
      evaluated for a neurological response as measured by neurocognitive testing and neuroimaging&#xD;
      as outlined in this protocol. All 24 in the Kuvan group will receive a 1 month trial of Kuvan&#xD;
      and then the responders will have their insurance cover the drug and for the non responders&#xD;
      Biomarin will supply Kuvan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that stable patients with PKU who are not currently on diet&#xD;
      have specific brain biomarkers quantifiable by DTI, fMRI and MRS and that the levels of these&#xD;
      biomarkers correlate with the clinical severity and outcome. Our pilot study and the research&#xD;
      of others have suggested the following as potential biomarkers for neural injury in PKU:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metabolic abnormalities: elevated Phe concentrations as measured by MRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  White matter microstructure: measured by apparent diffusion coefficient, (ADC), using&#xD;
           DTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Working memory and attention/executive function: measured by fMRI, Near infrared&#xD;
           spectroscopy (NIRS) and neuropsychological testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will study these potential biomarkers in a group of well characterized adults with PKU who&#xD;
      are not currently on diet or a strict diet as evidenced by elevated Phe, but who were&#xD;
      identified by the newborn screen and may have been on diet during childhood, with varying&#xD;
      severity of clinical involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To measure changes in biomarkers validated in Aim 1 after return to diet +/- Kuvan&#xD;
      (sapropterin dihydrochloride; Kuvan)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our preliminary data and that of others, Aim 1 should provide us with a number of&#xD;
      candidate biomarkers for brain injury in PKU. We expect that these will include three types&#xD;
      of markers that can be correlated: metabolic, structural and cognitive. We will use these&#xD;
      biomarkers to study subjects during return to diet and/or initiation of Kuvan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To compare cognitive performance in our subjects prior to and after return to diet +/-&#xD;
      Kuvan. using the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive Trail making test (CTMT) -Parts A and B Stroop WASI (IQ, digit span) BRIEF&#xD;
      Edinburgh Handedness Inventory Hand Preference Demonstration Test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome variables The primary endpoints in this study are 1) an estimate of the white matter&#xD;
      damage (macroscopic and microscopic) in participants with PKU versus controls at baseline and&#xD;
      after return to diet +/- Kuvan; 2) determination of a profile of brain biochemical&#xD;
      abnormalities in participants with PKU versus controls at baseline and after return to&#xD;
      diet/Kuvan, 3) assessment of cognitive and motor systems abnormalities (by fMRI and cognitive&#xD;
      testing) in the participant cohort as compared to age matched typically developing non&#xD;
      disease controls at baseline and after return to diet/Kuvan; 4) coefficient of variability of&#xD;
      scoring on traditional neurocognitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the conclusion of this study, future areas of research would include expansion to study&#xD;
      long term effects of Kuvan, study of more impaired populations and response to Kuvan, and&#xD;
      using optical imaging methods we are currently piloting in OTCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method to investigate biomarkers of disease We plan to use 1HMRS to identify markers of&#xD;
      disease severity such as elevations of Phe and decreases in NAA. This will be compared in&#xD;
      participants and normal age matched controls. Additionally, diffusion tensor imaging will&#xD;
      allow us to probe white matter fiber tracts that may be especially vulnerable in this&#xD;
      disorder selectively. Lastly, fMRI may identify regions of differential activation in the&#xD;
      brain that are different in participants versus age matched controls at rest and with a&#xD;
      cognitive task probing working memory and attention.&#xD;
