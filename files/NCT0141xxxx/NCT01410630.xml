  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A research study of a new method of visualizing internal organs called 18F-FLT PET/CT that&#xD;
      yields better tracking of cancer treatment progress. PET/CT stands for positron emission&#xD;
      tomography with low dose computed tomography and has been used for many years. 18F-FLT PET/CT&#xD;
      uses a new tracer, fluorothymidine, which is taken up by cells that are actively&#xD;
      proliferating or dividing such as cancer cells. We hope to learn whether this tracer is&#xD;
      superior to the conventional tracer for monitoring treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma&#xD;
      (DLBCL).&#xD;

      -Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigate whether the PPV of FLT-PET/CT is significantly higher than that of FDG-PET/CT by&#xD;
      following up patients for at least 24 months post-therapy or until evidence of persistent&#xD;
      disease/disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigate whether the event free survival (EFS) of patients with FDG-PET/CT-positive and&#xD;
      FLT-PET/CT negative scans is not significantly lower than that of patients with concordantly&#xD;
      negative FDG-PET/CT and FLT-PET/CT scans and that the NPV or FLT-PET/CT is similar to that of&#xD;
      FDG-PET/CT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlate interim FLT-PET/CT and FDG-PET/CT with the International Prognostic Index (IPI), a&#xD;
      well-established predictor of outcome in DLBCL, to determine their independent prognostic&#xD;
      value from the IPI&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have a histologic or cytological diagnosis of de novo DLBCL and be&#xD;
             scheduled to receive first line chemotherapy with R-CHOP given every 21 days&#xD;
             (R-CHOP-21) within 6 weeks of their enrollment and for 6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be &gt;=18 years of age, but there will be no discrimination based on&#xD;
             gender, race, creed, or ethnic background.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must sign an informed consent, and be mentally responsible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with significant concurrent medical complications that in the judgment of the&#xD;
             Principal Investigator(s) could affect the patient's ability to complete the planned&#xD;
             trial, including the multiple imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of prior lymphoma (e.g., follicular lymphoma) and/or second&#xD;
             cancers other than basal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients planned to be treated with R-CHOP-14 (i.e., R-CHOP given every 14 days) will&#xD;
             be excluded (this should be extremely rare, if at all, since R-CHOP-21 is the standard&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are scheduled to receive Rituxan or any other therapy (e.g., XRT,&#xD;
             radioimmunotherapy) as adjuvant therapy after completion of R-CHOP-21.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) after study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation. The effects of FLT on the developing human fetus&#xD;
             are unknown. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. A&#xD;
             screening urine human chorionic gonadtropin (hCG) (pregnancy test) will be&#xD;
             administered in Nuclear Medicine to women of childbearing potential before each FLT&#xD;
             scan and pregnant women will be stopped from participating further in this study.&#xD;
