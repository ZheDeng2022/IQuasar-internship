  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of roxadustat in the correction&#xD;
      of anemia in participants with end-stage renal disease who recently started dialysis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants on hemodialysis (HD) will be randomized to 3 treatment arms (A, B, and C) of in&#xD;
      a 1:1:1 ratio to receive no iron supplementation, oral iron supplementation, and IV iron&#xD;
      supplementation, respectively, in addition to roxadustat. At the same time, participants on&#xD;
      peritoneal dialysis (PD) will be enrolled into Arm D. Arm E will enroll either HD or PD&#xD;
      participants, and is an optional, confirmatory/supplemental treatment arm with flexible&#xD;
      dosing and flexible iron supplementation based on the evaluation of data from the previous 4&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial roxadustat dose will be based on a tiered, weight-based dosing scheme (low weight [40&#xD;
      to 60 kilograms {kg}], medium weight [&gt;60 to 90 kg], and heavy weight [&gt;90 to 140 kg]&#xD;
      participants will receive 60, 100, and 140 milligrams [mg] roxadustat, respectively). Dose&#xD;
      adjustments will be implemented (up to a maximum roxadustat dose of 140, 200, and 300 mg for&#xD;
      low, medium, and high weight participants, respectively) during Weeks 5 and 9, depending on&#xD;
      the hemoglobin (Hb) level and rate of Hb rise in the previous 4 weeks.&#xD;

TEAEs were defined as any event that either began or worsened after the first administration of study drug and within 28 days of the last dose. A summary of other nonserious AEs and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in Reported AE section.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Participants on hemodialysis (HD) were randomized to one of the 3 arms A, B, or C in 1:1:1 ratio to receive roxadustat with either no, per oral (PO), or intravenous (IV) iron supplementation, respectively. Participants on peritoneal dialysis (PD) were enrolled into Arm D and received roxadustat with PO iron supplementation.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Arm E was an optional, confirmatory/supplemental arm with flexible dosing and flexible iron supplementation based on the evaluation of data from the previous 4 arms. After enrollment of Arms A through C was completed, Arm E was decided to be identical to Arm A, for example, roxadustat with no iron supplementation and with the same tiered weight-based initial dosing. Hence, the data of Arms A and E were reported in a single arm.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The SF-36 V2 consists of 36 questions covering 8 health domains: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical problems, role limitations due to emotional problems, general health perceptions, mental health, social function, and vitality. The physical functioning subscore and vitality subscore are reported. The scores ranged from 0 (worst) to 100 (Best). Higher score indicated a better health state. Baseline is defined as the last non-missing value prior to the first dose administration.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 9 and 13</time_frame>
        <population>EE population included participants who received study treatment for 6 weeks or longer and had valid corresponding Hb measurements. LOCF method was used to impute missing values.</population>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Short Form 36 (SF-36) Version 2 Physical Functioning Subscore and Vitality Subscore at Weeks 9 and 13</title>
          <description>The SF-36 V2 consists of 36 questions covering 8 health domains: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical problems, role limitations due to emotional problems, general health perceptions, mental health, social function, and vitality. The physical functioning subscore and vitality subscore are reported. The scores ranged from 0 (worst) to 100 (Best). Higher score indicated a better health state. Baseline is defined as the last non-missing value prior to the first dose administration.</description>
          <population>EE population included participants who received study treatment for 6 weeks or longer and had valid corresponding Hb measurements. LOCF method was used to impute missing values.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) Total Score at Weeks 9 and 13</title>
        <description>FACT-An is composed of 27 core items which assess participant's function in 4 domains and 20 anemia-related items, grouped into 5 subscales as follows: Physical well-being (PWB): 7 items; Social/family well-being (SWB): 7 items; Emotional well-being (EWB): 6 items; Functional well-being (FWB): 7 items; and Anemia: 20 items. All FACT-An items were rated as: 0=not at all; 1=a little bit; 2=somewhat; 3=quite a bit; 4=very much. Each subscale score was the sum of scores for the items in the subscale. The FACT-An total score was the sum of all 5 subscale scores, ranging from 0 (worst) - 188 (best). Higher scores represented better quality of life. Baseline is defined as the last non-missing value prior to the first dose administration.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical event in a participant who received study drug whether or not the event is considered drug related. TEAEs were defined as any event that either began or worsened after the first administration of study drug and within 28 days of the last dose. A summary of other nonserious AEs and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in Reported AE section.</description>
