      The purpose of the study is to assess potential age-related differences on coagulation&#xD;
      profile of patients undergoing Cesarean Section, using thromboelastography (TEG). The&#xD;
      investigators will compare coagulation data collected from the study to assess potential&#xD;
      differences in coagulation parameters for the following age groups: (i) women less than 35&#xD;
      yrs (ii) women 35 yrs or older.&#xD;

      The purpose of the study is to assess potential age-related differences on coagulation&#xD;
      profile of patients undergoing Cesarean Section, using thromboelastography (TEG). The&#xD;
      investigators will compare coagulation data collected from the study to assess potential&#xD;
      differences in coagulation parameters for the following age groups: (i) women less than 35&#xD;
      yrs (ii) women 35 yrs or older. This study will allow us to collect more information about&#xD;
      differences regarding coagulation profile in patients undergoing cesarean section who are&#xD;
      less than 35 y vs. 35y or older. This information will add to current knowledge base about&#xD;
      potential risk for thrombotic events according with age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All obstetric patients presenting for elective Cesarean delivery (CD) will be informed about&#xD;
      the study prior to and on admission to the labor and delivery unit. Patients will be informed&#xD;
      at parents' education classes (during education sessions by obstetric anesthesiologists who&#xD;
      are also members of the research team). Potential participants will be approached by a member&#xD;
      of the research team prior to surgery. A study investigator will obtain patient written&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operatively, blood sampling will take place by venepuncture for the following analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematocrit, Platelet count (which are part of standard of care), TEG, prothrombin time (PT),&#xD;
      Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT), International Normalized Ratio (INR), fibrinogen (for&#xD;
      research purposes only, unless they are needed for clinical purposes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would prefer to avoid taking blood samples from indwelling peripheral IV&#xD;
      lines, as the samples will likely be diluted with intravenous fluid and therefore may&#xD;
      significantly affect blood sampling analysis. The volumes of blood necessary for TEG analysis&#xD;
      are extremely small (1 ml - less than half of a teaspoon - per TEG analysis; total =3&#xD;
      samples), and therefore will not significantly affect any potential degree of hemorrhage or&#xD;
      total blood loss incurred. The volumes of blood for laboratory analysis will also be small&#xD;
      (4-5 ml - about 1 teaspoon - for each research sample: total =3 samples), and will not affect&#xD;
      overall blood loss. No randomization will be possible. TEG and laboratory samples will be&#xD;
      taken at the following time intervals: prior to anesthesia in the preoperative holding unit,&#xD;
      post-operative days one and three.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be assessed for normality using normality plots and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.&#xD;
      Normally and non-normally distributed TEG parameters before and after CD (PACU samples) will&#xD;
      be assessed by using the paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test respectively. The&#xD;
      percentage change from baseline for each TEG parameter and Hb before and after CD will also&#xD;
      be calculated. Longitudinal analysis of individual changes for each TEG parameter will be&#xD;
      performed using mixed effects regression modeling, due to the non-uniformity of&#xD;
      time-intervals and to account for correlation among repeated measurements on the same&#xD;
      participants. The investigators will examine longitudinal models for individual TEG&#xD;
      parameters as a dependent measure, with study group as a fixed factor, and number of previous&#xD;
      cesarean section, total blood loss, IV fluids, platelet count and fibrinogen counts as&#xD;
      potential covariates (tbc). Separate models will incorporate age as continuous independent&#xD;
      variable (as both a fixed and random effect). The investigators will analyze these data using&#xD;
      SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C., USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study data will be stored in secured, locked storage boxes which will only be accessed by&#xD;
      study investigators. Samples and labels will be identified using a numerical system based&#xD;
      allocated prior to the start of the study. Only investigators directly involved in the study&#xD;
      will have access to the study data and other related documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study data will be protected as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hard data will be stored in secure box-files kept in locked file cabinets; databases with&#xD;
      study data will be password-protected. Study information will be coded in advance using a&#xD;
      numerical coding system not linked to the patients' medical record number or other PHI.&#xD;
      Coding will be performed when data is entered into the database. Only study investigators&#xD;
      will have access to the coding system for de-identifying data. All codes used to protect&#xD;
      study data and confidential information will be used solely by study investigators. All codes&#xD;
      used for data- protection will be known only to the study investigators, and&#xD;
      software-protection and encryption programs will be used as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEG will be performed by study investigators on the labor and delivery unit. Blood samples&#xD;
      will be destroyed after TEG analysis. Other laboratory samples will be analyzed as per normal&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic data will be stored at the Stanford File Management Tool. Only researchers and&#xD;
      research staff will be granted password-protected access to identifiable and coded data&#xD;
      stored on this server.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All persons involved in this study will receive appropriate training and abide by&#xD;
      confidentiality guidelines to protect the subject's privacy. All HIPAA rules and regulations&#xD;
      will be strictly followed.&#xD;
