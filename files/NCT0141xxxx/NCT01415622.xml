  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to prove the safety and efficacy of plasma as an add-on&#xD;
      treatment in combination with conventional treatment in cases of chronical venous Ulcus&#xD;
      cruris.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ulcus cruris consists of pathologically changed tissue of the lower leg. Up to 80% are of&#xD;
      venous origin. Because of the high prevalence of up to 2% the treatment of Ulcus cruris is of&#xD;
      special economical importance. Depending on the size, depth and possible infections, the&#xD;
      conventional treatment of these wounds consists of an adequate compression, preparation of&#xD;
      the lesion, cover and of appropriate control of infections. All tasks are undertaken in order&#xD;
      to faciliate the healing of these chronic wounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma consists of free ions or electrons and can be created by various techniques. Commonly,&#xD;
      it is use in the sterilization of medicinal equipment, the cauterization of tissue and in the&#xD;
      field of coagulation. Because of its bactericidal characteristics, the direct interaction of&#xD;
      plasma created by temperatures below 40°C on tissue is intensively studied. Both in vitro and&#xD;
      in vivo studies proved a significant reduction of bacterial contamination in different test&#xD;
      systems. As bacterial contamination might slow down wound healing, plasma treatment might be&#xD;
      a useful tool to complement conventional methods in the treatment of chronical wounds.&#xD;
