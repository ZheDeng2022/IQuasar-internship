      This phase II trial studies how well giving cyclophosphamide and anti-thymocyte globulin&#xD;
      together followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) and mycophenolate mofetil&#xD;
      works in treating patients with systemic scleroderma (SSc). Stem cells are collected from the&#xD;
      patient's blood and stored prior to treatment. To store the stem cells patients are given&#xD;
      colony-stimulating factors, such as filgrastim (G-CSF) or chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide) to&#xD;
      help stem cells move from the bone marrow to the blood so they can be collected and stored.&#xD;
      After storage, patients are then given high-dose chemotherapy, cyclophosphamide, and&#xD;
      immunosuppression with anti-thymocyte globulin to suppress the immune system to prepare for&#xD;
      the transplant. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming&#xD;
      cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy and immunosuppression. After the stem cells&#xD;
      have &quot;engrafted&quot; and have matured enough to support the immune system at approximately 2-3&#xD;
      months, patients are given a medication called mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or Myfortic. This&#xD;
      medication is given to prevent worsening or reactivation of SSc and is referred to as&#xD;
      maintenance therapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of high-dose immunosuppressive therapy&#xD;
      (HDIT) followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) (without cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation [CD]34-selection) and maintenance therapy with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in&#xD;
      systemic scleroderma (SSc) patients by evaluating the effects on event-free survival (EFS) at&#xD;
      5 years post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate safety of HDIT followed by autologous HCT as determined by regimen-related&#xD;
      toxicities, infectious complications, treatment-related mortality, overall total mortality,&#xD;
      and time to engraftment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate treatment effect on disease activation/progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQOL) using Short Form 36 (SF-36), the St.&#xD;
      George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), the modified scleroderma health assessment&#xD;
      questionnaire (SHAQ), and PROMIS version (v) 1.0 measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess work productivity (Work Productivity Survey) and health care utilization (using&#xD;
      University of California San-Diego [UCSD] healthcare utilization).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEM CELL MOBILIZATION AND PREPARATION: Patients receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on&#xD;
      mobilization days 1-4 followed by apheresis until a target dose of CD34+ cells &gt;= 2.5 x&#xD;
      10^6/kg are collected. Patients difficult to mobilize with filgrastim alone receive&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) or *plerixafor subcutaneously (SC) on mobilization days&#xD;
      1-2 and filgrastim SC on mobilization days 5-7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HDIT CONDITIONING: Patients receive high-dose cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days -5&#xD;
      to -2 and anti-thymocyte globulin IV on days -5, -3, -1, 1, 3, and 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo autologous PBSCT on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Beginning 2-3 months after transplant, patients receive mycophenolate&#xD;
      mofetil orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Plerixafor is an alternative to the cyclophosphamide based mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month, weeks 12 and 26, and&#xD;
      then annually for 5 years.&#xD;
