      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Many people who have had a traumatic brain injury have difficulty walking. Training on a&#xD;
      treadmill is often used to help people with walking difficulties. Supporting a person s body&#xD;
      weight with a harness while using the treadmill can help improve walking skills in people&#xD;
      with brain injury. Varying the rate at which people walk on the treadmill may also help more&#xD;
      than walking at a constant rate. Treadmill training with body weight support or walking at&#xD;
      different speeds may improve walking skills in people who have had a traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
      More research is needed to see if one method is better than the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To compare the effects of two types of treadmill training in people who have had a&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People at least 18 years of age who have had a mild or moderate traumatic brain injury at&#xD;
      least 6 months ago and have mild or moderate walking difficulty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will also&#xD;
           take a basic walking test (not on a treadmill).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be divided into two groups. The first group will have treadmill&#xD;
           training at a constant speed. The second group will have treadmill training at different&#xD;
           speeds. All participants will wear a support harness while walking on the treadmill.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first training visit, participants will have a gait assessment with different&#xD;
           tests of walking. Then they will have a treadmill walking session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the first visit, participants will return twice a week for 6 weeks for treadmill&#xD;
           training sessions (visits 3 through 12). They will also have grip strength and walking&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of 6 weeks, participants will have a final treadmill training session, and&#xD;
           will have a gait assessment exactly like the one in the first training visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 6 months after the final session, participants will have a followup visit with a&#xD;
           final gait assessment.&#xD;

      Objectives: To test the effectiveness of using time varying walking velocity in Body-Weight&#xD;
      Supported Treadmill Training (BWSTT) as compared to using constant velocity in subjects with&#xD;
      Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). We hypothesize that using time varying velocity will result in&#xD;
      a greater improvement in ambulatory function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: 30 adult subjects with a clinical diagnosis of non-penetrating TBI and with&#xD;
      functional deficits in gait will be enrolled. Subjects will be recruited from NIH, affiliated&#xD;
      hospitals/clinics, and in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This pilot study will use an instrumented treadmill (Bertec Co., Columbus, Ohio) and&#xD;
      a force controlled harness system called ZeroG (Aretech LLC, Ashburn, Virginia). Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to one of two groups (12 subjects per group): the first group will&#xD;
      receive BWSTT at a constant velocity (also known as standard treadmill training); and the&#xD;
      second group will receive BWSTT at randomized time varying velocity. BWSTT at time varying&#xD;
      velocity consists of two components: 1) subjects passively adjusting their walking speed to&#xD;
      the continuously changing speed of the treadmill; and 2) subjects actively changing their&#xD;
      walking speed by following the instructed walking speed displayed on a monitor screen while&#xD;
      the treadmill is automatically adjusted to the subjects speed. Each group will receive 8 gait&#xD;
      training sessions (30 minutes per session, twice per week) for four weeks. Gait performance&#xD;
      will be tested before (pre-test) and after (post-test) the 8 session gait training program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures are parameters representing gait performance:&#xD;
      maximum walking speed, self-selected walking speed, cadence, stride length, percentage of&#xD;
      swing, stance and double stance periods, gait symmetry, Time Up and Go (TUG), and Dynamic&#xD;
      Gait Index (DGI) scores. The secondary outcome measure is physical and cognitive effort&#xD;
      exerted during the training session as evaluated by grip-strength test and LNS (Letter-Number&#xD;
      Sequencing) test.&#xD;
