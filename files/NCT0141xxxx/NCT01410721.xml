  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to half of all military service members with combat-related traumatic brain injury (TBI)&#xD;
      also suffer from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). TBI and PTSD are each associated with&#xD;
      cognitive problems in what are called 'executive functions' such as planning actions,&#xD;
      inhibiting behavior, monitoring one's own thoughts and feelings, and solving problems&#xD;
      day-to-day. These types of impairments occur more often among veterans with both TBI and PTSD&#xD;
      than among those with only one of these conditions. The combination of TBI and PTSD in&#xD;
      veterans has also been linked to problems with anger and violence, which are common&#xD;
      complaints of veterans seeking mental health services post-deployment and have been shown to&#xD;
      predict poor treatment outcomes in Iraq and Afghanistan veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the relationship between combined TBI/PTSD diagnoses and post-deployment adjustment&#xD;
      problems has been demonstrated, there has been little research into clinical interventions&#xD;
      designed to reduce the severity of cognitive and affective symptoms in veterans with both TBI&#xD;
      and PTSD. Therefore, the investigators propose a randomized clinical trial involving a&#xD;
      cognitive rehabilitation intervention that targets improved executive functioning, with the&#xD;
      participation of N=100 veterans diagnosed with both TBI and PTSD (n=50 in experimental group&#xD;
      and n=50 comparison).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the study, all participants will receive an iPod touch. Participants will be&#xD;
      placed into one of the two study groups randomly. Based on which group participants are&#xD;
      placed in, they will receive one of two different sets of iPod touch apps and programs that&#xD;
      address and aim to improve different facets of cognitive functioning. Regardless of which&#xD;
      group, Veterans will be instructed to daily practice iPod touch applications on cognitive&#xD;
      functioning. Also, family members will be trained as &quot;mentors&quot; to reinforce use of the&#xD;
      applications in everyday living environments. Trained facilitators will also travel to&#xD;
      participants' homes to meet with veterans and family to observe behaviors in the home&#xD;
      environment, arrive at strategies for applying new skills in their situations, troubleshoot&#xD;
      any iPod technical problems, and review family mentoring processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will measure clinical outcomes using a comprehensive array of functional&#xD;
      and structural methods at baseline and six months. The investigators hypothesize improved&#xD;
      executive function among those in the experimental group as well as reduced&#xD;
      irritability/impulsivity and improved social/occupational functioning. The investigators&#xD;
      further hypothesize that, as a group, veterans participating in the cognitive rehabilitation&#xD;
      program will show significant changes in neural activity associated with executive functions&#xD;
      when comparing pre- and post-treatment EEG and fMRI responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Better understanding of the neural circuitry and neurocognitive function underlying executive&#xD;
      function and associated affective control deficits in veterans with both TBI and PTSD, and&#xD;
      how they relate to treatment outcome, will allow us to better identify therapeutic targets&#xD;
      for cognitive rehabilitation. The current proposal aims to explore the relationship between&#xD;
      brain function and connectivity in selective pathways/circuits, neuropsychological&#xD;
      functioning, and cognitive rehabilitation response in veterans with both TBI and PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study of the neurobiology and neuropsychology associated with intervention efficacy will&#xD;
      allow us to identify veterans with both TBI and PTSD who are predisposed to positive&#xD;
      treatment outcomes. To our knowledge, this will be the first attempt to integrate&#xD;
      neurobiological and neurocognitive techniques with information about the efficacy of a&#xD;
      theoretically and empirically driven cognitive rehabilitation intervention in veterans with&#xD;
      combined TBI/PTSD diagnoses. This research may suggest additional avenues for assessment of&#xD;
      clinical intervention efficacy and the identification of therapeutic targets (e.g. alteration&#xD;
      of function in fronto-limbic circuits) relevant to the military population. Given links&#xD;
      between TBI/PTSD, executive dysfunction, and anger, impulsivity, and aggression, efforts to&#xD;
      rehabilitate cognitive function will be particularly important to ensure that current and&#xD;
      future veterans adjust successfully when they return home to their families, workplaces, and&#xD;
      communities.&#xD;

      Background: It is estimated that up to half of all military service members with&#xD;
      combat-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) also meet criteria for Posttraumatic Stress&#xD;
      Disorder (PTSD). TBI and PTSD are both characterized by deficits in multiple cognitive&#xD;
      domains, including attention, executive function, and affective and cognitive control.&#xD;
      However, cognitive and affective sequelae associated with TBI are compounded by the presence&#xD;
      of PTSD symptoms in returning veterans. Specifically, it has been shown that significant&#xD;
      frontal lobe dysfunction, particularly disinhibition, occurs more often among veterans with&#xD;
      both TBI and PTSD than among veterans diagnosed with only one of these conditions. The&#xD;
      combination of TBI and PTSD in veterans has also been linked to problems with anger and&#xD;
      violence, which are common complaints of veterans seeking mental health services&#xD;
      post-deployment and have been shown to predict poor treatment outcomes in Iraq and&#xD;
      Afghanistan veterans. Executive dysfunction, especially difficulty with attentional&#xD;
      processing, is strongly related to hostility and aggressiveness in Iraq and Afghanistan&#xD;
      veterans; increasingly so in the presence of TBI and PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective/Hypothesis: Although the relationship between combined TBI/PTSD diagnoses and&#xD;
      post-deployment adjustment problems has been clearly demonstrated, there has been little&#xD;
      empirical research into clinical interventions designed to reduce the severity of cognitive&#xD;
      and affective symptoms in veterans with both TBI and PTSD. Therefore, the investigators&#xD;
      propose to conduct a randomized trial of theoretically based cognitive rehabilitation to&#xD;
      improve executive function and affective control among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans with&#xD;
      both TBI and PTSD, and to measure clinical outcomes using a comprehensive array of functional&#xD;
      and structural methods. The investigators hypothesize that improved executive function among&#xD;
      those in the experimental group as well as reduced irritability/impulsivity and improved&#xD;
      social/occupational functioning. The investigators further hypothesize that, as a group,&#xD;
      veterans participating in the cognitive rehabilitation program will show significant changes&#xD;
      in neural activity associated with executive functions when comparing pre- and post-treatment&#xD;
      EEG and fMRI responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: Better understanding of the neural circuitry and neurocognitive function&#xD;
      underlying executive function and associated affective control deficits in veterans with both&#xD;
      TBI and PTSD, and how they relate to treatment outcome, will allow us to better identify&#xD;
      therapeutic targets for cognitive rehabilitation. The current proposal aims to explore the&#xD;
      relationship between brain function and connectivity in selective pathways/circuits,&#xD;
      neuropsychological functioning, and cognitive rehabilitation response in veterans with both&#xD;
      TBI and PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Toward this end, the investigators propose a randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      involving a cognitive rehabilitation intervention that targets improved executive&#xD;
      functioning, with the participation of N=100 veterans diagnosed with both TBI and PTSD (n=50&#xD;
      in experimental group and n=50 receiving usual care). As part of the study, all participants&#xD;
      will receive an iPod touch. Participants will be placed into one of the two study groups&#xD;
      randomly. Based on which group participants are placed in, they will receive one of two&#xD;
      different sets of iPod touch apps and programs that address and aim to improve different&#xD;
      facets of cognitive functioning. Regardless of which group, Veterans will be instructed to&#xD;
      daily practice iPod touch applications on cognitive functioning. Also, family members will be&#xD;
      trained as &quot;mentors&quot; to reinforce use of the applications in everyday living environments.&#xD;
      Trained facilitators will also travel to participants' homes to meet with veterans and family&#xD;
      to review their respective applications and mentoring processes. The investigators will&#xD;
      examine both cognitive and behavioral changes, as well as neural changes associated with&#xD;
      cognitive rehabilitation using EEG and fMRI at baseline and six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Military Benefit: This study of the neurobiology and neuropsychology associated with&#xD;
      intervention efficacy will allow us to identify veterans with both TBI and PTSD who are&#xD;
      predisposed to positive treatment outcomes. To our knowledge, this will be the first attempt&#xD;
      to integrate neurobiological and neurocognitive techniques with information about the&#xD;
      efficacy of a theoretically and empirically driven cognitive rehabilitation intervention in&#xD;
      veterans with combined TBI/PTSD diagnoses. This research may suggest additional avenues for&#xD;
      assessment of clinical intervention efficacy and the identification of therapeutic targets&#xD;
      (e.g. alteration of function in fronto-limbic circuits) relevant to the military population.&#xD;
      Given links between TBI/PTSD, executive dysfunction, and anger, impulsivity, and aggression,&#xD;
      efforts to rehabilitate cognitive function will be particularly important to ensure that&#xD;
      current and future veterans adjust successfully when they return home to their families,&#xD;
      workplaces, and communities.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        OIF/OEF Veteran inclusion criteria include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. has served in one of the military branches (Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, National&#xD;
             Guard);&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. is between the ages of 18 and 65;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. has served in Iraq or Afghanistan War since October 2001;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. has screened positive for TBI and PTSD prior to baseline interview. Definition of TBI:&#xD;
             The American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM) (Kay et al., 1993), Center for&#xD;
             Disease Control (CDC, 2003), and Military TBI Task Force&#xD;
             (http://www.div40.org/pdf/Military_TBI.pdf) have sought to define criteria for&#xD;
             different types of head injuries. In the current DoD application, for both the&#xD;
             research registry and pre-screening, criteria for TBI should be defined as a veteran&#xD;
             who: 1. reports that during military service, head was hurt/injured in a way that&#xD;
             caused problems; AND 2. endorses at least one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  loss of consciousness or getting &quot;knocked out.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  immediately after the injury or upon regaining consciousness, being dazed or&#xD;
                  &quot;seeing stars.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  immediately after the injury or upon regaining consciousness, being unable to&#xD;
                  recall the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  being over one hour after the injury was it before veteran started remembering&#xD;
                  new things again.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  needing brain surgery after the injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Definition of PTSD: For the purposes of the current research, we use the Diagnostic&#xD;
        Statistical Manual-IV-TD (DSM-IV-TR) definition of PTSD for the purposes of the current&#xD;
        research. Specifically, subjects must report a traumatic event according to DSM criteria&#xD;
        and report experiencing re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal symptoms to qualify&#xD;
        for the diagnosis. Study registries define PTSD as having a score above the cut-off of 60&#xD;
        on the Clinical Assessment of PTSD (CAPS). We will re-screen potential participants before&#xD;
        enrollment by administering the PTSD Checklist, scores above 50 indicative of PTSD among&#xD;
        OIF/OEF veterans. Please note below that the CAPS will be administered as part of the main&#xD;
        clinical interview after veterans have signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Family member inclusion criteria include: (1) has family member/friend who served in one of&#xD;
        the military branches (Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, National Guard); (2) age 18-65; and&#xD;
        (3) has family member who served at least one tour in Iraq or Afghanistan since October&#xD;
        2001 and meets above criteria Inclusion of Women and Minorities in Study: It is anticipated&#xD;
        that the distribution of our sample by gender and race/ethnicity will reflect the client&#xD;
        population served by the North Carolina healthcare system. No one will be excluded from the&#xD;
        study because of gender or racial/ethnic group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Since MRI sessions are a part of the study, subjects should not participant if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. They have any foreign metal objects or implants in their body as determined by the&#xD;
             safety questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Veteran is a woman and is pregnant or unwilling to take a pregnancy test.&#xD;
