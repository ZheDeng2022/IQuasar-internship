      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a genetic disorder that prevents the body from making&#xD;
      enough cholesterol. People who have SLOS often need to take extra cholesterol, either in food&#xD;
      or in supplements, for their bodies to work properly. Cholesterol is very important for the&#xD;
      brain and nervous system. Therefore SLOS is highly related to autism, mental retardation, and&#xD;
      other brain and nervous system disorders. Not much is known about how people with SLOS handle&#xD;
      cholesterol and how taking extra cholesterol helps them. A long-term study of people with&#xD;
      SLOS will help answer these and other questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the effects of a high-cholesterol diet on people with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals of any age who have Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have study visits up to two times in the first year and once a year&#xD;
           every year after that. Each visit will last between 3 and 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood and urine&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide regular blood, urine, stool, saliva, and skin cell samples for&#xD;
           testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will keep track of the foods they eat at home. During the study, they will&#xD;
           eat a high-cholesterol diet at all times, except for the second study visit (3 to 6&#xD;
           months after the screening visit). That visit will involve a cholesterol-free diet for 4&#xD;
           weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have special cholesterol tests with blood samples at different times&#xD;
           during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At different study visits, participants will have tests of mental and physical skills&#xD;
           (including tests for autism). They will answer questions about their diet and food&#xD;
           habits. They will also have hearing and eye tests, body and bone measurements, and&#xD;
           imaging studies. Not all of the tests will be done at every study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be allowed to leave the study at any time.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to learn as much as possible about Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome&#xD;
      (SLOS) by following a large group of individuals with SLOS over a period of time. We plan to&#xD;
      measure cholesterol and other sterol levels, perform clinical observations, whole body&#xD;
      testing and imaging studies (brain MRIs), to learn more about disease mechanisms and&#xD;
      progression, variations in the clinical features among individuals with SLOS, and evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of cholesterol supplementation in this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a disorder of cholesterol synthesis, or production. It&#xD;
      is caused by mutations in the DHCR7 gene which encodes for 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, an&#xD;
      enzyme necessary for the production of cholesterol in the body. Affected individuals exhibit&#xD;
      multiple malformations and mental retardation. The features of SLOS are thought to be&#xD;
      primarily related to cholesterol deficiency and accumulation of cholesterol precursors.&#xD;
      However, the clinical phenotype is not well characterized, the biochemical pathogenesis is&#xD;
      incompletely understood, and there is no proven therapy for this devastating condition. Thus&#xD;
      our primary objective is to better define the clinical and biochemical phenotypes of the&#xD;
      disease using a natural history study design. The study will contribute to creating a&#xD;
      comprehensive SLOS patient registry, identify biomarkers that can be used for diagnostic&#xD;
      testing, screening and outcome measures in future therapeutic trials. All patients with SLOS&#xD;
      receive dietary cholesterol supplementation with the hope that cholesterol supplementation&#xD;
      will improve the clinical manifestation of the disease. However, there is no evidence&#xD;
      supporting a clinical benefit of cholesterol supplementation. Thus a secondary objective of&#xD;
      the study is to determine if cholesterol intake correlates with changes in whole body&#xD;
      cholesterol homeostasis and clinical end-points.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion of children:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The population being studied is subjects with SLOS. Children will not be excluded, in fact,&#xD;
        the majority of subjects being studied will be infants and children. Relatively few adults&#xD;
        with SLOS are known. We will continue to recruit subjects of all ages from newborn to adult&#xD;
        of both genders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion of women:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women and girls will certainly be included in the study. Women should be equally&#xD;
        represented in this study. SLOS is an autosomal recessively inherited condition that&#xD;
        affects males and females equally. However, since these disorders are uncommon&#xD;
        autosomal-recessively inherited inborn errors of metabolism, STAIR investigators will have&#xD;
        limited control over the gender mix of the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion of Minorities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        As mentioned for gender, STAIR investigators will have limited control over the race and&#xD;
        ethnicity mix of the study population. In order to increase the enrollment of minority&#xD;
        subjects, with permission, we will inform the national disease support group of our studies&#xD;
        so that subjects in other regions of the US with ethnically and racially more diverse&#xD;
        populations may be recruited. SLOS seems to be most common in Caucasians. In the current&#xD;
        SLOS study at OHSU, only one of the 34 SLOS subjects is Hispanic. There is only 1 report of&#xD;
        carriers in Blacks (Nowaczyk, 2001) and only 31 cases reported in a Japanese survey. In&#xD;
        Oregon at least, we will advertise the study at local community health clinics where large&#xD;
        numbers of Hispanics are seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        None.&#xD;
