  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy and safety of using afatinib (BIBW 2992)&#xD;
      to treat non-small cell lung cancer patients considered unfit for chemotherapy and have&#xD;
      either suspected or confirmed Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is most common cause of death from cancer, of which non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) accounts for ~80% of all cases with most patients presenting with advanced disease.&#xD;
      Patients medically unfit to receive radical or platinum-doublet palliative systemic therapy,&#xD;
      because of poor performance status or comorbidity, account for at least 45% of newly&#xD;
      diagnosed cases and have poor survival. Many oncologists have interpreted single-agent&#xD;
      chemotherapy data as not clinically meaningful when balanced against toxicities,&#xD;
      non-significant improvements in quality of life and comorbidity. Hence, in the UK, this group&#xD;
      of patients are predominantly treated by best-supportive care (BSC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to examine the efficacy and safety of using afatinib (BIBW 2992), an&#xD;
      irreversible second generation EGFR inhibitor, in patients with non-small cell lung cancer,&#xD;
      who are considered unfit for chemotherapy and have either suspected or confirmed Epidermal&#xD;
      Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suspected EGFR mutant patients will have clinical characteristics likely to harbour the EGFR&#xD;
      mutation (adenocarcinoma sub type and ex or never smokers) with EGFR genotype unknown either&#xD;
      due to no tissue suitable for genotyping or failed genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been only one small prospective study of medically unfit patients with EGFR&#xD;
      mutation, but it demonstrated good efficacy with a TKI17. This phase II study of East Asian&#xD;
      patients (n=30) with performance status 2-4 and treated with gefitinib demonstrated a rapid&#xD;
      improvement in performance status at 1 month, an overall response rate of 66% and median&#xD;
      survival of 17.8 months. Whilst gefitinib is licensed for EGFR mutant NSCLC, no prospective&#xD;
      studies have yet been performed on medically unfit patients from Western countries. Despite&#xD;
      dramatic initial responses, EGFR mutant NSCLC patients treated with gefitinib/erlotinib&#xD;
      ultimately relapse. In ~50% of cases this is due to the gefitinib/erlotinib-resistant T790M&#xD;
      genotype acquired through either secondary somatic mutation or clonal expansion. There is&#xD;
      therefore a need to improve the outcomes of medically unfit patients with suspected EGFR&#xD;
      mutation, who would otherwise be treated with best supportive care, and in proven EGFR&#xD;
      mutation cases by using an effective EGFR-directed therapy that inhibits EGFRT790M.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective data on medically unfit Western NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation are required to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs. Additionally, given that 50% of such patients will become&#xD;
      TKI-resistant through EGFRT790M, new therapies are required to overcome this resistance&#xD;
      mechanism.&#xD;
