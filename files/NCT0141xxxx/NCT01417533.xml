      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - GNE Myopathy is a disease that causes walking difficulties and increasing muscle weakness.&#xD;
      It usually develops in young adults (between 20 and 30 years of age), and affects arm and leg&#xD;
      muscles. HIBM is caused by mutations in a gene that may affect how the muscles function.&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn more about the causes, symptoms, and effects of HIBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect genetic and medical information from people with GNE Myopathy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 80 years of age who have GNE Myopathy and do not use a&#xD;
      wheelchair. - Participants must be willing to stop any current treatment of HIBM while&#xD;
      enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and neurological&#xD;
           exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first visit, participants will have the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires about the impact of HIBM on daily activities, mood, and quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hour urine collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle strength and endurance tests, including walking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging study of the muscles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will return for followup visits at 6, 12, and 18 months. They may be asked&#xD;
           to return for a final visit at 24 months. Not all tests will be performed at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study to evaluate patients with GNE myopathy and other&#xD;
      GNE-related diseases. The GNE gene encodes for UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase, the&#xD;
      bifunctional enzyme that initiates and regulates intracellular sialic acid (Neu5Ac)&#xD;
      biosynthesis and glycan sialylation. GNE myopathy is a rare, autosomal recessive myopathy&#xD;
      with onset in early adulthood characterized by progressive skeletal muscle atrophy and&#xD;
      weakness. The impairment of Neu5Ac production is presumed to cause decreased sialylation of&#xD;
      muscle glycoproteins, resulting in muscle deterioration. Other GNE-related diseases such as&#xD;
      congenital thrombocytopenia have been recently identified, but the pathophysiology is not&#xD;
      well understood. In this protocol, we plan to evaluate patients with GNE myopathy and other&#xD;
      GNE-related diseases clinically, biochemically, and molecularly to characterize the&#xD;
      mechanisms of disease, to delineate the natural history, phenotypes, progression and&#xD;
      complications of GNE-related diseases, and to identify endpoints and biomarkers to support&#xD;
      clinical trials testing potential therapies.&#xD;
