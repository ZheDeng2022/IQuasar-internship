      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), activity, and&#xD;
      safety of oprozomib in patients with hematologic malignancies.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    A program evaluation identified that the safety profile and pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
    characteristics of the formulation used in all oprozomib studies required further optimization&#xD;
    and thus enrollment in 2011-001 was halted.&#xD;
