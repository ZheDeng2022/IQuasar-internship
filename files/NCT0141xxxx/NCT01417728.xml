      The aim of the study is to analyze the mechanism of action of infliximab at the&#xD;
      endomicroscopic level and to analyze mucosal healing - i.e. structural and functional changes&#xD;
      in the mucosa in IBD patients - and associated processes such as permeability and bacterial&#xD;
      invasion of the mucosa. In this study the role of the above mentioned parameters and further&#xD;
      the establishment of endomicroscopic scores will serve to define new prognostic markers in&#xD;
      view of long term remission upon infliximab treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of treatment for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis has always been the&#xD;
      induction and maintenance of symptomatic improvement or at best remission. There is recent&#xD;
      evidence that with immunosuppression and treatment with infliximab a long-term healing of the&#xD;
      bowel can be achieved and that this affects the clinical outcome of both Crohn's disease and&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis. Chronic idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) including Crohn's&#xD;
      disease, ulcerative colitis and indeterminate colitis are characterised by the presence of&#xD;
      extensive areas of ulceration and inflammation in the gut. These ulcerations are the origin&#xD;
      of several complications e.g fistulas, toxic megacolon, perforation and bleeding or&#xD;
      developing neoplasias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore effective treatment of IBD should imply thoroughly and, if possible, complete&#xD;
      healing of bowel ulcerations in parallel with clinical remission. There is evidence that&#xD;
      infliximab, an immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody against tumour necrosis factor, not only&#xD;
      rapidly improves symptoms in patients with refractory IBDs, but also induces mucosal healing&#xD;
      of ileocolonic lesions by week 4 after intravenous administration. The key question of course&#xD;
      is whether healing of the mucosa of the bowel improves also the microstructural level of the&#xD;
      mucosa and submucosa and perhaps translocation of commensal bacteria and barrier function as&#xD;
      well. The validity of healing and maintain microscopic healing of the bowel mucosa and&#xD;
      submucosa still has to be shown. Clinical studies showed that infliximab heals the mucosa of&#xD;
      the colon in up to 60% by 8 weeks and maintains this healing for al long period of time.&#xD;
      Unfortunately treatments that heal the mucosa do not cure Crohn's disease or ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis; however, they are associated with a prolongation of the symptom free interval in&#xD;
      comparison with the non-healed bowel. This fact suggests that the disease mechanism in the&#xD;
      mucosa does not disappear with macroscopic healing of the ulcers and that the intraluminal&#xD;
      trigger ends up damaging the mucosa again. For the purpose of clinical trials mucosal healing&#xD;
      was defined so far by macroscopic view on the mucosa during white light endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A microscopic analysis of the microstructure for assessment of healing seems to be necessary,&#xD;
      especially to define objective end points for infliximab therapy to prevent relapses and&#xD;
      complications. It is known that mucosal healing does not always correlate with clinical&#xD;
      remission, therefore a microscopic diagnosis of ongoing inflammation is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a miniaturized confocal microscope was developed which could be integrated in the&#xD;
      distal tip of a conventional colonoscope. This new diagnostic technology for gastrointestinal&#xD;
      endoscopy, denoted confocal endomicroscopy, allowed in vivo histology of the mucosal layer&#xD;
      during ongoing colonoscopy. Furthermore, in patients screened for sporadic colorectal cancer,&#xD;
      surface and subsurface analysis at cellular and subcellular resolution could be used to&#xD;
      predict intraepithelial neoplasias (INs) with high accuracy. Endomicroscopic image&#xD;
      acquisition is performed by placing the tip of the colonoscope in direct contact with the&#xD;
      targeted tissue site and providing in this manner surface and subsurface imaging at the time&#xD;
      of ongoing video colonoscopy. It allows the detailed analysis of colorectal crypt&#xD;
      architecture, deep vascular net structure and detailed mucosal / submucosal analysis. Studies&#xD;
      in patients with ulcerative colitis showed that this novel endoscopic approach allowed to&#xD;
      diagnose flat intraepithelial neoplasias with a high degree of accuracy and thus emerges as a&#xD;
      crucial innovative imaging technology in the colon. Here, we propose to analyze the mucosa of&#xD;
      patients with Crohn´s disease and ulcerative colitis before and after infliximab therapy&#xD;
      using endomicroscopy for analysing microscopic healing processes during ongoing endoscopy.&#xD;
