  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to assess 1) the electrical activity of the diaphragm in mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated patients during weaning from mechanical ventilation. 2) Whether the electrical&#xD;
      activity of the diaphragm may predict the weaning outcome&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Optimization of the time to liberate the patient from mechanical ventilation should be&#xD;
      balanced between the risks associated with failed extubation and those related to prolonged&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation. Weaning failure is associated with major complications. Even when&#xD;
      weaning protocols and clinical predictors have been used to improve the weaning outcome,&#xD;
      there is still a significant proportion of patients who fail to breath spontaneously with&#xD;
      significant risks of pneumonia, prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality rate. Electrical activity of the diaphragm, a mirror of the respiratory drive and&#xD;
      now available on an ICU ventilator may help to predict in a more accurate way the weaning&#xD;
      outcome. The patients will be ventilated in NAVA with the titration method (1). As soon as&#xD;
      patients passed successfully a daily screening EAdi will be measured during a spontaneous&#xD;
      breathing trial.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Neurally adjust ventilatory assist (NAVA) and a nasogastric tube to measure the electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi catheter)</intervention_name>
    <description>Nava is a new ventilatory mode which delivers pressure in proportion of the the Electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi), a reflection of the neural respiratory output. EAdi will be obtained through a nasogastric tube with a multiple array of electrodes placed at its distal end. Correct positioning of the EAdi catheter is assured by means of a specific function of the ventilator (''EAdi catheter positioning''). The EAdi signal is processed according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) recommendations and filtered by algorithms designed to provide the highest possible signal-to-noise ratio</description>
