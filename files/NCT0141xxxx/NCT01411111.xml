    <textblock>
      Leukotrienes are potent inflammatory molecules produced mainly by mast cells, eosinophils,&#xD;
      monocytes/macrophage and neutrophils in response to allergic or inflammatory stimuli.&#xD;
      GSK2190915 is a high affinity 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) inhibitor that&#xD;
      attenuates the production of leukotrienes, through the blockage of the first committed step&#xD;
      in the leukotriene pathway, 5 lipoxygenase (5-LO) activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GSK2190915 has been shown to be an in vitro inhibitor of human organic anion transporting&#xD;
      polypeptides 1B1 and 1B3 (OATP1B1 and OATP1B3), hence there is a potential for a&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction with OATP1/ B1 substrates such as the anti-lipidemic&#xD;
      rosuvastatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the effect of repeat oral dosing of GSK2190915 (30milligram (mg) and&#xD;
      100mg) on the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of rosuvastatin (10 mg). In addition, the&#xD;
      study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of this combination when co-administered to&#xD;
      healthy, adult volunteers in two cohorts.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      GSK2190915 is a high affinity 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) inhibitor that&#xD;
      attenuates the production of leukotrienes, through the blockage of the first committed step&#xD;
      in the leukotriene pathway, 5 lipoxygenase (5-LO) activation. Leukotrienes are potent&#xD;
      inflammatory molecules produced mainly by mast cells, eosinophils, monocytes/macrophage and&#xD;
      neutrophils in response to allergic or inflammatory stimuli. As GSK2190915 inhibits the&#xD;
      production of leukotriene B4 and cysteinyl leukotrienes it has strong potential utility in&#xD;
      the treatment of asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) The organic anion&#xD;
      transporting polypeptides (OATP's) form a superfamily of sodium-independent transport systems&#xD;
      that mediate the transmembrane transport of a wide range of amphipathic organic compounds. Of&#xD;
      the 11 human OATP transporters, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 are specifically expressed on the&#xD;
      sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes and are considered to be of particular importance for&#xD;
      hepatic drug elimination and drug pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GSK2190915 has been shown to be an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Several clinically&#xD;
      utilised drugs have been identified as substrates of OATP transporters, including&#xD;
      rosuvastatin - a member of the statin group of anti-lipidemics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the target patient population for GSK2190915 may overlap with that for statins such as&#xD;
      rosuvastatin, it is important to evaluate any potential effects of GSK2190915 on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of a statin known to undergo hepatic elimination via OATP1B1/1B3 This study&#xD;
      will evaluate the effect of repeat oral dosing of GSK2190915 on the steady-state&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin. In addition, the study will evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of this combination when co-administered to healthy, adult volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two dose levels of GSK2190915 will be investigated; 30mg and 100mg once daily for 7 days. The&#xD;
      rosuvastatin dose selected for this study is 10mg which allows for up to a 4 times increase&#xD;
      in systemic exposure if there is a pharmacokinetic interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be an open label, single-sequence study in two cohorts with 2 treatment&#xD;
      periods. 28 subjects will receive rosuvastatin 10mg/day for 7 days during the first treatment&#xD;
      period, following on from which 14 subjects each will receive either GSK2190915 30 mg/day or&#xD;
      GSK2190915 100mg/day in combination with rosuvastatin 10mg/day for the next 7 days. Subjects&#xD;
      will be followed up 7-14 days after their last dose. PK samples will be obtained for both&#xD;
      rosuvastatin and GSK2190915 during the study. Safety will be evaluated via physical&#xD;
      examinations, ElectroCardioGrams (ECG) and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 28 healthy subjects will be enrolled such that approximately 24 subjects (12 in&#xD;
      each of the two treatment arms) complete dosing and critical assessments.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is of non-Asian origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alanine aminotransferase (AMT), alkaline phosphatase&#xD;
             and bilirubin &lt;1.5xULN (upper limit of normal) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is&#xD;
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical&#xD;
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination and laboratory tests. A&#xD;
             subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference&#xD;
             range for the population being studied may be included if the Investigator believes&#xD;
             that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not&#xD;
             interfere with the study procedures. The GSK medical monitor will be consulted where&#xD;
             necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             â€¢ A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential&#xD;
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or&#xD;
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a&#xD;
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 Milli&#xD;
             lnternational Units/millilitre ( MIU/ml) and estradiol &lt; 40 picogram/ml (pg/ml) (&lt;147&#xD;
             picomoles/Litre (pmol/L)) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy&#xD;
             (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the&#xD;
             contraception methods in Section 8.1 or the protocol if they wish to continue their&#xD;
             HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of&#xD;
             postmenopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2- 4&#xD;
             weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval&#xD;
             depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal&#xD;
             status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive&#xD;
             method.&#xD;
