  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in the United States. Through early&#xD;
      detection and improved local therapies a large number of men will be cured. The clinical&#xD;
      needs include early detection, accurate initial staging and detection of local recurrence or&#xD;
      metastases in order to permit application of the most appropriate therapy. Therapeutic&#xD;
      monitoring and prognostic assessment are equally important. Imaging can play an important and&#xD;
      crucial role in meeting these clinical needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has gained an important role in the clinical&#xD;
      management of cancer patients. 18F-DCFBC is a novel low molecular weight prostate specific&#xD;
      membrane antigen (PSMA)-based radiopharmaceutical which is radiolabeled with a fluorine-18&#xD;
      positron emitter for PET imaging. Preclinical mouse prostate cancer tumor model imaging&#xD;
      studies of 18F-DCFBC demonstrate high specific uptake in PSMA expressing prostate cancer&#xD;
      cells. The investigators will assess the hypothesis that 18F-DCFBC, a new positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) radiopharmaceutical may possess pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      properties that will represent an advance in imaging prostate cancer. This initial phase I&#xD;
      study will determine the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and prostate specific tumor&#xD;
      uptake in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.&#xD;
