    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers of&#xD;
      activity and efficacy of pre-operative Afatinib (BIBW2992) in untreated non-metastatic head&#xD;
      and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 500,000 new patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN) are&#xD;
      diagnosed each year around the world. Patients who relapse after primary therapy for&#xD;
      locoregional disease and those who present with distant metastases have limited prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug therapy for cancer control and the palliation of patients with recurrent or metastatic&#xD;
      SCCHN is currently suboptimal. In contemporary trials the most active cytotoxic drug&#xD;
      combinations have response rates in the range of 30%, and are associated with frequent and&#xD;
      severe toxicities and treatment-related mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular targeting has been demonstrated in oncology as a relevant strategy in cancer&#xD;
      therapeutics. In March 2006, the FDA announced the approval of a chimeric monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), cetuximab, for use in combination with&#xD;
      radiation therapy in patients with locally advanced SCCHN. Furthermore, the addition of&#xD;
      cetuximab to cisplatin and 5FU as first-line therapy in patients with recurrent or metastatic&#xD;
      SCCHN has significantly improved overall survival when compared to cisplatin and 5FU alone.&#xD;
      Phase II data of cetuximab given as monotherapy in recurrent or metastatic SCCHN patients who&#xD;
      have progressed on platinum-based therapy have demonstrated an overall response rate of 13%&#xD;
      and a median survival of about 6 months. Small molecules tyrosine kinase inhibitors of EGFR,&#xD;
      such as gefitinib and erlotinib, seem to be slightly less effective than cetuximab. Based on&#xD;
      these results, FDA has also approved cetuximab monotherapy use for this indication in&#xD;
      recurrent or metastatic SCCHN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite high expression of EGFR in SCCHN, EGFR inhibitor monotherapy has only had&#xD;
      modest activity. Potential mechanisms of resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies involve EGFR&#xD;
      and K-Ras mutations, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and activation of alternative and&#xD;
      downstream pathways. Strategies to optimize EGFR-targeted therapy in head and neck cancer&#xD;
      involve the selection for patients most likely to benefit and the use of therapies to target&#xD;
      the network of pathways involved in tumor growth, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afatinib is an irreversible dual inhibitor of EGFR and HER2 tyrosine kinase. Preclinical data&#xD;
      suggest that Afatinib might have a larger spectrum antitumor activity than EGFR tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase inhibitors. In vivo and in vitro studies indeed showed that Afatinib displays&#xD;
      antitumor activity in erlotinib/gefitinib-resistant lung models. Afatinib compared favourably&#xD;
      to cetuximab in platinum-resistant metastatic SCCHN. In addition, Afatinib has shown&#xD;
      promising antitumor activity in HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer after&#xD;
      trastuzumab failure and in metastatic adenocarcinomas of the lung harbouring EGFR activating&#xD;
      mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers studies have mostly been performed in&#xD;
      pre-treated metastatic patients. Erlotinib has been the most studied EGFR-targeted agent in&#xD;
      terms of biomarkers identification in SCCHN. In the metastatic setting, sequential biopsies&#xD;
      allowed correlating potential predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers with the outcome of&#xD;
      patients treated with erlotinib. The decrease of p-EGFR in tumor tissue was associated with&#xD;
      increased time-to-progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) in one study. In another study,&#xD;
      elevated pre-treatment levels of p27 and p-STAT3 in tumor tissue predicted for prolonged TTP&#xD;
      and OS, while a decrease in p-EGFR, p-NFkB and p27 correlated with increased TTP, OS or both.&#xD;
      However, the lack of control arm precluded to draw any definitive conclusion. One study&#xD;
      evaluated erlotinib in the neoadjuvant setting in untreated patients with operable SCCHN.&#xD;
      Baseline p21 expression in tumor tissue correlated with clinical response to treatment. But&#xD;
      again, the absence of control arm in this later study precluded drawing definitive&#xD;
      conclusions regarding the potential predictive and pharmacodynamic value of the biomarkers&#xD;
      under evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main characteristics of our study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the pre-operative setting in untreated patients with the advantage of having untreated&#xD;
           patients for whom it is easy to get pre- and post-treatment tumor specimen, during&#xD;
           initial panendoscopy and surgery, respectively&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the randomization versus no treatment which is the only way to be able to draw robust&#xD;
           conclusions regarding the potential predictive and pharmacodynamic value of the&#xD;
           biomarkers under evaluation. Single-arm phase II trials can only identify prognostic&#xD;
           markers of activity, but not predictive biomarkers of activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, surgery will not be delayed in any case by the study. However, it is required&#xD;
      that planning of surgery will enable patients to receive between 21 and 28 days of treatment&#xD;
      to participate into the study given the planned date of surgery.&#xD;
