  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers have linked media messages such as television programs to multiple problematic&#xD;
      health behaviors. The narrative style of many television programs-involving a plot, recurrent&#xD;
      characters, entertaining situations, and familiar settings-makes them compelling and likely&#xD;
      contributes to the powerful influence these programs can have on behavior. However, narrative&#xD;
      messages are not frequently utilized for prosocial purposes. In particular, health education&#xD;
      embedded in a narrative context has been neither commonly utilized nor carefully evaluated.&#xD;
      Using constructs from two complementary theories of health behavior, family physicians in a&#xD;
      large metropolitan region have developed a situation comedy entitled &quot;White Coats&quot; that aims&#xD;
      to provide quality patient education. The program currently airs on a local public access&#xD;
      channel. The objective of this project is to evaluate the effect of one particular episode of&#xD;
      &quot;White Coats&quot; on patient beliefs regarding hypertension.&#xD;

      1. Design Randomized, single-blinded controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants/Setting Permission from our Institutional Review Board has already been&#xD;
           granted for this project (IRB #PRO07020003), but we are in the process of reapplying&#xD;
           based on our revisions in response to the JGAP's initial review (please see section Q&#xD;
           below). Participants will be recruited from the patient population of our largest&#xD;
           residency family health center. The family health center cares for a pool of&#xD;
           approximately 5000 patients with low to moderate income. Its population is roughly 40%&#xD;
           male and 60% female. The population is racially diverse (Caucasian=60%; African&#xD;
           American=20%; Other=20%). In order to recruit our study sample, we will generate a&#xD;
           random list of patients from this health center's electronic records. All selected&#xD;
           individuals will be contacted to assess whether they meet study criteria. As listed in&#xD;
           Appendix 2, only persons with a history of hypertension or risk factors for hypertension&#xD;
           will be included. In this way, we will recruit 80 volunteers aged 18-65.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Procedure Selected individuals will participate in two sessions. The first will consist&#xD;
           of the intervention with pre-testing and immediate post-intervention testing, and the&#xD;
           second will consist of a follow-up survey two months after the intervention. We will&#xD;
           offer a $15 incentive (local grocery store gift card) to participate at each of these&#xD;
           two steps for a total incentive of $30. Study personnel will contact those patients&#xD;
           identified in the random sample by telephone and will read them a complete recruitment&#xD;
           form. Recruited subjects will make an appointment to meet the research assistant for the&#xD;
           initial survey testing and intervention exposure. At this appointment, study personnel&#xD;
           will obtain verbal assent. Participants will be randomized using block randomization,&#xD;
           stratifying for gender and age, into control and treatment arms. The entire&#xD;
           randomization scheme will be completed a priori. Subjects will not be informed of their&#xD;
           status as either a control or intervention group participant (single-blinded).&#xD;
&#xD;
           All subjects will be led to a private room and will be given 15 minutes to complete the&#xD;
           pre-test (Appendix 3). Participants in the intervention group will watch a twenty-five&#xD;
           minute episode of &quot;White Coats.&quot; Participants in the control group will watch a&#xD;
           twenty-five minute educational video about depression. Immediately following the&#xD;
           interventions, all subjects will be administered post-tests (Appendix 4). The research&#xD;
           assistant will contact participants two months later by telephone to schedule a time to&#xD;
           return to the family health center to take the delayed post-test (Appendix 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Intervention The intervention will consist of a twenty-five minute episode of a local&#xD;
           health education situation comedy television series. Two physicians affiliated with a&#xD;
           Family Medicine Residency and Fellowship Program created and currently produce this&#xD;
           television series, entitled &quot;White Coats,&quot; which currently airs on a local cable public&#xD;
           access channel. The series features a fictional married couple of Family Medicine&#xD;
           physicians who work in the same practice, located in our community. In both their&#xD;
           professional and private lives and, in moments both humorous and serious, these doctors&#xD;
           teach patients about a wide variety of health topics. The intervention episode&#xD;
           addressing hypertension will focus on three different patient-physician plot lines,&#xD;
           which were developed to specifically address each of the beliefs about hypertension&#xD;
           highlighted in the theoretical model (susceptibility, seriousness, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Measures Evaluation will consist of pre- and post-testing, both immediate and at a&#xD;
           two-month follow-up, with a self-administered written survey. The primary outcome&#xD;
           measures will consist of five items (Q15-Q19) representing constructs from the health&#xD;
           belief model and social cognitive theory: (1) perceived seriousness of hypertension&#xD;
           (Q15), (2) perceived susceptibility to hypertension (Q16), (3) barriers to hypertension&#xD;
           control (Q17), (4) self-efficacy regarding hypertension control (Q18), and (5) outcome&#xD;
           efficacy regarding hypertension control (Q19). All outcomes will be scored on a 1 to 7&#xD;
           point Likert scale. We have modeled question items from existing reliable, valid&#xD;
           instruments,23-25 although no complete previously validated instrument exists to&#xD;
           specifically measure these five constructs as they relate to hypertensive control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will collect demographics including age as a continuous variable (based on date of birth),&#xD;
      gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Race/ethnicity will be collected in the&#xD;
      manner suggested by the National Institutes of Health, allowing participants to select more&#xD;
      than one race/ethnicity. Socioeconomic status will be approximated with highest level of&#xD;
      education achieved.&#xD;
