  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall study objective is to evaluate Chondrofix Osteochondral Allograft (&quot;Chondrofix&quot;)&#xD;
      for the repair of osteochondral lesions in the knee. This includes, but is not limited to&#xD;
      primary cartilage lesion repair and revision of failed prior cartilage repair treatments. The&#xD;
      study hypothesis is that Chondrofix Allograft will provide pain relief and functional&#xD;
      improvement as demonstrated by a comparative analysis of baseline clinical evaluations at 24&#xD;
      months of follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knee cartilage injuries are a major cause of pain and functional impairment in young to&#xD;
      middle age adults and can lead to progressive joint degeneration. In response to challenges&#xD;
      with current cartilage repair options, Chondrofix Allograft was developed as an off-the-shelf&#xD;
      treatment option adding to the variety of cartilage reparation offerings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a multicenter, prospective, post-market clinical outcomes study designed to&#xD;
      assess the clinical outcomes of Chondrofix Allograft used in the treatment of both primary&#xD;
      and revision cartilage repair cases. Study design includes up to 6 qualified investigational&#xD;
      sites with 50 subjects enrolled across all centers during an 18 month enrollment period.&#xD;
      Study subjects will be followed postoperatively for 5 years. The Investigators who are&#xD;
      responsible for the conduct of this study in compliance with this protocol will be orthopedic&#xD;
      surgeons who are skilled in the techniques of articular cartilage repair.&#xD;

             pregnant during the first 24 months of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Up to two (2) cartilage lesion(s), each measuring less than 8 cm2, of the femoral&#xD;
