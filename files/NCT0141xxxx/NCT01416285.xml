  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a major public health problem worldwide. CHF carries a&#xD;
      devastating prognosis, which resembles that of some types of malignant cancer. Despite&#xD;
      substantial improvements in the management of the disease, the prognosis remains poor&#xD;
      especially in advanced stages of the disease. For these patients, self-management plan&#xD;
      includes monitoring of symptoms such as fatigue and shortness of breath, daily weighing, and&#xD;
      knowing what to do if signs of deterioration appear, and when to report the changes to&#xD;
      health. The investigators hypothesize that patients in the heart failure management programs&#xD;
      that promote self-management by means of intensive education, edema index-assistance, and&#xD;
      telephone follow-up can improve their functional status and quality of life, as well as the&#xD;
      biomarkers of CHF, left ventricular systolic function, proteinuria and nutritional status.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a major public health problem world-wide. CHF carries a&#xD;
      devastating prognosis which resembles that of some types of malignant cancer. Its incidence&#xD;
      rises steadily from 0.02 per 1000 population per year in those aged 25 to 34 years to 11.6 in&#xD;
      those aged 85 years or older. Despite substantial improvements in the management of the&#xD;
      disease, the prognosis remains poor especially in advanced stages of the disease. About half&#xD;
      of the patients diagnosed with CHF die within 4 years of diagnosis. With the increasing&#xD;
      number of patients with CHF being referred from hospital to primary health care, the demands&#xD;
      for expanded services in primary health care have increased. Caring for patients with CHF&#xD;
      often involves a number of physical, medical, behavioral, psychological and social factors,&#xD;
      and requires appropriate attention to all aspects of care, both pharmacological and&#xD;
      non-pharmacological. Educating patients about CHF treatment and the consequences of CHF has&#xD;
      been shown to improve self-management behavior. For patients with CHF, the self-management&#xD;
      plan includes monitoring of symptoms such as fatigue and shortness of breath, daily weighing,&#xD;
      and knowing what to do if signs of deterioration appear, and when to report the changes to&#xD;
      health care provider. In patients with CHF, the prognosis worsens considerably once&#xD;
      malnutrition develops. Mortality at 18 months in unselected patients with CHF in whom cardiac&#xD;
      cachexia had been diagnosed was as high as 50% compared to in non-cachectic patients from the&#xD;
      same study population. In addition, amount of proteinuria has been known to be related to&#xD;
      atherosclerosis burden and disease severity regarding lots of disease entities. The&#xD;
      atherosclerosis score is also probably modifiable by life style intervention and educational&#xD;
      program. CHF can also activate a few neurohormone and natriuretic peptides, among which brain&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide is the most world-wide used. Summarized, in this study, to estimate the&#xD;
      effect of CHF education and self-management program, the parameters adopted include blood&#xD;
      brain natriuretic peptide and albumin levels, atherosclerosis scores, proteinuria, renal&#xD;
      function, changes in life quality, left ventricular ejection fraction, and cardiac outcomes.&#xD;
      In Taiwan, so far, the investigators don't have this kind of CHF education and self-care&#xD;
      system. The investigators hypothesize that patients in the heart failure management programs&#xD;
      that promote self-management by means of intensive education, edema index-assistance, and&#xD;
      telephone follow-up can improve their functional status and quality of life, as well as the&#xD;
      biomarkers of CHF, left ventricular systolic function, proteinuria and nutritional status.&#xD;
