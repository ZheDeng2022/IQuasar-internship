    <textblock>
      The Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) is an inherited disorder that results in defects of the&#xD;
      blood and bone marrow. It affects boys because the genetic mistake is carried on the X&#xD;
      chromosome. Normal people have blood cells called platelets that stop bleeding when blood&#xD;
      vessels are damaged. Boys with WAS have low numbers of platelets that do not function&#xD;
      correctly. Boys with WAS are thus at risk for severe life-threatening bleeding. A normal&#xD;
      immune system is made of special blood cells called white blood cells, which protect against&#xD;
      infection and also fight certain types of cancer. In WAS, these white blood cells don't work&#xD;
      as well as they should, making these boys very susceptible to infections and to a form of&#xD;
      blood cancer known as lymphoma. The abnormal white blood cells of patients with WAS also&#xD;
      cause diseases such as eczema and arthritis. Although WAS can be mild, severe forms need&#xD;
      treatment as early as possible to prevent life-threatening complications due to bleeding,&#xD;
      infection and blood cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past decade, investigators have developed new treatments based on the investigators&#xD;
      knowledge of the defective gene causing WAS. The investigators can now use genes as a type of&#xD;
      medicine that will correct the problem in the patient's own bone marrow. The investigators&#xD;
      call this process gene transfer. The procedure is very similar to a normal bone marrow&#xD;
      transplant, in that the old marrow is killed off using chemotherapy, but is different because&#xD;
      the patient's own bone marrow is given back after it is treated by gene transfer. This&#xD;
      approach can be used even if the patient does not have any matched donors available and will&#xD;
      avoid problems such as GVHD and rejection. The investigators wish to test whether this&#xD;
      approach is safe and whether gene transfer will lead to the development of a healthy immune&#xD;
      and blood system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) (OMIM 301000) is a rare X-linked immunodeficiency caused by&#xD;
      mutations in a single gene, WAS, mapping to Xp11.22-Xp11.3 and coding for the Wiskott-Aldrich&#xD;
      Syndrome Protein (WASP) 1. WASP is a critical regulator of actin signaling with expression&#xD;
      limited to hematopoietic cells, and thus is required for multiple functions including T cell&#xD;
      activation, dendritic cell migration and podosome formation, and B cell terminal development&#xD;
      and function. WAS is characterized by microthrombocytopenia, recurrent infections, eczema and&#xD;
      associated with a high incidence of auto-immunity and of lymphoid malignancies. Classic or&#xD;
      severe WAS, is generally observed in patients with nonsense mutations or insertions/deletions&#xD;
      resulting in frameshift or splice-site mutations or missense mutations and resulting in&#xD;
      unstable protein 2. With few exceptions, WASP-negative patients have classical disease.&#xD;
      Affected patients have a severely reduced life expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the only curative option for WAS patients is hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (HSCT). This treatment is most successful when an HLA-identical sibling or&#xD;
      matched unrelated donor is available and results in correction of microthrombocytopenia and&#xD;
      immune dysfunction, even when stable mixed chimerism occurs. However, even patients&#xD;
      undergoing matched HSCT can suffer from considerable morbidity and mortality due to graft&#xD;
      versus host disease (GVHD) and many patients lack an HLA-identical donor. The outcome of&#xD;
      mismatched related HSCT is consistently poor with survival of approximately 50%. Gene&#xD;
      transfer is an attractive alternative treatment for WAS. Successful gene transfer using&#xD;
      autologous gene-corrected HSC would overcome clinical complications linked to GVHD and its&#xD;
      treatment. Furthermore, in contrast to allogeneic HSCT, gene transfer would not be limited by&#xD;
      the availability of compatible donors. Several lines of evidence indicate that partial&#xD;
      reconstitution with gene corrected cells may be sufficient to ameliorate the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose here a Pilot and Feasibility study of ex vivo gene transfer using a lentiviral&#xD;
      vector (LV) to transduce autologous bone marrow derived CD34+ HSC. Cells will be infused into&#xD;
      patients conditioned with cytoreductive chemotherapy. Our collaborating investigators in&#xD;
      Europe have developed a LV encoding the human WAS cDNA under control of the WAS promoter and&#xD;
      pseudotyped with the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus glycoprotein (VSVg) envelope. This&#xD;
      w1.6_hWASP_WPRE (VSVg) LV (abbreviated as w1.6W) has been shown to be efficacious in both in&#xD;
      vitro and in vivo preclinical models. Safety including cellular toxicity, insertional&#xD;
      mutagenesis and tumor formation has been studied by a number of methods including: 1) a&#xD;
      sensitive in vitro transformation assay, 2) toxicity studies in transduced human CD34+ cells,&#xD;
      3) examination of the insertional pattern in transduced murine cells, and 4) long-term&#xD;
      observation and secondary transplant studies in mice. In the United States, we plan to enroll&#xD;
      5 boys with classic WAS who lack a matched related or unrelated donor. Parallel studies (not&#xD;
      under our Investigational New Drug application) using the same LV produced in the same&#xD;
      facility, Genethon, will be conducted in London, UK (5 subjects) and Paris, France (5&#xD;
      subjects). The primary objective will be to demonstrate feasibility and safety. The secondary&#xD;
      objective will be to assess therapeutic efficacy.&#xD;
