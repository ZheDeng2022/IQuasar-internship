  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a case series study evaluating the feasibility and dosage of Intensive Mobility&#xD;
      Training (IMT). Twelve participants with chronic, mild-to-moderate, Traumatic Brain Injury&#xD;
      (TBI) causing significant locomotor impairment, who meet these specific criteria, will be&#xD;
      recruited. Location and nature of neural insult will be determined by multimodal Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) exam. All participants will receive 3 hours of rehabilitation per day&#xD;
      for 20 days, focusing on gait and balance. Locomotion and balance will be comprehensively&#xD;
      tested prior to IMT, after 10 days of IMT, and then again after the full dose of IMT. This&#xD;
      study will determine the feasibility of this intervention in the population of TBI patients,&#xD;
      allow an estimate of effect size and provide initial information on possible neural&#xD;
      predictors of success. Furthermore the investigators will be able to determine whether the&#xD;
      dosage of 10 days is sufficient or whether significant improvements are made with 20 days of&#xD;
      the intervention.&#xD;
