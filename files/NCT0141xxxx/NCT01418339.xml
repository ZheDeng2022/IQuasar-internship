    <measure>Change From Baseline in Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) - Total Tic Score (TTS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The YGTSS is a semi-structured clinical interview designed to measure the tic severity. This scale consisted of a tic inventory, with 5 separate rating scales to rate the severity of symptoms, and an impairment ranking. Ratings were made along 5 different dimensions on a scale of 0 to 5 for motor and vocal tics, each including number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference. The YGTSS TTS was the summation of the severity scores of motor and vocal tics. The TTS ranged from 0 (none) to 50 (severe) with a higher score represent more severe symptoms (greater reduction from baseline for greater improvement). Mixed Effect Repeated Measure Model (MMRM) analysis was performed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impressions Scale for Tourette's Syndrome (CGI-TS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of illness and efficacy of study medication for each participant were rated using the CGI-TS scale. The study physician rated the participants total improvement whether or not it is due to study treatment. All responses were compared to the participants condition at Baseline (Day 0). Response choices included: 0 = not assessed; 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; and 7 = among the most extremely ill patients), with lower score indicating better improvement. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. MMRM analysis was performed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome - Quality of Life Scale (GTS-QOL) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The GTS-QOL is a disease-specific patient-reported scale for the measurement of health-related quality of life in participants with Tourette's Disorder, taking into account the complexity of the clinical picture of the disease. The questionnaire consists of a 27-item Tourette's Disorder-specific scale with 4 subscales (psychological, physical, obsessional, and cognitive). The GTS-QOL total score ranged from 0 (extremely dissatisfied with life) and 100 (extremely satisfied with life). A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement. MMRM analysis was performed.</description>

    <description>Aripiprazole was administered orally once a week (QW) for 8 weeks in a double-blind manner. Participants randomized to aripiprazole received aripiprazole tablets at a starting dose of 52.5 milligrams (mg) QW on Day 0. At Week 1, according to the investigator's discretion based on efficacy and tolerability, the dose of aripiprazole could remain at 52.5 mg QW or could be increased to 77.5 mg QW. The dose could be increased to 110 mg QW as early as Week 2. For the remainder of the study (up to Week 8), the dose was to be adjusted up and down among these three dose levels, as determined by the investigator.</description>

      <recruitment_details>A total of 152 participants were screened and 135 were randomized to the treatment. The randomized participants were recruited from 45 study sites in the following 6 countries: United States (US), Hungary, Canada, Taiwan, South Korea, and Mexico. Out of 135, 124 participants were included in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study consisted of a Pretreatment and Treatment Phase. The Pretreatment Phase consisted of a Screening Period, Washout Period (when applicable), and Baseline visit. This was followed by an 8-week Treatment Phase. There was also a Follow-up Period (30 days) for participants who did not roll over into the open-label study 31-10-274 (NCT01416441).</pre_assignment_details>

Participants randomized to aripiprazole received aripiprazole tablets at a starting dose of 52.5 milligrams (mg) QW on Day 0. At Week 1, according to the investigator's discretion based on efficacy and tolerability, the dose of aripiprazole could remain at 52.5 mg QW or could be increased to 77.5 mg QW. The dose could be increased to 110 mg QW as early as Week 2. For the remainder of the study (up to Week 8), the dose was to be adjusted up and down among these three dose levels, as determined by the investigator.</description>

This scale consisted of a tic inventory, with 5 separate rating scales to rate the severity of symptoms, and an impairment ranking. Ratings were made along 5 different dimensions on a scale of 0 to 5 for motor and vocal tics, each including number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference. The YGTSS TTS was the summation of the severity scores of motor and vocal tics. The total tic score (TTS) ranged from 0 (none) to 50 (severe) with higher score represent more severe symptoms.</description>

For the remainder of the study (up to Week 8), the dose was to be adjusted up and down among these three dose levels, as determined by the investigator.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) - Total Tic Score (TTS)</title>
          <description>The YGTSS is a semi-structured clinical interview designed to measure the tic severity. This scale consisted of a tic inventory, with 5 separate rating scales to rate the severity of symptoms, and an impairment ranking. Ratings were made along 5 different dimensions on a scale of 0 to 5 for motor and vocal tics, each including number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference. The YGTSS TTS was the summation of the severity scores of motor and vocal tics. The TTS ranged from 0 (none) to 50 (severe) with a higher score represent more severe symptoms (greater reduction from baseline for greater improvement). Mixed Effect Repeated Measure Model (MMRM) analysis was performed.</description>
