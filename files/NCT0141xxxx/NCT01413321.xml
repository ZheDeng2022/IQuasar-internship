    <textblock>
      Hemiparetic gait following acquired brain injury (ABI) is grossly characterized by decreased&#xD;
      speed of walking, increased stance time on the unaffected side, and decreased stance time on&#xD;
      the affected side.These abnormalities are associated with a complex pattern of dysfunction&#xD;
      including muscle weakness, spasticity, impaired sensory-motor control, long-term mechanical&#xD;
      changes in muscles and joints, and cognitive impairments e.g. attention.\ At this stage of&#xD;
      our knowledge it is still unclear which kinetic and kinematic parameters of hemiparetic gait&#xD;
      provide insight about the different components of the complex pattern of dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel technique had been introduced in the Motion Laboratory of the Sheba Medical Center&#xD;
      consisting of an ordinary treadmill that is equipped with a 'mat' of more than 5000&#xD;
      high-quality capacitive pressure/force sensors. This treadmill developed by &quot;ZEBRIS&quot; enables&#xD;
      to analyze gait and roll-off patterns on the treadmill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess variability of data derived from the Zebris treadmill.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate stability of hemiparetic gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate variability and relevant gait parameters taking place during recovery after&#xD;
           acute ABI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare gait on ground with gait on treadmill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of the study- Basic assumptions of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. No significant change in gait parameters is expected in both groups including healthy&#xD;
           controls and chronic ABI subjects in recurrent examination within one week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subacute ABI patients are found to be within the context of neurorehabilitative recovery&#xD;
           due to brain plasticity. Therefore a change in gait parameters is expected within two&#xD;
           consecutive examinations in the chosen time intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All measurements are subject to error which contributes to the variance of outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the grounds of these assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Two consecutive examinations in both groups including healthy controls and chronic ABI&#xD;
      subjects are intended to estimate the error in measured values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Two consecutive examinations in the subacute ABI patient group are intended to estimate&#xD;
      the contribution of neurorehabilitative recovery due to brain plasticity assessed with this&#xD;
      unique research instrumentation.&#xD;

      Introduction The term hemiplegia/hemiparesis is used for the neural deficit that may occur in&#xD;
      patients after acquired brain injury (ABI), such as cerebral palsy, traumatic injury to the&#xD;
      brain, or cerebrovascular accident. The word hemiplegia means the neuromuscular disorder that&#xD;
      involves one-half of the body in the frontal plane while the other half is not involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemiparetic gait following ABI is grossly characterized by decreased speed of walking,&#xD;
      increased stance time on the unaffected side, and decreased stance time on the affected side.&#xD;
      Joint-angle disturbances include reduction or loss of the knee flexion phase in stance,&#xD;
      reduction of knee flexion in the swing phase, sometimes loss of dorsiflexion of the ankle in&#xD;
      the swing phase and at initial contact, and generally reduced joint excursions. Lehmann et&#xD;
      all [1] have reported a greater-than-normal internal knee flexion moment at mid-stance in&#xD;
      persons with hemiplegia, a feature that was thought to be related to anterior movement of the&#xD;
      center of gravity. (&quot;Internal&quot; moments are expressed as those internal to the link-segment&#xD;
      model; &quot;external&quot; moments are expressed as those acting upon the link-segment model.) The&#xD;
      internal moment is usually the result of muscle activity, though tension of structures&#xD;
      posterior to the knee may also be involved if the knee is fully extended. Patients with&#xD;
      hemiplegia exhibit disturbed mechanical energy patterns and overall energy costs that are&#xD;
      above normal [2]. The affected limb characteristically has shown tonic extensor activity,&#xD;
      co-activation of major muscle groups, and loss of selective muscle control during stance [3].&#xD;
      The patterns of activity and the presence of co-activation during walking have been used to&#xD;
      classify the gait of subjects with hemiplegia [4]. Muscle power patterns at major lower-limb&#xD;
      joints during walking have been near normal in shape but reduced in amplitude, with the&#xD;
      muscles of the affected side providing about 40% of the positive work [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      These abnormalities are associated with a complex pattern of dysfunction including muscle&#xD;
      weakness, spasticity, impaired sensory-motor control and long-term mechanical changes in&#xD;
      muscles and joints [4], [6], [7], [8], [9], and cognitive impairments e.g. attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this stage of our knowledge it is still unclear which kinetic and kinematic parameters of&#xD;
      hemiparetic gait provide insight about the different components of the complex pattern of&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with hemiparesis will show different reactions to change pattern of the treadmill,&#xD;
      like gait velocity and inclination in comparison to healthy subjects. Especially performing&#xD;
      the investigation under these challenging conditions may reveal the relevant insight in the&#xD;
      contribution of these different components to the complex pattern of hemiparetic gait.&#xD;
      Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of gait performed during clinical examination and&#xD;
      gait examination in a gait laboratory deliver temporal and spatial parameters. These&#xD;
      parameters relate to automatism and symmetry which are the two main components of gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess variability of data derived from the Zebris (ZIT) device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate stability of hemiparetic gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate variability and relevant gait parameters taking place during recovery after&#xD;
           acute ABI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare gait on ground with gait on treadmill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: The population to be studied consists of the three following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 15 patients after subacute ABI, defined as the first 3 months after insult.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 15 patients with chronic ABI, defined as at least one year after the insult.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 15 age and gender matched healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrumentation-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. &quot;ZEBRIS - treadmill&quot; - The ZIT consists of an ordinary treadmill but is equipped with a&#xD;
           'mat' of more than 5000 high-quality capacitive pressure/force sensors (Fig. 1). The&#xD;
           instrument and the PC are linked via a USB interface. A dedicated program processes the&#xD;
           analog signals of the sensors (the vertical component of the ground reaction force) at a&#xD;
           frequency of 1000 Hz. Using a technology specially developed by ZEBRIS, the movement of&#xD;
           the treadmill is compensated so that completely stable gait and roll-off patterns can be&#xD;
           analyzed. The measurements are performed at the Motion Laboratory of the Sheba Medical&#xD;
           Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. GaitRite - An electronic walkway contains eight sensor pads encapsulated in a roll up&#xD;
           carpet to produce an active area 24 inches (61cm) wide and 192 inches (488cm) long. In&#xD;
           this arrangement the active area is a grid, 48 sensors by 384 sensors placed on .5 inch&#xD;
           (1.27 cm) centers, totaling 18,432 sensors. The walkway is portable, can be laid over&#xD;
           any flat surface, requires minimal setup and test time, and requires no placement of any&#xD;
           devices on the patient. As the patient ambulates across the walkway, the system captures&#xD;
           the geometry and the relative arrangement of each footfall as a function of time. The&#xD;
           application software controls the functionality of the walkway, processes the raw data&#xD;
           into footfall patterns, and computes the temporal (timing) and spatial (distance)&#xD;
           parameters. The software's relational database stores tests individually under each&#xD;
           patient, and supports a variety of reports and analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic data and data from the clinical examination using the NIH scale will be&#xD;
           collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants will walk at comfortable speed 4 sweeps on the GaitRite sensors mat, in&#xD;
           order to collect free (unconstrained) walking spatio-temporal parameters. Optimal&#xD;
           velocity will be determined using habitual conditions namely with shoes and AFO for&#xD;
           patients (in case it is used in routine circumstances) and with shoes for subjects.&#xD;
           Using a stopwatch, the comfortable walking speed will be calculated for a net distance&#xD;
           of 6 m.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Using the ZIT, patients and subjects will first be tethered by cables. Tests will be&#xD;
           conducted with subjects wearing everyday clothing and shoes. Those patients wearing AFO&#xD;
           will be tested with the device. Normal stance will be first assessed without shoes and&#xD;
           with and without visual feedback (EO, EC conditions). Then the paradigm of the gait on&#xD;
           the treadmill. Normal stance will be first assessed with shoes and with and without&#xD;
           visual feedback (EO, EC conditions). Then the paradigm of the gait on the treadmill&#xD;
           (based on [5] below).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. At this stage the treadmill motor will be initiated and the target speed reached within&#xD;
           10-20s. At the target speed (based on [2] above), subjects will spend 20s and then their&#xD;
           gait will be recorded at this sped for another 20s. Immediately following that, the&#xD;
           speed will be increased by 10% and if feasible to a total 20% of comfortable individual&#xD;
           speed during an epoch of 20s will be recorded. Following this epoch, treadmill speed&#xD;
           will be reduced to the targets and subjects will spend an additional 20s before raising&#xD;
           the front end of the platform by 3°. At this incline the subject will walk for 10-15s&#xD;
           and a final epoch of 20s, under these conditions will be recorded. Following this final&#xD;
           epoch, incline will be returned to horizontal and speed reduced to zero to allow the&#xD;
           subject to dismount the ZIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Walking on the treadmill can initially be an unfamiliar experience. Therefore, the data&#xD;
           collection will start as soon as he patient is comfortable with the set-up but not less&#xD;
           than 2 min after initiation of the test and after approximately six minutes of&#xD;
           familiarization time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timing - The normal controls group and chronic ABI hemiparetic subjects group will be tested&#xD;
      twice over a period of 2-7 days to establish measurement error (absolute reproducibility).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subacute ABI hemiparetic subjects group will be reassessed between 4 -6 weeks after the&#xD;
      1st data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Frame of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2nd and final Data collection will be performed after the 1st according to the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the normal control and chronic ABI hemiparetic subjects group between 2-7 days after&#xD;
           the 1st data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the subacute ABI hemiparetic subjects group between 4 -6 weeks after the 1st data&#xD;
           collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are expecting to finish the Data collection one year after the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be done up to 1 year after Data collection. Summarize of the study 6&#xD;
      months after Data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of any unexpected event during the study the NIH and local Helsinki committee will be&#xD;
      informed within two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of the study- Basic assumptions of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. No significant change in gait parameters is expected in both groups including healthy&#xD;
           controls and chronic ABI subjects in recurrent examination within on week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subacute ABI patients are found to be within the context of neurorehabilitative recovery&#xD;
           due to brain plasticity. Therefore a change in gait parameters is expected within two&#xD;
           consecutive examinations in the chosen time intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All measurements are subject to error which contributes to the variance of outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the grounds of these assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Two consecutive examinations in both groups including healthy controls and chronic ABI&#xD;
      subjects are intended to estimate the error in measured values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Two consecutive examinations in the subacute ABI patient group are intended to estimate&#xD;
      the contribution of neurorehabilitative recovery due to brain plasticity assessed with this&#xD;
      unique research instrumentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis - In general terms, the analysis will be based on a 2X2 design namely, between&#xD;
      subjects (ABI vs. normal) and within (bilateral) comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spatio-temporal parameters calculated from the force sensors will consist of those listed&#xD;
      in the report sheet (enclose a report).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The temporal parameters calculated from the ground reaction force in function of time are as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of stance phase (stance time) [tstance - s]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of swing phase (swing time) [tswing-s ]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of double support phase [tdouble-s]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  time of step [tstep - s]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spatial parameters calculated from temporal parameters and constant gait speed [vgait -&#xD;
      m/s] is as follows [16]:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cadence [c - step/minutes]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Step length [lstep - mm]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stride [length]). These are the commonly used parameters in all gait laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The footprint templates will be assessed for location of pressure prominent pressure foci and&#xD;
      their location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the ZIT software produces a ground force and pressure report as well as a&#xD;
      special representation of the movement trajectory of the center of pressure (COP) point&#xD;
      during the gait cycle. Due to its shape, this trajectory is known as the 'butterfly'. From&#xD;
      the butterfly, the area of the base of gait will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing will consist of descriptive and inferential statistics. In case of normal&#xD;
      distribution of the outcome parameters, a general 2X2 ANOVA will be carried out.&#xD;
