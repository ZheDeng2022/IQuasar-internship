  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  The primary objective of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
           alglucosidase alfa manufactured at the 4000 L scale in participants who had a confirmed&#xD;
           diagnosis of Pompe disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A secondary objective of this study was to evaluate and explore the relationship between&#xD;
           anti-recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase antibody titers and the PK of&#xD;
           alglucosidase alfa.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The total study duration per participant was 4 to 8 weeks that consisted of a screening&#xD;
      period (from 2 days to 4 weeks), treatment visit (1 day), and a follow up call (greater than&#xD;
      or equal to 30 days). Two participants enrolled prior to protocol amendment 2 (dated 17&#xD;
      December 2015), which changed the study to single-dose, and were treated for 26 weeks, with a&#xD;
      4-week follow up.&#xD;
