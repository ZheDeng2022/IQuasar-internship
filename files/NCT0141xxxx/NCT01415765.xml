  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - MLN4924 is an experimental cancer drug. It may help kill lymphoma cells and make them more&#xD;
      sensitive to chemotherapy. EPOCH R is a combination chemotherapy drug. It has been effective&#xD;
      in treating some cases of large B-cell lymphoma. This research will look at two things. The&#xD;
      first is the effect of MLN4924 on its own in treating large B-cell lymphoma. The second is&#xD;
      the safe dose and effect of MLN4924 and EPOCH-R in combination when treating large B-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study how MLN4924 affects large B-cell lymphoma tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the effects of MLN 4924 alone and MLN4924 plus standard EPOCH-R chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have large B-cell lymphoma that will be treated&#xD;
      with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will also&#xD;
           have blood and urine tests, tumor samples, and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive MLN4924 for a maximum of six 21-day cycles of treatment. Each&#xD;
           cycle involves a dose of MLN4924 twice a week for 2 weeks, followed by a 1-week rest&#xD;
           period. Participants will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who do not benefit from MLN4924 alone will have MLN4924 along with EPOCH-R&#xD;
           chemotherapy for up to six cycles of treatment.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) have been molecularly sub-classified into&#xD;
           germinal center like B-cell (GCB) and activated B-cell like (ABC) DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinically, the ABC subtype has a significantly higher rate of drug resistance and lower&#xD;
           survival. The ABC subtype has constitutive activation of the NF-KappaB pathway which may&#xD;
           account for the drug resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ability of NF-KappaB to inhibit responses to cancer therapeutic agents may also&#xD;
           contribute to the refractory clinical behavior of ABC subtype, and inhibition of&#xD;
           NF-KappaB can synergize with chemotherapy to kill tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Because a phase II randomized design is not clinically or technically practical at this&#xD;
           early stage to address the scientific endpoints, we have designed a novel endpoint based&#xD;
           on relative efficacy of DA-EPOCH-R + MLN 4924 (DA-EPOCH-RN) in ABC and GCB DLBCL. Based&#xD;
           on our study that shows that survival of relapsed ABC and GCB DLBCL are comparable and&#xD;
           poor following initial R-CHOP, we hypothesize that significantly improved survival of&#xD;
           ABC compared to GCB DLBCL after DA-EPOCH-RN is strongly indicative of preferential&#xD;
           activity of MLN4924 in ABC DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess response of MLN4924 in relapsed/refractory DLBCL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess toxicity and safe tolerated dose of MLN4924 and DA-EPOCH-R&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess difference in response (CR/PR) and OS in ABC and GCB DLBCL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relapsed/refractory de novo DLBCL greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No PMBL DLBCL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No patients with active CNS lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No pregnant or breast-feeding women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate organ function (as defined in protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a single center with a sequential treatment design. The study is divided into&#xD;
           two parts (A and B). Clinical end points are to assess the activity of MLN4924 alone&#xD;
           (Part A) and in combination with DA-EPOCH-R (Part B), and to assess the toxicity and MTD&#xD;
           of DA-EPOCH-RN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Part A, MLN4924 will be given alone for 6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Part B, MLN4924 will be initially escalated to determine the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
           (MTD) in combination with DA-EPOCH-R at dose levels (to be determined) and schedule&#xD;
           every 21 days. Responding or stable patients may receive up to 6 cycles of DAEPOCH-RN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be restaged every 2 cycles during treatment, and every 3, 4 and 6 months&#xD;
           during years one, two and three respectively, thereafter. Standard response criteria&#xD;
           will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total of 56 patients will be enrolled depending on the relative differences in&#xD;
           response observed between the ABC and GCB subtypes to MLN4924.&#xD;
