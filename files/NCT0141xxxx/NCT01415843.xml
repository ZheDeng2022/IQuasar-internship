  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first phase of a study that will investigate the effects that different&#xD;
      approaches to physiotherapy have on the expression of associated reactions. During this&#xD;
      phase, current practice among neuro-physiotherapists will be explored in relation to: the&#xD;
      learning strategies used in stroke rehabilitation, the common interventions used in gait&#xD;
      re-education, and the strategies adopted for the assessment and management of associated&#xD;
      reactions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Associated reactions are unintended and involuntary arm movements, normally seen as bending&#xD;
      of the wrist and elbow, that may occur after stroke when a person is doing something&#xD;
      effortful such as walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide an insight into the learning strategies used by physiotherapists during the&#xD;
           re-education of walking, including the verbal dialogue that takes place and any&#xD;
           preferences (overt or subconscious) adopted for one type of learning strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop and refine a description of what is meant by the term &quot;gait re-education&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide an insight into how therapists currently manage associated reactions&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase of the study will explore these objectives using direct non-participation&#xD;
      observation of a number of physiotherapy treatment sessions. This will provide an insight&#xD;
      into the nature of the therapy that takes place for retraining walking(e.g. the types of&#xD;
      exercises commonly used) and the nature of the learning strategies frequently adopted,&#xD;
      including the amount and content of explicit verbal instruction and feedback that is provided&#xD;
      to patients.&#xD;
