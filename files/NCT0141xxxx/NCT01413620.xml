  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Burned patients because of their increased oxidative stress have severely depleted vitamin E,&#xD;
      which is a dietary antioxidant. Oxidative stress is responsible for much of the&#xD;
      pathophysiology seen in burned patients, which leads to acute and chronic morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality, in addition to a decrease in their quality of life. Oral vitamin E will be used to&#xD;
      reverse the oxidative stress of burn injury and, in the process, decrease the secondary&#xD;
      consequences of thermal trauma. This proposal will demonstrate the benefit of maintaining&#xD;
      adequate vitamin E status.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We have previously demonstrated that thermal injury depletes plasma vitamin E in pediatric&#xD;
      burn patients. However, plasma changes reflect short-term vitamin E changes, whereas adipose&#xD;
      tissue alpha-tocopherol concentrations reflect long-term vitamin E status. We reported last&#xD;
      year that burn injury depleted vitamin E stores in adipose tissue in children by nearly half&#xD;
      within one month following injury. Our long-term goal is to improve the quality of life of&#xD;
      burn patients by preventing pulmonary and hepatic dysfunction that may occur from vitamin E&#xD;
      depletion. The objectives of this application are to a) attenuate alpha-tocopherol depletion&#xD;
      in burned patients by vitamin E supplementation, b) prevent or reverse oxidative stress in&#xD;
      these patients, and c) collect pilot data on the effect of vitamin E supplementation on lung&#xD;
      and liver function. Our central hypothesis is that the administration of high doses of&#xD;
      alpha-tocopherol will prevent or restore levels of vitamin E in adipose tissue and reverse&#xD;
      the oxidative state in burned patients. The rationale of the proposed studies is that in&#xD;
      severe cases of vitamin E depletion, oxidative stress, fatty liver and lung dysfunction have&#xD;
      all been reported in our patients. We will administer vitamin E supplements (300-1200 IU&#xD;
      RRR-alpha-tocopherol) to burn subjects (n= 20 per group, 6-70 years, â‰¥20% total body surface&#xD;
      burns) for fifteen days. The subjects will be randomly assigned into two groups: an early&#xD;
      treatment group who will receive vitamin E for days 1-15 of the study, and a delayed&#xD;
      treatment group who will receive vitamin E for days 16-30 of the study. Both groups will be&#xD;
      studied for a total of thirty days. We will test the following aims: Aim 1: determine the&#xD;
      degree that supplemental Vitamin E will attenuate alpha-tocopherol depletion. Aim 2:&#xD;
      determine if supplemental Vitamin E reduces markers of oxidative stress in burned patients.&#xD;
      Aim 3: collect preliminary data to establish the relationship between oxidative stress and&#xD;
      pulmonary pathophysiology and fatty liver after burn injury. We will measure plasma and&#xD;
      adipose tissue alpha-tocopherol and urinary and plasma markers of oxidative stress, prior to&#xD;
      supplementation and then weekly. The proposed research is innovative because the oxidative&#xD;
      stress of burn injury causes a severe depletion of an essential nutrient, vitamin E.&#xD;
      Supplementation of vitamin E is a novel concept that may mitigate the complications of burns,&#xD;
      including lung injury, fatty liver and peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
