  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Developed in the early 1970s, Fontan Operation has provided palliative care for patients with&#xD;
      single ventricle physiology. Single ventricle is a rare subclass of the atrioventricular (AV)&#xD;
      alignment abnormalities double inlet and common inlet ventricles (and rarely, straddling&#xD;
      tricuspid valve), in which there is only one ventricular sinus [1]. Most patients present&#xD;
      with symptoms of congestion , low cardiac output, and deep cyanosis immedietly after birth.&#xD;
      Untreated, these heart anomalies are highly lethal. Neonatal heart transplantation is&#xD;
      implacable because of shortage of donors. Fontan operation is a three staged palliative&#xD;
      procedure: the single ventricle pumping blood to the systemic circulation , while blood flows&#xD;
      laminarly to the lungs through direct anastomosis of the superior and inferior vena cavae&#xD;
      (total cavo pulmonary connections), inevitably by-passing the right heart .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This procedure has been shown to immediately correct the mixed venous blood dysfunction,&#xD;
      providing treatment for the prominent signs of cyanosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with its beneficial outcomes, Fontan circulation patients have been documented to have&#xD;
      a variety of post-operative late complications. Of most substantial, increased systemic&#xD;
      vascular resistance (mean of 10-15 mmHg higher) [2], systolic dysfunction as a result of&#xD;
      decreased preload and increase afterload [3], and atrial arrhythmias [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the advent of bypassing right-heart circulation with Fontan operation, the pulmonary&#xD;
      vascular bed is exposed to a new atmosphere of blood flow. Instead of physiological pulsatile&#xD;
      flow in normal circulation, the pulmonary vasculature is receiving slow velocity, laminar&#xD;
      flow [5]. Patients post-Fontan operations have been documented to have restrictive-type&#xD;
      pulmonary function, but still yet to be correlated with Fontan circulation or as a possible&#xD;
      result of prior lung tissue injury from the pre/intra-operation high volume blood flow.&#xD;
      Regardless, Fontan patients are described to have decreased pulmonary function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research effort is to document and analyze the pulmonary function of&#xD;
      those patients post-Fontan operation. It is still unclear as to what the long-term effects of&#xD;
      Fontan operation are towards the pulmonary vascular bed, leaving us questions about the&#xD;
      effects on lung capacities, ventilation-perfusion efficiency, and oxygen saturation.&#xD;

      Generation of Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Spirometry-Spirometry will be performed in accordance with ATS/ERS (American Thoracic&#xD;
           Society/ European Respiratory Society) Task Force using a KoKo spirometer (KoKo system,&#xD;
           PDS Inc., Ferraris Cardiopulmonary System Group; Louisville, CO, USA). Each maneuver&#xD;
           will be repeated for at least three technically acceptable FEFV curves; the best results&#xD;
           were used for analysis. [6]&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Whole Body Plethysmography- FRCpleth will be measured in a commercial, whole body ZAN500&#xD;
           constant volume body plethysmograph (ZAN-Messgeraete GmbH, Germany); the surrounded&#xD;
           glassed cabin of 980 L includes a chair with adjustable height, all meeting the ATS/ERS&#xD;
           recommendations for plethysmography measurements [7,8]. The flow, volume, cabin&#xD;
           pressure, and mouth pressures are automatically calibrated. BTPS conditions for lung&#xD;
           volumes are automatically corrected. According to the manufacturer, environmental&#xD;
           interference is automatically reduced by a numeric-drift-compensation, enabling quick&#xD;
           stable signals for immediate testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. MCT - Methacholine challenge tests will be performed in a designated room at the&#xD;
           Pediatric Pulmonary Unit, Meyer Children's Hospital, Haifa, Israel. MCT was performed&#xD;
           with double doses of fresh methacholine solutions in saline. Solutions were driven by&#xD;
           KoKo-PDS dosimeter via mouthpiece. The MCT will end when FEV1 dropped by more 20% from&#xD;
           baseline FEV1 values or when a methacholine concentration of 16 mg/ml was reached. The&#xD;
           exact PC20 value will be then calculated by the program according to the log-transformed&#xD;
           formula, as described in the guidelines for methacholine.[9] Airway hyper-reactivity was&#xD;
           defined as PC20 &lt;8 mg/ml. Oxygen saturation and heart rate were monitored by pulse&#xD;
           oximetry (Nonin Wrist Ox 3100, Nonin Medical, Inc., Plymouth, MN, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. FENO: Measurement of FENO will be performed by portable electrochemical analyzer NIOX&#xD;
           MINO (Aerocrine AB, Smidesvägen, Sweden),[10] and according to ATS recommendations . The&#xD;
           measurement procedure includes a deep inhalation to total lung capacity followed by&#xD;
           exhalation for 10 seconds at a mouth flow rate of 50 mL/sec and a pressure of 10&#xD;
           cmH2O.[11] Analysis of Data: Subjects of study will be patients post-Fontan operation&#xD;
           over the age of 6 years in order to fulfill the cooperation requirement necessary to&#xD;
           obtain data. Patients should be in general good health without any ongoing acute&#xD;
           pulmonary disease.&#xD;
