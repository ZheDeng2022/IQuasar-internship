      RATIONALE: Morphine may reduce pain in patients who have undergone radiofrequency ablation to&#xD;
      remove bone metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well morphine works after radiofrequency&#xD;
      ablation of painful bone metastases in patients with cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure the efficacy of morphine sulfate at 8 weeks after radiofrequency ablation (RFA)&#xD;
           of bone metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess minimum and average pain and analyze use of morphine sulfate before and after&#xD;
           RFA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine disease progression by CT scan of bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the percentage of relief associated with RFA, specifically patient&#xD;
           satisfaction, quality of life, anxiety, depression, and physical performance during RFA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess complications and side effects related to RFA and the evolution of possible side&#xD;
           effects associated with morphine sulfate therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete a pain questionnaire over 1 week before undergoing radiofrequency ablation&#xD;
      (RFA). Patients also complete questionnaires about pain, physical performance, quality of&#xD;
      life (QOL), and anxiety at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone metastases are removed by radiofrequency ablation (RFA). After surgery, patients receive&#xD;
      acetaminophen and patient-controlled analgesic (PCA) morphine sulfate. PCA morphine sulfate&#xD;
      continues with a dose increase of 50% bolus every 24 hours. Patients with maximum pain less&#xD;
      than or equal to that at inclusion receive standard morphine sulfate therapy instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data concerning the total dose of PCA morphine sulfate; minimum, average, and maximum pain&#xD;
      intensity; side effects and complications of RFA; and total dose of morphine sulfate (or&#xD;
      equivalent) is collected daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain is assessed at 4 and 8 weeks after RFA. Patients complete follow-up questionnaires about&#xD;
      physical performance, QOL, and anxiety at 12 weeks. Patients also undergo a CT scan at 12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Difference in maximum pain scores between inclusion and 2 months after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) according to an 11-point numerical scale&#xD;
Rate of patients with a decrease of two or more points in their most intense pain, 2 months after the radiofrequency ablation.&#xD;
This rate is calculated for the evaluable population for the principal outcome measure.&#xD;
This rate is equal to the ratio of the number of patients with a decrease of two or more points in their maximum pain divided by the size of the evaluable population.&#xD;
The response rate considered acceptable is 50%, above this threshold the treatment will be considered potentially effective and may be proposed in phase III.</description>

    <description>Difference in maximum pain scores between inclusion and 2 months after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) according to a discrete 11-points numerical scale.&#xD;
Increased/decreased pain is considered as a variation of at least one point on the numerical scale.&#xD;
If 25 patients or more are observed with pain reduction of 2 or more points, then the treatment will be considered potentially effective.</description>

        <description>According to a discrete 11-points numerical scale which ranges from 0 (low pain) to 11 (intense pain), intensity of pain (Minimum, Average, Maximum) has been evaluated at different time point between pre-selection and up to 3 months after radiofrequency.&#xD;
Assessment of intensity of pain has been done in this order at:&#xD;
Pre-selection visit: First algology assessment within a week (± 3 days) after the radiology consultation,&#xD;
Inclusion visit: Second algology assessment (One week after the first algology assessment)&#xD;
J-1: one day before radiofrequency&#xD;
J+1: One day after radiofrequency&#xD;
Discharge from hospital&#xD;
7 days after discharge from hospital&#xD;
1 month after radiofrequency&#xD;
2 months after radiofrequency&#xD;
3 months after radiofrequency&#xD;
Here, are presented only data collected at the pre-selection visit.</description>
