  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many children who catheterize their bladders because of spina bifida or other neurologic&#xD;
      disorders have bacteriuria. This can lead to urinary tract infections by bacteria from the&#xD;
      gut which colonize the vagina and are carried into the bladder during catheter passage. We&#xD;
      seek to test whether oral administration of probiotic bacteria can &quot;displace&quot; these&#xD;
      vagina-derived uropathogens and reduce or prevent bacteriuria in girls with spina bifida who&#xD;
      empty their bladders through catheterization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In children with spina bifida and neurogenic bladder dysfunction, the need for intermittent&#xD;
      bladder catheterization increases the risk of bacteriuria. In many patients, this leads to a&#xD;
      clinically significant urinary tract infection (UTI). Many of these children are placed on&#xD;
      long term, low dose antibiotic suppression to prevent recurrent urinary infection.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, bacteriuria often persists despite daily antibiotic therapy, and breakthrough&#xD;
      urinary tract infections are common. Furthermore, this approach carries the potential for&#xD;
      deleterious side effects, and may promote the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary tract infection in girls occurs when virulent bacteria migrate from the rectum and&#xD;
      colonize the vagina and peri-urethral mucosa, thus gaining access to the bladder. In girls&#xD;
      with spina bifida, access to the bladder is greatly facilitated by catheter passage.&#xD;
      Antibiotic prophylaxis relies on maintaining a low dose of antibiotic in the urinary stream,&#xD;
      which decreases peri-urethral colonization, and prevents proliferation of bacteria after they&#xD;
      gain access to the bladder. An alternative approach to daily antibiotic prophylaxis is to&#xD;
      decrease the risk of urinary colonization with virulent bacteria by supplementing the normal&#xD;
      bacteria flora with non-infection causing strains of bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotics are dietary supplements containing potentially beneficial bacterial strains such&#xD;
      as Lactobacillus. The safety of oral administration of probiotics has been demonstrated in&#xD;
      several studies over the last 30 years. Studies using L. rhamnosus GG, a probiotic introduced&#xD;
      in the late 1980s to alleviate diarrhea, have shown promising results when used for UTI&#xD;
      prevention. In one study, researchers found that the subjects consuming Lactobacillus GG&#xD;
      drinks had fewer episodes of UTI compared to those women not receiving probiotics. A&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study in premature infants also used L. rhamnosus GG in an attempt to&#xD;
      prevent UTI. The number of urinary infections was reduced but statistically the difference&#xD;
      was not significant. Finally, a recent randomized clinical trial demonstrated that the rate&#xD;
      of UTI in patients taking prophylactic antibiotics was similar to that of patients taking&#xD;
      Lactobacillus acidophilus alone. The efficacy of probiotic usage in the spina bifida&#xD;
      population has not been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective is to determine whether over the course of 3 months, probiotics can reduce&#xD;
      preexisting or new bacteriuria in girls with spina bifida who perform clean intermittent&#xD;
      catheterization for bladder emptying. We will also attempt to ascertain whether changes in&#xD;
      bacteriuria are associated with vaginal colonization by the administered probiotics.&#xD;
