      This research is being done to find out the best way to give narcotics for pain relief in&#xD;
      adults with sickle cell disease and painful crisis. This study is a comparison of two ways of&#xD;
      giving narcotics. The first way is what occurs now in the Emergency Acute Care Unit (EACU)&#xD;
      where patients are given a single intravenous (iv) dose of a narcotic which is repeated by&#xD;
      the nurse as needed to control the pain. The second way is to provide a single iv dose of&#xD;
      narcotic and then allow the patient to push a button and receive one or more additional doses&#xD;
      of narcotic when he/she thinks it is needed. Our hypothesis is that PCA will be a more&#xD;
      effective way of controlling pain.&#xD;
