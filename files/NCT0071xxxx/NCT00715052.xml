      INTRODUCTION Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      worldwide. Due to improvements in emergency medical care, transportation and specialized&#xD;
      trauma facilities, the number of people surviving TBI with impairment has significantly&#xD;
      increased in recent years. The long term cognitive sequelae, which are often not visible&#xD;
      persist far beyond the resolution of the obvious physical disabilities. This combined with&#xD;
      the relatively low awareness of the general public has designated TBI as the &quot;silent&#xD;
      epidemic&quot; (TBI CDC 2006). Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been suggested as a possible&#xD;
      treatment modality for these cases and preliminary studies are promising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of HBOT in the treatment of&#xD;
      chronic mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI). Sequential SPECT scans of the brain and&#xD;
      neurocognitive testing will be used to evaluate cerebral blood flow (CBF) response, cognitive&#xD;
      and functional improvement following treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) Traumatic brain injuries are a major cause of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality leading to major long term consequences on both a personal and national level with&#xD;
      an estimated 5.3 million Americans suffering from permanent TBI related disabilities (24).The&#xD;
      prevalence of traumatic brain injury in the United States is estimated to be approximately&#xD;
      1.5 million individuals per year (24,25). This however does not include those individuals who&#xD;
      did not receive care in a facility included in national surveillance systems or received no&#xD;
      medical care at all and thus probably significantly underestimates the actual number of TBI&#xD;
      victims. The 2006 NIH consensus states a prevalence of 2.5 - 6 million people per year suffer&#xD;
      form TBI(23).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to improvements in emergency medical care, transportation and specialized trauma&#xD;
      facilities, the number of people surviving TBI with impairment has significantly increased in&#xD;
      recent years. The long term consequences of TBI are vast, affecting a large number of people&#xD;
      with a substantial effect on the patients themselves, their families and society as a whole.&#xD;
      These injuries also impart a significant economic burden on those involved, both personally&#xD;
      and as a society. Approximately 80,000 - 90,000 individuals suffer from long term&#xD;
      disabilities annually, and the estimated costs including both direct medical care and&#xD;
      indirect expenses such as lost earning potential were over 60 million dollars in 2001 in the&#xD;
      US (28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long term sequelae of TBI may include impairment of the individuals physical, cognitive&#xD;
      and psychosocial functioning. The neurological consequences are numerous and complex&#xD;
      affecting various sites and functions. Sensory, motor and autonomic systems may all be&#xD;
      affected and symptoms may include headaches, seizures, visual defects, movement disorders and&#xD;
      sleep disorders. The cognitive consequences likewise are broad and varied. Amongst the&#xD;
      symptoms most commonly noted are memory deficits and problems with attention and&#xD;
      concentration. There may be impaired executive function, problem solving abilities and&#xD;
      language difficulties as well as problems with planning, information processing, judgment and&#xD;
      insight. While some of these symptoms may be apparent immediately after the injury, others&#xD;
      may present days, weeks or months after the initial trauma(Kushner,24). Moreover, there can&#xD;
      be vast fluctuations and changes in the severity and presentation over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another realm of difficulties resulting from TBI includes behavioral, emotional and&#xD;
      psychological impairments. There can be vast personality changes including loss or decreased&#xD;
      ability to initiate responses and activities, disinhibition, impulsivity, aggressive&#xD;
      behaviors - both verbal and physical, and changes in sexual behavior. Personality and mood&#xD;
      disorders may appear and depression, anxiety and changes in emotional control are often noted&#xD;
      after TBI.(23) The social consequences may also be widespread and often devastating. There is&#xD;
      an increased incidence of divorce, chronic unemployment, suicide and substance abuse&#xD;
      following TBI. Even in the more chronic stages as the patient is in the recovery stage, the&#xD;
      increased demands placed on him in the workplace or upon undertaking new tasks may uncover&#xD;
      problems with executive functions and planning abilities that had as of yet been unnoticed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These problems and the burden of caring for these individuals on a long term basis place&#xD;
      cumulative strains on the family and their support network. Family members and care givers&#xD;
      report an increased occurrence of depression, anger and social isolation. These combine to&#xD;
      result in disrupted family functioning and relationships and these problems may persist or&#xD;
      worsen with time.(24)&#xD;
&#xD;
      HBO for TBI Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) has been in use since the 1930's when it was&#xD;
      initially used for decompression sickness. Shortly thereafter physicians started usingHBOT&#xD;
      for a variety of other conditions. The use of HBOT for neurological indications started in&#xD;
      the early 1960s with the work by Smith et al showing its protective effect in cerebral&#xD;
      ischemia and that of Saltzman showing effectiveness in stroke patients.(Jain) HBOT is the&#xD;
      inhalation of 100% oxygen at pressures exceeding 1 atmospheres absolute (ATA) in order to&#xD;
      enhance the amount of oxygen dissolved in the blood and body fluids, thereby allowing for&#xD;
      increased oxygen delivery to the tissues. The mechanism by which HBOT is thought to improve&#xD;
      the outcome of brain injury is multifaceted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Neubauer and Walker(2000) theory postulates that HBOT improves cerebral metabolism by&#xD;
      improving functioning of the dormant neurons and stimulating axonal growth (10). Zhang et al&#xD;
      suggest that potential targets of oxygen therapy include prevention of apoptosis, inhibition&#xD;
      of neuroinflammation and BBB damage (Zhang pathophysiology 2005,Rossignol). There is&#xD;
      stimulation of angiogenesis and neovascularization, as well as direct effects on blood&#xD;
      vessels in the brain, and maintenance of BBB integrity. (1((5-12)),20) . Similarly, SPECT&#xD;
      scans have demonstrated a positive effect on the cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the damaged&#xD;
      brain following HBOT (2,8,10,16,19,17,neubauer HBOT of closed head,20,). HBOT also brings&#xD;
      about improved neurocognitive functioning in patients suffering from chronic brain injury.&#xD;
      (14,9,6,13,20,21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under normobaric conditions, the amount of oxygen dissolved in the blood is only 0.3 ml/dl.&#xD;
      At 1.5 ATA this amount increases 10 fold to 3.2 ml/dl. Using an animal model of brain injured&#xD;
      mice Daughrty et al (rockswall 9) found a 250% increase in the local brain tissue oxygen&#xD;
      levels between 100% oxygen administered at 1 ATA (103 mmHg) as opposed to that given at 1.5&#xD;
      ATA (247 mmHg). This seems to suggest that the this dissolved O2 is more readily available to&#xD;
      the brain tissue than hemoglobin bound oxygen (20). Additionally, work by several&#xD;
      investigators seems to indicate that HBOT allows for more efficient use of baseline oxygen&#xD;
      levels by injured brain tissue following treatments, which in turn leads to a positive&#xD;
      persistent affect on this tissue (20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been theorized that following brain injury from any cause, there is an area of &quot;idling&#xD;
      neurons&quot; in the ischemic penumbra zone which are still viable and potentially salvageable if&#xD;
      given the right treatment. This area consists of dormant neurons between the areas of dead&#xD;
      tissue and the unaffected healthy tissue surrounding it. .(2,16,17,18,19,jain,22). There&#xD;
      appears to be sufficient oxygen available to these cells to maintain cell life and ion pump&#xD;
      mechanisms, but not enough to generate action potentials and allow them to act as functioning&#xD;
      neurons (17,19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hyperoxia from HBOT causes vasoconstriction of the cerebral blood vessels which has been&#xD;
      shown to cause a decrease in brain edema and ICP (11,13,6,7,12 fr rockswald ). This&#xD;
      vasoconstriction does not appear to have any harmful affect on the brain tissue due to the&#xD;
      greatly increased oxygen availability to the tissue. There is also a beneficial effect effect&#xD;
      on the BBB, evidence by reduce post ischemic BBB permeability defect (jaine,veltkamp,&#xD;
      rockswald 52,55,63).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are well documented animal models of TBI and a growing body of literature using HBOT on&#xD;
      these animal models verifying the above stated hypotheses and findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sun et al demonstrated improved penumbral oxygenation following HBO treatment in focal&#xD;
      ischemia using an animal model by measuring both extrinsic and intrinsic markers of hypoxia&#xD;
      (SUN). Harch et al used a rat model of TBI to evaluate HBO effects on spatial learning and&#xD;
      memory, as well as it's affect on blood vessel density. After receiving a unilateral cortical&#xD;
      contusion, Long-Evans rats were tested in the Morris Water Task (MWT) 31-33 days post injury.&#xD;
      The rats were divided into an untreated control group, a sham-treated normobaric air group&#xD;
      and an HBO group which received 80 bid treatments of HBO at 1.5 ATA/90 mins. The rats were&#xD;
      subsequently retested in the MWT and then euthanized. Blood vessel density was measured&#xD;
      bilaterally in the hippocampus and correlated with the MWT performance. The HBOT caused a&#xD;
      significant increase in the hippocampal vascular density (p&lt; 0.001) and an associated&#xD;
      significant improvement in spatial learning (p&lt; 0.001) compared to the control groups.&#xD;
      Similarly, the increased vascular density and the improved MWT in the HBOT group were highly&#xD;
      correlated (p&lt;0.001). (11)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECT for investigation and follow up Single photon emission CT (SPECT) scans have been found&#xD;
      to be effective in evaluating post traumatic lesions in mTBI patients and are useful as a&#xD;
      means of follow up of recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective study to evaluate the usefulness of SPECT scans in the diagnosis of patients&#xD;
      with mTBI and it's correlation with common clinical symptoms such as post concussion syndrome&#xD;
      (PCS), post traumatic amnesia (PTA) and loss of consciousness (LOC), Gawda et al found&#xD;
      perfusion abnormalities in 63% of the patients. This as opposed to positive CT findings in&#xD;
      only 34% of these patients. In adults, the frontal lobe was most commonly affected whereas&#xD;
      the temporal lobes were more likely to be involved in children. The SPECT scan was found to&#xD;
      be more sensitive than CT in patients presenting with LOC, PTA and PCS (14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Jacobs et al evaluated the predictive value of SPECT scans for clinical outcome of 136 mTBI&#xD;
      patients in a prospective study. None of the patients had abnormal findings on CT. All&#xD;
      patients underwent initial SPECT scans and CT scans within 4 wks of the trauma. Follow up&#xD;
      evaluations were performed 3, 6, and 12 months post injury. All patients with abnormal SPECT&#xD;
      studies or deteriorating clinical findings had follow up SPECT scans performed at the&#xD;
      subsequent time of evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial SPECT was positive in 54% of the patients with a gradual decrease in the number&#xD;
      of positive scans over time. The clinical normalization occurred more rapidly than did the&#xD;
      normalization of the imaging studies. The SPECT was shown to have high sensitivity and&#xD;
      negative predictive value from 3 months post injury onward so that a negative early SPECT is&#xD;
      a reliable criteria in the exclusion of clinical sequelae. A positive initial SPECT scan did&#xD;
      not exclude a positive clinical outcome, however, a positive SPECT scan at 12 months post&#xD;
      injury was a reliable predictor for clinical outcome (13). Golden et al showed improved blood&#xD;
      flow as measured by sequential SPECT studies in 50 patients with chronic neurological&#xD;
      disorders (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SHI Xiao -yan presented a large study of 310 patients in which the effect of HBOT on CBF as&#xD;
      well as the usefulness of SPECT in the diagnosis and assessment of neurocognitive disorders&#xD;
      following TBI was examined. Pre and post treatment scans were compared and the percent of&#xD;
      positive initial SPECT scans was substantially higher than those found with CT alone (81.3%&#xD;
      vs. 15.2%). Following HBOT 63.5% of the SPECT scans had normalized concomitant with marked&#xD;
      improvement of the clinical symptoms of headache, dizziness, poor concentration and poor&#xD;
      memory. An additional 36.5% of the initial positive SPECT scans showed between 33-66%&#xD;
      improvement in CBF along with clinical improvement as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed Study Design Sixty consenting TBI patients at any age who are at least one year post&#xD;
      injury with stable cognitive deficits will be recruited. Any patient with previous&#xD;
      neurological deficits, head trauma or substance abuse will be excluded as well as anyone with&#xD;
      any contraindications for HBOT. All patients or their trustees will sign written informed&#xD;
      consent before their inclusion and the study protocol will be approved by the local Helsinki&#xD;
      committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be excluded if they will have one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Had been treated with HBOT for any indiction prior to their inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Have any other indication for HBOT&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Chest pathology incompatible with pressure changes&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Inner ear disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients suffering from claustrophobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Inability to give written informed consent by the patient or his trustee. A complete&#xD;
           history including medical and concurrent medications will be recorded. Patients will&#xD;
           undergo evaluation of activities of daily living (ADL), physical examination,&#xD;
           neurocognitive testing and SPECT scan will be performed at baseline. Mild traumatic&#xD;
           brain injury will be defined according to the 1993 American Congress of Rehabilitation&#xD;
           Medicine definition as a head trauma with loss of consciousness lasting less than 30&#xD;
           minutes, a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) score of 13 or more, and posttraumatic amnesia&#xD;
           lasting less than 24 hours. (Kay et al).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomly assigned to two groups. Group I will initially receive 40&#xD;
      consecutive HBOT treatments and Group II no HBOT treatment. At the end of this first phase of&#xD;
      approximately two months, both groups will be revaluated with a second SPECT scan and&#xD;
      neurocognitive testing. There will then be a cross over of the two groups and Group II&#xD;
      (previously none treated) will receive HBOT treatment while Group I (previously treated) will&#xD;
      not receive any further treatments. Again at the end of this second phase there will be&#xD;
      follow up SPECT scans and neurocognitive testing for both groups. Additionally at the end of&#xD;
      each phase there will be a detailed questioner assessing adverse effects and evaluating any&#xD;
      changes in ADL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be an evaluation of the results after the first phase comparing the differences&#xD;
      between the treated and non treated groups as well as allowing for evaluation of any&#xD;
      spontaneous changes occurring in the non treated group due to the passage of time or a&#xD;
      learning curve for the cognitive evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of the second phase there will be another evaluation of the results&#xD;
      comparing the effect of HBOT on Group II as compared to their baseline as well as evaluating&#xD;
      whether the effects seen in Group I are maintained after two months with no treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HBOT treatment will consist of 40 consecutive one hour treatments at 1.5 ATA with 100% O2&#xD;
      in either a multiplace or monoplace unit per patient preference. The treatments will be given&#xD;
      once daily five times a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis This is a pilot randomized crossover study. The sample size of 30&#xD;
      patients in each subgroup (total 60 patients) in the post ischemic stroke as well as in the&#xD;
      post hemorrhagic stroke was determined in order to achieve 90% power based on the following&#xD;
      assumption related to the expected change in neurologic evaluation: mean difference between&#xD;
      the groups of at least 25% with drop rate of 16% and alpha 5% before the cross match period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using the statistical software SPSS-version 13.&#xD;
      Parametric data will be expressed as means ± standard deviations and compared by one way&#xD;
      ANOVA. Non-parametric data will be compared using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Differences&#xD;
      between the results yielding p values less than 0.05 (p&lt;0.05) will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
