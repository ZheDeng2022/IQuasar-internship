      The purpose of this project is to establish a Center of Excellence in Research on Obesity&#xD;
      that will focus on severe obesity. The prevalence of severe obesity (i.e., Class 2 and 3&#xD;
      obesity; body mass index &gt; 35 kg/m2 and 40 kg/m2) is increasing more rapidly than is&#xD;
      overweight and Class 1 obesity. Treatment guidelines for severe obesity are uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three novel hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of severe obesity will be tested: a) using&#xD;
      non-invasive methods to measure energy expenditure; b) conducting an annotated lipomic search&#xD;
      for bio-markers of impaired fat oxidation; and c) examining the role of obesity-induced&#xD;
      inflammation as a cause for leptin resistance. Responses will also be measured following&#xD;
      intervention with diet and activity.&#xD;

      SPECIFIC AIMS The first specific aim is to examine mechanisms for the pathogenesis of severe&#xD;
      obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is a heterogeneous and complex metabolic disorder. The pathogenesis of obesity&#xD;
      remains obscure and it is unclear why some individuals are prone to severe obesity. It is&#xD;
      also unclear why there are ethnic and racial differences for severe obesity. Many scientists&#xD;
      postulate that metabolic vulnerabilities for obesity can be identified in the severely obese.&#xD;
      The 1st specific aim examines the pathogenesis of severe obesity with three research&#xD;
      protocols applied within the same cohort of research participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. energy expenditure. Some prior studies indicate lower rates of resting energy&#xD;
           expenditure (REE) in African-Americans, posing a metabolic risk for weight gain and&#xD;
           resistance to weight loss. Other recent work highlights an important role for&#xD;
           non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) in the pathogenesis of obesity. There are&#xD;
           limited data addressing energy expenditure in severe obesity. In 120 severely obese&#xD;
           adults (50% Class II and 50% Class III; with 50% African American participation), energy&#xD;
           expenditure will be studied at baseline and after 6 months of intervention. The&#xD;
           doubly-labeled water method will be used to measure total daily energy expenditure&#xD;
           (TEE). Indirect calorimetry will be used to measure resting metabolic rate (RMR).&#xD;
           Physical activity will be measured using light-weight, wearable monitors. NEAT will be&#xD;
           calculated using these measurements. Comparisons will be between the groups with Class&#xD;
           II and III obesity with further analysis for effects of ethnicity. These findings will&#xD;
           be compared to data obtained in lean control subjects. The effect of intervention will&#xD;
           be examined. This cohort will have a 1 year intensive behavioral weight loss&#xD;
           intervention. Half of the volunteers will be randomized to a combined diet and exercise&#xD;
           intervention (DE) , and the others will be randomized to diet intervention only for the&#xD;
           initial 6 months, adding the exercise component at 6 months (DE-DELAY).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. impaired capacity for fat oxidation. In these participants, a drop of blood will be&#xD;
           obtained at baseline and 6 months, for a low-cost, high throughput, yet highly detailed&#xD;
           tandem mass spectroscopy profile of plasma levels of acylcarnitines. Elevated levels&#xD;
           will denote disorders of fatty acid oxidation and selective increase in specific&#xD;
           acylcarnitine species will denote particular enzymatic loci of impairment. This aim&#xD;
           derives from rapid recent progress in two parallel field of metabolic investigation. One&#xD;
           of these is the field of &quot;inborn errors of metabolism&quot;, a field generally applied to&#xD;
           newborns and children. In this field there has been a rapid increase during the past&#xD;
           decade in recognizing and delineating in-born errors of fatty acid oxidation. Profiling&#xD;
           plasma levels of acylcarnitine species is a standard diagnostic approach. In obesity&#xD;
           research, a strong body of data have been developed during the same interval that one of&#xD;
           the key metabolic impairments is mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced capacity for&#xD;
           fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle. Racial differences in muscle oxidative capacity&#xD;
           have been reported, with lower values for oxidative capacity in AA women,&#xD;
           characteristics postulated to be a metabolic risk factor for obesity. We propose&#xD;
           inter-action of these two lines of investigation, exploring the utility of tandem mass&#xD;
           spectroscopy screening for plasma acylcarnitines as a non-invasive probe of metabolic&#xD;
           impairments in the severely obese.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. leptin resistance. The third protocol to be used in this group of severely obese&#xD;
           concerns a novel concept for leptin resistance. A decade ago, the discovery of leptin&#xD;
           was pivotal in renewing scientific interest in obesity. Leptin modulates appetite and&#xD;
           energy expenditure, two processes fundamental to weight regulation. Yet, treatment of&#xD;
           obesity with leptin has failed to meet expectations. This has been attributed to &quot;leptin&#xD;
           resistance&quot;. This protocol will examine the role of serum leptin interacting proteins&#xD;
           (SLIPs) that bind leptin as a factor contributing to leptin resistance. This line of&#xD;
           basic science research indicates that one of the SLIPs is C-reactive protein (CRP) which&#xD;
           suggests that low-grade inflammation, a metabolic complication of obesity related to&#xD;
           risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) may also contribute to the pathogenesis of&#xD;
           obesity. There are common themes in these three protocols that form Specific Aim 1. Each&#xD;
           addresses an aspect of the regulation of energy expenditure and fat oxidation. Each has&#xD;
           the potential to identify novel bio-markers. Each project employs state-of-the-art&#xD;
           analytical procedures, yet uses only minimally invasive sample collections. Finally,&#xD;
           each will be carried out in the full research cohort of Phase 1, at baseline and during&#xD;
           intervention, comparing metabolic effects of DE versus DE-DELAY. Though physical&#xD;
           activity may be more important for weight loss maintenance than induction of weight&#xD;
           loss, it has been found to increase capacity for fat oxidation more than weight loss&#xD;
           induced by diet. It is from this latter perspective that we are interested in&#xD;
           comparisons of DE and DE-DELAY at 6 months using these metabolic parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2nd specific aim is to develop an effective intervention for the severely obese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Axiomatic in the contemporary approaches to treatment of obesity is that clinically&#xD;
      significant benefits are obtained with modest weight loss. This principle underlies the&#xD;
      consensus recommendations for a weight loss target of 5 to 10% for overweight and obese&#xD;
      individuals. The 2nd specific aim is to implement a behavioral dietary and physical activity&#xD;
      intervention and assess whether this achieves a target weight loss at 1 year of â‰¥ 7% in Class&#xD;
      II and Class III obese research participants. 120 adults, as described above, will have a 1&#xD;
      year intervention. Intervention to increase physical activity in the severely obese may be&#xD;
      particularly challenging. Possibly this is easier after a period of weight loss. The staging&#xD;
      of diet and physical activity (DE versus DEDELAY) will examine this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3rd specific aim is to assess the effect of intervention on adverse health risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical rational for weight loss and physical activity is to improve health and&#xD;
      ameliorate adverse effects of obesity. The 3rd specific aim is to assess the impact of&#xD;
      intervention in the Phase 1 cohort. A panel of standardized clinical measurements, laboratory&#xD;
      tests, and self-report instruments will be performed at baseline, 6 months and 1 year. We&#xD;
      will examine: 1) traditional cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. hypertension, dyslipidemia,&#xD;
      glucose and insulin, along with other endocrine measurements); 2) markers of inflammation,&#xD;
      adipokines and cytokines; 3) body composition and regional distribution of adipose tissue; 4)&#xD;
      functional status (a timed 400 meter corridor walk); 5) sub-clinical vascular disease (pulse&#xD;
      wave velocity and carotid ultrasound); 7) health history and use of medications; and 8)&#xD;
      demographic indices, social and neighborhood factors, quality of life, impact of obesity, and&#xD;
      self-perception of body image and discrimination. One line of inquiry concerns the role of&#xD;
      baseline characteristics in accounting for heterogeneity between individuals in adverse&#xD;
      effects of severe obesity. The second line of inquiry is to assess the impact of intervention&#xD;
      to change these parameters.&#xD;
