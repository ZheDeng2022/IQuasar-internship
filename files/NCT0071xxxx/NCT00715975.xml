      The Psoriasis and a chronic dermatosis characterized by abnormal proliferation of cells&#xD;
      epithelial, vessel dilation and inflammation locally, which presents erythematous-scaly&#xD;
      lesions in various areas of the body, preferably in the scalp, region and religious joints as&#xD;
      elbows and knees. It occurs equally in both sexes and can appear at any age, and the mean age&#xD;
      for the onset of the disease and around 27.3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The halobetasol propionate and an ultra-potent corticoid. Its chemical structure and similar&#xD;
      to the Clobetasol corticoid this, until then classified as the most potent corticoid used&#xD;
      worldwide in clinical practice. However, the molecular structure of Halobetasol gives it&#xD;
      increased its activity antiinflammatory and anti-proliferative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of the drug&#xD;
      Halobetasol propionate cream formulation as a treatment in patients with plaque psoriasis&#xD;
      mild to moderate, compared to the substance of similar power, Clobetasol propionate - Psorex&#xD;
      - Cream.&#xD;

      The patients eligible will be informed about the procedures of the study and that agree to&#xD;
      participate and sign the TCLE will be initially evaluated clinically for the clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis of psoriasis plate with mild and moderate involvement of up to 20% of body surface.&#xD;
      After the procedures for selection (initial clinical evaluation and verification of the&#xD;
      criteria for inclusion and exclusion) the patients will be photographed, receive treatment&#xD;
      and will be targeted and to manage it in proper way and standardized, when they do so at&#xD;
      home. In each return (after 7, 14 days) will be held photographs of injuries, clinical&#xD;
      examination, evaluation of adverse events and dispensing of medicine to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs dispensed will be sufficient for daily use until the next return. The product will&#xD;
      be applied once a day, during night, preferably after the bath. The follow-up visits will&#xD;
      occur in times of 07 and 14 days after the start of treatment. If there is complete improves&#xD;
      the disease, treatment is interrupted before this date. On each visit will be examined by&#xD;
      clinical parameters validated scales of assessment internationally (PASI), which provide the&#xD;
      exact data of changes in the framework of each patient in each parameter measured. As&#xD;
      parameters of the tolerability will be evaluated frequency and intensity of adverse events&#xD;
      and the potential of irritative formulations, will be held photo of patients and&#xD;
      questionnaires of cosmeticidade the formulation. Patients will be geared not to expose to the&#xD;
      sun during the treatment period. At the end of the study, patients who present evolution will&#xD;
      be full of injuries released the study and those who are still with obvious symptoms have&#xD;
      treatment interrupted because of the risk of prolonged use of the drug under study. These&#xD;
      patients will be referred to the Health Service for maintenance treatment with a new therapy.&#xD;
      The patients who are released and make recurrence of the disease due to the rebound effect&#xD;
      will be&#xD;
