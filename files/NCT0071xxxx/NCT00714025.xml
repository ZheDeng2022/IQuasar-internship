      An open-label, single arm, non-randomized, single stage phase II study. 3 phases:Baseline,&#xD;
      treatment/duration and Follow-up. All patients will be treated with RAD001 10 mg daily dose&#xD;
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity death, or discontinuation from the study,&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, single arm, non-randomized, single stage phase II study. Baseline phase:&#xD;
      Baseline evaluations will be performed within 2 weeks before the first dose study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment phase/duration of treatment: All patients will be treated with RAD001 10mg PO daily&#xD;
      dose until disease progression (by RECIST) or unacceptable toxicity death or discontinuation&#xD;
      from the study for any other reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up phase: All patients will have a follow-up visit scheduled 28 days after the last&#xD;
      dose of the study drug to follow for AEs and SAEs that may have occured after discontinuation&#xD;
      from the study. Any patient who is discontinued from treatment with RAD001 for any reason&#xD;
      other than disease progression will continue to have tumor assessments until the patient has&#xD;
      documented disease progression or start of additional anti-tumor therapy. Central radiology&#xD;
      review and survival data collection will be performed. After discontinuation of RAD001 all&#xD;
      patients will be followed up for survival until the final OS analysis is performed.&#xD;
