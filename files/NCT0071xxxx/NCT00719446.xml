  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe lung condition that causes respiratory failure. The ARDS&#xD;
      Network (ARDSNet) is a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-sponsored network that is&#xD;
      focused on improving treatments for people with ALI and a similar condition called acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This study will evaluate participants who were enrolled&#xD;
      in one of three ARDSNet studies to examine how the treatments carried out in the prior&#xD;
      studies affect participants' long-term health outcomes and quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ALI, a life-threatening condition that involves inflammation of the lungs and fluid&#xD;
      accumulation in the air sacs, typically leads to low blood oxygen levels and respiratory&#xD;
      failure. Common causes of ALI include pneumonia, sepsis, and lung trauma. Symptoms, including&#xD;
      breathing difficulty, low blood pressure, and organ failure, usually develop within 24 to 48&#xD;
      hours of the original injury or illness. Most patients require immediate care in an intensive&#xD;
      care unit (ICU), and the main form of treatment is mechanical ventilation, which delivers&#xD;
      oxygen and a continuous level of pressure to the damaged lungs. The ARDS Network (ARDSNet) is&#xD;
      a group of hospitals and medical centers that conduct research to improve treatment options&#xD;
      for people with ARDS and ALI. This study will enroll people who participated in the ARDSNet's&#xD;
      ALTA, OMEGA, EDEN, or SAILS study; these studies are investigating new treatments to improve&#xD;
      survival and reduce the amount of time people remain on mechanical ventilation in the ICU&#xD;
      after ALI. It is not known whether the ARDSNet's treatments have any prolonged benefit for&#xD;
      patients after they leave the hospital. The purpose of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      participants' quality of life and long-term health outcomes after they receive the ALTA,&#xD;
      OMEGA, EDEN, or SAILS study treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll participants who were in the ALTA, OMEGA, EDEN, or SAILS study. ARDS&#xD;
      Network trial participants from sites that approved this follow-up study will be contacted by&#xD;
      phone at 6 and 12 months to complete a collection of surveys. These surveys assess quality of&#xD;
      life, mental health, memory and cognition, physical functioning, fatigue, employment and&#xD;
      health insurance status, and health care utilization. At the end of each follow-up,&#xD;
      participants will be asked for feedback regarding their experience during the follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants from a sub-set of ARDS Network study sites participating in this study,&#xD;
      researchers will review participants' medical records and information collected during the&#xD;
      ARDSNet studies. Six and 12 months after ALI, participants will attend study visits at which&#xD;
      time walking ability, lung function, and muscle strength will be measured. Weight, dietary&#xD;
      changes, and changes in muscle and fat composition will also be assessed. Participants will&#xD;
      take part in interviews to evaluate memory and cognition. If participants cannot attend the&#xD;
      study visits, research staff will either visit participants' homes to complete the&#xD;
      evaluations or conduct some of the evaluations over the phone.&#xD;
