  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to determine whether a specific immune microenvironment in the&#xD;
      primary tumor is associated with a favorable clinical course after nephrectomy and in the&#xD;
      absence of adjuvant treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a tumor with clinically apparent immunologic phenomena, such as&#xD;
      response to immunotherapies (interferon, interleukin-2, immune cellular therapy etc),&#xD;
      spontaneous regression, and sometimes indolent behaviour. Nephrectomy itself influences the&#xD;
      prognosis of advanced RCC patients as shown in 2 randomised trials, and could have an immune&#xD;
      basis. We previously reported on the variability of clinical behaviour in advanced RCC&#xD;
      patients who had not received systemic treatment after debulking nephrectomy (Debulking&#xD;
      Nephrectomy Followed By A &quot;Watch And Wait&quot; Approach In Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma .Wong&#xD;
      A, et al. Urol Oncol, in press). The clinical significance of this includes the avoidance of&#xD;
      toxic systemic therapies after nephrectomy, or the possibility of using non-toxic vaccine&#xD;
      approaches in metastatic patients after cytoreductive nephrectomy. In this research proposal&#xD;
      we would like to analyse the immune related gene expression profile on nephrectomy tumor&#xD;
      samples and correlate them with the clinical course of the patient after the nephrectomy.&#xD;
      This will be an exploratory and retrospective study of 15 patients in whom debulking&#xD;
      nephrectomy for advanced RCC had been done, who did not receive any adjuvant treatment, and&#xD;
      in whom the clinical course had been monitored after the nephrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will first carry out a feasibility study during which we will isolate RNA from 3 FFPE&#xD;
      (formalin-fixed,paraffin-embedded) samples using commercially available RNA isolation kit and&#xD;
      we will determine if their quality is compatible with quantitative polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      (qPCR) or microarray studies. Upon successful feasibility study, the analysis will be&#xD;
      extended to 15 patients. RNA will be isolated from FFPE samples and the gene expression&#xD;
      profiles will be evaluated by qPCR and/or microarray. Emphasis will be placed on the&#xD;
      expression profile of immune-related genes. Finally, transcriptome analysis results will be&#xD;
      extended at the protein and cell level using immunohistochemistry assays.&#xD;
