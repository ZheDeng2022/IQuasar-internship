      1. Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To investigate clinical bladder dysfunction in a cohort of 10 diabetic and 10&#xD;
                stroke patients as assessed by a combined neurophysiologic and urologic assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To develop and quantify appropriate study methods for evaluating symptomatic and&#xD;
                asymptomatic bladder dysfunction in diabetic and stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. To develop pilot data of medical therapy (Toviaz) in diabetic and stroke bladder&#xD;
                dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Incontinence will be defined as losing bladder control at least once per week or&#xD;
                use of an indwelling catheter to control incontinent episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Incontinence will be measured at baseline and follow-up. Urinary frequency is&#xD;
                defined as urinary voiding greater than 8 times per 24-hour period and/or more than&#xD;
                one voiding per night. Pad count, leakage episodes, and nocturia will be measures&#xD;
                of incontinence. The amount and frequency of voiding, and nocturia will also be&#xD;
                measured. These items will be assessed using the Voiding Diary. Overall patient&#xD;
                satisfaction will be assessed using the Analog Scale of Voiding Satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Data collected will include medical history, co-morbidities, sensory and motor&#xD;
                symptoms, Voiding Diary for 3 days (attached), Analog Scale of Urinary Voiding&#xD;
                Satisfaction (attached), pad test, bladder symptoms, medical treatment, and&#xD;
                assessment of activities of daily living. In stroke patients the NIH Stroke Scale&#xD;
                Score and the Modified Rankin Scale will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                In diabetic patients, hemoglobin A1C levels will be measured and the Dyck grading&#xD;
                scheme for diabetic neuropathy will be assessed (Dyck, 1988).&#xD;
&#xD;
                Stage 0 (no neuropathy) = no symptoms and fewer than 2 abnormalities on testing&#xD;
                (nerve conduction, neurological examination, quantitative nerve testing of muscle&#xD;
                strength, threshold for vibration, cooling or warming sensation, or autonomic&#xD;
                function) Stage 1 (asymptomatic neuropathy) = no symptoms but two or more&#xD;
                abnormalities of functional testing Stage 2 = symptoms of a lesser degree than&#xD;
                stage 3 along with two or more functional abnormalities Stage 3 (disabling&#xD;
                neuropathy) = disabling symptoms and two or more functional abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
                Examination data will include sensory testing to include quantitative measures of&#xD;
                sensory dysfunction, motor examination to include manual motor testing, and&#xD;
                autonomic testing including postural blood pressures. Neurophysiologic testing as&#xD;
                outlined below will include nerve conduction velocity testing and somatosensory&#xD;
                evoked potentials of the tibial and median nerves. Urodynamic testing will be&#xD;
                performed as outlined below to include sphincter electromyography, urodynamic&#xD;
                evaluation, and clitoral and anal reflexes.&#xD;
&#xD;
                a) Stroke group: Examination data will include neurological testing of sensory and&#xD;
                motor dysfunction, the NIH Stroke Scale Score, and the Modified Rankin Scale.&#xD;
                Postural blood pressures and frequency of constipation (as a measure of&#xD;
                gastrointestinal motility) will be assessed. Laboratory studies will be obtained&#xD;
                and stroke lesion location and size will be documented. Data collected at follow-up&#xD;
                will include a history of new vascular events, medication use, the NIH Stroke Scale&#xD;
                Score, and the Modified Rankin Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
                (b) Diabetes group: In the diabetes group, laboratory studies including hemoglobin&#xD;
                A1C will be obtained. Diabetic management will occur with the consultation of the&#xD;
                patient's diabetologist to maximize current diabetic therapy based on ADA&#xD;
                Guidelines and provide consistency during the observation period of the study.&#xD;
                Postural blood pressures and frequency of constipation (as a measure of&#xD;
                gastrointestinal motility) will be assessed. The Dyck grading scheme for diabetic&#xD;
                neuropathy will be assessed (Dyck, 1988).&#xD;
&#xD;
                Stage 0 (no neuropathy) = no symptoms and fewer than 2 abnormalities on testing&#xD;
                (nerve conduction, neurological examination, quantitative nerve testing of muscle&#xD;
                strength, threshold for vibration, cooling or warming sensation, or autonomic&#xD;
                function) Stage 1 (asymptomatic neuropathy) = no symptoms but two or more&#xD;
                abnormalities of functional testing Stage 2 = symptoms of a lesser degree than&#xD;
                stage 3 along with two or more functional abnormalities Stage 3 (disabling&#xD;
                neuropathy) = disabling symptoms and two or more functional abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
                (c) Neurophysiology evaluation: Neurophysiologic testing will include Pundendal&#xD;
                nerve terminal motor latency (PNTML), nerve conduction velocity testing, and&#xD;
                somatosensory evoked potentials of the tibial and median nerves, sphincter&#xD;
                electromyography, and clitoral urethral and bladder anal reflexes.&#xD;
&#xD;
                All nerve conduction velocity (NCV) studies will be performed using standardized&#xD;
                methodology with temperature monitored and maintained during the study. Adult norms&#xD;
                will be utilized for all studies except F-waves, which will also be age-and,&#xD;
                height-normalized. Standard stimulation sites will be utilized and distances&#xD;
                measured on the skin surface. All latencies, amplitudes, conduction velocities&#xD;
                measured and waveforms will be stored. Motor nerve conduction (NCV) studies of the&#xD;
                peroneal nerve, posterior tibial nerve, and sural nerve will be obtained&#xD;
                bilaterally. Sural sensory distal latency will be obtained. H-reflex studies will&#xD;
                be performed and F-waves determined for the peroneal and tibial nerves. A&#xD;
                somatosensory evoked potential of the tibial and median nerve will be performed.&#xD;
                Pundendal nerve terminal motor latency will be performed (PNTML). Specific&#xD;
                methodologies are described below. All use of needle electrodes will be preceded by&#xD;
                a localized numbing anesthetic spray.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The urethral anal reflex will be performed using the methodology of Bradley&#xD;
                (Bradley, 1972). The urethra is stimulated using electrodes within a catheter with&#xD;
                recording from patch electrodes placed 1 cm lateral to the anal mucocutaneous&#xD;
                junction at 3, 6, and 9 o'clock with the patient in the lithotomy position. The&#xD;
                stimulus is paired with interstimulus interval of 5ms and stimulus duration of 0.1&#xD;
                ms, using constant current stimulator and recording stimulus level in mA. A&#xD;
                nonrecurrent mode is used for the stimulation. Simultaneous two-channel recording&#xD;
                is performed where channel 1 records electrodes at 3 and 6 positions and channel 2&#xD;
                records at the 9 and 6 positions. Sweep speed is 20 ms and the gain setting is 50&#xD;
                uV. Low-filter setting is 10 Hz and high-filter setting is 10kHz. The sensory&#xD;
                threshold is measured in mA and stimulation is performed starting at 2x threshold.&#xD;
                Responses are superimposed and latency measured as the most consistent response.&#xD;
                Normal values are sensory threshold mean 3.4 mA, with SD of 1.76 (cutoff 8 mA),&#xD;
                latency 63 ms, SD 9.4 (cut off 82 ms).&#xD;
&#xD;
                The bladder anal reflex is performed with the same catheter electrode advanced into&#xD;
                the bladder. Impedence testing is performed to assure bladder wall contact with the&#xD;
                electrode on the catheter; an impedence of less than 10 kilo Ohm is sought.&#xD;
                Recording electrodes and stimulation is performed as with the urethral anal reflex&#xD;
                above. The normal values for this reflex are: mean sensory threshold 15.9 mA, SD&#xD;
                10.9 (cutoff 37 mA), and latency 64 ms, SD 13.4 (cut off 95 ms). Responses with&#xD;
                latencies greater than 100 ms are assumed to be voluntary, not reflex. The clitoral&#xD;
                reflex test will be accomplished similarly to the urethral and bladder reflex test.&#xD;
                However, a two-pronged surface electrode will be used rather than the electrode&#xD;
                catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Peroneal and sural nerve testing are used to test the lower extremity motor nerve.&#xD;
                In both of these tests, recording and stimulating electrodes are place in specified&#xD;
                areas of the foot, knee, and calf.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Pudendal Nerve Terminal Motor latency (PNTML) will be performed using a St Mark's&#xD;
                electrode. The vaginal approach to the pudendal nerve will be utilized. Both right&#xD;
                and left pudendal nerves will be tested. Stimulation is performed starting at 2x&#xD;
                threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
                (d) Urodynamic Evaluation: Patients will present with a full bladder and proceed&#xD;
                with a uroflow study; 8-fr catheter will then be placed and postvoid residual will&#xD;
                be performed leaving the catheter for the filling phase cystometrogram. Flow of&#xD;
                water will be at 50 ml/min with a standard 4-channel recording plus surface&#xD;
                electromyogram performed at 150/300 cc. When maximum bladder capacity has been&#xD;
                reached (or 1000 cc), the voiding phase will begin with the patient moved to a&#xD;
                potty chair. Surface electrodes (patches applied to the perineum) will be utilized&#xD;
                to record pelvic floor electromyographic activity during voiding. Needle&#xD;
                electromyography of the urethral sphincter is performed using needle electrodes&#xD;
                inserted after spray anesthetic is applied before the procedure. Filter settings&#xD;
                are LFF 10 Hz and HFF 10 kHz; sweep speed 10 ms/div; gain 50 UV/div. Insertional&#xD;
                activity, spontaneous activity, recruitment and motor unit potential morphology is&#xD;
                recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Treatment: After urological and neurological evaluation, those patients who meet&#xD;
                the U.S. approved indications for prescribing will be placed on a regimen of Toviaz&#xD;
                4 mg/day taken once daily with liquids and swallowed whole. The Toviaz dose may be&#xD;
                increased to 8 mg/day if there is not a therapeutic response on the 4mg/day. While&#xD;
                we recognize the need for a placebo group in future studies, that is not&#xD;
                appropriate with the number of patients and goals of this pilot study. Patients&#xD;
                will be monitored for side effects of therapy throughout the study observation&#xD;
                period. Drug treatment failure will lead to standard treatment options (Royal&#xD;
                College, 2002). Patients will complete a short weekly log rating incontinence,&#xD;
                complaints and medication compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Follow-Up Contacts and Visits: At 1, 3, and 6 months, the patient will return to&#xD;
                the clinic for review of a 3-day voiding diary, Incontinence Questionnaire (form&#xD;
                has already been approved by the IRB), and a pad test. The pad test will consist of&#xD;
                the patient collecting pads used for urine leakage for 12 hours the day before her&#xD;
                clinic appointment. The pads will be stored in an air-tight plastic bag and given&#xD;
                to the nurse coordinator at the patient's clinic visit. These pads will be weighed&#xD;
                and this data recorded for comparison at each clinic visit. The log forms will be&#xD;
                collected monthly either by mail or at the clinic visit. Patients will be contacted&#xD;
                by phone on alternate months by the nurse coordinator to verify demographic&#xD;
                information, current medications, complaints and response to the drug treatment.&#xD;
                Patients will continue to be followed by their specialty physicians (Neurologists&#xD;
                and Diabetologists) during the follow-up period.&#xD;
