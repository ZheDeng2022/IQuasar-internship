  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine how much nausea and or vomiting is caused by irinotecan-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer. Patients with colorectal cancer scheduled to&#xD;
      receive their first cycle of an irinotecan-based chemotherapy regimen are eligible. Any&#xD;
      chemotherapy agents administered in combination with irinotecan must have low-minimal&#xD;
      potential to cause nausea and or vomiting. Examples of acceptable regimens would be&#xD;
      irinotecan in combination with infusional fluorouracil and leucovorin (FOLFRI) with or&#xD;
      without bevacizumab and irinotecan in combination with cetuximab. Patients who have received&#xD;
      prior non-irinotecan-based chemotherapy are eligible providing they experienced no vomiting&#xD;
      and no greater than mild nausea with their prior chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Irinotecan is a camptothecin analog which exerts its cytotoxic effects by forming a covalent&#xD;
      complex with topoisomerase I and DNA, resulting in inhibition of DNA re-ligation,&#xD;
      accumulation of DNA double strand breaks and apoptotic cell death (1). Irinotecan is FDA&#xD;
      approved for use in the front-line and second-line treatment of colorectal cancer. It has&#xD;
      also demonstrated activity in a variety of other non-hematologic tumors. The recently updated&#xD;
      ASCO antiemetic guidelines characterize irinotecan as having moderate emetic risk. (2).&#xD;
      However, the emetogenic potential of this agent has been poorly characterized and there are&#xD;
      no published prospective trials with emesis as a primary-end point. In addition there is a&#xD;
      complete paucity of information on the potential of irinotecan to induce emesis beyond the&#xD;
      first day after chemotherapy, so-called delayed emesis. Best characterized following&#xD;
      cisplatin, delayed emesis is also associated with a number of other chemotherapy agents that&#xD;
      similar to irinotecan appear to be moderately emetogenic such as carboplatin,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin. Antiemetic prophylaxis for delayed emesis following&#xD;
      irinotecan is not routinely prescribed at the present time. Prospectively obtained&#xD;
      information on the potential of irinotecan to cause delayed emesis would be helpful in&#xD;
      guiding appropriate antiemetic practice.&#xD;
