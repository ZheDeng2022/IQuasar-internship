  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether repetitive high field transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation of the left or right frontal lobes is beneficial for the treatment of depression&#xD;
      that is refractory to antidepressant medication.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the utility of modern psychotropic medications, depression remains a medical problem&#xD;
      with major societal impact. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective somatic treatment&#xD;
      for depression. However, ECT has disadvantages, including risks attendant with general&#xD;
      anesthesia and significant cognitive side effects (e.g. confusion and memory loss). An&#xD;
      effective but safer somatic therapy for depression could help many patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brain can be stimulated non-invasively by using time-varying magnetic fields to induce&#xD;
      electrical currents within the cerebral cortex, a technique known as transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation. Preliminary investigations have provided promising evidence of improved mood&#xD;
      associated with high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of left&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex in patients with medication-resistant major depression. However, the role&#xD;
      of stimulus laterality in the effects of prefrontal rTMS have not been tested systematically.&#xD;
      Furthermore, previous studies have likely been confounded by inadequate patient blinding and&#xD;
      by a lack of standardization of psychotropic medication treatment. Therefore, we propose to&#xD;
      use a carefully controlled clinical trial to directly test the hypothesis that the effects of&#xD;
      prefrontal rTMS on mood are related to the laterality of magnetic stimulation. We also intend&#xD;
      to improve blinding in comparison to previous studies by: 1) employing a parallel-group study&#xD;
      design comparing real and simulated rTMS, as opposed to a crossover study design; 2) using&#xD;
      specially constructed sham magnetic coils which can be placed directly on the scalp surface,&#xD;
      to more effectively simulate rTMS; and 3) using trains of weak electrical impulses to&#xD;
      simulate the cutaneous scalp stimulation associated with rTMS. We will minimize confounding&#xD;
      effects of medications and antidepressant withdrawal by: 1) requiring that all patients have&#xD;
      fail a monitored clinical trial of an SSRI or other comparable antidepressant prior to rTMS;&#xD;
      and 2) continuing pharmacological treatment of depression during the rTMS phase of the trial.&#xD;
      Demonstration of therapeutic efficacy of rTMS in this rigorously controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      would provide a foundation for further investigation and development of this novel potential&#xD;
      treatment modality.&#xD;
