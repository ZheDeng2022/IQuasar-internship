  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) represent one of the most significant complications of NF1. They&#xD;
      are a significant cause of morbidity in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) by causing pain,&#xD;
      impaired function, and disfigurement. They may become life-threatening through mechanical&#xD;
      compression of vital organs such as the trachea, great vessels, or spinal cord, and may&#xD;
      significantly interfere with normal function when located in the extremities or orbit. The&#xD;
      only effective therapy for PN is total surgical excision. However, due to local infiltration&#xD;
      of normal tissue, gross total resection is usually not feasible, and often PN are completely&#xD;
      unresectable due to their location, size, and multiplicity. To date, other therapeutic&#xD;
      modalities, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy, have not shown efficacy in PN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, local photodynamic therapy will be investigated. Photodynamic therapy&#xD;
      (PDT) utilizes a drug, called a photosensitizer or photosensitizing agent, and a particular&#xD;
      type of light. When photosensitizers are exposed to a specific wavelength of light, they&#xD;
      produce a form of oxygen that kills nearby cells. PDT is expected to result in treatment&#xD;
      response with shrinkage of tumor. The main purpose of the study is to determine the maximum&#xD;
      amount of light that can be safely used with LS11 for PDT in children with plexiform&#xD;
      neurofibromas.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current treatment options for PN are limited. The only effective therapy for PN is complete&#xD;
      surgical resection. Incompletely resected lesions have a high incidence of recurrence, often&#xD;
      resulting in the necessity of several surgeries over a patient's lifetime. Development of&#xD;
      non-surgical treatments for PN is a high priority. To date, other therapeutic modalities,&#xD;
      including radiotherapy and chemotherapy, have not shown efficacy in PN, although it is&#xD;
      arguable that these modalities have not been sufficiently studied. Newer approaches,&#xD;
      including anti-angiogenesis agents, farnesyl transferase inhibitors, and inhibitors of growth&#xD;
      factor pathways are in development and are being studied, but are clearly not proven&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Agent LS11, talaporfin sodium, was specifically developed as a&#xD;
      photosensitizing agent for use in photodynamic therapy. The light activation of LS11 leads to&#xD;
      the formation of singlet oxygen causing damage to the vascular endothelial cells leading to&#xD;
      vascular thrombosis and occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I and II studies were conducted in the US and Japan using LS11. PDT with LS11 was&#xD;
      generally well tolerated in these studies and there were no serious adverse events noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PDT is a novel treatment modality in which a systemically administered photosensitizer (LS11&#xD;
      in our proposal) is activated locally by illuminating the diseased tissue with light of a&#xD;
      specific wavelength. Light activation of LS11 leads to the formation of reactive oxygen&#xD;
      species that cause damage to the vascular endothelial cells leading to vascular thrombosis&#xD;
      and occlusion and subsequently death of tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Light Source Placement: Ultrasound may be used to monitor the percutaneous implantation of&#xD;
      the Light Source. However, the position of the implanted Light Source must be verified by&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use a RITA introducer that has a trochar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Make a small incision in the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insert the introducer into the tumor and advance to the desired position in the target&#xD;
           tissue (using ultrasound or CT to verify placement).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Remove the trochar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insert the Light Source catheter to the end of the sheath. (Avoid mechanical damage to&#xD;
           the device, such as twisting, kinking, or exerting force during insertion).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pull the sheath back at least 4 centimeters (cm) (the Light Source has to remain in&#xD;
           position and not be pulled back with the sheath).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Verify the Light Source tip location by CT. Reposition if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The sheath may be removed completely, after verifying Light Source tip location, at the&#xD;
           physician's discretion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record distance to lesion surface and to vital structures of the implanted light source.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secure the Light Source&#xD;
&#xD;
      LS11 Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Since compatibility between LS11 and other drugs is not established, LS11 should not be&#xD;
           mixed with or physically added to other drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every effort should be made to avoid extravasation of LS11 in the surrounding tissue.&#xD;
           The extravasated drug may pose prolonged photosensitivity risk to the tissue near the&#xD;
           injection site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To avoid extravasation, establish an intravenous (IV) line and ensure that there is a&#xD;
           free flow of saline or dextrose and water. If a heparin lock is used, flush thoroughly&#xD;
           with saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LS11 should be slowly (over 3-5 minutes) administered intravenously as a single dose of&#xD;
           30 mg/m2 or 40 mg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following the injection the line should be flushed with at least 10 cc of saline or&#xD;
           dextrose and water.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In case of extravasation, the site should be thoroughly rinsed with saline or water and&#xD;
           carefully bandaged to protect the area from room- and sun-light. The photosensitivity at&#xD;
           the extravasated site will last longer than general cutaneous photosensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record the administration start time and end time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam, blood tests, electrocardiogram (ECG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will&#xD;
      be performed prior to starting on study and regularly after the treatment per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Light Exposure Precautions Following PDT-Instructions for Patients: Patients will be&#xD;
      sensitive to light and must observe precautions to reduce exposure of skin and eyes to direct&#xD;
      sunlight and bright indoor lighting for up to 14 days. The sensitivity to light is due to&#xD;
      residual drug that will be present in all parts of the skin and eyes. To minimize skin&#xD;
      reactions due to light exposure after LS11 administration, precautions should be taken as&#xD;
      detailed in the protocol.&#xD;

    <description>Treatment will be given with a standard 3+3 light dose escalation. The &quot;Treatment Period&quot; will be 28 days. The LS11 dose will be 30mg/m2. The initial light dose will be 50 J/cm. If criteria for dose escalation are met, then the light dose will be escalated to 100J/cm, 150J/cm and 200J/cm. Once the maximum light dose is determined, up to 6 additional patients will be treated at that level to gain further experience with this modality prior to phase II testing. In particular, at least 3 subjects &lt;12 years of age will be enrolled at the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) to allow for further evaluation of safety in younger children. If grade 3 or 4 toxicities are noted at light dose level #1, the LS11 dose will be decreased to 20mg/m2 (2/3 of the standard dose).</description>
