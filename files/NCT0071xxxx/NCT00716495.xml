  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this open-label study of patients with advanced melanoma 20 evaluable patients will be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug substance, AGI-101H, is a whole cell, allogeneic melanoma vaccine, representing a&#xD;
      mixture (1:1 ratio) of two therapeutic gene modified human melanoma cell lines, referred to&#xD;
      as Mich1H6 and Mich2H6, which has been gamma-irradiated to render the cells non-proliferative&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive treatment for up to 26 weeks. Progression at any time point requiring&#xD;
      systemic treatment with, for example with chemotherapy or cytokines will lead to withdrawal&#xD;
      of this patient from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose chosen is 5 x 107 viable cells/dose.&#xD;

      Total number of patients: 20 evaluable patients will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage: 5 x 107 live cells. No dose modification is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration: Subcutaneous (s.c.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of treatment: Patients will receive treatment for up to 26 weeks. Progression at any&#xD;
      time point requiring systemic treatment with, for example with chemotherapy or cytokines will&#xD;
      lead to withdrawal of this patient from the study. All surviving patients of this AGITAM&#xD;
      trial will be offered the opportunity to transfer to a follow-up treatment protocol with AGI&#xD;
      - 101H. In this case treatment may continue every 4 - 8 weeks until progression or death or&#xD;
      withdrawal unless such therapy is contraindicated or patient does not wish to continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference therapy: Not applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of medicinal product: The drug substance, AGI-101H, is a whole cell, allogeneic&#xD;
      melanoma vaccine, representing a mixture (1:1 ratio) of two therapeutic genemodified human&#xD;
      melanoma cell lines, referred to as Mich1H6 and Mich2H6, which has been gamma-irradiated to&#xD;
      render the cells non-proliferative. There is no recommended International Non-proprietary&#xD;
      (INN) Name for the drug substance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: In this open-label study of patients with advanced melanoma, one dose of AGI -&#xD;
      101H vaccine will be administered s.c.. 20 evaluable patients will be recruited. An&#xD;
      independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will review all safety data after the first 10&#xD;
      injections and then after another 10 injections (20 injections in total). Up to that second&#xD;
      DMC meeting all patients have to stay in the hospital for a 2 hours observation; after the&#xD;
      analysis of the 20 vaccinations the DMC will review the safety data and may recommend&#xD;
      reverting to normal outpatients setting.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have given signed informed consent for participation in the study prior&#xD;
             to any study-related procedures being performed and not part of normal medical care,&#xD;
             with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time&#xD;
             without prejudice to their future medical care&#xD;
&#xD;
