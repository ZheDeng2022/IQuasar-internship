    <textblock>
      The worldwide epidemic of obesity is paralleled with increased cases of non-alcoholic liver&#xD;
      disease (liver fat accumulation) and diabetes. Fat belongs in the adipose tissue, and if&#xD;
      excess fat accumulates in the liver or muscle, these tissues cannot use sugar efficiently. It&#xD;
      has been discovered that when large quantities of fructose (a sugar present in soft drinks)&#xD;
      are consumed, the conversion of carbohydrate (CHO) to fat in the liver increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that: 1) subjects with fatty liver have a higher CHO uptake and conversion to&#xD;
      fat in their liver when compared to matched control subjects with normal liver fat content;&#xD;
      and that: 2) when subjects with fatty liver are fed a diet limiting fructose and simple&#xD;
      sugars will decrease their liver CHO fat content. This reduction in liver fat will normalize&#xD;
      the way the liver responds to sugar and insulin, reversing the pre-diabetic state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement of these parameters will be done using state-of-the-art techniques such as&#xD;
      safe non-radioactive isotope tracers and non-invasive magnetic resonance spectroscopy.&#xD;

      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver ailment in developed&#xD;
      countries. Fatty liver - steatosis - affects up to one third of the population. Its&#xD;
      prevalence is rising and seems to parallel the global increase in obesity and type-2&#xD;
      diabetes. The etiology of NAFLD in humans is not well understood. We propose that the hepatic&#xD;
      conversion of carbohydrates (CHO) to lipids (de novo lipogenesis, DNL) is a key factor in the&#xD;
      accumulation of excess liver fat and the accompanying dyslipidemia and hepatic insulin&#xD;
      resistance; and that suppressing DNL by diet will reduce liver fat and improve both lipid and&#xD;
      carbohydrate metabolism in patients with steatosis. These hypotheses are based on studies in&#xD;
      which we and others have established that fractional hepatic DNL can vary dramatically&#xD;
      depending on the diet and/or health status of a subject; and, in particular, that dietary&#xD;
      fructose is a potent lipogenic stimulus. In this proposal we will perform CRC-based studies&#xD;
      to compare the rates of DNL and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) kinetics in steatotic and&#xD;
      matched non-steatotic controls and evaluate their relationship to lipid profiles and hepatic&#xD;
      and whole-body insulin resistance and overall carbohydrate metabolism (Aim1). The steatotic&#xD;
      individuals whose habitual intake of fructose and other simple sugars exceeds 15% of total&#xD;
      energy intake will then be randomized to consume one of two low-fat diets that differ only in&#xD;
      CHO type to determine whether diet-induced changes in DNL affect liver fat flux and content&#xD;
      and hepatic, whole-body insulin sensitivity, and overall carbohydrate metabolism (Aim 2). We&#xD;
      hypothesize that a diet that is rich in complex CHO will achieve greater decreases in DNL and&#xD;
      liver fat than one that contains typical amounts of simple CHO, including fructose. This&#xD;
      dietary intervention study includes a 6-week 25% energy restriction outpatient phase to&#xD;
      promote moderate weight loss and improve insulin sensitivity, followed by a two weeks weight&#xD;
      maintenance with the last 4 days as an inpatient stay during which all of the studies&#xD;
      performed at baseline (Aim 1) will be repeated. State-of-the-art stable isotope techniques&#xD;
      will be used to assess hepatic DNL, apoB100 turnover, VLDL-triglyceride (TG) fluxes, and&#xD;
      lipolysis under fasting and fed conditions. Hepatic and extra-hepatic insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      will be measured using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps and stable isotope studies of&#xD;
      endogenous glucose production and glycogen flux. Liver and muscle fat will be measured by&#xD;
      proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), visceral fat by magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI), and whole-body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). These studies&#xD;
      will allow us to evaluate the importance of DNL as a mechanism modulating liver fat content&#xD;
      and flux, and the significance of CHO quality in dietary guidance for steatotic patients.&#xD;

             biopsies since they are not medically warranted; thus, to ensure they do not have&#xD;
             steatosis they will undergo MRS during screening and have a total lipid: unsuppressed&#xD;
             water &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Habitual consumption of alcohol &gt; 20 g/day for men and 10 g/day for women&#xD;

          -  Change in body weight &gt;5% within the preceding 6 months (by self-report)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known intolerance, allergy or hypersensitivity to fructose&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or lactation (for women); OR&#xD;
