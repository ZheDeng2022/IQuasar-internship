  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been numerous studies comparing various ACD measurements in phakic eyes,while&#xD;
      researches comparing ACD in pseudophakic eyes are less extensive. With the recent popularity&#xD;
      of presbyopia correction, measuring the ACD will facilitate differentiating pseudophakic&#xD;
      accommodation from pseudoaccommodation. It is thus mandatory to verify the accuracy of ACD&#xD;
      measurement of these devices since the innovation of various IOLs in the recent decade makes&#xD;
      this task more complicated. In this study, we will assess the limitations of using Pentacam&#xD;
      for ACD measurement in pseudophakic eyes and compare Pentacam measurement with IOLMaster and&#xD;
      A-scan measurements.&#xD;

      In this prospective study, ACD was measured in 90 phakic and 94 pseudophakic eyes by&#xD;
      Pentacam, IOLMaster and A-scan. Correlations and differences between the three measurements&#xD;
      were investigated. The accuracy in detecting the anterior lens surface in pseudophakic eyes&#xD;
      was also assessed.Differences in ACD-Pen, ACD-IOLM, and ACD-A were analyzed using one-way&#xD;
      analysis of variance (ANOVA). When an overall significance of P&lt; 0.05 was obtained, pair-wise&#xD;
      comparisons were made using Tukey's multiple comparison t tests. The association between&#xD;
      ACD-Pen, ACD-IOLM, and ACD-A was assessed using Pearson's correlation test. The distribution&#xD;
      of erroneous ACD-Pen measurement for the three IOLs was analyzed with the chi-square test. In&#xD;
      all analyses, P &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;

        Ninety phakic eyes were randomly selected for study from the outpatient clinic. Ninety-four&#xD;
        pseudophakic eyes that had a standard clear cornea phacoemulsification with one of three&#xD;
        acrylic IOLs (MA60BM, SA60AT, SN60AT) implanted into the capsular bag by the same surgeon&#xD;
        were also studied.&#xD;
