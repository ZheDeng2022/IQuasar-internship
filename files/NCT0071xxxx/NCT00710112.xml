  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if sequence variations in genes involved in the&#xD;
      development and function of vulnerable organs increases susceptibility to chronic lung&#xD;
      disease (CLD) and other diseases affecting premature infants, such as necrotizing&#xD;
      enterocolitis (NEC), sepsis, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and intraventricular hemorrhage&#xD;
      (IVH). The study will also determine whether measurement of certain biomarkers in serum will&#xD;
      identify infants who will develop these complications of prematurity. Previous studies from&#xD;
      this institution and others have identified genetic variants in some genes, such as toll like&#xD;
      receptor genes are associated with higher risk of CLD or NEC. The interaction of these&#xD;
      variants with other gene variants that can influence the risk of these diseases remains&#xD;
      unclear.&#xD;

      Chronic lung disease of prematurity (CLD) is diagnosed in 30-40% of very low birth weight&#xD;
      (VLBW) infants (&lt;1500gms) and remains a leading cause of mortality and long-term morbidity in&#xD;
      this population. Other diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), sepsis, patent&#xD;
      ductus arteriosus (PDA), and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) also contribute to mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity in this population. A central tenet in the pathogenesis of NEC, CLD and sepsis&#xD;
      is the failure of host genome-regulated immune defenses to surmount the challenges posed by&#xD;
      microbial pathogens in the presence of risk-factors that induce intestinal, pulmonary and&#xD;
      systemic injury, respectively. Toll like receptors (TLRs) are pathogen recognition receptors&#xD;
      which serve as the recognition and effector arm of the innate immune system. Since the&#xD;
      premature infant is predominantly dependent on the innate immune system for host defense our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that hypomorphic genetic variations in TLRs will increase susceptibility to&#xD;
      diseases of prematurity such as CLD and sepsis.The increased risk of inflammation, decreased&#xD;
      potential for repair and growth of lung may be reflected in the levels of biomarkers, such&#xD;
      as, cytokines, micro-RNAs (miRNA) or peptides that are secreted into biological fluids, like&#xD;
      blood and tracheal aspirates. It is likely that the genetic variants that increase the risk&#xD;
      of inflammation or decreased repair and growth will be also associated with altered levels of&#xD;
      these biomarkers. Measurement of the biomarkers and genetic variants together can increase&#xD;
      the precision of the early predictors of these complications of prematurity. Measurement of&#xD;
      biomarkers in biological fluids can be done with a shorter turnaround time than gene&#xD;
      sequencing at the present time. Biomarkers can also provide longitudinal changes in the&#xD;
      severity of disease and response to therapy. Newer multiplex assays make it feasible to&#xD;
      measure the levels of biomarkers in very small quantities of biological fluids. These&#xD;
      complementary strengths make gene sequencing and biomarker detection ideal 1-2 approach for&#xD;
      the early identification and disease progression evaluation in premature infants. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis will be tested in VLBW infants in four specific aims: (1) To determine whether the&#xD;
      presence of previously described single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TLR4 (Asp299Gly,&#xD;
      Thr399Ile) TLR2 (Arg753Gln) and TLR5 (Arg392STOP) genes is associated with an increased risk&#xD;
      of CLD ; (2) to detect by DNA sequencing if novel genetic variations in TLR4, TLR2, TLR9,&#xD;
      MyD88 and other innate immune genes increases the risk of CLD or other disease in premature&#xD;
      infants; (3) to identify by gene sequence approach whether variants in other repair and&#xD;
      growth genes alter susceptibility to diseases affecting premature infants such as CLD,NEC or&#xD;
      sepsis or PDA or IVH; and (4) whether alterations in cytokines, miRNA and other biomarker&#xD;
      levels in serum from the same blood samples can provide additional predictive value in&#xD;
      recognizing the risk of diseases of prematurity. VLBW infants who develop CLD (oxygen&#xD;
      requirement at 36 weeks postconceptional age), NEC, sepsis, PDA, or IVH will serve as cases&#xD;
      while VLBW infants who do not develop the diseases of interest will serve as controls. A&#xD;
      0.5cc sample of blood will be collected from enrolled infants via indwelling catheter or&#xD;
      heel-stick for DNA analysis after consent is obtained. The TLR4 (Asp299Gly, Thr399Ile) TLR2&#xD;
      (Arg753Gln) and TLR5 (Arg392STOP) SNPs will be evaluated using a multiplex Single Base&#xD;
      extension based technique, using commercially available primers. Novel genetic variations in&#xD;
      these genes of interest and other variants proposed to be related to NEC will be detected&#xD;
      using conventional Sanger or Next Generation DNA sequencing. Serum will be separated from the&#xD;
      same blood sample obtained for DNA isolation. A second 0.5cc sample of blood will be&#xD;
      collected for biomarker measurement. Biomarker levels in serum will be analyzed using&#xD;
      multiplex EIA for cytokines, sequencing for miRNA profile and ELISA for peptide levels of&#xD;
      interest (VEGF, angiopoietin-2 and Nogo-B peptide). Benefits include the possibility of&#xD;
      development of risk-based preventive and therapeutic strategies to prevent CLD, NEC, sepsis,&#xD;
      PDA, or IVH in this population.&#xD;
