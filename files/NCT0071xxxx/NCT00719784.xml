      Vibration Response Imaging (VRI) is novel technology which records breath sounds via&#xD;
      pizo-electric sensors and produces a digital image using a computer algorithm. It is&#xD;
      radiation free and is portable to the patient's bedside. Data exists to show that the&#xD;
      recordings from normal individuals differs from those who have pulmonary pathology. There is&#xD;
      also evidence that recordings have high levels of inter and intra-observer reliability.&#xD;
      However, data on specific VRI patterns for specific pathology is still needed before this can&#xD;
      be used as a diagnostic tool. We aim to perform an open label feasibility trial on inpatient&#xD;
      and outpatient pulmonary patients. Bedside clinical examination and chest auscultation will&#xD;
      be used as the reference gold standard. Other diagnostic modalities that have been used as&#xD;
      part of the patient's usual standard of care will also be used for comparison. Specifically&#xD;
      breath sound progression, the maximal sound energy shape/distribution and the presence of&#xD;
      artifactual sounds will be used to search for patterns that may be used for diagnosis.&#xD;
      Sensitivity and specificity will be calculated for each disease (eg. asthma, emphysema,&#xD;
      bronchiectasis, pneumonia, effusion, pneumothorax, etc)&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement of regional distribution of breath sound intensity within the human thorax&#xD;
      during respiration using computerized lung sound analysis has generated interest as a&#xD;
      possible diagnostic modality. Using normal breath sound distribution as a reference, abnormal&#xD;
      distributions of sound energy can be used to identify potential pathological states.&#xD;
      Vibration Response Imaging (VRI) utilizes such technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VRI processes lung sound recordings and generates a dynamic representation of this sound&#xD;
      energy distribution on a computer screen using a grey-scale coding. Air turbulence within the&#xD;
      airways and the consequent vibrations that are generated are captured by multiple&#xD;
      piezoelectric contact sensors, which have been placed on the skin of the patient. The signals&#xD;
      are processed by band-pass (150-250 Hz) filtering to eliminate heart sounds and chest wall&#xD;
      movements. These filtered signals are then combined, sliced over 0.17 second intervals, and&#xD;
      converted into a sequence of dynamic images that reflect regional sound vibration energies&#xD;
      against a time axis. Lung vibration energy is presented on the screen in various grey shades&#xD;
      from black in maximum energy areas to white in zero energy areas. Pilot data suggest that VRI&#xD;
      can distinguish breath sounds in normal patients from those with intra-thoracic pathology&#xD;
      based on distinctive patterns of vibration energy. Reproducibility of VRI recordings and&#xD;
      consistency of inter-observer interpretation have also been documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the diagnostic capability of Vibration Response Imaging (VRI) in the evaluation of&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (Subjects presenting as pulmonary inpatients and outpatients). Chest&#xD;
      auscultation and other diagnostic modalities that have been used as part of standard of care&#xD;
      (eg. chest radiograph, CT scans and thoracic ultrasound) will be used as the reference gold&#xD;
      standard to compare against.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adult (≥ 21 years old) patients (inpatients and outpatients) under the care of the&#xD;
      Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine between 1/07/2008 and 31/05/2009 will be&#xD;
      considered eligible. Children may have too small body sizes for the current standard sensors&#xD;
      and will not be recruited. Other inclusion criteria will be ability to provide informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Conditions that will prevent the placement of sensors oh the patients&#xD;
      back such as bony/chest wall deformity and contagious skin conditions. The presence of a&#xD;
      pacemakers and pregnancy are also considered contraindications because of the yet undefined&#xD;
      safety issues associated with these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have signed informed consent will be asked to sit upright with their back&#xD;
      exposed. Those unable to sit up will have the sensors slid under them while in the supine&#xD;
      position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recordings will be then performed using the VRI device (Deep Breeze™, Or Akiva, Israel).&#xD;
      Forty-two sensors that are assembled on 2 planar arrays will be placed on subject's back.&#xD;
      Each row of 3 sensors is held in place by silicone cups that are coupled to the patient's&#xD;
      back by a computer-controlled low vacuum seal. Prior to the application of the sensors, the&#xD;
      patient's back will be wiped clean with an alcohol-free wet wipe to remove perspiration and&#xD;
      dirt debris.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recorded for 12 seconds while asked to breathe deeply in and out. Forced&#xD;
      exhalations are discouraged. Each 12-second recording usually include 3-4 respiratory cycles.&#xD;
      Most patients need to be coached on the breathing technique for 1-2 minutes by the recording&#xD;
      physician. An average of 2-3 recordings will be made at each setting to ensure that a&#xD;
      reproducible image could be attained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator was trained in the recording and interpretation at Harvard&#xD;
      University. The co-investigators have been trained by the principal investigator and are&#xD;
      familiar with the machine because it has been on trial with the department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VRI recordings will be interpreted by the study doctors and by the Deep Breeze (Company&#xD;
      manufacturing VRI equipment) scientist. None of the patient's personal or clinical&#xD;
      information will be released to Deep Breeze Pte Ltd.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No additional tests or investigations will be performed on the patients. They will receive&#xD;
      management as per standard of care. The VRI recordings will be compared against standard&#xD;
      physical examination and diagnostic investigations that the patients would have had anyway.&#xD;
      Therefore, patients will not be paid any monetary compensation for their participation in the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information that will be collected is described in the Case Report Form (Appendix A). All&#xD;
      clinical data will be stored in the locked department office of the Principal Investigator&#xD;
      for a period of 2 years after the completion of the trial for the purpose of data analysis.&#xD;
      The patient's VRI recordings will remain on the VRI machine which is also password protected.&#xD;
      For the purpose of analysis, the recordings may be downloaded on to CDs and sent to Deep&#xD;
      Breeze. These recordings will contain no personal information except de-identified subject&#xD;
      code numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is an exploratory trial to test the feasibility of a novel technology, there is no&#xD;
      basis for sample size collection. An arbitrary figure of 200 was chosen because this was felt&#xD;
      to be achievable within the trial period. We will attempt to correlate the VRI findings with&#xD;
      the physical examination and other diagnostic modalities for individual disease states&#xD;
      depending on the clinical diagnosis (e.g. asthma, bronchiectasis, pneumonia, emphysema, heart&#xD;
      failure, effusion, pneumothorax) with the hope of finding reliable patterns that will enable&#xD;
      a diagnosis solely based on VRI. Sensitivity and specificity will be calculated for each&#xD;
      condition&#xD;
