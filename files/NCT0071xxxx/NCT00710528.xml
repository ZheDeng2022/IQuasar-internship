&#xD;
               -  CLL - refractory to or relapsed after at least 2 prior therapies, including&#xD;
                  fludarabine, alone or in combination. Patients should not be eligible for&#xD;
                  transplantation (patients who are candidates for transplantation and have&#xD;
                  declined transplantation are eligible for this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  B-cell NHL - refractory to or relapsed after at least 1 prior chemotherapy&#xD;
                  regimen and having received rituximab as a single agent or in combination with&#xD;
                  other therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AML - refractory to or relapsed after at least 1 cycle of induction chemotherapy.&#xD;
                  Patients over the age of 70 who are not appropriate candidates for chemotherapy&#xD;
                  are eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  MM - refractory to or relapsed after at least 2 prior chemotherapy regimens,&#xD;
                  including bortezomib and thalidomide or lenalidomide (except if the drug is&#xD;
                  contraindicated in a patient then this requirement is waived).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Disease status requirement:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  For AML patients, has &gt; 10% blasts in the bone marrow for refractory or relapsed&#xD;
                  disease and &gt; 20% blasts in the bone marrow if no prior chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For MM patients, has measurable disease defined by at least 1 of the following 3&#xD;
                  measurements: serum M-protein &gt; or = to 1 g/dL, urine M-protein &gt; or = to 200&#xD;
                  mg/24 h, or serum free light chain (FLC) assay with involved FLC level &gt; or = to&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Has had a transplant with current active graft-versus-host-disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has known active central nervous system involvement of the malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has active, serious infection requiring systemic therapy. Patients may receive&#xD;
             prophylactic antibiotics and antiviral therapy at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
             physician.&#xD;
