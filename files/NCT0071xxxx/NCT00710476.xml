      In order to reach fertilization in the context of IVF, the presence of high concentrations of&#xD;
      spermatozoa is associated with a higher degree of sperm metabolism and a higher concentration&#xD;
      of sperm degradation products, which may adversely affect not only sperm and oocyte viability&#xD;
      and the fertilization rate. The effect of a high concentration of sperm used for oocyte&#xD;
      insemination appears also to be negative on embryo development (Dumoulin et al 1992*). If&#xD;
      that is true, lowering the sperm concentration for oocyte insemination might improve embryo&#xD;
      quality and result in a higher implantation rate per embryo. Therefore, we tested the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the percentage of 8 cell-embryos on day 3 after IVF is significantly higher&#xD;
      (40%) after insemination with a low sperm concentration (150 000/ml spermatozoa) than after&#xD;
      insemination with a higher sperm concentration (30%; group 600 000/ml spermatozoa).&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
           In human in-vitro fertilization procedures, oocytes are usually inseminated with&#xD;
           concentrations that vary between 50 000 and 150 000 spermatozoa per ml fertilization&#xD;
           medium. It has been shown that increasing the concentration of spermatozoa to &gt;200 000&#xD;
           per ml, results in decreased fertilisation rates (66,7% in the group inseminated with&#xD;
           200 000 spermatozoa/ml versus 79,7% in the group inseminated with 10 000-90 000/ml;&#xD;
           p&lt;0,001) (Mahadevan and Trounson, 1984). These results were confirmed by another study&#xD;
           (Diamond, Rogers et al., 1985). The reason for this decreased fertilisation rate is&#xD;
           unclear but it has been speculated that the presence of high concentrations of sperm&#xD;
           metabolism or degradation products associated with larger numbers of spermatozoa may&#xD;
           adversely affect sperm and oocyte viability. Dumoulin et al. 1992 showed that increasing&#xD;
           the sperm concentration affects not only the fertilisation rate but also the embryo&#xD;
           development (Dumoulin, Bras et al., 1992). Significantly fewer fast-developing embryos&#xD;
           (4-cell and 5- to 8-cell stages) were found on day 2 in the 100 000/ml group (53.4%)&#xD;
           than in the 50 000/ml group (65.5%; p&lt;0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the Leuven University Fertility Centre (LUFC) oocytes have been inseminated&#xD;
           traditionally for more than 15 years now with a higher sperm concentration (600 000/ml&#xD;
           spermatozoa) than the average concentrations published (50 000 to 200 000 motile&#xD;
           sperm/ml) (Chen and Kattera, 2006; Dumoulin, Bras et al., 1992; Racowsky, Combelles et&#xD;
           al., 2003) This higher concentration for the insemination may be the cause of the lower&#xD;
           rate of 8-cell embryos on day 3 observed at the LUFC when compared to the literature. At&#xD;
           the LUFC only 20% of the embryos reach the 8-cell stage on day 3. In the literature the&#xD;
           proportion of 8 cell embryos on Day 3 has been reported to be between 30 and 37% (Chen&#xD;
           and Kattera, 2006;Racowsky, Combelles et al., 2003;Racowsky, Orasanu et al., 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
           In this prospective randomised trial we will test the hypothesis that embryo development&#xD;
           can be improved by reducing the sperm concentration at insemination. This will be the&#xD;
           first randomised trial showing the effect of inseminating with 600 000 spermatozoa/ml on&#xD;
           the embryo development on day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MATERIALS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients All patients with at least four oocytes will be included in this study.&#xD;
                Furthermore, for inclusion in the study, the semen sample at the day of pick-up&#xD;
                needs to have a total motility count after processing of at least 10 x 106 /ml. All&#xD;
                ICSI patients will be excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Randomisation For each patient, all oocytes will be randomly assigned to the low&#xD;
                insemination concentration (150 000/ml) or the high concentration (600 000/ml). The&#xD;
                randomization will be done at the time of oocyte retrieval according to the&#xD;
                principle &quot;one here - one there&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Results from pilot study Before starting this prospective randomised trial, we have&#xD;
                conducted a pilot study to check whether the fertilisation rate was not influenced&#xD;
                by the reduction of the insemination concentration. 268 oocytes of 21 patients were&#xD;
                included in this pilot study. Only patients with a good prognosis (defined as a&#xD;
                fertilization rate of at least 70 % in the previous cycle and good sperm&#xD;
                parameters: at least 10 x 106 motile spermatozoa per ml after processing and&#xD;
                minimal 60% motile spermatozoa) were selected. At first, the insemination&#xD;
                concentration was halved. The fertilisation rate didn't change significantly when&#xD;
                we inseminated with 300 000 spermatozoa per ml instead of with 600 000 per ml (75,&#xD;
                9% versus 68,7%; p&lt;0,05). In the second part of the pilot study the concentration&#xD;
                was lowered to 150 000/ml. There was no decrease in fertilisation rate with the&#xD;
                reduced number of spermatozoa (76,6% in the 150 000 group versus 83,6% in the 600&#xD;
                000 group; p&lt;0,05). On day 2 a 10 percent increase in the number of good quality&#xD;
                embryos was noticed (53,1% 4-cell embryos in the 150 000 group versus 42,6% in the&#xD;
                600 000 group; p&lt;0,05). But on day 3 no difference in the number of good quality&#xD;
                embryos was observed in this small group (32,7% in the 150 000 group versus 36,1%&#xD;
                in the 600 000 group; p&lt;0,05). This pilot study showed that lowering the sperm&#xD;
                concentration for insemination does not reduce the fertilization rate, and may have&#xD;
                a beneficial effect on embryo development but more patients need to be studied to&#xD;
                confirm this trend&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sperm preparation Sperm samples are prepared using a density gradient&#xD;
                centrifugation technique. The samples are loaded on an Isolate gradient and&#xD;
                centrifuged at 1450 rpm for 20 minutes. The resulting pellet is washed twice by&#xD;
                centrifugation. Afterwards, the pellet is resuspended in 0,75 ml fertilization&#xD;
                medium. After counting the sample is diluted to a final concentration of 10 x 106&#xD;
                motile spermatozoa per ml (this is the concentration used for the high insemination&#xD;
                group). For the low insemination group the sperm sample will be diluted again to a&#xD;
                concentration of 2.5 x 106 motile spermatozoa per ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Embryo culture and transfer During the oocyte aspiration the oocytes will be&#xD;
                divided in two groups. The oocytes are placed in 750 µl fertilization medium with a&#xD;
                maximum of 5 oocytes. After incubation at 37°C, oocytes are inseminated by adding&#xD;
                30 µl of the sperm sample with either the low or the high concentration.&#xD;
                Fertilization is evaluated 18-20h after the insemination. Embryo quality is&#xD;
                evaluated on day 2, 3 and 5 (cleavage stage, morphology and symmetry). Depending on&#xD;
                the number of fertilized oocytes and on the number of previous cycles, embryo&#xD;
                transfer is performed on day 2, 3 or day 5. According to the transfer policy of the&#xD;
                Belgian law (Koninklijk Besluit, 1 juli 2003), the best embryo(s) (based on&#xD;
                cleavage stage, morphology and symmetry) are transferred into the uterus. On the&#xD;
                day of transfer all surplus embryos of sufficient quality are cryopreserved.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Outcome variables and Power calculation The primary outcome variable of this study&#xD;
                is the embryo development evaluated by the number of good quality embryos on day 2&#xD;
                and day 3 (in 7 or 8 cell stage). To test the hypothesis that the percentage of 7&#xD;
                to 8 cell-embryos in the group with the low insemination concentration (150 000/ml&#xD;
                spermatozoa) is significantly higher (40%) than the percentage of the group with&#xD;
                the high insemination concentration (30%), power calculation revealed that 299&#xD;
                embryos are needed in each group on day 3 (beta= 0.8 and alpha &lt;0.05). Other&#xD;
                outcome variables of this study are the fertilization rate, the incidence of&#xD;
                polyspermy, pregnancy rate and implantation rate per transferred embryo.&#xD;
