      1. To demonstrate the feasibility of leukapheresis and ex vivo activation of autologous NK&#xD;
           cells in patients with metastatic NPC&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To demonstrate the safety of low dose systemic IL-2 in combination with escalating doses&#xD;
           of autologous Ex Vivo Activated NK cells in patients with metastatic NPC&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess immune measurements such as quantitation of regulatory T cells, EBV specific T&#xD;
           cells, serum cytokine levels, and NK cell function after treatment with IL-2 and&#xD;
           autologous Ex Vivo Activated NK cells&#xD;

    <textblock>
      We are investigating the use of immune cell therapy in metastatic Nasopharyngeal Cancer&#xD;
      (NPC). Recent small studies have shown that EBV specific cytotoxic T cells can be infused&#xD;
      into NPC patients with some good clinical effect including tumor responses. We are trying to&#xD;
      achieve a similar result using a less complex and less costly approach, with Natural Killer&#xD;
      (NK) cells. NK cells are known to recognize tumor and virally infected cells through a&#xD;
      variety of mechanisms. Also, NK cells influence the development of antigen-specific T cell&#xD;
      responses via reciprocal interactions with dendritic cells and the secretion of IFNγ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot clinical trial to study the feasibility of collecting, manipulating , and&#xD;
      infusing autologous enriched NK cells activated by short-term incubation in IL-2.&#xD;
      Leukapheresis units will be collected from eligible patients with NPC. NK cells will be&#xD;
      selected and activated with IL-2 prior to re-infusion. Patients will receive low dose IL-2&#xD;
      after infusion of activated NK cells. Post infusion monitoring will include peripheral blood&#xD;
      T cell subsets, cytokine secretion and serum cytokine levels. The parameters will be&#xD;
      correlated to clinical observations. If clinical efficacy is shown, our protocol could&#xD;
      represent a simple way of harnessing the immune system of the patient for treatment of this&#xD;
      disease. This study will also serve as platform technology development for later trials&#xD;
      involving manipulating cell therapy products.&#xD;

             measurable metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status &lt;2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy greater than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have adequate access for leukapheresis (vein or central line)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Organ function tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. total bilirubin &lt;1.5X normal, AST(SGOT) / ALT(SGPT) &lt;2.5 X of normal or &lt;5X in&#xD;
                  the case of patients with liver metastases;&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. creatinine &lt;1.5X normal institutional limits or a calculated creatinine clearance&#xD;
                  of &gt; 50 mls/min.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Age 18 and older&#xD;

             nasopharyngeal carcinoma&quot;.Neoadjuvant chemotherapy or concurrent chemoradiation&#xD;
