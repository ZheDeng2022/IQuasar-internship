      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of extended release mixed amphetamine&#xD;
      salts in treating preschool children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common developmental disorder that&#xD;
      affects between 4% and 12% of school-aged children. Children with ADHD often show symptoms of&#xD;
      hyperactivity, inattention, inability to sit still, trouble listening, excessive talking, and&#xD;
      aggression. ADHD is generally not diagnosed and treated in children less than 6 years old&#xD;
      because some symptoms of ADHD are difficult to distinguish from normal behaviors of&#xD;
      preschool-aged children. However, some preschool children who exhibit symptoms indicative of&#xD;
      ADHD and who have been carefully diagnosed by a health professional may benefit from early&#xD;
      treatment to lower risk for functional impairment later in childhood. Currently,&#xD;
      environmental changes, parent effectiveness training, and behavior therapy are the commonly&#xD;
      used treatments for preschoolers with ADHD symptoms, but not all preschoolers respond well to&#xD;
      such behavioral interventions. These children may benefit from medication treatment; however,&#xD;
      the safety and effectiveness of ADHD medications in treating preschool-aged children is not&#xD;
      well known. Extended release mixed amphetamine salts (XR-MAS), a stimulant medication, is a&#xD;
      commonly prescribed and approved medication for treating ADHD in children 6 years and older.&#xD;
      Further study is needed to determine how XR-MAS affects preschool-aged children with ADHD&#xD;
      symptoms. This study will compare the safety and effectiveness of XR-MAS versus placebo in&#xD;
      treating preschool children with ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last 6 weeks. All participants will first undergo rigorous&#xD;
      psychiatric assessments to confirm their diagnosis of ADHD. Eligible participants will then&#xD;
      be assigned randomly to receive treatment with either XR-MAS then placebo or placebo then&#xD;
      XR-MAS. Participants will take their assigned XR-MAS or placebo medications for 3 weeks and&#xD;
      then cross over to the other medication for an additional 3 weeks of treatment. Rating scale&#xD;
      scores will be collected weekly from parents and teachers to assess symptom response and&#xD;
      measures of safety.&#xD;

    <description>Depending on whether 1) child has had previous medication trial or 2) is on psychotropic medication at time of screening, children will either enter the washout period of 3 days before extended release mixed amphetamine salts (XR-MAS) or placebo (PBO) is initiated or proceed directly to the active treatment sequence they were randomized to. Participants randomized to Sequence 1 first receive treatment with XR-MAR for 3 weeks and then placebo for 3 weeks. Flexible, forced dosing will start at 5 mg/day for the first week, increase to 10 mg/day for the second week and continue to 15 mg/day on the third week. No washout period otherwise occurs (XR-MAS is not clinically suspected to have lingering effects beyond initial dosing/day of administration), including the crossover week to PBO.</description>
