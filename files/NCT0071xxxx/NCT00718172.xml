  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 120 patients with chronic hepatitis C will be enrolled in a study of viral kinetics and&#xD;
      liver gene expression before and during combination therapy with peginterferon and ribavirin.&#xD;
      Adult patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who have compensated liver&#xD;
      disease and have not received interferon in the past will be randomized into one of four&#xD;
      groups. Groups A and C will undergo liver biopsy before starting peginterferon therapy and&#xD;
      Groups B and D will undergo biopsy 6 hours after the initial dose of peginterferon.&#xD;
      Furthermore, Groups C and D will receive a run-in period of 4 weeks of ribavirin therapy&#xD;
      before starting peginterferon. All patients will receive the standard recommended doses of&#xD;
      peginterferon alfa 2a (180 mcg sc weekly) and ribavirin (1000 or 1200 mg daily for genotypes&#xD;
      1, 4-6 and 800 mg daily for genotype 2 and 3) for up to 48 weeks (24 weeks for genotype 2 and&#xD;
      3). All patients in Groups C and D, irrespective of genotype, will be pretreated with&#xD;
      ribavirin at a dose of 1000 or 1200 mg, depending on patient body-weight. After the initial&#xD;
      peginterferon injection, patients will have blood taken and symptoms recorded at 6, 24, 48,&#xD;
      72 hours and weekly thereafter for four weeks to assess viral kinetic response. Liver biopsy&#xD;
      tissue taken before or 6 hours after the initial dose of peginterferon will be assessed by&#xD;
      standard light microscopy and also subjected to RNA extraction and microarray analysis of&#xD;
      mRNA expression. Patients will be monitored carefully during therapy and tested regularly for&#xD;
      HCV RNA levels. Therapy will be given for 48 weeks, but will be discontinued early for&#xD;
      patients with genotype 1 infection if HCV RNA levels do not decline by at least 2 log IU/ml&#xD;
      by week 12 (lack of an early virological response) or do not decline to undetectable levels&#xD;
      by week 24 (lack of HCV RNA clearance). Patients with other genotypes with be treated for a&#xD;
      full course of therapy regardless of early responses. After completing therapy, patients will&#xD;
      be followed at 4 to 8 week intervals and undergo repeat medical evaluation with liver biopsy&#xD;
      24 weeks after stopping therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary clinical criterion for success of therapy is a sustained virological response, as&#xD;
      marked by the absence of HCV RNA from serum at least 24 weeks after stopping. The focus of&#xD;
      this study, however, will be on viral kinetics comparing patients who were pretreated with&#xD;
      ribavirin (Groups C and D) to those who were not (Groups A and B) as well as on gene&#xD;
      expression studies assessing the effects of peginterferon on intrahepatic mRNA profiles by&#xD;
      comparing Group A and B and the effects of ribavirin by comparing Group A to Group C and&#xD;
      Group B to Group D. Results will also be compared between different HCV genotypes. These&#xD;
      studies are aimed at assessing the mechanisms of action of peginterferon and ribavirin&#xD;
      against HCV and evaluating the basis for the lack of virologic response to combination&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age 18 years or above, male or female&#xD;
&#xD;
        Presence of HCV RNA (with or without anti-HCV) in serum at levels of at least 10,000 IU/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Willingness to undergo liver biopsy before or 6 hours after an initial injection of&#xD;
        peginterferon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Previous adequate treatment with any form of type I interferon (standard alpha interferon,&#xD;
        peginterferon, beta interferon). Adequate treatment is considered at least 12 weeks of&#xD;
        therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other antiviral therapy within the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If cirrhosis is present, decompensated liver disease, as marked by bilirubin greater than 4&#xD;
        mg percent, albumin less than 3.0 gm percent, prothrombin time greater than 2 sec&#xD;
        prolonged, or history of bleeding esophageal varices, ascites or hepatic encephalopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Serum ALT or AST levels greater than 1000 micro/L (greater than 25 times ULN). Such&#xD;
        patients will not be enrolled but may be followed until three consecutive determinations&#xD;
        are below this level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy or current breastfeeding. In women of child bearing potential or in spouses of&#xD;
        such women, inability to practice adequate contraception, defined as vasectomy in men,&#xD;
        tubal ligation in women, or use of condoms and spermicide, or birth control pills, or an&#xD;
        intrauterine device until 6 months after the end of treatment with ribavirin given the&#xD;
        potential for teratogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Significant systemic or major illnesses including congestive heart failure, organ&#xD;
        transplantation, serious psychiatric disease or depression, human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
        (HIV) infection, and angina pectoris.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pre-existing anemia (hematocrit less than 33 percent) or known history of hemolytic anemia.&#xD;
        In patients in Groups C and D, liver biopsy will not be performed if hemoglobin levels fall&#xD;
        to below 11 g/dl during ribavirin monotherapy. Epopoetin alfa or darbopoietin alfa therapy&#xD;
        will be available to achieve an adequate hematocrit if clinically indicated for patients in&#xD;
        all groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Immunosuppressive therapy with either corticosteroids (more than 5 mg of prednisone daily&#xD;
        on a chronic basis) or major immunosuppressive agents (such as azathioprine or&#xD;
        6-mercaptopurine). Patients receiving a short-course of corticosteroids for acute allergic&#xD;
        reactions or asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations (less than 2&#xD;
        weeks of therapy) will be eligible for the study after 4 weeks off therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Evidence of another form of liver disease in addition to viral hepatitis (for example&#xD;
        autoimmune liver disease, Wilson's disease, alcoholic liver disease, hemochromatosis, alpha&#xD;
        1 antitrypsin deficiency). Patients with concomitant non-alcoholic steatohepatitis but no&#xD;
        other form of chronic liver disease will not be excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Evidence of coronary artery disease or cerebral vascular disease, including abnormalities&#xD;
        on exercise stress testing in patients with defined risk factors who will be screened for&#xD;
        evidence of underlying coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Active substance abuse, such as alcohol, inhaled or injection drugs within the previous&#xD;
        year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma; either alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels greater than&#xD;
        200 ng/ml (normal less than 9 ng/ml) and/or ultrasound (or other imaging study)&#xD;
        demonstrating a mass suggestive of liver cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Clinical gout.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Active, serious autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosis, ulcerative&#xD;
        colitis, Crohn s disease or rheumatoid arthritis that in the opinion of the investigators&#xD;
        might be exacerbated by therapy with alpha interferon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        These exclusion criteria are considered the standard relative contraindications to&#xD;
        peginterferon and ribavirin therapy.&#xD;
