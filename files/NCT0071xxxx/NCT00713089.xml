  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to document prospectively the incidence of allergies of eczema, asthma and&#xD;
      allergic rhinitis in 2 diverse cohorts (Singaporean and Indonesian) with contrasting&#xD;
      lifestyles and socioeconomic development. The profile of microbial colonization in terms of&#xD;
      species variety, as well as their genetic diversity will be studied in Singapore and&#xD;
      Indonesia cohorts and to correlate these with clinical allergy.&#xD;

      The main objective of the current study is to establish the relationship of gut microbiota&#xD;
      and development of allergy in 2 populations with different socioeconomic status and&#xD;
      prevalence of allergy (high in Singapore and low in Indonesia). A cohort of children will be&#xD;
      followed prospectively from birth up to 2 years. Stool from different time points,&#xD;
      environmental exposure data and clinical manifestations of allergy will be analyzed and&#xD;
      recorded. Singapore and Indonesia will provide the South East Asian context in resolving&#xD;
      early life influences associated with divergent allergy prevalence. By studying subjects&#xD;
      below age two, this will provide valuable knowledge regarding the epidemiology of allergy and&#xD;
      atopy in the first years of life, which is poorly documented in this age group. More&#xD;
      importantly, the prospective nature and varied parameters included in this study (colony&#xD;
      counts, species variety and genetic diversity of microbiota) will add to the global data and&#xD;
      scientific evidence for the role of these factors in allergy development.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pre-delivery evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Either parent or sibling (ie first degree relative) has a history of atopy. This&#xD;
                  will be evidenced by a doctor-diagnosis of asthma, allergic rhinitis or eczema&#xD;
                  AND a positive skin prick test/specific IgE test to any of a panel of common&#xD;
                  allergens.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Parents agree to the child's participation in the study and sign the Informed&#xD;
                  Consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The subject and the parents are willing to comply with procedures and both child&#xD;
                  and parents are able to keep to scheduled clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Both parents are at contactable range (with valid mobile or land line numbers)&#xD;
                  for study team to arrange and schedule clinic visits and complete telephone&#xD;
                  interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Post-delivery evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is born full term (at least 37 weeks gestation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject does not have major congenital malformations/major illness as judged by&#xD;
             the doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is in otherwise good, stable health on the basis of medical history,&#xD;
             physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Family appears to be able to successfully complete this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The parent is, in the opinion of the investigator, mentally or legally incapacitated,&#xD;
