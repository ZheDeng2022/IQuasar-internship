      A retrospective clinical records review of patients diagnosed with gastrointestinal stromal&#xD;
      tumour (GIST) in the two tertiary centres in Singapore i.e. Singapore General Hospital and&#xD;
      National University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal tumours are the most common soft-tissue tumours of the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tracts. Remarkable progress has been made during the last several years in the diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of GIST. Understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of GIST which is linked to&#xD;
      deregulated KIT tyrosine-kinase activity has improved diagnosis, such that GIST is now more&#xD;
      frequently and specifically identified. More importantly, systemic tyrosine kinase inhibitor,&#xD;
      imatinib, has been used successfully in the treatment of GIST patients with advanced or&#xD;
      unresectable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GIST has been reviewed in the Western literature but there is a lack of Asian data. The&#xD;
      review will help us to better understand the disease in our population.Furthermore we will&#xD;
      also examine several unresolved issues in the Western literature by looking into our local&#xD;
      data. These include required duration of imatinib therapy, role of imatinib in the adjuvant&#xD;
      setting (application of chemotherapy after macroscopically complete removal of tumour) and&#xD;
      role of combination therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical records of all patients diagnosed with the disease at the two centres will be&#xD;
      reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the results aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to compare the characteristics of the GIST (epidemiology, site, morphology,&#xD;
           immunohistochemistry profile) in our centres compared to the well-published literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to compare the treatment regimen and results of our centres compared to others&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to review the role of chemotherapy in the adjuvant settings in the centres.&#xD;
