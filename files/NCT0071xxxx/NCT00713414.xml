      This study will examine how the brain controls speech in patients with spasmodic dysphonia, a&#xD;
      voice disorder that involves involuntary spasms of muscles in the larynx (voice box), causing&#xD;
      breaks in speech. Although the causes of spasmodic dysphonia are unknown, recent studies&#xD;
      found changes in brain function in patients with the disorder that may play a role in its&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People between 21 and 80 years of age with adductor spasmodic dysphonia may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Candidates are screened with the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasolaryngoscopy to examine the larynx. For this test, the inside of the subject s nose is&#xD;
      sprayed with a decongestant and a small, flexible tube called a nasolaryngoscope is passed&#xD;
      through the nose to the back of the throat to allow examination of the larynx. The subject&#xD;
      may be asked to talk, sing, whistle and say prolonged vowels during the procedure. The&#xD;
      nasolaryngoscope is connected to a camera that records the movement of the vocal cords during&#xD;
      these tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voice and speech recording to measure the type and severity of voice disorder. Subjects are&#xD;
      asked questions about their voice disorder and their voice is recorded while they repeat&#xD;
      sentences and sounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      of the brain, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET: A catheter is placed in a vein in the subject s arm to inject a radioactive substance&#xD;
      called a tracer that is detected by the PET scanner and provides information on brain&#xD;
      function. [11C]flumazenil is used in one scanning session and [11C]raclopride is used in&#xD;
      another. For the scan, the subject lies on a bed that slides in and out of the&#xD;
      doughnut-shaped scanner, wearing a custom-molded mask to support the head and prevent it from&#xD;
      moving during the scan. For the first scan the subject lies quietly for 60 minutes. For the&#xD;
      second scan, the subject lies quietly for 50 minutes and is then asked to say sentences&#xD;
      during another 50 minutes. The amount of radiation received in this study equals to a uniform&#xD;
      whole-body exposure of 0.9 rem, which is within the dose guideline established by the NIH&#xD;
      Radiation Safety Committee for research subjects. The guideline is an effective dose of 5 rem&#xD;
      received per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI: This procedure uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves instead of X-rays to obtain&#xD;
      images of the brain. The subject lies on a table that slides into the scanner, a narrow metal&#xD;
      cylinder, wearing ear plugs to muffle loud knocking sounds that occur during the scan. Images&#xD;
      of the brain structure are obtained while the subject lies still in the machine for 10&#xD;
      minutes. This is followed by functional MRI (fMRI) for 60 minutes, in which pictures are&#xD;
      taken while the subject speaks, showing changes in brain regions that are involved in speech&#xD;
      production.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) and writer s cramp (WC) are primary focal dystonias with selective&#xD;
      impairment of voluntary control of speaking and writing, respectively. Although the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of SD and WC is unknown, dystonia is considered to be a disorder of basal&#xD;
      ganglia that leads to secondary cortical and subcortical sensorimotor dysfunction. Results of&#xD;
      recent neuroimaging studies have established microstructural abnormalities, as well as&#xD;
      alterations of functional activity and neurotransmission within the basal&#xD;
      ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuitry during symptom production in these patients. Abnormal&#xD;
      functional relationships between these brain regions may play an important role in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of dystonia. However, the organization of functional networks and the&#xD;
      neurochemical correlates underpinning their abnormalities have not, to date, been fully&#xD;
      investigated. A few pharmacological reports of patients have provided indirect evidence of&#xD;
      the contributing role of the major basal ganglia neurotransmitters, &gt;=-aminobutyric acid&#xD;
      (GABA) and dopamine, to the pathophysiology of this disorder. We identified decreased D2/D3&#xD;
      receptor binding at rest and abnormal dopamine release during both symptomatic and&#xD;
      asymptomatic tasks in SD and WC compared to controls. We also identified altered GABAergic&#xD;
      transmission, especially involving the laryngeal and hand sensorimotor cortex. These changes&#xD;
      in neurotransmission may, in turn, be coupled with abnormalities of network functional&#xD;
      activity in these patients and thus contribute to the pathophysiology of this disorder. There&#xD;
      is, therefore, a critical need to further investigate the contribution of dopaminergic&#xD;
      transmission via D1-family receptors as well as dopaminergic function of substantia nigra,&#xD;
      pars compacta (SNc), in order to fully characterize abnormalities of dopaminergic&#xD;
      neurotransmission in this disorder. Filling this knowledge gap is essential for development&#xD;
      of effective neuropharmacological treatments for patients with SD and WC, which are limited,&#xD;
      to date, to only short-term benefits from injections of botulinum toxin into the affected&#xD;
      muscles every 3-4 months for a lifetime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this application is to determine the role played by major basal ganglia&#xD;
      neurotransmitters in the pathophysiology of primary focal dystonia. The central hypothesis is&#xD;
      that dopaminergic transmission is selectively altered within the nigro-striatal and direct&#xD;
      basal ganglia pathways and is correlated with abnormal dopaminergic function within the&#xD;
      indirect basal ganglia circuitry in SD and WC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to examine patients with adductor SD (ADSD) compared to two other groups of subjects:&#xD;
      (1) patients with another form of task-specific focal dystonia (writer s cramp, WC) and (2)&#xD;
      healthy volunteers without history of neurological, psychiatric, or head and neck disorders.&#xD;
      The research volunteers may be spouses of persons with SD and WC without a familial&#xD;
      relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a natural history study. Using neuroimaging techniques (positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (PET), the central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: (1) to map the&#xD;
      D1-like dopaminergic receptor binding in SD and WC patients as measured with PET using&#xD;
      [11C]NNC-112; (2) to map the nigro-strital dopaminergic function in SD and WC patients as&#xD;
      measured with PET using [18F]FDOPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies will determine neurotransmitter function in patients with ADSD and WC compared&#xD;
      to healthy subjects. The proposed research is expected to advance our understanding of the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of voluntary motor control of voice and hand movements in diseased&#xD;
      individuals as an important step in identifying possible mechanisms for potential&#xD;
      neuropharmacological interventions in these patients.&#xD;
