  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 60% of patients with DLBCL can be cured with a chemotherapy program. It is called&#xD;
      RCHOP-21 (Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, and Prednisone). It is given&#xD;
      once every 3 weeks, for 18 weeks. Each three weeks is a cycle. Some factors predict that you&#xD;
      may not be cured with R-CHOP-21. The most common ones are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage - how much DLBCL, PMBL, or FL3B you have&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LDH - a blood chemistry marker; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether you can do your normal daily activities. (performance status) We think that the&#xD;
           best way to cure more patients with poor risk factors is to add new treatment to R-CHOP.&#xD;
           You will get different chemotherapy after 4 cycles. This type of treatment is called&#xD;
           risk-adapted therapy.&#xD;

Consolidation C: Patients with biopsy proven disease after induction therapy. Patients whose bone marrow remain positive at interim restaging will have the option of getting an allogeneic[m3] stem cell transplant, in lieu of an ASCT, if they have an acceptable HLA match donor. The allogeneic[m4] stem cell transplant regimen will be decided by the MSK Bone Marrow Transplant Service.</description>

    <description>It consists of four drugs in a regimen called augRICE. It is given every 3 weeks for 2 cycles. After the rituximab on day 3, you will then be admitted to the hospital for 2 to 3 nights.&#xD;
Part 2: Stem Cell Collection, Part 3: High dose chemoradiotherapy and stem cell transplant. Your doctor may want you to get radiation therapy. If so, it will start 2 weeks before the highdose chemotherapy. This regimen is called CBV-N chemotherapy. It is given by vein in the hospital.</description>
