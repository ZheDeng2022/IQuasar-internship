  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinically widely used X-ray computed tomography examination has a low-grade radiation&#xD;
      effect and recently has attracted much attention concerning the possible adverse effects of&#xD;
      radiation on human body [ref. 1-5]. The radiation is harmful to human tissues and cells&#xD;
      mainly because it can interact with water (which makes up to 80% of cells) to generate&#xD;
      reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially the formation of hydroxyl radicals. So far as we&#xD;
      can reach, there is no report concerning the relation between X-ray computed tomography&#xD;
      examination and the blood ROS concentration. Therefore, we wish to conduct this study to&#xD;
      clarify if the routinely applied X-ray computed tomography examination may induce a higher&#xD;
      concentration of ROS in the peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be participants of health check program at our hospital. The only&#xD;
      enrollment condition will be a scheduled X-ray computed tomography examination for either&#xD;
      lung (20 cases) or heart (20 cases) of the study subject. Another 20 participants receiving&#xD;
      health check program without X-ray computed tomography examination will be included as the&#xD;
      control group. The formal consent will be delivered to the participants of health check&#xD;
      program several days before their admission for health check and will be retrieved before the&#xD;
      proceeding of health check.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements and comparison of ROS concentration will be performed in the sampled peripheral&#xD;
      blood before and after the performance of X-ray computed tomography examination during a&#xD;
      regular health check program. Totally 120 blood samples will be collected from included 60&#xD;
      study subjects within 3 months. Reactive oxygen species（ROS）levels will be measured by a&#xD;
      chemiluminescence (CL) analysing system (CLD-110, Tohoku Electronic Industrial, Sendai,&#xD;
      Japan).&#xD;
