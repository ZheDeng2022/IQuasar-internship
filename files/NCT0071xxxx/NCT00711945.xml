    <textblock>
      Pediatric Crohn's Disease is a life long disease , presenting early in life.As such , it is&#xD;
      imperative to be able to evaluate the risk for more severe disease and poorer outcomes when&#xD;
      making the decision which therapies to offer our patients. These decisions should be based&#xD;
      according to longer-term disease outcomes, such as whether they prevent disease relapse or&#xD;
      prolong remission [10-12]. However, for the most part, previous studies were not designed to&#xD;
      yield predictive parameters that could allow a clinician to differentiate which patients are&#xD;
      at a higher risk for relapse, or more likely to to have serious attacks or complications of&#xD;
      the disease or therapy. The ability to predict these risks would impact dramatically the way&#xD;
      CD patients are treated, allowing the clinician to tailor therapy, both type and intensity,&#xD;
      to each patient's individual risk for relapse and outcomes.In the present first phase of the&#xD;
      study , we will attempt to identify factors that predict relapse of the disease, focusing on&#xD;
      the use of calprotectin at onset and after clinical remission, and on the use of anti-glycan&#xD;
      antibodies, as well as disease severity, site and phenotype.&#xD;

      This proposal describes the first prospective large pediatric cohort study designed to look&#xD;
      simultaneously, from disease onset, at clinical, inflammatory, serological and therapeutic&#xD;
      parameters of CD, with standardized treatment regimens and long-term follow-up. The&#xD;
      exploratory study will delineate whether a sub-clinical inflammatory parameter&#xD;
      (calprotectin), performed post-treatment and after achieving remission, is indeed predictive&#xD;
      of time to relapse or relapse rate. We anticipate that patients with low calprotectin levels&#xD;
      are significantly less likely to relapse during the follow-up period, while patients with&#xD;
      persistent inflammation after induction of remission (high calprotectin levels) are more&#xD;
      likely to relapse early. We will also evaluate the relationships between various clinical and&#xD;
      sub-clinical parameters and CD disease outcomes, as well as the influence of treatments on&#xD;
      these parameters. Greater knowledge about the relationship between inflammatory and&#xD;
      serological markers, treatments chosen, and CD outcome will improve disease control in the&#xD;
      clinic and may offer insights as to how the clinician can modify the course of CD.&#xD;
      Furthermore, this study should answer the following question: in patients with clinical&#xD;
      improvement but ongoing inflammation, should we treat according to clinical symptoms or&#xD;
      should we treat according to sub-clinical laboratory data? Finally, without industry bias,&#xD;
      this study may offer ultimately the ability to model factors predictive of poorer outcomes,&#xD;
      and to compare the long-term benefits or hazards of treatments in use today.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The framework of the proposed study is development prospectively of an incident cohort of&#xD;
      ~300 +/- 30 newly diagnosed cases of CD over a period of two years by a team of pediatric&#xD;
      gastroenterologists that represent approximately 20 European IBD centers (the ESPGHAN 'Porto'&#xD;
      group). Multiple clinical and laboratory parameters will be recorded serially at intervals in&#xD;
      a standardized, pre-agreed format, at initial presentation and for the subsequent 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At initial presentation, each IBD clinic will confirm independently diagnosis of CD, as&#xD;
      opposed to any other inflammatory bowel condition, according to the Porto criteria . These&#xD;
      newly diagnosed untreated pediatric patients with CD must be under the age of 18. Exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will include abdominal surgery, pregnancy and indeterminate colitis. All&#xD;
      participating centers will file an IRB within their own organization. Consent will be sought&#xD;
      from each patient or patient's guardian and documented in their native language.&#xD;
      Participation in this study does not entail any novel therapeutic intervention, and as such&#xD;
      does not pose any risk to the patient. Most of the data to be collected during the study are&#xD;
      collected routinely during care of a CD pediatric patient, although there will be extra blood&#xD;
      and stool samples taken. Since it is standard to take blood for other tests during these&#xD;
      visits, for example to assess disease activity or the presence of anemia or other&#xD;
      complications, it is not anticipated that the blood draws will inhibit participation.&#xD;
      Therefore, we predict that almost all eligible patients (80%) that present at 'Porto' group&#xD;
      centers will be enrolled in this study. At each visit, a clinician will evaluate and record&#xD;
      the location of disease, height and weight, as well as disease activity (Pediatric Crohn's&#xD;
      Disease Activity Index, PCDAI; and CRP . A stool sample will be taken at all visits for&#xD;
      assessing fecal calprotectin (a measure of intestinal inflammation . Any disease&#xD;
      complications, such as fistulae, abscess or strictures will also be noted as well as the type&#xD;
      (if any) of treatment to be administered. There will be 6 predetermined standard visits at 0,&#xD;
      8, 12, 26, 52 and 78 weeks. Blood will be drawn at 0, 8, 12 and 52 weeks. Serum obtained from&#xD;
      blood samples will be divided before being frozen at minus 20 degrees centigrade in each&#xD;
      center. These serums will be transported to 'Hub' centers (to be selected), where they will&#xD;
      be stored long-term; they shall not be transferred to any other party. These samples will be&#xD;
      used to serotype the serological markers gASCA, pANCA, ACCA, ALCA and AMCA (serology&#xD;
      profile). .&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participating gastroenterologists have agreed on standardized treatment regimens to be&#xD;
      employed where possible and standardized follow-up protocols. The regimens and protocols were&#xD;
      defined at a meeting held in Porto in June 2005 and validated at the meeting held in Porto in&#xD;
      March 2007 . Use of standardized regimens removes treatment variability as a possible bias or&#xD;
      confounding factor during disease outcome analysis. Institution of a second treatment, due to&#xD;
      relapse or to lack of response, will be registered using a standardized relapse/lack of&#xD;
      response form .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, multivariate statistical analysis will be employed to search for significant&#xD;
      correlations between inflammatory and serological parameters and disease outcomes.&#xD;
