  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to investigate cognition in long term survivors of Primary&#xD;
      Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL). Sometimes caregivers as well as patients who no&#xD;
      longer have the disease report cognitive problems such as reduced memory or attentional&#xD;
      dysfunction and decreased quality of life. Unfortunately, little is known about what may&#xD;
      contribute to this cognitive dysfunction in part because PCNSL is a rare disease and&#xD;
      sensitive tests have not often been used in the research studies. This project is being&#xD;
      conducted to help understand what factors, such as radiation, may contribute to cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction and better define the relationship between brain structure and thinking in people&#xD;
      who have had PCNSL.&#xD;

      This is an international, multi-center project that will enroll as many as 118 subjects of&#xD;
      which approximately 35 will be enrolled at Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU).&#xD;
      Neuropsychological testing will consist of a battery of paper and pencil tests that examine&#xD;
      abilities such as memory, motor skills, attention and speed of information processing.&#xD;
      Questionnaires that assess quality of life will also be administered. These noninvasive tests&#xD;
      are administered by a trained examiner or neuropsychologist and last about 30 minutes.&#xD;
      Subjects will also undergo an MRI of the head which provides a picture of the brain's&#xD;
      structure by placing an individual inside a powerful magnet. Statistical analyses will&#xD;
      examine the relationship between the neuropsychological test scores and magnetic resonance&#xD;
      (MR) images as well as examine the contribution of factors such as radiation, age, surgery,&#xD;
      chemotherapy etc. to cognition.&#xD;
