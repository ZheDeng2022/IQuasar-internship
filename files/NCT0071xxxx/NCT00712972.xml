      The goal of our study is to present important anatomic considerations which should be&#xD;
      considered before knee injection is performed. Additionally, we have developed important&#xD;
      procedural augments to the traditional para-patellar injection techniques in order to exceed&#xD;
      the accuracy and safety previously reported for the infra-patellar approaches We have&#xD;
      developed an injection technique which mechanically is similar to current techniques&#xD;
      practiced and poses no additional risks or discomfort to the patient. The basis of our&#xD;
      technique and its success is through recognition of anatomic factors and avoidance of&#xD;
      possible iatrogenic injuries which exist when using other knee injection technique. The focus&#xD;
      of our study is to validate the clinical accuracy we have been obtaining using our technique&#xD;
      through fluoroscopically confirmed visualized confirmation of repeated intra-articular&#xD;
      deposit. Additionally we want to document the range of needle length we require to properly&#xD;
      access the knee joint in our population to substantiate the importance of needle length.&#xD;
      Needle length is a critical factor in obese patients whom have larger infra-patellar fat&#xD;
      pads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that when using a 6 inch 22 gage needle for intra-articular knee injections&#xD;
      through the medial joint line approach, while utilizing the medial wall of the lateral&#xD;
      femoral condyle as an intra-articular stop point for needle insertion, the accuracy of&#xD;
      intra-articular deposit will exceed the values currently reported in the literature which is&#xD;
      approximately 75% success rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prove this point we will be injecting 2 cc of radiocontrast dye into the joint space and&#xD;
      than immediatly view the joint flouroscopicly after the knee has been brought through 10&#xD;
      cycles of flexion and extension.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Injection into the knee joint, although considered a remedial procedure by much of the&#xD;
      medical community, is not as easy a procedure to reproducibly and accurately perform as one&#xD;
      would believe. Numerous authors have estimated that between 20 to over 30 percent of knee&#xD;
      injection procedures fail to deposit the injectate into the joint space (6),(7),(9) (11). In&#xD;
      response to the reportedly high complication rates associated with intra-articular deposit of&#xD;
      injectate, numerous authors have published different techniques, injection sites, and tricks&#xD;
      to help the clinician. Techniques such as air arthrography (12)(13), the backflow technique&#xD;
      (7), the triangle technique (11), and others have added complexity and time to a seemingly&#xD;
      easy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific anatomic relationships within the knee joint provide larger access windows and&#xD;
      relatively easier entry for some techniques than for others. Additionally, the presence of&#xD;
      hyaline articular cartilage, the smooth, nonreplicable joint surface integral to the&#xD;
      efficient and pain free articulation of joints adds another complexity and concern in access&#xD;
      to the knee joint. Iatrogenic damage to this cartilage is probable with some commonly&#xD;
      employed injection techniques. Damage to the articular surface is the anatomic equivalent of&#xD;
      arthritic pathologic change within the knee joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much of the confusion surrounding accurate intra-articular injection stems from the anatomic&#xD;
      relationships we are taught during our training. Anatomical atlases depict the layers of the&#xD;
      knee joint in such a fashion as there being a tangible and recognizable joint space to easily&#xD;
      insert a needle. This is not the case in the normal knee which does not have a knee effusion.&#xD;
      The reality is that the normal adult knee has 2 cc of synovial fluid dispersed as an&#xD;
      extremely thin film over the top of the articular cartilage. The synovial membrane in effect&#xD;
      rests directly on top of the articular cartilage and hence the joint space is actually a&#xD;
      potential space. Even though this is the case, there are three predominate areas of recess&#xD;
      within the knee joint where if the needle is accurately placed, this potential space can be&#xD;
      developed. These three regions are the inter-trochlear groove, inter-condylar notch, and the&#xD;
      suprapatellar pouch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inter-trochlear groove is the region on the anterior surface of the femur which lies&#xD;
      directly below the patella when the knee is in its extended position. The inter-trochlear&#xD;
      groove is covered with articular cartilage which is integral in maintaining normal pain free&#xD;
      patellofemoral articulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inter-condylar notch is a region of the femur on its most distal aspect which houses the&#xD;
      ACL and PCL tendons. The inter-condylar notch is not an articular region of the knee joint&#xD;
      and is not covered with articular cartilage. The fact that there is no articular cartilage in&#xD;
      the inter-condylar notch significantly reduces chances of iatrogenic cartilage damage.&#xD;
      Placement of the needle precisely into one of these spaces is crucial for a successful&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been debate as to the safest and most reliable technique for intra-articular knee&#xD;
      injections over the last decade. Five common procedures, including the technique studied in&#xD;
      this research protocol are currently employed by the medical community for access into the&#xD;
      knee joint. These five techniques all share the same basic materials and principles, and all&#xD;
      five carry the same risks associated with insertion of a foreign body into a joint space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medial and lateral infra-patellar techniques are the first two techniques considered.&#xD;
      Regardless of the side of the knee the needle is placed into, the infra-patellar technique&#xD;
      positions the needle between the patella and the femur while the knee is in the extended&#xD;
      position on the examination table. The infra-patellar injection technique uses a needle&#xD;
      endpoint position which lies within the intertrochlear groove.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medial and lateral joint line techniques, also known as the para-patellar techniques are&#xD;
      other commonly utilized techniques. The para-patellar injection techniques route of entry&#xD;
      into the knee joint is through the soft spot just proximal to the tibial plateau, on either&#xD;
      the medial or lateral side of the patellar ligament. In the para-patellar injection&#xD;
      techniques needle insertion is performed while the knee is flexed to 90 degrees off the edge&#xD;
      of the examination table and the end point is within the intercondylar notch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last injection site occasionally used, orientates the needle into the suprapatellar&#xD;
      pouch. This route of injection is at times chosen due to the fact that it is a reliable&#xD;
      region to aspirate a knee when there is a large effusion. Although the suprapatellar pouch is&#xD;
      the largest potential space in the knee joint, this space is essentially closed down in the&#xD;
      knee which lacks an effusion. Successful injection into the suprapatellar pouch is analogous&#xD;
      to perfect placement of a needle between two sequential pages in a book. When no joint&#xD;
      effusion is present, this space lacks any tactile stimulus to indicate proper needle&#xD;
      orientation and depth, and hence successful injections from this route are difficult and&#xD;
      unreliable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another issue plaguing current knee injection practices is the choice of needle used. The&#xD;
      vast majority of medical offices stock 1.5 inch long needles as this is by far the most&#xD;
      common production length available. Obviously other lengths are available, yet they are more&#xD;
      of a special order type item which is not on hand at the time of the knee injection. Needle&#xD;
      length is not a consideration to nearly all practitioners whom are performing knee&#xD;
      injections. This is partially due to the anatomic misconceptions of the intra-articular space&#xD;
      as a wide open and easily accessible region as depicted in anatomy texts. When injecting into&#xD;
      a knee using the para-patellar technique there are important structures the needle must pass&#xD;
      through before it will enter into the synovial space. Structures such as pre-patellar bursal&#xD;
      tissue, subcutaneous adipose, fascia, the infrapatellar fat pad, and possibly hypertrophic&#xD;
      thickened synovium are distinct anatomic structures which vary in depth and can quickly use&#xD;
      up the working length of a standard needle before it is able to access the intra-articular&#xD;
      space. With the growing obesity problem in America, the issue of adequate needle length is&#xD;
      becoming an increasingly important consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current literature regarding knee injections does not seem to account for required needle&#xD;
      length. Numerous studies, including the ones referred to in this protocol utilize needles&#xD;
      which are 2 inches in length or less, and these same studies report a low accuracy of&#xD;
      intra-articular penetrance with techniques which transverse the infra-patellar fat pad&#xD;
      (1),(2),(6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for accurate placement of a substrate directly into the knee joint has increased&#xD;
      over the last few years as the popularity of proteoglycan hyaluronic acid (HA) preparations&#xD;
      are growing in popularity for treatment of osteoarthritis (OA). Unlike steroid injections&#xD;
      largely utilized in the past for symptomatic treatment of OA, the HA preparations for&#xD;
      efficiency require accurate placement within the synovial pocket of the knee joint. Briefly&#xD;
      this difference is based upon the mechanism of action of these two macromolecules. Steroids&#xD;
      function as anti-inflammatory mediators, inhibiting the ability for recruitment and entry of&#xD;
      inflammatory cells into the knee joint. Because of this, inaccurate deposit of steroid&#xD;
      injections in a peri-articular location will still result in clinical benefits through a&#xD;
      paracrine mechanism (7),(8). HA preparations are made of proteoglycans, which are large&#xD;
      negatively charged protein polysaccharide molecules, which recruit water into the joint space&#xD;
      and articular cartilage. Proteoglycans function like a sponge by providing hydrodynamic&#xD;
      cushioning to the joint during weight bearing . Unlike steroid a preparation, if HA is&#xD;
      mistakenly injected into the peri-articular soft tissues, its clinical benefit is essentially&#xD;
      nullified (1), (6),(10). In relation to the above discussion on proper needle length,&#xD;
      inadvertent placement of HA into the infra-patellar fat pad as a result of too short of a&#xD;
      needle will result in the injected material to remain within the fat pad, unable to reach the&#xD;
      intra-articuar space where it will be effective. In a 5 subject MRI evaluation of the size of&#xD;
      the infra-patellar fat pad, Jackson et al. has shown size variations ranging from 1.8 to 2.2&#xD;
      inches between the skin and articular surface (1). Obviously a larger sample size is required&#xD;
      to achieve a more accurate distribution of pre-articular soft tissue mass but this reported&#xD;
      range does add validity to the importance of needle size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current hyaluronic acid preparations involve a series of 3-5 injections and currently have a&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness for pain relief for approximately 50% of patients receiving the series&#xD;
      of injections. Although this study is not intended to test or evaluate the above clinical&#xD;
      efficacy of HA, the fact that the HA injectate may be mistakenly deposited into the&#xD;
      infrapatellar fat pad secondary to improper needle length or poor technique may be an&#xD;
      important factor in its low clinical effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently authors such as Jackson (1), Wind (2) Toda (6), and others have reported excellent&#xD;
      success with intra-articular injections through the infra-patellar approach to the knee.&#xD;
      Their studies have touted the high accuracy in delivering a substrate into the&#xD;
      intra-articular space. Additionally their work has shown considerably lower accuracy in&#xD;
      intra-articular deposit via one of the joint line approaches. Their articles have set a&#xD;
      precedent in the medical community for the infra-patellar injection approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biggest concern we have with the infra-patellar approach is centered on damage to the&#xD;
      articular cartilage of the inferior surface of the patella as well as the trochlear groove of&#xD;
      the femur. There is very limited space between the patella and the femur in the joint which&#xD;
      lacks an effusion. MRI evaluation of a normal knee joint displays at most 1 - 2 mm of&#xD;
      potential space where a needle can be inserted into to provide a joint injection without&#xD;
      damage to articular cartilage. Radiographs provide a false interpretation of available free&#xD;
      space at the patellofemoral joint. Indeed the articular cartilage which resides in this joint&#xD;
      is very thick producing the radiolucent clear region appreciated on radiographs. The normal&#xD;
      thickness of articular cartilage on the condyles is 4.0 and 3.7 mm for the medial and lateral&#xD;
      sides respectively. The normal thickness of articular cartilage on the patella is 5 mm in&#xD;
      depth and holds the distinction of being the thickest layer of articular cartilage in the&#xD;
      body (3). The correct placement of the injection needle is further complicated by two&#xD;
      additional factors, one being no specific palpable entry point to insert the needle into. A&#xD;
      lack of a definitive palpable entry point results in estimation and clinical experience to&#xD;
      provide the initial starting point. Secondly, with the infra-patellar injection site there is&#xD;
      no definitive palpable end point to aid in stopping the insertion of the needle. This lack of&#xD;
      end point unfortunately results in excessive insertion of the needle with iatrogenic&#xD;
      articular trauma produced by the cutting edge of the needle tip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second consideration associated with the reported successful nature of intra-articular&#xD;
      dissemination through the infrapatellar approach concerns the &quot;blowout&quot; force generated by&#xD;
      hydrodynamic pressures. Because no definitive end point of needle insertion in this region&#xD;
      exists until after the needle tip has traversed the articular cartilage surface, forceful&#xD;
      injection, even with some pre-emptive needle withdrawal, will cause the dye to initially be&#xD;
      forced into the articular cartilage substrate before it can be extravisated out into the&#xD;
      articular space. This forced evacuation out through the cartilage is due to the molecular&#xD;
      structure of hyaline cartilage, its collagen fiber orientation, and its resultant resilience&#xD;
      to surface shear forces. Indeed the collagen fiber network restricts absorption of fluid to&#xD;
      only 20% of the cartilage's potential volume, all other fluid will resultantly be forcefully&#xD;
      evacuated from the extra cellular matrix into the joint space. (4) a fluid bolus of a couple&#xD;
      of cc results in the cartilage's inability to retain the fluid in its extracellular matrix&#xD;
      resulting in a &quot;blowout&quot; of the artiticular surface to allow release of the material into the&#xD;
      joint space. Although this forceful extravisation provides fluoroscopic evidence of&#xD;
      successful fluid bolus placement into the joint space, it does so at the cost of the&#xD;
      integrity of the articular cartilage at the injection site. This is in contrast to the&#xD;
      accommodating, compliant, and hydrophobic nature of adipose tissue in the infrapatellar fat&#xD;
      pad which tends to expand around an injected fluid bolis and retain the injected substrate&#xD;
      resulting in failed intra-articular deposit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above observations suggest that although the infra-patellar approach does effectively&#xD;
      provide for a means of injection into the knee joint's space, it does so at a cost to the&#xD;
      articular cartilage which in this author's opinion is an unnecessary risk and complication.&#xD;
      When one considers that the common HA preparations on the market today require between 3 - 5&#xD;
      total injections, and the fact that repeat intra-articular treatments are often provided on a&#xD;
      biannual basis, the potential for iatrogenic injury quickly multiplies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of our study is to present important anatomic considerations which should be&#xD;
      considered before knee injection is performed. Additionally, we have developed important&#xD;
      procedural augments to the traditional para-patellar injection techniques in order to exceed&#xD;
      the accuracy and safety previously reported for the infra-patellar approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is not intended to directly compare our results against those achieved in the&#xD;
      infra-patellar technique, this research does not refute the excellent clinical results&#xD;
      achievable through the infra-patellar techniques. The intention of this study is to show that&#xD;
      utilizing our specific technique for para-patellar knee injection we can achieve accurate&#xD;
      intra-articular deposit over 95% of the time, which is a considerable improvement over&#xD;
      previously reported results using the para-patellar approach (1). Additionally our technique&#xD;
      avoids the theoretical iatrogenic injury associated with the infra-patellar approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have developed an injection technique which mechanically is similar to current techniques&#xD;
      practiced and poses no additional risks or discomfort to the patient. The basis of our&#xD;
      technique and its success is through recognition of the factors mentioned above. The focus of&#xD;
      our study is to validate the clinical accuracy we have been obtaining using this technique&#xD;
      through fluoroscopically confirmed visualized confirmation of repeated intra-articular&#xD;
      deposit. Additionally we want to document the range of needle length we require to properly&#xD;
      access the knee joint in our population to substantiate the importance of needle length.&#xD;
      Needle length is a critical factor in obese patients whom have larger infra-patellar fat pads&#xD;
      All intra-articular injection will be performed by, Drs Harold Battenfield and Brian Drake.&#xD;
      The study population will be equally divided between the two such that each investigator will&#xD;
      inject an even number of knees. The distribution of the patients to each physician will be&#xD;
      randomized based upon time of presence. Drs Battenfield and Drake will alternate &quot;turns&quot;&#xD;
      where the first patient will be injected by one physician than the next sequential patient&#xD;
      will be injected by the other physician until a significant number of injections have been&#xD;
      performed The study population will consist of patients already receiving a knee arthroscopy&#xD;
      at our institution. It is important to note that the study information will be kept&#xD;
      completely separate and isolated from the operative patient chart. All involved patients will&#xD;
      be issued a study number and any information recorded will be done so under that number. All&#xD;
      patients involved in the study will have their sex, height, weight, and success of attempted&#xD;
      insertion recorded. No names, no birthdates, no medical record numbers, nor any other&#xD;
      specific and identifiable information will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This entire procedure will be performed after the patient has been administered the general&#xD;
      anesthesia as is customary during a knee arthroscopy. The injection protocol adds less than 2&#xD;
      minutes to the surgical time of the arthroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to test our hypothesis we will draw up 2 cc of radiopaque dye (Isovue dye) into a 5&#xD;
      cc syringe attached to a 6 inch 22 gage spinal needle utilizing sterile technique. This&#xD;
      injection is performed on the same knee as is scheduled for arthroscopy. The patient will be&#xD;
      positioned into the standard arthroscopy leg immobilizer which allows the leg to hang&#xD;
      dependently in a 90 degree flexed position, which mimics the typical position as would be&#xD;
      experienced in the office.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anatomic location for needle penetration is easily found in even obese patients by simple&#xD;
      digital palpation of the &quot;soft spot&quot; which exists directly above the tibial plateau. This&#xD;
      soft spot will then be marked with a small blunt object. We will use a &quot;clickable&quot;&#xD;
      retractable ink pen while the ink cartage is in its retracted position to provide a nice&#xD;
      &quot;bullseye&quot; demarcation on the skin surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the site is marked the skin surface will be cleansed with a betadine based prepping&#xD;
      solution utilizing sterile technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The needle will be inserted through the predemarcated site, and the trajectory of the needle&#xD;
      will be directed toward the medial wall of the lateral femoral condyle, within the&#xD;
      inter-condylar notch. Insertion of the needle will proceed until confirmed tactile impact&#xD;
      against the condyle is achieved. The depth the needle inserted into the skin will then be&#xD;
      sterilely marked on the needles shaft with a sterile marking pen, and this length is later&#xD;
      measured. Without retraction of the needle the 2 cc of radiopaque dye will then be injected&#xD;
      into the knee joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The injection volume of 2 cc is chosen based upon the fact that this is the volume of fluid&#xD;
      commonly packaged into viscosupplimentation (hyaluronic acid) preparations. The 2cc volume&#xD;
      will more closely correlate with in office injection conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the dye is successfully placed within the joint, and the needle removed, the joint will&#xD;
      than be flexed and extended a total of 10 revolutions ending in an extended position. This&#xD;
      flexion and extension cycling provides an opportunity for intra-articular injectate to&#xD;
      disseminate around the joint's surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this point mobile fluoroscopy will be utilized to visualize the knee in both the AP and&#xD;
      Lateral planes. Evaluation of proper placement of the dye is confirmed by noting the&#xD;
      extravasation characteristics of the dye fluoroscopically. Successful injection into the&#xD;
      joint space is anticipated to result in uniform distribution of the dye along the margins of&#xD;
      the femoral condyles, evenly coating the joint surface as previously reported by Jackson (1),&#xD;
      Wind(2), and Toda(6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, if radiopaque dye is injected into the fat pad an entirely different&#xD;
      radiographic image will result. The infra-patellar fat pad acts as an anatomic &quot;cork&quot;&#xD;
      preventing materials injected into its substance from entering into the knee joint where it&#xD;
      is intended to go. If the needle does not penetrate the synovial membrane than there is a low&#xD;
      likelihood of extra-articular material from entering the knee joint. This is a normal&#xD;
      anatomic phenomena that our bodies utilize to help prevent intra-articular infections. The&#xD;
      joint space is in effect a protected region of the body, much like the central nervous system&#xD;
      is protected by the blood brain barrier. If our injection technique inaccurately places the&#xD;
      radiopaque dye into the infra-patellar fat pad, the result will be a well circumscribed&#xD;
      radiopaque &quot;blob&quot; which sits extra-articularly and is easily recognized by the post-injection&#xD;
      floroscopy. Authors such as Jackson (1), Wind (2), and Toda (6) have shown the accumulation&#xD;
      phenomenon of injected substrate into the infra-patellar fat pad With this procedure&#xD;
      complete, the patient's leg will be prepped and draped in the normal standard manner and the&#xD;
      arthroscopy will be carried out as would normally be performed.&#xD;

        The patient population often encountered in our practice includes a variety of patient&#xD;
        demographics. We enjoy patient referrals from numerous primary care physicians in the&#xD;
        community as well as through Oklahoma State University Medical Center's emergency&#xD;
        department. Additionally we work closely with one of the regions primary workers&#xD;
        compensation agencies. Because of our numerous referral resources, our patient population&#xD;
        is considerably varied and provides an ample mixture of patient demographics to allow us to&#xD;
        reasonably extrapolate and compare our study results to the general population&#xD;
