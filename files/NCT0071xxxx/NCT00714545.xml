      This study is a prospective study of patients treated at Scripps Clinic with intracoronary&#xD;
      brachytherapy for recurrent restenosis within drug eluting stents.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated protocol examining the effectiveness of intracoronary&#xD;
      brachytherapy using the Novoste beta-emitting catheter for recurrent stenosis after treatment&#xD;
      with multiple drug-eluting stents. While intracoronary brachytherapy has been used for this&#xD;
      purpose by clinicians for some time, data supporting this clinical decision-making is&#xD;
      lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, when cardiologists find restenosis after implanting a drug-eluting stent, they&#xD;
      often place a stent that elutes a different drug within that stent. If a patient presents&#xD;
      with restenosis in the segment that has already been treated with both sirolimus and&#xD;
      paclitaxel-eluting stents, further options are limited. Intracoronary brachytherapy is often&#xD;
      used in this scenario, but the efficacy of this approach has not been well studied. The&#xD;
      investigators recently reviewed the clinical outcomes of five patients who underwent&#xD;
      intracoronary radiation after drug-eluting stents. They discovered only one episode of target&#xD;
      vessel revascularization and no episodes of stent thrombosis. While this sample is small,&#xD;
      investigators believe that a prospective study will provide important information regarding&#xD;
      this approach.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Eligible for percutaneous coronary intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Target lesion with recurrent restenosis (&gt;50% by visual estimate) previously treated&#xD;
             with any 2 or more combination of DES stents.&#xD;

          5. Target lesion is located within a native coronary artery or bypass graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Be reliable, cooperative and willing to comply with all protocol-specified procedures&#xD;
             and follow-up.&#xD;
