      To define the frequency of T regulatory cells in peripheral blood of RCC patients before and&#xD;
      after nephrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis: That nephrectomy results in a normalisation of peripheral blood T regs in&#xD;
      early stage RCC, and a lowering of T regs in advanced RCC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      T regulatory cells (T regs) are a recently identified subset of T cells with inhibitory&#xD;
      functions on the immune system. In cancer, it has been shown that there is an increased&#xD;
      proportion of T regs in several different human malignancy states. T regs are found to be&#xD;
      elevated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, draining lymph nodes and in the primary tumor&#xD;
      itself. There has also been correlation between peripheral blood T regs and tumor stage,&#xD;
      tumor relapse and survival. It has been proposed that the T regs are activated and expanded&#xD;
      by factors produced by the tumor microenvironment. They are thought to play a role in&#xD;
      preventing or demising host T-cell responses against cancer, including a suboptimal host&#xD;
      responses to vaccine strategies. Strategies to reduce T regs in cancer patients are being&#xD;
      explored as a novel immunologic anti-cancer approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal cell cancer (RCC) is a tumor with well-known immune-mediated phenomena such as&#xD;
      spontaneous regression. There is paucity of data on T regs in RCC. We propose to study the&#xD;
      frequency of peripheral blood T regs before and after nephrectomy for RCC. We will document&#xD;
      the baseline frequency of T regs in RCC and if nephrectomy results in a change in levels. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that nephrectomy will lower peripheral T regs to normal levels in early stage&#xD;
      RCC, and will reduce peripheral T reg levels in advanced RCC patients. If found to be so, T&#xD;
      regs could in future be used as an indicator of disease recurrence in early stage RCC. In&#xD;
      advanced RCC, lowering of T reg levels may help explain the previous hypothesis that&#xD;
      debulking nephrectomy results in improved anti-tumor immunity, provide rationale for second&#xD;
      debulking procedures, and be correlated with subsequent clinical course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main laboratory technique is flow cytometry. This will be a pilot study with small&#xD;
      patient numbers. Only blood samples are required.&#xD;
