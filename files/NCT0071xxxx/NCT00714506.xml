      This research study will assess the effects of two different programs on weight, body&#xD;
      composition, mobility and improved health. Measures of health will include functional&#xD;
      abilities, and physical performance. The 2 programs being tested will be provided the same&#xD;
      physical activity program which will include aerobic activity and resistance (weight)&#xD;
      training. The intervention study will last up to 1 year with follow-up at 6 months and yearly&#xD;
      phone calls thereafter.&#xD;
