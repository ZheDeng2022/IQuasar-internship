      This is a a prospective study of the WallFlex™ Biliary Partially-covered Stent designed to&#xD;
      collect data to support regulatory clearance by the FDA in the United States and to determine&#xD;
      the functionality of the WallFlex™ Biliary Partially Covered Stent as a Palliative treatment&#xD;
      for malignant bile duct obstruction.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants With Absence of Recurrent Biliary Obstruction</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months post treatment or prior to death, whichever came first</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as absence of recurrent biliary obstruction defined as absence of biliary symptoms. Biliary symptoms, included, but were not limited to jaundice, itching, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and dark urine. Symptom assessment occurred during the Screening/Baseline period and at all follow-up time points.</description>

    <measure>Number of Adverse Events Related to the Device and/or Procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>From time participant signs informed consent until time participant exits study (up to 6 months following stent placement)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of adverse events (serious and non-serious) related to the device and/or procedure were collected following informed consent, treatment, and at all follow-up timepoints.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Technical Stent Placement Success</measure>
    <time_frame>Initial stent placement procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Technical stent placement success defined as the ability to deploy the stent in satisfactory position across the stricture</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Occurrence of Re-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months post-initial study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A re-intervention is defined as any type of endoscopic, percutaneous, or surgical procedure to improve biliary drainage after insertion of the initial study stent. Re-intervention does not include a second WallFlex stent placement during the 7 days post initial placement as a second stent could have been placed due to misplacement or failure to cover the entire stricture.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Recurrent Biliary Obstruction</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Biliary obstruction symptoms were collected at all follow-up visits post treatment and included but not limited to jaundice, itching, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and dark urine. The time to recurrent biliary obstruction was recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Bilirubin</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month following stent placement</time_frame>
    <description>Bilirubin change at 1 month following stent placement as assessed against bilirubin at baseline.</description>
