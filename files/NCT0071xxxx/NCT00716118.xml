      The cryopreservation of oocytes (OC) has broad applications in the field of reproductive&#xD;
      endocrinology for the management of clinical problems in both fertile and infertile patients.&#xD;
      For example, young fertile women who are diagnosed with malignancies may freeze their oocytes&#xD;
      before initiating potentially toxic radiation or chemical cancer therapy which may render&#xD;
      them sterile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the OC technology, we have established a frozen oocyte bank using healthy, compensated&#xD;
      egg donors who have been pre- screened using FDA criteria. Following an appropriate&#xD;
      quarantine time, oocytes can be thawed and offered to women diagnosed with premature ovarian&#xD;
      failure or diminished ovarian reserve. This application of OC has already shown promise by&#xD;
      eliminating the logistical and clinical complications associated with traditional oocyte&#xD;
      donation using fresh oocytes from donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the societal perspective, cryopreservation of surplus oocytes in an IVF cycle may remove&#xD;
      some of the social and moral objections surrounding embryo cryopreservation. Currently, our&#xD;
      frozen oocyte pregnancy rate (56%) is equivalent to our frozen embryo pregnancy rate (45%).&#xD;
      Patients, who have completed their families, find it easier to discard oocytes versus&#xD;
      embryos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, women who make a personal choice to delay childbearing may be offered the option to&#xD;
      preserve their oocytes with the potential for later use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two distinct techniques currently being used for oocyte cryopreservation are: 1)&#xD;
      controlled-rate freezing and 2) vitrification. Controlled-rate freezing shares some&#xD;
      similarities with the basic technology employed for embryo cryopreservation in nearly every&#xD;
      IVF program. The technique involves the slow freezing of embryos in cryoprotectant solutions,&#xD;
      often combined with a computer-controlled freezer to regulate temperature changes. Attempts&#xD;
      to improve our understanding of oocyte cryobiology have been mostly empirical using trial and&#xD;
      error. Only limited experience has been gained by adopting scientific models able to predict&#xD;
      the effect of &quot;cryo&quot; stress imposed on oocytes using various freezing methods (Fuller and&#xD;
      Paynter, 2004; Paynter, 2005). In the absence of properly designed studies, advances in&#xD;
      clinical experience with oocyte freezing have been very limited. One of the major obstacles&#xD;
      to the implementation of oocyte freezing had been the inability to achieve reproducible high&#xD;
      survival rates owing to an important effect on the intracellular organelles. For example, due&#xD;
      to its sensitivity at low temperature, the metaphase II spindle has always been considered&#xD;
      susceptible to structural alterations which potentially might interfere with normal&#xD;
      chromosome segregation at meiosis II. Additionally, the essential role of mitochondria in&#xD;
      normal cell function, fertilization and early embryo development has previously been&#xD;
      described (Jones et al., 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our recently developed modified freeze-thaw protocol has consistently shown high recovery&#xD;
      rates, leading to optimism that oocyte storage could at last become available in clinical&#xD;
      practice. But it remains to be demonstrated that excellent post-thaw survival coincides with&#xD;
      cellular integrity and unaltered developmental competence. Therefore, prior to recommending&#xD;
      the adoption of oocyte cryopreservation, one of our aims is to document the possible effect&#xD;
      of cryo- preservation at the meiotic spindle and mitochondrial levels. An important aim of&#xD;
      our study is to assess the post-thaw viability and organelle integrity of oocytes using: 1) a&#xD;
      conservative technique [PolScope analysis of meiotic spindle] and 2) a non-conservative&#xD;
      technique [Fluorescence microscopy analysis of the meiotic spindle and mitochondria] using&#xD;
      our oocyte cryopreservation protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuing development in freezing technology is occurring rapidly. It can be anticipated&#xD;
      that in the near future, egg freezing will become as successful as embryo cryopreservation.&#xD;
      Finally, as more clinical experience with egg freezing accumulates, acceptable outcome data&#xD;
      will determine the future of egg freezing. Until then, oocyte cryopreservation should be used&#xD;
      in carefully selected clinical cases with full disclosure to the patient regarding risks and&#xD;
      limited success rates.&#xD;
