  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a uniformly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder&#xD;
      for which there is no known cure. In a novel attempt to widen the search for potential&#xD;
      therapeutic agents, a NINDS- led cooperative group performed an in-vitro screening program of&#xD;
      1040 FDA approved drugs in over 28 assays relevant to various neurodegenerative disorders.&#xD;
      Several cephalosporins showed hits in ALS relevant assays. Efficacy was noted in models&#xD;
      suggesting increased expression of the astrocytic glutamate transporter, EAAT2, as well as&#xD;
      models of superoxide dismutase mediated toxicity. Ceftriaxone is a third generation&#xD;
      cephalosporin with good CNS penetration, a long half-life, and was effective in both types of&#xD;
      ALS assays. Ceftriaxone has calcium binding activity, antioxidant properties, and rescues&#xD;
      motor neurons in culture from chronic glutamate toxicity. Since completion of the original&#xD;
      NINDS screen, Ceftriaxone has been shown to increase by three fold EAAT2 activity in rodent&#xD;
      brains, due to ceftriaxone's ability to increase EAAT2 promotor activation This program is&#xD;
      for the use of ceftriaxone in ALS for compassionate care. Currently ceftriaxone is approved&#xD;
      by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating bacterial infections but not for&#xD;
      treating ALS. However, there is an ongoing phase I study -by NEALS Consortium and the&#xD;
      National Institute of Health- with three cohorts -a placebo group and two groups receiving&#xD;
      either 2 or 4 grams of ceftriaxone daily-. Unfortunately there are only a limited number of&#xD;
      patients being enrolled and the next phase of the project will not be undertaken until next&#xD;
      year. At this point there are ALS patients unable to participate in this Phase I trial and&#xD;
      unlikely to be alive when the next phase of study begins. Some of these patients want to&#xD;
      receive the drug and are willing to pay for the drug and nursing care. We are therefore&#xD;
      requesting a compassionate use protocol for these patients who request the medication and are&#xD;
      willing to pay for the drug and nursing care to administer it. Dr. Terry Heiman-Patterson&#xD;
      will supervise the administration and safety monitoring including labs for renal and hepatic&#xD;
      function as well as IV site inspection.&#xD;
