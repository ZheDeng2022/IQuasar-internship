  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the bioequivalence of the test product&#xD;
      Hospira Iron Sucrose 20 mg/mL (Hospira, Inc.) to the reference product Venofer® 20 mg/mL&#xD;
      following intravenous administration to healthy subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron is essential to the synthesis of hemoglobin (Hb) to maintain oxygen transport and to the&#xD;
      function and formation of other physiologically important heme and nonheme compounds. Iron&#xD;
      deficiency may be caused by blood loss during dialysis, increased erythropoiesis following&#xD;
      administration of epoetin, and insufficient absorption of iron from the gastro-intestinal&#xD;
      tract. Most dialysis patients require intravenous iron supplementation to replenish iron&#xD;
      stores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron sucrose is used to replenish body iron stores in patients with iron deficiency on&#xD;
      chronic hemodialysis and receiving erythropoietin. In these patients iron deficiency is&#xD;
      caused by blood loss during dialysis procedure, increased erythropoiesis, and insufficient&#xD;
      absorption of iron from the gastrointestinal tract. Most hemodialysis patients require&#xD;
      intravenous iron to maintain sufficient iron stores to achieve and maintain a hemoglobin&#xD;
      level of 11-12 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria after screening will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive 100 mg of iron sucrose as either Hospira Iron Sucrose or Venofer®.&#xD;
