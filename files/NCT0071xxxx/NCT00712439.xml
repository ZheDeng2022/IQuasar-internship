        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men or women 18 years or older with diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes who have&#xD;
             reported symmetrical painful symptoms in distal extremities for 1-5 years prior to the&#xD;
             study and whose symptoms are attributable to sensorimotor diabetic peripheral&#xD;
             neuropathy (DPN).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at&#xD;
             screening/randomization, and must use medically acceptable methods of birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has pain score of at least 4 on the 11-point Likert numerical rating scale at&#xD;
             screening. Potential patients should not be informed of the pain intensity eligibility&#xD;
             criterion prior to screening or randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a mean baseline week pain intensity of at least 4 on the 11-point Likert&#xD;
             scale at the end of a one-week pre-treatment period and has completed at least 4 days&#xD;
             of diary entries during the baseline week.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is on stable regimen of antidiabetes medication at screening that can be&#xD;
             maintained during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≤11% at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has FPG ≤310 mg/dL at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have a minimum washout of greater than 5 times the half-life of the drug&#xD;
             of any of several medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients currently treated with gabapentin or pregabalin at screening may be eligible&#xD;
             for the study, but must have tapering period wherein the dose of gabapentin is reduced&#xD;
             gradually over a period of at least 7 days plus a 2-day or 3-day washout of gabapentin&#xD;
             or pregabalin, respectively, prior to start of the Baseline Week.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have adequate eyesight to complete questions on the DiaryPro and SitePro.&#xD;
             If a patient is unable to do so (for reasons other than severe eye disease) but a&#xD;
             caregiver is available to complete these tasks following instruction from the patient,&#xD;
             the caregiver may be trained to accomplish these tasks&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have previously not responded to treatment for DPN with gabapentin at&#xD;
             doses of ≥1200 mg/day or pregabalin at doses ≥300 mg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who previously experienced dose-limiting adverse effects that prevented&#xD;
             titration of gabapentin to an effective dose.&#xD;
&#xD;

             particular, amputations other than toes, non-diabetic neurologic disorders (e.g.&#xD;
             phantom limb pain), and skin conditions affecting sensation in painful limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has skin conditions in the area affected by the neuropathy that could alter&#xD;
             sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is in an immunocompromised state.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has an estimated creatinine clearance of &lt;60 ml/min calculated using the&#xD;

             weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has any abnormal chemistry or hematology results that are deemed by the&#xD;
             investigator to be clinically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a history of substance abuse within the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has had 1 or more visits to an emergency room or hospital within the previous&#xD;
             30 days due to hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a history of seizure (except for infantile febrile seizure) or is at risk&#xD;
             of seizure due to head trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a history of pernicious anemia, untreated hypothyroidism, chronic&#xD;
             hepatitis B or C, hepatitis within the past 3 months, or HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has any other serious medical condition that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator would jeopardize the safety of the patient or affect the validity of the&#xD;
             study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Continuing use of any concomitant medication excluded by Inclusion Criterion 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
