  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the study is to assess the feasibility of the use of blood for the&#xD;
      detection of EGFR mutations in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the use of immuno-separation techniques to enrich the tumor cell population in&#xD;
           the blood of NSCLC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the use of denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) assay for&#xD;
           the detection of EGFR mutations in the blood of NSCLC patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The oral tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR),&#xD;
      gefitinib and erlotinib, have produced dramatic responses, encouraging response rates and&#xD;
      possibly improved survival in a subset of NSCLC patients. Evidence suggests that somatic EGFR&#xD;
      mutations in the tumor are at present the single most reliable biological marker of&#xD;
      predicting response to EGFR TK inhibitors. In addition, these mutations may be an early event&#xD;
      in the pathogenesis of NSCLC in a subset of patients. Unfortunately, the technology of EGFR&#xD;
      mutations sequencing incurs high costs and requires sufficient tissue, which is often a&#xD;
      problem in NSCLC. We hypothesize that EGFR mutations can be detected in the blood and propose&#xD;
      a study to determine the feasibility of detecting EGFR mutations in the blood of NSCLC&#xD;
      patients. We will approach newly diagnosed NSCLC patients as well as patients who are known&#xD;
      to be responding to the oral TK inhibitors. We will perform EGFR mutations on the tumors. For&#xD;
      the blood, we will use new immuno-separation techniques to isolate tumor cells and perform&#xD;
      denaturing high performance liquid chromatography to detect EGFR mutations. If we prove that&#xD;
      it is feasible to detect the mutations in the blood, we will follow up with a validation&#xD;
      study. Many applications can result if our hypothesis holds true: 1) it will be proof of&#xD;
      principle that our technique can effectively isolate and detect somatic mutations in&#xD;
      circulating tumor cells, 2) it will be a simple way to overcome the problem of insufficient&#xD;
      tumor samples, 3) it can be used for early detection of lung cancer if EGFR mutations proves&#xD;
      to be important in pathogenesis in a subset of patients and 4) the technology can be extended&#xD;
      to detect new mutations in patients who become resistant to oral TK inhibitors which can lead&#xD;
      to new targeted therapies.&#xD;

    <description>Patients from Group 1 will undergo thoracoscopy as part of their routine clinical management to drain off excess pleural fluid.
