      Anticholinergic antiparkinsonian agents often cause side-effects including cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, dry mouth, and constipation while they diminish antipsychotic-induced&#xD;
      parkinsonian symptoms. The introduction of second generation antipsychotics (SGA) brought&#xD;
      fewer neurological side effects. However, anticholinergic coprescription rates are still as&#xD;
      high as 12-65% in patients on SGA that are much higher than the incidence of EPS reported in&#xD;
      clinical trials (3-20%). This apparently discrepancy is likely explained, in part, by the&#xD;
      established tradition of routine use of this medications. Older patients are particularly&#xD;
      sensitive to anticholinergic side-effects due to age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics. In this study, we will examine the safety and benefits of reducing the dose&#xD;
      of a frequently prescribed anticholinergics, benztropine, on cognitive function,&#xD;
      extrapyramidal symptoms, and psychotic symptoms in older subjects with a primary psychotic&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Anticholinergic antiparkinsonian agents (AAAs) are frequently prescribed in patients with a&#xD;
      primary psychotic disorder either to treat or prevent the emergence of antipsychotic induced&#xD;
      extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are by definition&#xD;
      associated with fewer neurological side effects. This would be expected to be associated with&#xD;
      a lower use of AAAs. However, in a recent prescription survey, Park and colleagues found that&#xD;
      while the rate of concomitant use of antiparkinsonian agents dropped by 9.2% in patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia after changing their antipsychotic from typical antipsychotics to SGAs, 30% of&#xD;
      prescriptions for SGAs included a concomitant antiparkinsonian agent. This is consistent with&#xD;
      the results of other cross-sectional surveys demonstrating anticholinergic co-prescription&#xD;
      rates of 12 - 65% in patients treated with SGA. These high rates are remarkable especially&#xD;
      when one considers that the incidence of EPS reported in past clinical trials using SGAs (3 -&#xD;
      20%) is much lower than this reported co-prescription rate. This apparent discrepancy is&#xD;
      likely explained, in part, by the established tradition of prophylactic (or routine) use of&#xD;
      AAAs for patients starting antipsychotic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adverse effects of AAAs are well known, and are particularly significant clinically in&#xD;
      the elderly, who are at high risk of cognitive impairment with AAAs. Anticholigergic effects&#xD;
      have been reported to impair cognitive function both globally as well as in specific domains,&#xD;
      including memory and executive functioning. The association between anticholinergic activity&#xD;
      and cognitive performance are also strongly supported by recent studies measuring serum&#xD;
      anticholinergic activity (SAA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, in addition to their well-known side effects such as dry mouth, blurred vision,&#xD;
      and constipation, they have also been reported to increase the risk of tardive kinesia and&#xD;
      have been claimed to have a negative impact on the clinical efficacy of antipsychotic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of these adverse effects, the World Health Organization has discouraged the&#xD;
      prophylactic use of AAAs, and a careful risk-benefit analysis is necessary for each&#xD;
      individual patient. Since most cases of antipsychotic-induced EPS present within 11 weeks of&#xD;
      initiation of antipsychotic treatment or a dosage increase, a trial of AAA taper and&#xD;
      discontinuation has been recommended following 3 months of regular AAA treatment. These&#xD;
      recommendations emerged prior to the widespread use of SGAs, and one might expect that&#xD;
      successful discontinuation of concomitant AAAs would be higher for SGAs than conventional&#xD;
      antipsychotics. AAA discontinuation trials for conventional antipsychotics have been&#xD;
      inconsistent, with some studies reporting favorable outcomes and others reporting&#xD;
      re-emergence of EPS. More recently Mori et al reported a favorable outcome following AAA&#xD;
      discontinuation for both cognition and EPS in patients maintained on chlorpromazine,&#xD;
      risperidone, or haloperidol in mixed age population with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only study of AAA discontinuation in older patients with schizophrenia also reported&#xD;
      improved cognitive function in a sample of 21 elderly inpatients with schizophrenia. However,&#xD;
      this study did not include extrapyramidal symptoms, psychopathology, or other side effects&#xD;
      from AAAs as outcome measures. Furthermore, improvement in cognitive function reported in&#xD;
      this study could be attributed to practice effects: the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment&#xD;
      Scale-Cognitive subscale was administered at intervals of 10 days - though the learning&#xD;
      effects of this scale have not been studied in patients with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Older patients with schizophrenia would be expected to be particularly sensitive to side&#xD;
      effects to both antipsychotics and AAAs due to age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics. However, in view of the well known adverse effects of AAAs in the elderly,&#xD;
      use of anticholinergic drugs is specifically included in the 2002 criteria for potentially&#xD;
      inappropriate medication used in older adults. This may be especially relevant to older&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia since their cognitive function is already impaired as a function&#xD;
      of the dual effects of age-related decline and the cognitive difficulties inherent to the&#xD;
      psychotic illness itself. Concomitant use of AAAs would be expected to lead to a further&#xD;
      decline in their cognitive and social functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore propose an open-label prospective trial to assess the feasibility of reducing&#xD;
      the dose of a frequently prescribed AAA at our Centre, benztropine, in older subjects with a&#xD;
      primary psychotic disorder on SGAs using validated assessment scales and methods. In order to&#xD;
      quantify the anticholinergic burden in these patients before and after AAA dose reduction,&#xD;
      serum anticholinergic activity will be also assessed.&#xD;
