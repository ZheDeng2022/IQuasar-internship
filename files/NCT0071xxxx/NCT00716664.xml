      The pilot study aims to evaluate the effects of a treatment series of gentle joint and muscle&#xD;
      movements (in addition to normal optimal care)on lung function, exercise capacity and posture&#xD;
      in stable adults with cystic fibrosis.&#xD;

      Study type:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, single-blinded, randomised control trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prospective subjects will be given written and verbal information about the project and&#xD;
           will be given at least 24 hours to consider entry to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will give written consent to participate in the project. The top copy will be&#xD;
           included in the patient's medical record and a copy placed in the patient's study file.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A letter will be written to the subject's General Practitioner outlining the purpose of&#xD;
           the study and inviting him/her to make contact to discuss the study in more detail if&#xD;
           there are any queries or concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the time of consent, the appointments for the duration of the interventions and&#xD;
           potential follow-up will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention for the treatment group A treatment series of gentle joint and muscle movements&#xD;
      (musculoskeletal interventions) will be undertaken by a physiotherapist, weekly, for six&#xD;
      weeks. A chaperone would be available if requested by the subject (the patients would be made&#xD;
      aware of this when informed about the study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiotherapy musculoskeletal assessment and intervention may last up to one hour and may&#xD;
      include one or a combination of the following techniques which are well described in&#xD;
      populations with postural changes, thoracic stiffness, discomfort and/or pain:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific, gentle oscillatory mobilisations to the rib cage and thoracic spine of the&#xD;
           subjects to improve joint alignment and mobility, and to reduce pain. These techniques&#xD;
           should optimise chest wall mechanics, improving the length-tension relationships of the&#xD;
           muscles and normalising movement to dysfunctional areas (Maitland et al. 2001; Mulligan&#xD;
           2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment of specific muscle dysfunction or tight muscle groups to further optimise&#xD;
           muscle length and biomechanical relationships in the area (Massery 2005), leading to&#xD;
           improved efficiency of recruitment and improved power output (Travell &amp; Simons 1983).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neural stretches consisting of specific stretches to the neural system, to improve the&#xD;
           neural dynamics aiming to reduce symptoms, increase range of motion and optimise nerve&#xD;
           conduction in order to normalise the working relationship of the joint and muscular&#xD;
           components of the area (Butler 1991).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuromuscular techniques restore normal movement through facilitation. Guidance by the&#xD;
           hands of the physiotherapist inhibits abnormal activity and facilitates a more optimal&#xD;
           muscular activity. Specific postural awareness exercises are used to educate and&#xD;
           re-establish normal movement, augmenting gains made with treatment (Carr &amp; Shepherd&#xD;
           1998).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Home programme to reinforce the progress during the treatment sessions consisting of no&#xD;
           more than three specific stretching or strengthening exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group The control group would be invited to undertake the measurements at similar&#xD;
      time intervals to the treatment group (0, 3, 6 and 12 weeks). They will receive their usual&#xD;
      care but no placebo intervention. The control group would be offered treatment after the&#xD;
      completion of data collection for the study, if the intervention is shown to be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement in lung function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improved thoracic excursion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction in chest wall pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement in exercise capacity. Potential risks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post treatment soreness lasting up to 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the event of undetected exclusion criteria there is the potential for a rib fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There may be a relative or transient risk of syncopal event or vagal stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection The outcome measures will be undertaken by an independent observer to&#xD;
      pre-agreed protocols, before the first intervention session (Week 0) and after the third&#xD;
      (Week 3) and sixth treatments (Week 6). Full lung function will be repeated at the end of the&#xD;
      intervention period. The outcome measurements will be repeated at six weeks (Week 12)&#xD;
      following the end of treatment to explore the sustainability of any treatment effects. On&#xD;
      completion of or withdrawal from the study, subjects will be invited to complete an exit&#xD;
      interview questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed Primary Outcome measure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). Secondary Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Forced vital capacity (FVC), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual analogue scale for pain (Huskisson 1974)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modified shuttle test (Bradley et al. 1999) monitoring oxygen saturation and heart rate&#xD;
           and Borg CR10 scale of perceived exertion (Borg 1982).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Cystic Fibrosis Quality of Life Questionnaire, section one: physical functioning -&#xD;
           Questionnaire I (Gee et al. 2000)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Flexi curve measurements of posture (Tillotson &amp; Burton 1991)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest wall excursion measurements (LaPier &amp; Cook 2000)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Full lung function will be measured ≤ one month prior to the start of the study and at&#xD;
           the end of the intervention period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire II - the subject's perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis and reporting The statistical analysis has been discussed with Mr&#xD;
      Michael Roughton, Statistician, Royal Brompton Hospital and Imperial College London.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation As there is no recent similar study available upon which to base a&#xD;
      sample size calculation this will be a pilot study. The study aims to recruit 10 to the&#xD;
      treatment group and 10 to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The quantitative outcomes will be analysed using the Mann-Whitney test&#xD;
      (assuming that this small set of data will not be normally distributed) to test for any&#xD;
      difference for each variable from baseline; and will be analysed at each assessment point to&#xD;
      establish the most beneficial length of treatment and the sustainability of any effects. The&#xD;
      results will be represented graphically and in tables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of any missing data, withdrawal or non-compliance the patients will be analysed&#xD;
      as 'intention to treat'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be allocated using &quot;the method of minimisation&quot; (Evans, Day, &amp; Royston) to&#xD;
      either the control or treatment group. This method weights a number of prognostic factors and&#xD;
      their potential influence upon the outcome (e.g. FEV1 severity, sex of the subject). Two&#xD;
      prognostic factors will be used reducing the predictability of which group hey will be&#xD;
      allocated to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects are then allocated using the method of minimisation using a computer generated&#xD;
      randomisation schedule running a minimisation algorithm thus ensuring a greater chance of a&#xD;
      subject being allocated to a group that will optimise the comparability of the groups since&#xD;
      the number of subjects being studied is small, but with the allocation still being subject to&#xD;
      randomisation principles. The randomisation will be carried out by an independent member of&#xD;
      the Department of Cystic Fibrosis and concealed from the independent observer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events Any adverse events will be documented in the patient's medical notes,&#xD;
      discussed with the medical staff and reported to the Chairman of the Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Protection Patient data will be coded to protect their identities. Written data will be&#xD;
      kept in a locked filing area within the Department of Cystic Fibrosis, Royal Brompton&#xD;
      Hospital. Data analysis will be done on a password protected computer. Back-up will be&#xD;
      maintained on a CD-ROM in a locked filing area within the Department of Cystic Fibrosis.&#xD;
