      Zonisamide (Zonegran) and sodium valproate (Epilim) are both medicines approved to treat&#xD;
      epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out the extent to which zonisamide may affect memory and&#xD;
      concentration, compared to sodium valproate. This will be investigated using cognitive tests&#xD;
      which are performed on a computer screen. Either zonisamide or sodium valproate will be added&#xD;
      as a second medicine to the one patients are currently taking, carbamazepine (Tegretol),&#xD;
      which will be continued throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned that about 80 people across Europe will take part in this study. For the&#xD;
      purpose of the study, patients will need to go to the study doctor's clinic 4 times and have&#xD;
      5 telephone calls. Involvement in the study might be as long as 20 weeks, but it could be as&#xD;
      short as 12 weeks. The length of the study and number of visits will depend on whether&#xD;
      patients have an accurate recording of previous seizures already, how many seizures they have&#xD;
      during the study, and whether they decide to continue or to stop treatment after the study is&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult subjects with a clinical diagnosis of non-symptomatic (i.e., idiopathic or unknown&#xD;
      cause) localisation-related epilepsy, with partial onset seizures with or without secondary&#xD;
      generalisation, who are receiving fixed dose carbamazepine as their only therapy or can be&#xD;
      transferred to carbamazepine (as their only therapy) in the two months before the study&#xD;
      baseline. Subjects must require addition of another anti-epileptic drug (AED) to their&#xD;
      anti-epileptic therapy, either because they continue to have seizures (i.e., are not&#xD;
      controlled), or because they wish to switch to another AED for other reasons (e.g., they&#xD;
      tolerate another drug better).&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of non-symptomatic (i.e., idiopathic or&#xD;
             cryptogenic) localisation-related epilepsy with partial onset seizures with or without&#xD;
             secondary generalisation according to International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE)&#xD;
             classification27. Diagnosis should be clinically established by history, by previous&#xD;
             electroencephalogram (EEG) and by previous magnetic resonance imaging or computer&#xD;
             tomography of the brain, consistent with localisation related epilepsy. No lower or&#xD;
             upper limit of baseline seizures is defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Able and willing to sign informed consent form (ICF) in accordance with the&#xD;
             International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP)&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Male or female subjects aged ≥18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects taking carbamazepine as monotherapy at baseline or who can be transferred to&#xD;

             carbamazepine is within that recommended by the SPC. Carbamazepine dose has not been&#xD;
             altered during the previous 2 weeks prior to the start of the Baseline Period, or 6&#xD;
             weeks if the Baseline Period is to be shortened due to the availability of a&#xD;

             the study.&#xD;

             seizures (are refractory), or because they wish eventually to switch to another AED&#xD;
             for other reasons after the study completion (e.g. tolerability reasons).&#xD;
