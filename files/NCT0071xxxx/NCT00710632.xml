      RATIONALE: Screening tests may identify people with cancer who are at high risk of losing&#xD;
      weight and help doctors plan better treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well a new screening tool works in predicting&#xD;
      weight loss in patients with cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify people with cancer who are at greatest risk of future weight loss by the&#xD;
           development of a simple and practical screening tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the reliability of the Appetite and Symptom Questionnaire (part 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop a screening tool based on the ability of the optimal combination of items&#xD;
           from the three measures (ASQ, MUST, CRP) to predict clinically significant weight loss&#xD;
           over three months (part 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the sensitivity and specificity at various cut-points of the developed&#xD;
           screening tool in predicting clinically significant weight loss (&gt; 10% weight loss or&#xD;
           between 5% and 10% weight loss with a BMI &lt; 20 kg/m^2) over three months (part 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a two-part study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1: Patients are asked to complete the Appetite and Symptom Questionnaire (ASQ) on&#xD;
           two occasions, one week apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2: Patients are screened at baseline for risk of malnutrition using the&#xD;
           Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool. Blood samples are also taken at this time to&#xD;
           establish the level of C-reactive protein and patients complete the ASQ. Patients are&#xD;
           weighed using calibrated scales and height measurements are obtained. Patients are asked&#xD;
           about unplanned weight loss over the previous 3-6 months. Patients are weighed again at&#xD;
           3 months. Percentage weight loss is calculated at 3 months.&#xD;
