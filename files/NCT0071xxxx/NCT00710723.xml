    <textblock>
      In assisted reproduction technology (ART), cryopreservation of embryos maximizes the&#xD;
      potential of IVF cycles. Currently different cryopreservation methods are used, the&#xD;
      conventional slow freezing method and vitrification. There is, therefore an immediate need to&#xD;
      assess which cryopreservation technique is preferential in human IVF. In this prospective&#xD;
      randomised study conventional slow freezing and vitrification, using the Hemi-straw carrier&#xD;
      system, of human day 3 embryos were compared.&#xD;

      1. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although there are studies that reported successful pregnancies after transfer of&#xD;
           vitrified cleavage stage embryos, most of the studies focused on the vitrification of&#xD;
           oocytes and blastocysts. As far as we know, there is only one report of a randomised&#xD;
           prospective study were both common freezing methods -conventional slow freezing and&#xD;
           vitrification (making use of the nylon loop system with 40% ethylene glycol), were&#xD;
           compared for day 3 embryos (Rama Raju, Haranath et al., 2005). They report an&#xD;
           implantation and pregnancy rate (14,9% and 35,0% respectively) with vitrification, which&#xD;
           is significantly higher than the rates with the slow freezing protocol (4,2% and 17,4%&#xD;
           respectively). There is still need to more randomised studies which compares both&#xD;
           freezing methods for cleavage stage embryos .&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is evidence in literature that the vitrification method used at LUFc (hemi-straw)&#xD;
           is superior to the method used in the randomised trial of Rama Raju. Liebermann and&#xD;
           Tucker compared both the hemi-straw and cryoloop system for vitrification of day 3&#xD;
           embryos derived from abnormally fertilized zygotes (Liebermann and Tucker, 2002). They&#xD;
           found no statistical difference (p=0.07) in the survival rate, but the development after&#xD;
           24 hours was statistically better (p =0.002) using hemi-straws. Based on this study we&#xD;
           would even expect better results than the study of Rama Raju.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To further refine the effect of cryopreservation of cleavage stage embryos using the&#xD;
           hemi-straw system on developmental and implantation potential, the effectiveness of&#xD;
           vitrification (20% EG and 20% DMSO) was compared with slow freezing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients In this prospective study all patients underwent IVF or ICSI between are&#xD;
                included. Fresh embryo transfer was carried out on day 3 after insemination. All&#xD;
                surplus embryos who reached at least the 6 cell stage on day 3 and had less than&#xD;
                20% fragmentation were considered for cryopreservation using either vitrification&#xD;
                or slow freezing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Randomisation All embryos will be cryopreserved by one of the two methods.&#xD;
                Randomisation will take place at day 3 after insemination. For practical reasons,&#xD;
                all embryos frozen on the same day will be randomly assigned to the same freezing&#xD;
                method.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Results from retrospective data analysis Vitrification has been used as a standard&#xD;
                cryopreservation method at the LUFc since September 2004. So both slow freezing and&#xD;
                vitrification had been used for cryopreservation of day 3 embryos. The method used&#xD;
                depends on workload… so there was no randomisation. After a retrospective analysis&#xD;
                of these data (124 cycles 43 in the slow group and 81 in the vitrification group),&#xD;
                we noticed a significant increase in the survival of the embryos after&#xD;
                vitrification (81.2% in the vitrification group versus 45.8% in the slow group;&#xD;
                p&lt;0.0001). There was no significant difference in pregnancy rate between both&#xD;
                groups (19.8% in the vitrification versus 30.2% in slow group; p=NS).&#xD;
&#xD;
           So far we saw a remarkable difference in survival immediately or 24h after thawing, but&#xD;
           a clear difference in the implantation rate has not been discovered yet, therefore we&#xD;
           would like to start a randomised trial to proof a significant difference at the&#xD;
           implantation or pregnancy level.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Vitrification of human embryos Our method was based on the procedure described by&#xD;
                Vanderzwalmen et al 2000 (Vanderzwalmen, Bertin et al., 2000). First the embryos&#xD;
                were equilibrated (PBS with 17% HSA ) for 2 min at room temperature. They were then&#xD;
                transferred to the first vitrification solution (PBS + 14% HSA + 10% DMSO + 10%&#xD;
                ethylene glycol) for 2 min at RT followed by 30 sec in the second vitrification&#xD;
                solution (PBS + 12% HSA + 20 % DMSO + 20% ethylene glycol + ficoll + sucrose).&#xD;
                Finally the embryos were loaded as quickly as possible on the Hemi-straw in a&#xD;
                droplet of approximately 3 µl and immersed directly in liquid nitrogen. Afterwards&#xD;
                the hemi-straw was inserted in the CBS-straw.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Thawing after vitrification The hemi-straw holding exactly one embryo was pulled&#xD;
                out of the CBS straw and immediately immersed into 3 ml of the first thawing&#xD;
                solution (PBS with 20% HSA) for 3 min at 36°C. Afterwards the embryo was&#xD;
                consecutively exposed for 2 min to the 3 other thawing solutions (0.5M sucrose,&#xD;
                0.25M sucrose and 0.125M sucrose respectively). The embryos were washed thoroughly&#xD;
                and incubated overnight in COOK blastocyst medium. Embryos are considered as&#xD;
                'survived' if at least 50% of the blastomeres survived the vitrification procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Slow freezing and thawing procedure For the slow freezing and thawing procedure we&#xD;
                used the HEPES-buffered commercial freezing medium of Cook (K-SICS 5000) with&#xD;
                propandiol and sucrose as cryoprotectants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Statistical analysis and power calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on literature (Rama Raju et al 2005) we expect a 10 % higher implantation rate in the&#xD;
      vitrification group (25%) versus the slow freezing group (15%)(Rama Raju, Haranath et al.,&#xD;
      2005). To proof a significant difference at the implantation or pregnancy level with α=0,05&#xD;
      and a power (β) of 0,80. Therefore we would need 270 embryos transferred in each group.&#xD;
