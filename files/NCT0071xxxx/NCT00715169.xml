  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2a trial evaluating the&#xD;
      potential of MLN1202 to reduce circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP)in patients with&#xD;
      risk factors for Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Patients with risk factors&#xD;
      for ASCVD will be screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria including assessment of&#xD;
      C-reactive protein. If the patient's CRP is greater than 3.0 mg/L on repeated measurements at&#xD;
      least 2 weeks apart, the patient will be enrolled, stratified by screening CRP levels (≤5.0&#xD;
      mg/L and &gt;5.0 mg/L), and randomized to receive 1 dose of either placebo or MLN1202. Safety&#xD;
      will be assessed by vital signs, physical examination, clinical laboratories at baseline, and&#xD;
      adverse event (AE) reporting from Day 1 to Day 113 of the trial.&#xD;
