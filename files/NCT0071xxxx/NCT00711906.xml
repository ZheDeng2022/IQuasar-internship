    <textblock>
      Malaria is a major contributor of disease burden in Sub-Saharan Africa, and pregnant women&#xD;
      and children are the most vulnerable population. Malaria in pregnancy increases the risks of&#xD;
      abortion, prematurity, maternal anaemia, low birth weight (LBW), perinatal, neonatal and&#xD;
      infant mortality. For prevention and control of malaria in pregnancy, Intermittent Preventive&#xD;
      Treatment (IPT), insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and case management for malaria and anemia&#xD;
      are recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV infection in pregnancy increases the risk of malaria, LBW, post-natal mortality and also&#xD;
      of anaemia. In pregnant women, HIV infection decreases the efficacy of IPT with the medicine&#xD;
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), which is the only treatment with proven efficacy and safety&#xD;
      in IPT and is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Unfortunately, there is a&#xD;
      documented increase of resistance to SP, so cotrimoxazole (CTX) could be an alternative: many&#xD;
      studies in Zambia and Uganda demonstrated that it reduces mortality and morbidity in HIV&#xD;
      infected persons, and CTX prophylaxis significantly improves birth outcomes in&#xD;
      immuno-suppressed HIV women. Unfortunately, there is not yet information on its effectiveness&#xD;
      for preventing placental malaria infection, maternal anaemia and LBW. Thus in this study, we&#xD;
      aim to establish the safety and efficacy of daily CTX in preventing malaria infection during&#xD;
      pregnancy and its consequences, both in HIV infected and non-infected pregnant women. This&#xD;
      information is urgently needed to assist to issue guidelines on IPT in pregnancy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Malaria is a major contributor of disease burden in Sub-Saharan Africa, with pregnant women&#xD;
      and children being the most vulnerable population. P. falciparum infection in pregnancy leads&#xD;
      to parasite sequestration in placental vascular space, with increased risks of abortion,&#xD;
      stillbirth, prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, maternal anaemia, low birth weight&#xD;
      (LBW), perinatal, neonatal and infant mortality. In low transmission areas, malaria can&#xD;
      evolve towards severe disease with high risk of mortality. In endemic areas, it is still&#xD;
      associated with maternal anaemia, LBW and stillbirth. For prevention and control of malaria&#xD;
      in pregnancy, WHO recommends Intermittent Preventive Treatment (IPT), insecticide treated&#xD;
      nets (ITNs) and case management for malaria and anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV in pregnancy increases the risk of malaria, LBW, post-natal mortality and also anaemia,&#xD;
      suggesting a synergistic interaction between HIV and malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In pregnant women, HIV-1 infection decreases the efficacy of&#xD;
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine(SP)IPT, although 2 or more doses in 2nd and 3rd trimesters still&#xD;
      reduce peripheral parasitaemia, placental infections and maternal anaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, SP is the only treatment with data on efficacy and safety in IPT: WHO recommends at&#xD;
      least 2 doses after the first trimester. But there is a documented increase in SP resistance,&#xD;
      so cotrimoxazole (CTX) could be an alternative: many studies in Zambia and Uganda&#xD;
      demonstrated that it reduces mortality and morbidity in HIV infected individuals, and CTX&#xD;
      prophylaxis significantly improves birth outcomes in women with CD4 count &lt;200. Concurrent&#xD;
      administration of SP and CTX has been associated with increased incidence of severe adverse&#xD;
      reactions in HIV-infected patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHO has promoted CTX as alternative to SP for IPT in immuno-compromised HIV-infected pregnant&#xD;
      women. Unfortunately, there is no information on effectiveness of daily CTX for preventing&#xD;
      placental malaria infection, maternal anaemia and LBW. In the past, CTX has been used to&#xD;
      treat malaria in children and daily use of CTX by non-pregnant HIV-infected adults has been&#xD;
      associated with a 70% reductions of the incidence of clinical malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will target both HIV infected and non-infected pregnant women with CD4≥&#xD;
      200/µL, with the aim to establish the safety and efficacy of daily CTX in preventing malaria&#xD;
      infection during pregnancy and its consequences, by assuming that CTX is not inferior to SP&#xD;
      in reducing placental parasitaemia: such information is urgently needed to assist to issue&#xD;
      guidelines on IPT in pregnant women.&#xD;
