    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 safety and dose escalation study to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      and identify the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) following IV administration of GPX-150 once&#xD;
      every 3 weeks. Escalating doses starting at the dose of 14 mg/m2 and increasing to the dose&#xD;
      of 265 mg/m2 will be administered IV once every 3 weeks for up to 8 cycles of treatment.&#xD;
      Patients who have previously received an anthracycline are limited to 4 cycles of treatment.&#xD;

             receiving blood transfusions or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents should continue&#xD;
             receiving them as per the ASCO guidelines. Patients requiring palliative radiation&#xD;
             therapy should complete their course of radiation treatment 4 weeks before the first&#xD;
             study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient may have received unlimited prior hormonal therapy, but this must have been&#xD;
             completed at least 4 weeks prior to the first study treatment, and progressive disease&#xD;
             documented following withdrawal of hormone therapy. Patient with hormone-refractory&#xD;
             prostate cancer on long acting LHRH agents may continue on these agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient may have received unlimited prior biological or immunological therapy without&#xD;
             limitation, but this must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to the first&#xD;
             study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has fully recovered from any previous surgery (at least 4 weeks since major&#xD;
             surgery) and radiation therapy (at least 4 weeks since the end of treatment).&#xD;
