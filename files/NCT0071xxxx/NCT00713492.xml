  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the reliability of a procedure for self-administering ethanol (alcohol)&#xD;
      intravenously (through a vein), using a computer-assisted method. People ordinarily&#xD;
      self-administer alcohol through drinking alcoholic beverages, but blood alcohol levels&#xD;
      resulting from drinking vary greatly among individuals. For research on alcohol dependence&#xD;
      and treatment, a tool for achieving precise blood levels is needed. In addition to testing&#xD;
      this method of alcohol administration, the study will examine self-administration behavior&#xD;
      and resulting breath alcohol concentration, the effects of alcohol on the participants, and&#xD;
      differences between men and women in alcohol self-administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 21 and 45 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Participants are assigned to one of two study groups. Group 1 undergoes three 7-hour study&#xD;
      sessions and group 2 participates in two sessions, each of which includes the following&#xD;
      procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breathalyzer and urine tests for alcohol and illicit drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine pregnancy test for women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Light lunch.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire about health and recent drinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alcohol infusion: Subjects are seated in a comfortable chair and instructed on how to use a&#xD;
      computer to give themselves a short infusion of alcohol through a catheter (plastic tube)&#xD;
      that has been inserted into a vein in their the arm. Sensors are placed on their chest to&#xD;
      monitor heart beat and their neck to record skin blood flow. At the start of the session,&#xD;
      subjects complete questionnaires about any drug effects and urges to drink they may be&#xD;
      feeling. They are trained on how to use the computer to administer alcohol and are then&#xD;
      allowed to self-administer alcohol through the catheter any time they like, as long as their&#xD;
      peak breath alcohol level does not exceed 0.1 g% (a level that would result from ingestion of&#xD;
      4 to 6 drinks in most people). If that point is reached, the computer automatically&#xD;
      inactivates self-administration until the level is lowered again. Breathalyzer readings are&#xD;
      taken every 15 to 30 minutes. Subjects may read, watch television or videos or listen to&#xD;
      music during the sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recovery: At the end of the 2.5 hours of self-administration, the catheter is removed and&#xD;
      subjects can eat, read, watch television and relax in the clinic until their breath alcohol&#xD;
      level falls below 0.02 g%, usually after 2.5 to 3 hours, when they can go home by taxi or&#xD;
      with a pre-arranged designated driver.&#xD;

      Objective: The goal of this project is to characterize the computer-assisted&#xD;
      self-administration of ethanol (CASE) paradigm by assessing intravenous (IV) alcohol&#xD;
      self-administration behavior and the resulting breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) exposure&#xD;
      and pharmacologic responses in humans. The study will also evaluate the test-retest&#xD;
      reliability of alcohol self-administration and examine the influence of sex and recent&#xD;
      drinking history, as well as the effect of acute stress cues on alcohol self-administration.&#xD;
      Additionally, this study will test whether a novel experimental paradigm can be used to&#xD;
      evaluate impaired control in&#xD;
&#xD;
      heavy drinkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Participants will be 21-60 year-old male and female social drinkers, binge&#xD;
      drinkers and heavy drinkers in good health, as determined by medical history, physical exam,&#xD;
      ECG and lab tests. Participants with Axis-I psychiatric illness (other than alcohol use&#xD;
      disorder for Group 6) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The CASE system utilizes a model-based algorithm based on previously published&#xD;
      methods to achieve and maintain pre-determined BrACs using IV alcohol infusions. The CASE&#xD;
      system provides flexibility to participants in choosing when to push a button to receive&#xD;
      alcohol, as well as flexibility to investigators in controlling the subsequent BrAC exposure.&#xD;
      The CASE system allows the investigator to specify and assure the same BrAC increment across&#xD;
      all participants, and is set up to prevent the BrAC from exceeding any pre-set upper limit&#xD;
      (e.g., 120 mg%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following screening, participants will undergo IV ethanol self-administration sessions.&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled in six groups: Group 1 will consist of the first 10&#xD;
      participants who will participate in 3 self-administration sessions (a training session&#xD;
      followed by 2 test sessions) to assess the test-retest reliability of alcohol&#xD;
      self-administration behavior. Group 2 will consist of 50 participants, who will each&#xD;
      participate in 2 self-administration sessions (a training session followed by a test&#xD;
      session). During each session, participants will first undergo a directed priming period,&#xD;
      lasting 25 min, where they will be prompted to push a button to receive small standardized&#xD;
      alcohol infusions. This will be followed by an ad-lib period, lasting up to 2 hrs, where they&#xD;
      will have free access to standardized IV alcohol infusions. During the session, BrAC will be&#xD;
      measured, heart-rate will be continuously recorded, and subjective perceptions of alcohol&#xD;
      effects and urges will be assessed. Group 3 will consist of 15 participants, who will undergo&#xD;
      two identical progressive work self-administration sessions for evaluation of test-retest&#xD;
      reliability. During each progressive ratio (PR) schedule session, participants will be&#xD;
      required to push the button progressively higher number of times for each subsequent alcohol&#xD;
      infusion over a 2.5 hr period. Group 4 will consist of 100 participants, who will each&#xD;
      participate in 2 sessions: one ad lib self-administration session and one PR schedule&#xD;
      self-administration session. Group 5 will consist of 40 participants, who will undergo a&#xD;
      baseline self-administration session followed by an interview session for construction of&#xD;
      guided imagery scripts. Following this, participants will undergo three alcohol&#xD;
      self-administration sessions, following exposure to personalized stress-, alcohol- or&#xD;
      neutral-condition associated scripts, presented in randomized order on separate days. Group&#xD;
      6a will consist of a maximum of 15 participants who will undergo a baseline&#xD;
      self-administration session followed by an experimental session in which they will be given&#xD;
      the opportunity to resist receiving self-infusions of alcohol in return for monetary&#xD;
      reinforcers. Group 6b will consist of 37 participants who will complete a baseline&#xD;
      self-administration session followed by two experimental sessions, with and without a priming&#xD;
      dose of alcohol, and two follow up visits. Group 6 participants will also be given an&#xD;
      ecological momentary assessment (EMA) device and will complete random assessments of&#xD;
      real-world measures of impaired control and alcohol consumption per day for the duration of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The primary endpoint is the BrAC exposure (highest BrAC, average BrAC,&#xD;
      area-under-the-BrAC-time-curve) achieved during the self-administration session.&#xD;
      Additionally, changes in subjective perceptions of alcohol effects, as well as changes in&#xD;
      heart rate will be evaluated. The influence of sex and recent drinking history as well as&#xD;
      genetic polymorphisms on the self-administration of alcohol will also be examined.&#xD;
      Furthermore, individual-specific cellular responses to alcohol exposure will be examined&#xD;
      using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from participants selected based on genotypic&#xD;
      and phenotypic variation in self-administration measures. Outcome measures for group 5 will&#xD;
      include stress and alcohol cue-induced craving and self-administration. Human laboratory&#xD;
      outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      measures for Group 6 will include time to lapse during the delay phase, number of infusions,&#xD;
&#xD;
      peak BrAC, and average BrAC during the ad-libitum phase. EMA outcomes will include&#xD;
&#xD;
      total alcohol consumption, number of impaired control episodes, and severity of impaired&#xD;
&#xD;
      control episodes. The CASE paradigm can be a valuable tool for evaluating determinants that&#xD;
      may underlie self-administration behavior in humans. The effect of pharmacological agents on&#xD;
      alcohol self-administration can be evaluated as a marker of the clinical effectiveness of&#xD;
      these agents in the treatment of alcohol-dependence.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Group 5 will include 20 subjects who report at least 2 binge drinking episodes in the&#xD;
             month prior to the study (a binge episode is defined as consuming at least 4 drinks&#xD;
             for females and at least 5 drinks for males during the drinking episode) and 20&#xD;
             subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        who report no binge drinking episodes in the past month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Current or prior history of serious medical illness, including CNS, cardiovascular,&#xD;
             respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, endocrine, or reproductive disorders.&#xD;

             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Non-drinkers (alcohol-na(SqrRoot) ve individuals or current abstainers) or individuals&#xD;
             with no experience drinking 5 or more drinks on one occasion in their lifetime.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Regular tobacco users will be excluded from the study in order to avoid nicotine&#xD;
             withdrawal symptoms. Occasional use of tobacco products (up to 20 cigarettes/week) is&#xD;
             acceptable. For Groups 3, 4 and 5, participants must be current non-smokers (past&#xD;
             smokers who have quit for over 1 year can be included).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Positive result on urine drug screen or positive breathalyzer during screening visit&#xD;
             or at the start of any study visit.&#xD;

             a urine beta-hCG test to ensure they are not pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Use of prescription or OTC medications known to interact with alcohol within 2 weeks&#xD;
             of the study. These include, but may not be limited to: isosorbide, nitroglycerine,&#xD;
             benzodiazepines, warfarin, anti-depressants such as amitriptyline, clomipramine and&#xD;
             nefazodone, anti-diabetes medications such as glyburide, metformin and tolbutamide,&#xD;
             H2-antagonists for heartburn such as cimetidine and&#xD;
&#xD;
             ranitidine, muscle relaxants, anti-epileptics including phenytoin and phenobarbital&#xD;
             codeine, and narcotics including propoxyphene, oxycodone and hydrocodone. Drugs known&#xD;
             to inhibit or induce enzymes that metabolize alcohol should not be used for 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to the study. These include chlorzoxazone, isoniazid, metronidazole and&#xD;
             disulfiram. Cough-and-cold preparations which contain anti-histamines, pain medicines&#xD;
             and anti-inflammatories such as aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, celecoxib and&#xD;
             naproxen, should be withheld for at least 72 hours prior to each study session.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Current or prior history of alcohol-induced flushing reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Female participants who have abnormal menstrual cycles in the absence of&#xD;
             irregularities caused by hormonal contraception, as defined by irregularities in&#xD;
             menstrual cycle length (cycles of &gt;36 days or &lt; 8 cycles per year), clinically&#xD;
             significant menstrual periods that are heavier or lighter than usual, and/or&#xD;
             accompanied by significant pain, cramping or nausea and vomiting that requires&#xD;
             intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        GROUP 6&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group 6 will include heavy drinkers between the ages of 21 and 60 years, in good health.&#xD;
        Unfortunately, heavy drinking does not have a universally agreed upon definition and the&#xD;
        criteria used to define heavy drinking vary from study to study. There is evidence that&#xD;
&#xD;
        incorporating both amount of alcohol consumed per occasion and amount of alcohol consumed&#xD;
        per week is relevant to account for risk related to pattern of drinking and total&#xD;
        consumption. Therefore in our study we will select heavy drinkers using a definition that&#xD;
        takes into account both pattern of drinking and total consumption. For pattern of drinking,&#xD;
        we will require our subjects to have on average at least one binge drinking day per week,&#xD;
        using the NIAAA definition of 5 or more drinks for men and 4 or more drinks for women&#xD;
        (NIAAA website). For total consumption, we will use an average of 8 or more drinks per week&#xD;
        for women and 15 or more drinks per week for men as this level of drinking has been shown&#xD;
        to confer increased risk of mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male and female participants between 21-60 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male participants must have consumed an average of 15 or more standard drinks per week&#xD;
             and females must have consumed an average of 8 or more standard drinks per week during&#xD;
             the past 90 days. Average number of drinks per week will be calculated based on total&#xD;
             number of drinks as measured by the timeline followback (TLFB) (e.g., for 90 days&#xD;
             worth of data, total drinks divided by 90 and then multiplied by 7 will be the average&#xD;
             number of drinks per week).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants must have on average at least 1 binge drinking day per week during the&#xD;
             last 90 days, defined as a day in which 4 or more standard drinks were consumed for&#xD;
             females and 5 or more standard drinks were consumed for males. Average number of binge&#xD;
             drinking days will be calculated based on total number of binge drinking days from the&#xD;
             TLFB (e.g. for 90 days worth of data, participants with a total of 13 or more binge&#xD;
             drinking days will be eligible).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants must be able and willing to refrain from consuming alcohol 24 hours prior&#xD;
             to each alcohol self-administration session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Current or prior history of serious medical illness, including CNS, cardiovascular,&#xD;
             respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, endocrine, or reproductive disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Positive hepatitis A, B antigen, or C or HIV test at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Abnormal findings on ECG, unless cleared for participation by cardiologist or Licensed&#xD;
             Independent Practitioner (LIP).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Current history of major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder,&#xD;
             obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), eating&#xD;
             disorder, or any other Axis-I psychiatric disorders requiring intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. An aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) level more than 3 times&#xD;
             the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Current (past 12 months) diagnosis of substance use disorder other than alcohol use&#xD;
             disorder, unless in early remission (no criteria met for at least 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Positive result on urine drug screen or breathalyzer test during initial or update&#xD;
             visit under the screening protocol (14-AA-0181) most proximal to enrollment. Positive&#xD;
             urine drug screen during more than 1 study visit or breathalyzer reading during more&#xD;
             than 1 self-administration study visit will result in participant withdrawal from the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Currently seeking treatment for alcohol use disorder or having undergone inpatient or&#xD;
             outpatient detoxification or treatment for alcohol problems in the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of significant withdrawal symptoms or presence of clinically significant&#xD;
             withdrawal symptoms (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA) score &gt; 8) at&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Pregnancy, intention to become pregnant, or breastfeeding. Female participants will&#xD;
             undergo a urine beta-hCG test to ensure that they are not pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Medication exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. . Daily or regular use of prescription or OTC medications known to interact with&#xD;
                  alcohol in the 2-week period prior to assessment. These include, but may not be&#xD;
                  limited to: isosorbide, nitroglycerine, benzodiazepines, warfarin,&#xD;
                  anti-depressants such as amitriptyline, clomipramine and nefazodone,&#xD;
                  anti-diabetes medications such as glyburide, metformin and tolbutamide,&#xD;
                  H2-antagonists for heartburn such as cimetidine and ranitidine, muscle relaxants,&#xD;
                  anti-epileptics including phenytoin and phenobarbital codeine, and narcotics&#xD;
                  including propoxyphene, oxycodone and hydrocodone.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Daily or regular use of drugs known to inhibit or induce enzymes that metabolize&#xD;
                  alcohol in the 4-week period prior to assessment. These include chlorzoxazone,&#xD;
                  isoniazid, metronidazole and disulfiram. Note that any discontinuation of&#xD;
                  medications will only be done at the recommendation of a physician.&#xD;
