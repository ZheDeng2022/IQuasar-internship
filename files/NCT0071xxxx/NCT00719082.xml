  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls are the greatest cause of accidental death in the elderly. There is no normative data&#xD;
      on large groups of geriatric subjects specific to their stability scores obtained by&#xD;
      computerized dynamic posturography (CDP). CDP is the standard test to obtain stability scores&#xD;
      and is utilized as the gold standard in posturographic evaluations and fall prevention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human stability can be measured by CDP. Increased stability is associated with a lessor&#xD;
      probability of falls. Stability decreases as age increases and a normative data collection of&#xD;
      stability scores in the geriatric population will allow and promote clinical applications&#xD;
      which can be utilized in fall prevention.&#xD;

      Computerized dynamic posturography outcomes will be obtained on geriatric subjects attending&#xD;
      the September, 2008 AARP meeting in Washington, DC. All subjects will be volunteers. The&#xD;
      outcome measurement will be obtained using computerized dynamic posturography, a standard&#xD;
      diagnostic test of balance function. The subject's balance will be tested using a&#xD;
      three-component force platform (CAPS test) under one sensory condition of the modified&#xD;
      Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance (mCTSIB), the eyes closed without&#xD;
      perturbation. This condition is chosen as studies have shown it to be the single test that&#xD;
      best correlates with balance impairment and falls. The stability score, already used in&#xD;
      several studies by other authors will be used as the primary outcome measure in this&#xD;
      research. It is defined as 1 minus the ratio between the measured sway during the test&#xD;
      (computed as the major axis of a standard 95% confidence ellipse) and the amount of sway a&#xD;
      normal subject of the same height as the one being tested should be able to sway before&#xD;
      falling (also known as the theoretical maximum sway or the theoretical limit of stability,&#xD;
      calculated using a regression formula based on the subject's height developed by NASA in 1962&#xD;
      and commonly used in all posturographic tests). For convenience, the stability score will be&#xD;
      expressed as a percentage. Its definition makes it a convenient and easy to understand&#xD;
      measure to use as a subject able to stand perfectly still with no sway will have a score of&#xD;
      100%, whereas one that sways as much as the limit of stability will have a score of 0%.&#xD;
      During each test, the subject's sway will be determined by the force platform and its related&#xD;
      software. The CAPS three-component force platform uses 3 load cells arranged in a triangle to&#xD;
      measure the distribution of the vertical ground reaction force on the platform. The analog&#xD;
      load cell signals are amplified and simultaneously sampled by the platform electronics using&#xD;
      three synchronized individual 24-bit delta-sigma analog to digital converters sampling at 312&#xD;
      kHz and decimating the samples to a data rate of 64 Hz. The use of three A/D converters&#xD;
      insures that the signals from the 3 load cells are acquired simultaneously with no timing&#xD;
      error. The high sampling rate with the high decimation and low data rate of the sigma-delta&#xD;
      converters eliminates aliasing and provides a resolution of about 4 parts per million. The&#xD;
      digital load cell data will be then sent via a USB connection to the PC where software uses a&#xD;
      calibration matrix determined by the manufacturer to compute the total vertical force and the&#xD;
      two horizontal moments acting on the platform. From these data, the software will compute the&#xD;
      point of application of the vertical force acting on the platform, commonly referred to as&#xD;
      the Center of Pressure (CoP). The location of the CoP coincides in static conditions with the&#xD;
      projection of the subject's Center of Mass (CoM) onto the platform, and its movement relates&#xD;
      to the movements of the subject's CoM (sway). The determination of the actual sway will&#xD;
      require the determination of the instantaneous location of the CoM via the location and&#xD;
      inertial properties of each body segment of the specific subject being tested. The CAPS test,&#xD;
      like all posturographic equipment, uses the movement of the CoP as an approximation of the&#xD;
      sway. Because it is an approximation, and because for kinetic reasons the CoP moves more than&#xD;
      the CoM, the 95% confidence interval of the CoP motion will be considered. This will allow&#xD;
      the CAPS software to compute the ellipse that represents the location of all of the sway&#xD;
      samples collected during the test with 95% confidence. The major axis of this ellipse will&#xD;
      represent the maximum sway of the subject in any direction during the test and it will be&#xD;
      used to compute the stability score. To assess the accuracy and resolution of the measurement&#xD;
      chain, calibrated weights of 75 kg and 100 kg will be positioned in the center of the force&#xD;
      platform (as if it were a subject) and 20 sec acquisitions will be performed: The accuracy of&#xD;
      the weight must fall within the instrument's factory specifications (+2N). Therefore the&#xD;
      accuracy for the position claimed by the manufacturer of +1 mm for a weight of 75 kg will be&#xD;
      accepted as correct as it determination would have required specialized equipment and&#xD;
      software available only to the manufacturer. It should be noted that the overall accuracy of&#xD;
      the position of the CoP given by the instrument will not be relevant in this study as the&#xD;
      motion of the CoP will determine the sway. The sway measurement error will be estimated&#xD;
      considering the fact that during the test at both weights the dead weight will not move, but&#xD;
      the measurement chain will indicate a ''sway'' of less then 0.05 mm (measurement noise),&#xD;
      therefore the resolution of the measurement chain and the sway measurement error will be&#xD;
      considered to be 0.05 mm. To verify the repeatability of the measurement chain, the same type&#xD;
      of tests will be repeated two times. The authors have obtained similar results (within the&#xD;
      specified accuracy and resolution) in another study. Given the sway measurement error, the&#xD;
      measurement error in the stability score will be determined. From the definition of the&#xD;
      stability score it is clear that the least the theoretical limit of stability, the more&#xD;
      pronounced the effect of the sway measurement error will be. As the theoretical limit of&#xD;
      stability is computed by using the formula 0.556height626sin(6.258), the shorter the subject,&#xD;
      the more the stability score is sensitive to the measurement errors. To estimate the&#xD;
      stability score measurement error a subject's height of 1.6 m will be considered. Such a&#xD;
      subject would have a theoretical limit of stability of 191.6 mm. For such a subject, a sway&#xD;
      measurement error of 0.05 mm means a stability score measurement error of 0.05/191.6 or, if&#xD;
      the score is expressed in percentage, of 0.026%. Thus, any changes in the stability score&#xD;
      greater than that are a consequence of the subject's sway and not of measurement errors. A&#xD;
      CAPS sit to stand test in which the subject will be asked to stand on the force platform from&#xD;
      a sitting position followed by a posturography test in the eyes closed stance will be&#xD;
      obtained on all subjects. Subjects will be instructed that they will sit on a chair and then&#xD;
      stand up without using their hands or a structure for support. They then wil be instructed to&#xD;
      stand on a computerized force plate platform without pertubation and close their eyes while&#xD;
      data is obtained from the computerized force plate. The subjects will be given practice&#xD;
      sessions so that they will be familiar with the test prior to the collection of data. The&#xD;
      CAPS testing, including the sit to stand and the eyes closed standing test occurs over 90&#xD;
      sec. We will divide the degree of sway observed during the first half of the eyes closed&#xD;
      standing test (10 seconds) and the second half of the eyes closed standing test (10&#xD;
      seconds)and obtain ratios. If a subjects sway increases in the second half of the test in&#xD;
      reference to the first half we will call this a fatigability ratio. When individuals&#xD;
      demonstrate less sway in the second half of the test we will call this an adaptability ratio&#xD;
      that we consider might be related to some type of motor learning.&#xD;
