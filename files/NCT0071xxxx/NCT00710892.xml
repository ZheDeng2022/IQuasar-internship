  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients are being asked to participate in this study because they will be receiving a stem&#xD;
      cell transplant as treatment for their disease. As part of the stem cell transplant, they&#xD;
      will be given very strong doses of chemotherapy, which will kill off all their existing stem&#xD;
      cells. Stem cells are created in the bone marrow. They grow into different types of blood&#xD;
      cells that we need, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have identified a close relative of the patients whose stem cells are not a perfect match&#xD;
      for the patient, but can be used. This type of transplant is called &quot;allogeneic&quot;, meaning&#xD;
      that the cells come from a donor. With this type of donor who is not a perfect match, there&#xD;
      is typically an increased risk of developing graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and a longer&#xD;
      delay in the recovery of the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GvHD is a serious and sometimes fatal side effect of stem cell transplant. GvHD occurs when&#xD;
      the new donor cells recognize that the body tissues of the patient are different from those&#xD;
      of the donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the laboratory, we have seen that cells made to carry a gene called iCasp9 can be killed&#xD;
      when they encounter a specific drug called AP1903. To get the iCasp9 into the T cells, we&#xD;
      insert it using a virus called a retrovirus that has been made for this study. The drug&#xD;
      (AP1903) that will be used to &quot;activate&quot; the iCasp9 is an experimental drug that has been&#xD;
      tested in a study in normal donors, with no bad side effects. We hope we can use this drug to&#xD;
      kill the T cells. Other drugs that kill or damage T cells have helped GvHD in many studies.&#xD;
      However we do not yet know whether AP1903 will kill T cells in humans, even though it has&#xD;
      worked in our experimental studies on human cells in animals. Nor do we know whether killing&#xD;
      the T cells will help the GvHD. Because of this uncertainty, patients who develop significant&#xD;
      GvHD will also receive standard therapy for this complication, in addition to the&#xD;
      experimental drug. We hope that having this safety switch in the T cells will let us give&#xD;
      higher doses of T cells that will make the immune system recover faster. These specially&#xD;
      treated &quot;suicide gene&quot; T cells are an investigational product not approved by the Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because the patient will receive cells with a new gene in them, they will be followed for a&#xD;
      total of 15 years to see if there are any long-term side effects of the gene transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the conditioning treatment for the transplant, we collected 30 mL (6 teaspoonfuls) of&#xD;
      blood from the patient, which we made into a cell line that grows in the laboratory by mixing&#xD;
      the blood with a virus called EBV. Some of the cells from this blood were mixed with T cells&#xD;
      from the blood stem cell donor, to stimulate cells that might cause GvHD. We then added an&#xD;
      investigational agent called RFT5-dgA. The RFT5-dgA helped to get rid of donor T cells that&#xD;
      might cause GvHD. To get iCasp9 into the remaining T cells, we have to insert the iCasp9 gene&#xD;
      into these cells. This is done with a virus called a retrovirus that has been made for this&#xD;
      study, and will carry the iCasp9 gene into the T cells. The virus also has another gene&#xD;
      called CD19, which will make the cells express the CD19 protein on their surface. We will not&#xD;
      inject the virus directly into the patient, but only into the special T cells we have made in&#xD;
      the laboratory. After we have put the virus into the cells, we will select the T cells that&#xD;
      have CD19 on their surface, so we know these cells will also have the iCasp9 gene. We will&#xD;
      perform tests on the specially treated cells before giving them to the patient, to ensure&#xD;
      they only carry the iCasp9 gene, and not the virus itself. This should ensure that no virus&#xD;
      can come out of the cells and infect other cells in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT PLAN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prepare the body for transplantation, the patient will be given high-dose chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Further discussion of the treatment plan for the stem cell transplant will be discussed with&#xD;
      the patient separately, and they will sign a separate consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is doing well after the transplant, and they do not have serious GvHD, they&#xD;
      will be eligible to receive the special T cells from Day 30 to 90 post-transplant. The&#xD;
      specially selected and treated T cells will be given by vein, once. The cells will be given&#xD;
      between Day 30 and day 90 after the patient receives their stem cell transplant. We will give&#xD;
      special medicines before the IV starts to help prevent allergic reactions that might occur.&#xD;
      Because there is a possibility that the specially treated T cells can cause or worsen GvHD,&#xD;
      we will not be able to give these cells if the patient already has significant GvHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient develops GvHD after being given the specially treated T cells, we will&#xD;
      prescribe the new drug that has been shown to kill cells carrying iCasp9. The drug's name is&#xD;
      AP1903. It has been tested in normal healthy volunteers, and has not caused any bad effects,&#xD;
      but it is not approved by the FDA. Although the drug is not approved by the FDA, the FDA has&#xD;
      allowed us to use the drug for this study. This drug will be given as a 2-hour intravenous&#xD;
      infusion. We will take 10 mL (2 teaspoonfuls) of blood on days 2, 4, 7 and 14 after the&#xD;
      infusion to check if the drug has been successful in killing the specially treated cells. If&#xD;
      the patient has mild GvHD, and if the GvHD does not get better with AP1903, we will give the&#xD;
      patient additional medicines that are usually used to treat GvHD. If the patient has serious&#xD;
      GvHD, we will immediately give additional medicines that are usually used to treat GvHD, as&#xD;
      well as AP1903. In some cases though, GvHD does not respond to treatments.&#xD;
