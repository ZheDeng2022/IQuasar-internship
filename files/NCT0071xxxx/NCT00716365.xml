      USF Hemostasis - USage of HemCon for Femoral Hemostasis after Percutaneous Procedures. A&#xD;
      Comparative Open Label Study The purpose of this trial is to test HemCon pad after diagnostic&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary angiography as an adjunct to manual compression to better control&#xD;
      vascular access site bleeding and reduce time-to-hemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the use of HemCon bandage (containing a carbohydrate called chitosan,&#xD;
      found in the shells of shrimp, lobster and beetles) will shorten the time needed to achieve&#xD;
      hemostasis, time to patient's ambulation, and patient's satisfaction without increasing&#xD;
      vascular complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      278 patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography receiving 2500 u intravenous Heparin&#xD;
      will be studied and randomized for manual homeostasis with either a HemCon or a regular pad.&#xD;
      Primary efficacy endpoint will be time to hemostasis. Secondary endpoints will be safety&#xD;
      (complication rate) and satisfaction of patients regarding time to sitting incline and time&#xD;
      to ambulation. 25% of patients from each arm will be randomized for Duplex examination of the&#xD;
      femoral artery at the access site.&#xD;

      USF Hemostasis USage of HemCon for Femoral Hemostasis after Percutaneous Procedures A&#xD;
      Comparative Open Label Study Introduction After completion of angiography performed via the&#xD;
      femoral artery, hemostasis is achieved by applying local pressure either manually or by&#xD;
      mechanical devices for 10-20 minutes. This is time consuming for the physician, uncomfortable&#xD;
      for the patient and occasionally complicated with vascular events that increase morbidity and&#xD;
      hospital duration and reduce patient satisfaction. Closure devices have been developed to&#xD;
      shorten pressure time but they are costly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HemCon pad is composed of a bandage containing a carbohydrate called chitosan, found in&#xD;
      the shells of shrimp, lobster and beetles. Its molecules are positively charged and attract&#xD;
      the negatively charged blood cells and platelets, and thus promote clotting. Chitosan&#xD;
      hemorrhage control dressings have been shown to be effective in animal models of severe&#xD;
      hemorrhage (1-4). Bandage. U.S. military personnel in the Iraquean and Afghanistan conflicts&#xD;
      have used the HemCon Bandage to successfully stop arterial hemorrhage not controlled by&#xD;
      conventional bandages in more then 64 patients without adverse effects (3,5). The HemCon&#xD;
      bandage is also an FDA-cleared hemostatic dressing suitable for use in hemodialysis access&#xD;
      puncture (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this trial is to test HemCon pad after diagnostic percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      angiography as an adjunct to manual compression to better control vascular access site&#xD;
      bleeding and reduce time-to-hemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the use of HemCon bandage will shorten the time needed to achieve&#xD;
      hemostasis, time to patient's ambulation, and patient's satisfaction without increasing&#xD;
      vascular complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints Primary endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare efficacy (time to hemostasis) of HemCon to regular pads Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare efficacy (time to ambulation) of HemCon to regular pads&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare safety (complication rate) of HemCon to regular pads using a protocol of shorter&#xD;
           time to ambulation with the HemCon pad.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare satisfaction of patients regarding time to sitting incline and time to&#xD;
           ambulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 278 patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography receiving 2500 u intravenous&#xD;
      Heparin will be studied and randomized as written hereinafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age 18-80 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signing an informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percutaneous coronary angiography with a 6 french sheath via the femoral artery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post catheterization non-invasive systolic blood pressure 150 mm Hg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  STEMI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who received IIb-IIIa antagonists before or during angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who received more than 2500u IV Heparin or more than 0.5 mg/kg LMWH within 8&#xD;
           hours before the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known bleeding tendency, disturbed clotting system or platelet function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evidence of bleeding or hematoma at the access site prior to sheath removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heparin treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive IV 2500 u Heparin immediately after introducing the femoral sheath.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedure duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure duration will be recorded in minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 1:1 randomization of HemCon and regular pad will be performed after completion of the&#xD;
      procedure. Envelopes marked with consecutive numbers will contain a note written: &quot;HemCon&#xD;
      pad&quot; or &quot;Regular pad &quot;. Notes content will be randomized by a computer program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the procedure is completed and a decision is taken to withdraw the sheath the next&#xD;
      consecutive envelope will be opened to determine the sheath removal technique to be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arterial sheath removal:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The femoral sheath will be removed at the patient's bed (and not on the angiography&#xD;
                table). One ml of blood will be allowed to flow from the access site. A HemCon or a&#xD;
                regular pad (according to randomization) will be applied manually with occlusive&#xD;
                pressure for 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. After 5 minutes the operator will release the pressure. If bleeding continues,&#xD;
                application of local pressure will be resumed. After this stage, the operator is&#xD;
                allowed to release the pressure after every 5 minutes or longer at the operator's&#xD;
                discretion. The total numbers of pressure release and the total time to hemostasis&#xD;
                will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. After achieving hemostasis a pressure bandage will be applied at the access site&#xD;
                for 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Bed rest:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Minimal bed rest duration will be 2 hours. Longer bed rest duration in increments&#xD;
                of 30 minutes will be decided at the operator's discretion according to hemostasis.&#xD;
                Total bed rest time will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. During bed rest the operator may allow the patient to sit up in 450 incline after 1&#xD;
                hour. Time to sitting up will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. If hematoma occurs, it will be evaluated by palpation and diameter measurement will&#xD;
                be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ambulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After bed rest, ambulation is allowed providing no confounding events such as blood pressure&#xD;
      abnormalities and hematoma have developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In hospital follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. A duplex examination of the femoral artery at the access site will be performed at&#xD;
                the operator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. One day after the procedure patient's complaints and physical findings will be&#xD;
                recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Blood count will be taken from all patients on the day after the procedure. Earlier&#xD;
                blood count and other blood examinations may be taken at the operator's discretion&#xD;
                and will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discharge:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be discharged at the operator's discretion. Complications or adverse events&#xD;
      will be noted and recorded upon discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Out of hospital and patient's satisfaction follow up: One day after discharge the patient&#xD;
      will be contacted by phone and asked for any procedural complications (groin pain, hematoma)&#xD;
      that appeared after discharge. If needed, the patient will be invited to the hospital for&#xD;
      further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the phone call the patient will be asked of his / her satisfaction of the ambulation&#xD;
      procedure at a scale of 1-10 (10 mostly satisfactory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be compared between the 2 groups using t-test:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to hemostasis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of bed rest (total, supine position and incline sit-up position)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of minor and major hematoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hematoma size&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post procedural stay at the hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level of satisfaction evidenced in post-procedure satisfaction surveys. The number of&#xD;
           patients to be studied (278) was calculated with the assumption that the HemCon will&#xD;
           achieve a decrease of 30% in hemostasis time (the primary endpoint), with alpha value of&#xD;
           0.05 and power of 0.8.&#xD;
