    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of most closely&#xD;
      HLA-matched multivirus specific CTL lines (CHM-CTLs) in HSCT patients with EBV, CMV or&#xD;
      adenovirus infections that are persistent despite standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to assess safety and feasibility of administering CTLs.&#xD;
      Survival data will be collected by asking the transplant center to submit the routine&#xD;
      Transplant Essential Data form that is sent to the Stem Cell Transplant Outcomes Database at&#xD;
      100 days and 1 year and includes data on survival status and other outcome measures.&#xD;

      Patients may be screened for study entry when they have persistent disease despite standard&#xD;
      therapy as defined in the inclusion criteria. At that stage a search will be done of the&#xD;
      available lines. Lines were generated from HSCT donors who consented to the use of CTLs not&#xD;
      required for their recipient for research or from normal donors. All donors were screened and&#xD;
      deemed to be eligible as transplant donors. We will also manufacture additional lines with&#xD;
      the goal of covering common HLA types and will consult with the NMDP to determine what HLA&#xD;
      types would be desirable. Additional donors will be screened by a transplant donor center&#xD;
      physician and must be deemed eligible before a line can be manufactured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTL Lines: We will use trivirus specific CTL lines generated as described previously.&#xD;
      Generation of trivirus-specific CTL lines requires the generation of several different&#xD;
      components from PBMC. The CTL line will be derived from donor peripheral blood T cells, by&#xD;
      multiple stimulations with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) presenting CMV, EBV and adenovirus&#xD;
      antigens and expansion with interleukin-2 (IL-2). The APCs used to stimulate and expand the&#xD;
      CMV-specific T cells will be derived from patient mononuclear cells and B lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To initiate the trivirus-specific CTL line, PBMC will be transduced with an adenovirus vector&#xD;
      (Ad5f35-pp65) expressing the immunodominant antigen of CMV, pp65. The monocyte fraction of&#xD;
      PBMC expressed and presented CMV-pp65 peptide epitopes to the CMV-specific T cell fraction of&#xD;
      the PBMC, while the virion proteins from the adenovirus vector were processed and presented&#xD;
      to the adenovirus-specific T cell fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To expand trivirus -specific T cells we used EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines&#xD;
      (EBV-LCLs) transduced with Ad5f35-pp65. This transduction allows the EBV-LCLs to present&#xD;
      CMV-pp65 and adenovirus virion peptides to the T cells as well as endogenously expressed EBV&#xD;
      antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EBV-LCLs are derived from PBMC-B lymphocytes by infection with a clinical grade, laboratory&#xD;
      strain of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). About 5 x 10^6 PBMC, or 5 to 10 mLs of blood is required&#xD;
      to generate the EBV-LCL&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the CTL culture period, the frequency of T cells specific for each virus were&#xD;
      determined using tetramer reagents if available. To test the functional antigen specificity&#xD;
      of the CTL we will use overlapping peptide libraries for pp65 and adenovirus hexon and&#xD;
      autologous and allogeneic LCLs in Elispot assays and we will perform cytotoxicity assays&#xD;
      using unmodified PHA blasts and LCLs untransduced or transduced with Adhexon and CMVpp65&#xD;
      pepmix OR LCL transduced with Ad5f35-null and Ad5f35-pp65. Some lines will have aliquots sent&#xD;
      for further characterization to the NIH where Drs Melenhorst and Barrett are developing&#xD;
      assays to predict alloreactivity where they examine virus antigen-specific T cells using an&#xD;
      extensive panel of activated T cells as antigen presenting cells (T-APC). These lines will be&#xD;
      labeled with component number only and will not have subject identifiers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CTL lines will also be checked for identity, phenotype and sterility, and cryopreserved&#xD;
      prior to administration according to SOP. Release criteria for administering the CTL to&#xD;
      patients include viability &gt;70%, negative culture for bacteria and fungi for at least 7 days,&#xD;
      endotoxin testing less than or equal to 5EU/ml, negative result for Mycoplasma, &lt;2% CD19&#xD;
      positive B cells, &lt;2% CD14 positive monocytes (or &lt;2% CD83 positive cells if Dendritic cells&#xD;
      were used as stimulators) and HLA identity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No Matched CTL Line Available: If no matched line is available the patient will be registered&#xD;
      so that the feasibility of the approach can be assessed and the eventual outcome will also be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTL Line Available but Patient Status Changes: Patients clinical course that changes between&#xD;
      screening and infusion will not be given the CTL and will be followed for eventual outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival data will be collected by asking the transplant center to submit the routine&#xD;
      Transplant Essential Data form that is sent to the Stem Cell Transplant Outcomes Database at&#xD;
      100 days and 1 year and includes data on survival status and other outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Selection of CTL Line: In general the line matching at the highest number of HLA&#xD;
      loci will be selected. Matching at the allele level will be preferred but antigen level will&#xD;
      be accepted or HLA-A and HLA-B. However consideration will also be given to the type of&#xD;
      infection and activity of the line against that virus. For example for a patient with&#xD;
      adenovirus infection a line that matches at 2 loci but that has recognition of adenovirus&#xD;
      mediated through those antigens would be preferable to a line matched at 3 loci but with no&#xD;
      demonstrated activity against adenovirus. The protocol chair will discuss each case with the&#xD;
      principal investigators at each center to determine the optimal CTL line for each patient. If&#xD;
      more than one line matches and there are insufficient cells to cover additional infusions a&#xD;
      second CTL line will be reserved in the event that additional infusions are warranted.&#xD;
      Patients with a partial response are eligible to receive an additional dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premedications: Patients will be premedicated with Benadryl 1mg/kg (max 50 mg) IV and Tylenol&#xD;
      10 mg/kg (max 650 mg) PO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored according to institutional standards for administration of blood&#xD;
      products and at a minimum will be monitored according to below: • Patients should remain in&#xD;
      the clinic for at least one hour • Patients should remain on continuous pulse oximetry for at&#xD;
      least 30 minutes • Vital signs should be monitored at the end of infusion then at 30 and 60&#xD;
      minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supportive Care: Patients will receive supportive care for acute or chronic toxicity,&#xD;
      including blood components or antibiotics, and other intervention as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient has a partial response they are eligible to receive up to 4 additional doses at&#xD;
      a minimum 2 week intervals and if they meet the eligibility criteria for subsequent lines.&#xD;
      These doses would come from the original infused line if sufficient vials were available but&#xD;
      may come from another line if there are insufficient cells in the original line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Assessments: The timing of follow-up visits is based on the date of CTL infusion.&#xD;
      If a patient has multiple CTL doses the schedule resets again at the beginning so follow up&#xD;
      relates to the last CTL dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up will occur at 7 days, 14 days, 21 days, 28 days, 42 days, 90 days, 180 days, and&#xD;
      365 days (+/- 2 days up to Week 8, and +/- 14 days for Days 90, 120, and +/- 28 days for 6&#xD;
      and 12 months, post-enrollment..)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following assessments are considered standard-of-care unless identified below by &quot; * &quot;:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Infusion: 1. History and physical exam including height and weight 2. Viral loads for&#xD;

      data entry system within 24 hours of knowledge of a patient's death. If the cause of death is&#xD;
      unknown at that time, it need not be recorded at that time. However, once the cause of death&#xD;
      is determined, the form must be updated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donor Evaluation: - Complete history and physical examination - CBC, platelets, differential&#xD;
      - Total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, - HIV-1 antibody,&#xD;
