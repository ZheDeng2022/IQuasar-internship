      The purpose of this study is to see what the effect of Botox has on bladder function for&#xD;
      those who have recently suffered spinal cord injury. We also will study bladder tissue levels&#xD;
      of NGF (nerve growth factor) that can tell us how the nerves to the bladder are healing after&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting male and female cervical and high thoracic (T10 and above) SCI patients will be&#xD;
      identified within the first 6-7 weeks after SCI and randomized to two external urethral&#xD;
      sphincter injection groups. Each group will be injected within 8 weeks after SCI (Day 0) and&#xD;
      3 months later (Day 90). The injection paradigm will consist of: Group 1-100 units of BTX-A&#xD;
      (Botox®, Allergan Inc., Irvine, CA) on Day 0 and 100 units of BTX-A on Day 90; Group 2-sham&#xD;
      saline injections on both Day 0 and Day 90. Injections will be performed under local&#xD;
      anesthesia using standard flexible cystoscopic equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of placebo is justified because: 1. there have been documentation of nerve&#xD;
      desensitization with dry needling (i.e. acupuncture) and wet needling (i.e.&#xD;
      saline)--therefore, to truly demonstrate benefit of Botox over just the needle insertion into&#xD;
      the sphincter muscle or injection of the diluent saline, a sham saline injection group is&#xD;
      included, 2. the injection procedure itself is minimally invasive and not expected to result&#xD;
      in any complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who qualify and have signed the informed consent document will be randomized into&#xD;
      two groups, those receiving the BTX-A and those receiving placebo. Blinding will be performed&#xD;
      by the TIRR pharmacy department who will provide Botox and placebo in identical syringes so&#xD;
      that the treating staff will be blinded. Pharmacists will ensure patients receive the same&#xD;
      agent at the time of the second injection. Unblinding will occur at the end of the study or&#xD;
      if complications necessitate breaking of the code. Both groups will undergo urodynamic&#xD;
      testing to document before and after treatment data. Bladder biopsies will be taken prior to&#xD;
      treatment in both groups that will be analyzed for nerve growth factor. Three day voiding&#xD;
      diaries will be kept and reviewed with the study coordinator at the follow up visits. Quality&#xD;
      of life questionnaires will be completed at each follow up visit. The treatments will take&#xD;
      place on Day 0 and Day 90. Follow up visits will occur at Day 120, 16 month, and 28 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Approximately 10,000 spinal cord injuries (SCI) occur each year, most of which occur in males&#xD;
      (80%). Many of these patients develop neurogenic bladder dysfunction (NGB) characterized by&#xD;
      overactivity of the detrusor muscle, termed detrusor overactivity (DO) or detrusor&#xD;
      hyperreflexia (DH). They can also develop detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia (DESD), an&#xD;
      abnormal/ uncoordinated response of the sphincter to bladder contraction. A combination of&#xD;
      these factors can lead to long-term complications in up to 50% of patients. These&#xD;
      complications include hydronephrosis, autonomic dysreflexia, vesicoureteral reflux,&#xD;
      nephrolithiasis, sepsis, renal insufficiency or failure and even death. Our basic&#xD;
      understanding of the physiology of NGB as well as the introduction of the concept of clean&#xD;
      intermittent catheterization (CIC) several decades ago has significantly reduced the death&#xD;
      rate due to renal complications in SCI patients. Nevertheless, there continues to be a&#xD;
      significant amount of morbidity and risk that these patients experience due to our incomplete&#xD;
      understanding of DESD; both its development and subsequent impact on bladder function. We&#xD;
      postulate that a primary drive to producing detrusor hypercontractility is the obstruction&#xD;
      created by increased tone within the external urethral sphincter (EUS). In addition, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that high-pressure obstructive voiding patterns displayed by patients with DESD&#xD;
      promote development of bladder wall smooth muscle hypertrophy and fibrosis, loss of bladder&#xD;
      compliance, and development of the complications listed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of our treatment options for neurogenic bladder in the SCI patient population aim to&#xD;
      reduce bladder filling pressures and obstructive voiding patterns either by reducing bladder&#xD;
      overactivity (i.e. antimuscarinic agents) or by decreasing bladder outlet resistance (i..e.&#xD;
      alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonists, sphincterotomy, UroLume stent placement, or&#xD;
      botulinum toxin injection of external urethral sphincter). However, typically treatments are&#xD;
      not initiated until these reflex voiding patterns have already developed. Almost all patients&#xD;
      with supraconal lesions, regardless of their neurological level of injury or final voiding&#xD;
      patterns, display areflexic bladders during the acute and subacute time period after SCI.&#xD;
      This time period can last anywhere from 1 month to 1 year (typically 6-8 weeks) after which&#xD;
      spinal reflex voiding develops. Dyssynergic voiding patterns are most common in cervical and&#xD;
      thoracic (supraconal) lesions while are flexic voiding patterns predominate in lumbar and&#xD;
      sacral conal and infraconal injuries. However, there are many exceptions to this rule,&#xD;
      especially in incomplete lesions, and that is why urodynamic testing is an important&#xD;
      component in the evaluation of every SCI patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nerve Growth Factor (NGF): Role in Obstructive Uropathy: The processes that lead to&#xD;
      reorganization of neural pathways and emergence of hyperactive and dyssynergic voiding are&#xD;
      incompletely understood. Possible mechanisms underlying the neural plasticity following SCI&#xD;
      could involve alterations in levels of neurotrophic factors within the bladder. Nerve Growth&#xD;
      Factor (NGF) is a signaling protein that is thought to play a prominent role in mediating the&#xD;
      development of bladder reflex voiding mechanisms in various disorders of bladder dysfunction&#xD;
      including neurogenic and non-neurogenic bladder outlet obstruction and chronic bladder&#xD;
      inflammation (i.e. interstitial cystitis). Studies have found that by inhibiting NGF's&#xD;
      actions through immunization, enhancement of bladder hyperactivity and detrusor sphincter&#xD;
      dyssynergia was prevented in SCI rats. Finally, studies in SCI human patients found that&#xD;
      bladder hyperactivity as well as bladder NGF tissue levels was significantly reduced by&#xD;
      bladder BTX-A treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BOTOX® (Botulinum Toxin Type A) Purified Neurotoxin Complex is a sterile, vacuum-dried&#xD;
      purified botulinum toxin type A, produced from fermentation of Hall strain Clostridium&#xD;
      botulinum type A grown in a medium containing casein hydrolysate, glucose and yeast extract.&#xD;
      It is purified from the culture solution by dialysis and a series of acid precipitations to a&#xD;
      complex consisting of the neurotoxin, and several accessory proteins. The complex is&#xD;
      dissolved in sterile sodium chloride solution containing Albumin Human and is sterile&#xD;
      filtered (0.2 microns) prior to filling and vacuum-drying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One Unit of BOTOX corresponds to the calculated median intraperitoneal lethal dose (LD50) in&#xD;
      mice. The method utilized for performing the assay is specific to Allergan's product, BOTOX®.&#xD;
      Due to specific details of this assay such as the vehicle, dilution scheme and laboratory&#xD;
      protocols for the various mouse LD50 assays, Units of biological activity of BOTOX cannot be&#xD;
      compared to nor converted into Units of any other botulinum toxin or any toxin assessed with&#xD;
      any other specific assay method. Therefore, differences in species sensitivities to different&#xD;
      botulinum neurotoxin serotypes precludes BOTOX is approximately 20 units/nanogram of&#xD;
      neurotoxin protein complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each vial of BOTOX contains 100 Units (U) of Clostridium botulinum type A neurotoxin complex,&#xD;
      0.5 milligrams of Albumin Human, and 0.9 milligrams of sodium chloride in a sterile,&#xD;
      vacuum-dried form without a preservative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Botulinum Toxin (BTX-A) to treat DESD: Botulinum toxin, first isolated by van Ermengem in&#xD;
      1897, is the most potent biological toxin known to man. Through basic and clinical research,&#xD;
      clinicians have been able to transform this lethal toxin into a health benefit. BTX-A&#xD;
      represents a viable option in the treatment of DESD. When injected, the toxin acts at the&#xD;
      neuromuscular junction of the external sphincter to block vesicle transport of acetylcholine;&#xD;
      in essence, producing a chemical denervation. The clinical effects begin within 2-3 days and&#xD;
      are reversible as terminal nerve sprouting occurs within 3-6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of studies on DESD have examined several outcome measures following BTX-A&#xD;
      injection: Change in post-void residual (PVR), change in urethral pressure profile&#xD;
      (UPP-static or dynamic), change in bladder pressures during voiding, change in frequency or&#xD;
      severity of autonomic dysreflexia (AD), and change in symptoms or satisfaction of the&#xD;
      procedure to the patient. Once again, BTX-A treated patients' demonstrated improvements in&#xD;
      PVR and UPP similar to their previous study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, while most studies of BTX-A for DESD have documented significant reductions in&#xD;
      detrusor and urethral pressures as well as PVR, prior research has shown that detrusor leak&#xD;
      point pressure (DLPP) is the best prognostic measure for upper tract damage in neurogenic&#xD;
      bladder patients. This fundamental concept was corroborated by external sphincterotomy&#xD;
      studies demonstrating that failure to achieve a DLPP below 40 cm H2O increases the frequency&#xD;
      of upper tract deterioration. This finding underscores the importance that future studies&#xD;
      examining the efficacy of BTX treatment for DESD will utilize DLPP as an objective measure of&#xD;
      the procedure's success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Data: Effect of BTX-A on Urethral Outlet Resistance by Measuring Changes in Leak&#xD;
      Point Pressure. The purpose of these investigations was to evaluate the effects of BTX-A on&#xD;
      in vivo urethral resistance by measuring leak point pressure (LPP) with a vertical tilt table&#xD;
      and intravesical pressure clamp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Female SD rats (n=8; 220-250g) were anesthetized with urethane (1.2 g/kg) and injected&#xD;
      intraperitoneally with either BTX-A (100u) or saline 18 hours prior to experimentation. LPP&#xD;
      was recorded before and after administration of the nicotinic receptor antagonist&#xD;
      -bungarotoxin (BGT), and the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium (HEX).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BGT significantly decreased the LPP in control animals by 46% but had no appreciable affect&#xD;
      in BTX-A treated animals. In comparison, BTX-A treatment decreased LPP by 47% compared to&#xD;
      baseline values in control animals. The ganglionic blocker, HEX, had no appreciable effect on&#xD;
      either control or BTX-A treated animals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BTX-A significantly decreased the basal LPP to the same extent as BGT, confirming it's in&#xD;
      vivo potency at the striated neuromuscular junction. However, the fact that HEX had no&#xD;
      appreciable effect in either group suggests that sympathetic tone is not a prominent&#xD;
      component of outlet resistance in female rats, and may not be a suitable in vivo model to&#xD;
      describe the effects of BTX-A on urethral adrenergic pathways. Although originally designed&#xD;
      as a method to evaluate stress urinary incontinence in rodents, this method actually measures&#xD;
      the intravesical pressure during bladder filling at which urinary leakage occurs, that is,&#xD;
      detrusor leak point pressure (DLPP). The marked decrease in DLPP induced by BTX-A in this&#xD;
      animal model validates BTX-A's potential effects on DLPP in humans with DESD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BTX-A Urethral Sphincter Injections in Humans: Sixty eight patients received urethral&#xD;
      sphincter injections for bladder outlet obstruction resulting from DESD or pelvic floor&#xD;
      spasticity. Patients' mean age was 53 (range 21-71) and the underlying pathophysiology for&#xD;
      outlet obstruction included: spinal cord injury (n=9), multiple sclerosis (n=32), stroke&#xD;
      (n=4), other (n=8), idiopathic retention/pelvic floor spasticity (n=15). Patients were&#xD;
      injected with 100 units of BTX-A into their external urethral sphincters under local or&#xD;
      general anesthesia. Postoperatively, significant decreases in maximal detrusor pressures&#xD;
      (81cm to 52cm H2O, p&lt;0.05) and post-void residuals (240ml to 88ml, p&lt;0.05) were observed with&#xD;
      beneficial effects lasting 3-4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The significance of these experiments begins with the fact that our proposed&#xD;
      intervention occurs during early spinal cord injury (i.e. within 8 weeks) before pathologic&#xD;
      bladder reflex pathways have emerged. In addition, our proposed project would be: 1. The&#xD;
      largest, prospective randomized trial examining the effects of BTX-A urethral sphincter&#xD;
      injection for detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia (DESD) and the first to look at the&#xD;
      effect of BTX-A on detrusor leak point pressure (DLPP); 2. The first study to evaluate the&#xD;
      role that bladder outlet obstruction by DESD plays in the development of bladder&#xD;
      hyperactivity and the development of complications resulting from bladder dysfunction; 3. The&#xD;
      first study profiling bladder tissue levels of the signaling protein nerve growth factor&#xD;
      (NGF) during early SCI and then again once bladder hyperreflexic patterns develop, and; 4.&#xD;
      The first study evaluating the effect of reducing outlet resistance with BTX-A on bladder NGF&#xD;
      levels. If our hypotheses prove to be correct, treated patients will display less&#xD;
      incontinence, require lower doses of anticholinergic medication, and avoid the complications&#xD;
      of DESD listed earlier in this proposal. Although this study as written is of moderate length&#xD;
      (i.e. total 5 years), we hope that by finding significant results we will be able to capture&#xD;
      a longitudinal history of this population by extending follow-up to a longer duration (i.e.&#xD;
      &gt;10 years). In addition, BTX-A treatment could be extended to other neurogenic populations&#xD;
      suffering from DESD (i.e. Multiple Sclerosis) as well as other conditions where bladder&#xD;
      overactivity appears to be driven by outlet obstruction (i.e. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. BTX-A injection of the external urethral sphincter significantly decreases detrusor leak&#xD;
           point pressure (DLPP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Decreased DLPP during early SCI will markedly reduce bladder tissue nerve growth factor&#xD;
           (NGF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reducing DLPP and bladder NGF during early SCI will diminish complications associated&#xD;
           with neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) and outlet obstruction.&#xD;
