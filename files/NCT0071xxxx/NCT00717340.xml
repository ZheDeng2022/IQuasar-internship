      This is a standard Phase 1b and 2a, multi-center, study design that will examine the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, maximum tolerated dose, and overall response rate of tivozanib (AV-951) and&#xD;
      paclitaxel in a breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Phase 1b study, only the doses of tivozanib (AV-951) will be escalated from 0.5 mg/day&#xD;
      to 1.5 mg /day. All subjects will receive doses of weekly paclitaxel chemotherapy.&#xD;
