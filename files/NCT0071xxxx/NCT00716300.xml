      The aim of the study is to examine the kinetic, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and cellular&#xD;
      cholesterol efflux properties of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in subjects with the&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome (MetS) and lean individuals.&#xD;

      Background and Purpose of This Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized by impaired glucose and insulin metabolism&#xD;
      (insulin resistance), abnormal body fat distribution called central obesity (a pot belly) and&#xD;
      high blood pressure. People with the metabolic syndrome have markedly increased risk of heart&#xD;
      disease which is mainly attributed to the abnormal fat metabolism and its associated&#xD;
      metabolic disorders. Therefore, understanding of the body fat disorder is important to reduce&#xD;
      the incidence and severity of heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fats in the blood originate from dietary sources and from production by the liver. They are&#xD;
      then delivered into peripheral body cell for utilization or storage. A particular protein,&#xD;
      called high-density lipoprotein (HDL) apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, is an important fat carrier&#xD;
      responsible for transporting excess fat from cells, via the bloodstream, back to the liver.&#xD;
      Low HDL-apoA-I concentration is related to increased risk of heart disease. Subjects with&#xD;
      MetS have reduced level of apoA-I and we wish to test the hypothesis that it is responsible&#xD;
      for the impaired movement of fat from the periphery to the liver. Recent evidence suggests&#xD;
      that the functionality of HDL, including anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and cholesterol&#xD;
      efflux properties, is also important in preventing the development of heart disease. However,&#xD;
      these function tests have not yet been investigated extensively in MetS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, we wish to examine the transport and anti-atherogenic properties of HDL in&#xD;
      subjects with MetS and compare these with normal lean subjects. Such findings would be of&#xD;
      significant clinical importance in the understanding of the diverse role of HDL-apoA-I in&#xD;
      reducing or preventing the progression of heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with MetS or lean individuals will be recruited for the study via newspaper&#xD;
      advertisements. Following informed consent and once found suitable for participation, 15 men&#xD;
      with MetS and 15 lean men will be enrolled. We will give the participants a harmless&#xD;
      substance called a stable (non-radioactive) isotope. The isotope will trace the speed at&#xD;
      which apoA-I is released into the blood (production) and are removed from the bloodstream&#xD;
      (clearance) by the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to fast (only water allowed) for 12 hours prior to the isotope&#xD;
      study. The stable isotope will be administered by intravenous injection in the form of a&#xD;
      clear fluid (total volume approximates 15 to 25ml, 1-1.5 tablespoons). A small plastic tube&#xD;
      (a cannula) will be placed into a vein in the arm, from where a total of 160mll (10.5&#xD;
      tablespoons) of blood will be obtained. The isotope study lasts 10 hours, during which&#xD;
      participants will rest quietly and be allowed water only. At the end of the study day,&#xD;
      participants will be given a meal and will be allowed home by taxi or family transport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies will allow us to measure the metabolic action of apolipoprotein A-I, thereby&#xD;
      gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms that leads to abnormal blood fat levels in&#xD;
      those with MetS. To complete this study, each participant is required to attend 7 visits over&#xD;
      a 6-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive health education, as well as information on personal health&#xD;
      status and a review of heart risk factors.&#xD;
