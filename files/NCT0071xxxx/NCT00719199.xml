      Open-label phase 1b trial. Study treatment will be administered in 3 week cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two distinct parts in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1: Dose escalation from IMO-2055&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2: Once a recommended phase 2 dose is found additional tolerability and&#xD;
           pharmacodynamics will be explored&#xD;

      -  Part 1: Dose escalation of IMO-2055, including 3 dose groups. Once a recommended phase 2&#xD;
           dosage (RP2D) of IMO-2055 given concomitantly with FOLFIRI and cetuximab is found the&#xD;
           selected cohort will be expanded by an additional 6 to 9 patients (to a total of 12&#xD;
           patients) for confirmation of the RP2D and combination treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2: A final cohort of 12 patients (Cohort 6) will be enrolled simultaneously to&#xD;
           explore tolerability and pharmacodynamics in patients treated with the RP2D of IMO-2055&#xD;
           in combination with FOLFIRI with cetuximab.&#xD;
