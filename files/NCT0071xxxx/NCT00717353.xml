      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the presence and frequency of novel and known UGT1A6 and UGT2B7&#xD;
           polymorphisms in healthy Chinese, Malay and Indian subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the presence and frequency of novel and known UGT1A6 and UGT2B7&#xD;
           polymorphisms in Chinese lung cancer patients with squamous cell and adenocarcinoma&#xD;
           subtype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To analyze the functional variations in UGT1A6 and UGT2B7 polymorphisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 To study the correlation of UGT1A6 and UGT2B7 polymorphisms with lung cancer type.&#xD;

      Germline polymorphisms are inherited genetic variation present in all cells of the body. At&#xD;
      molecular level, such variations may affect gene transcription, translation, mRNA stability,&#xD;
      protein activity, protein expression (1-3). Mounting evidences have emerged showing that&#xD;
      genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolizing genes and DNA repaired genes are major&#xD;
      determinants of response to drugs and carcinogens with possible predictive or prognostic&#xD;
      value for clinical outcome (4-6). However, only a small number of all polymorphisms&#xD;
      discovered have functional significance and it is often difficult to predict this base on&#xD;
      nucleotide sequence alone. Genome based studies have generated a wealth of data on genetic&#xD;
      polymorphisms far exceeds our knowledge on the function of these variants. Hence, there is an&#xD;
      urgent need to characterize the functional and expressional impact of genetic polymorphisms&#xD;
      in candidate genes so that appropriate target polymorphisms most likely to affect the&#xD;
      phenotype can be selected for larger scale association studies. In this study, we will adopt&#xD;
      a novel 2-stage approach to identify and characterize new polymorphisms in the UGT1A6 and 2B7&#xD;
      genes in our Asian population. Data from our initial genotyping work will then be used to&#xD;
      optimize the study design of the stage II association study for the generation of hypothesis&#xD;
      that lung cancer histology (phenotype) is associated with UGT polymorphisms (genotype). This&#xD;
      study will help to advance our understanding in the functional significance and diversity of&#xD;
      genetic variants that exist in our population. It may also shed light on the role of UGT in&#xD;
      carcinogenesis and will provide vital ground work for future studies of risk assessment,&#xD;
      treatment and may allow identification of at risk individual for chemoprevention and adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy studies.&#xD;

        Our laboratory has conducted a pilot study to look at UGT1A expression in both normal and&#xD;
        cancer tissue using RT PCR. We have found that in UGT1A6 is the predominant UGT1A enzymes&#xD;
        expressed in normal lung and the expression of UGT1A6 enzymes is down regulated in lung&#xD;
        cancer (unpublished data). The distribution of UGT1A enzymes in the lung suggests that&#xD;
        UGT1A6 may be important in the glucuronidation of inhaled UGT substrates including&#xD;
        chemicals from tobacco smoking.&#xD;
