  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A small percentage of patients with retinal degeneration accumulate fluid in the center of&#xD;
      their retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies using an oral form of treatment has been successful in decreasing this fluid&#xD;
      which improves vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test the use of a topically applied form of this treatment to the eye to&#xD;
      reduce the amount of fluid and improve or preserve vision.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with certain retinal degenerations will be asked to take part in a research study&#xD;
      about the use of a topically applied eye drop for treating fluid in the central part of the&#xD;
      retina (macular edema).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, investigators propose to use topical Trusopt in a group of patients&#xD;
      with retinal degeneration (RD) to determine its effectiveness in reducing the amount of&#xD;
      retinal fluid in patients with RD and macular edema. The methods will involve an initial one&#xD;
      month treatment with topical Trusopt three times a day in each eye. After a period of one&#xD;
      month, patients will return for a follow-up examination. At baseline, they will have had a&#xD;
      measurement of their center vision and a measurement of their macular fluid with a&#xD;
      photographic-like procedure termed optical coherence tomography (OCT). After the one month&#xD;
      period of treatment, they will again have a measurement of their vision and re-evaluation&#xD;
      with OCT. An improvement at least of one line (7 letters) or more of vision will be&#xD;
      considered as a clinically significant improvement.&#xD;

    <description>Foveal thickness measured by OCT. A 17% or greater reduction in foveal thickness was considered an improvement. While initially it was our intent to follow participants at 1, 4, and 7 month intervals, these time periods could not be consistently adhered to based on participant non-compliance with appointments. Consequently, additional participants were subsequently seen at baseline to various time points beyond seven months that ranged from 2 months to 36 months at their most recent visit.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Improvement of Seven Letters or More Read on a Visual Chart</title>
          <description>Visual acuity measured in LogMAR units. Reading 7 letters or more on a visual chart, from baseline to most recent visit, was considered an improvement. While initially it was our intent to follow participants at 1, 4, and 7 month intervals, these time periods could not be consistently adhered to based on participant non-compliance. Consequently, additional participants were subsequently seen at baseline to various time points beyond seven months that ranged from 2 months to 36 months at their most recent visit.</description>
