  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genetic research has provided the most exciting breakthroughs in neuroscience and cognitive&#xD;
      science. Partially genetically determined cognitive impairments have been described in people&#xD;
      with COMT, 5HT6, BDNF (Swillen et al., 2000; Moss et al., 1999, Henry et al., 2002, Bilder et&#xD;
      al., 2002)and biological systemic pathway candidate genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selective inhibitors of COMT proved to improve cognitive function in animals and in patients&#xD;
      with Parkinson's disease (Carlsson, et al, 2000). Recent studies suggested that variation in&#xD;
      COMT activity might have neurobiological effects specific to the prefrontal cortex; the COMT&#xD;
      (Val) allele with high activity impairs tasks of prefrontal cognition in people with&#xD;
      schizophrenia (Egan et al., 2001) and higher loading of the COMT (Met) allele is associated&#xD;
      with better cognitive performance on attention and processing speed in people with chronic&#xD;
      schizophrenia (Bilder et al., 2002). Moreover, prefrontal dopamine levels are increased in&#xD;
      COMT knockout mouse model (Gogos et al., 1998). This suggests that in people who have&#xD;
      heterozygosis on COMT, dopamine levels could be abnormal. Thus, variation in COMT expression&#xD;
      could also affect performance on prefrontal cognitive tasks. In the previous study, we found&#xD;
      the neuropsychological profile in students with COMT (Met) allele is better in object&#xD;
      perception, problem solving and planning, and abstract and social thinking (Henry et al.,&#xD;
      2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      5-HT6 inhibitor has been reported to raise extracellular acetylcholine levels in the cortex&#xD;
      and hippocampus (Dawson et al., 2001 and Riemer et al., 2003). Acetylcholine release in&#xD;
      hippocampal and cortical regions is known to be important for memory acquisition and&#xD;
      retention, and several groups have demonstrated that 5-HT6 blockade overcomes&#xD;
      scopolamine-induced amnesia. We hypothesize that variations in COMT and 5-HT6 are associated&#xD;
      with genotype that will cause a poor/better performance in cognitive tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the aim to establish the possible correlation between candidate genes (COMT, 5HT6,BDNF&#xD;
      and biological systemic pathway candidate genes. etc) and cognitive ability, which will&#xD;
      provide us an understanding on factors and its extent that affect students' thinking, and&#xD;
      then develop appropriate teaching models or strategies for assisting students in learning. It&#xD;
      seems timely, therefore, to consider how we might implement our increased understanding of&#xD;
      brain development and brain function to explore educational questions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the past decade, the number of studies concerning the connections between neuroscience and&#xD;
      cognitive science has been growing dramatically. The findings might inform us how learners&#xD;
      find a better way to learn. However, it has been proven that it is difficult to apply these&#xD;
      findings to the real classrooms (Bruer, 1997; Goswami, 2006). This is mainly because learning&#xD;
      behavior requires interactions among various cognitive abilities, yet most&#xD;
      neuroscience-related research stressed only on a cognitive ability or microstructure alone.&#xD;
      In other words, neuroscience research often focuses on microstructure of cells, while&#xD;
      cognitive research focuses on systematic integrations. Generally speaking, a single-neuron&#xD;
      cell is insufficient for behavior development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the statement, &quot;whole does not equal to sum of every single part&quot;, simply examining&#xD;
      a microstructure will not lead to an understanding of behavior that produced by cell&#xD;
      assembly/synergy. The current neuroscience technology for detecting activities in two or more&#xD;
      cells simultaneously is still in progress, and issues on how cells can work harmoniously have&#xD;
      been seriously considered recently. Clearly, educators do not study learning at the level of&#xD;
      the cell. A successful learning depends on the curriculum, the teacher, context provided by&#xD;
      the classroom and the family, and the context of the school and the wider community. All of&#xD;
      these factors synergistically interact with the characteristics of individual brains. For&#xD;
      example, children with high levels of the monoamine oxidise A who experience maltreatment and&#xD;
      adverse family environments seemed to be protected from developing antisocial behavior&#xD;
      (Caspi, et al., 2002), possibly via moderating effects on their neural response to stress.&#xD;
      Diet is also reported to affect the brain. A child whose diet is poor will not be able to&#xD;
      respond to excellent teaching in the same way as a child whose brain is well-nourished. It is&#xD;
      already possible to study the effects of various medications on cognitive function.&#xD;
      Methylphenidate (Ritalin) has been shown to improve stimulus recognition in children with&#xD;
      ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) (Seifert, et al., 2003). Neuroimaging&#xD;
      techniques also offer the potential to study the effects of different diets, food additives&#xD;
      and potential toxins on educational performance. In our opinion, applying neuroscience&#xD;
      findings to actual classroom will be beneficial to students in learning. It will be of value&#xD;
      if studies about the connections between neuroscience and education can be extended to other&#xD;
      related topics, such as practical mechanisms, which will result in a meaningful integration.&#xD;
      Therefore, exploring the behavior-cognitive-neuron-gene system (BCNG system) (Fig 1) and&#xD;
      developing science educational theories from neuroscience-related studies will be the main&#xD;
      objectives and long-term goads as a result of our future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BCNG system includes two main categories, namely &quot;science education&quot; and &quot;neuroscience&quot;.&#xD;
      Currently, science education research including our previous endeavors emphasizes how&#xD;
      cognitive abilities affects learners' academic achievement and performance (for example,&#xD;
      Wang, Chang, &amp; Li, published online; Chang et. al., 2006) while neuroscience stresses on the&#xD;
      relationships between individual's cognitive ability and neurophysiology/ biochemistry&#xD;
      mechanism. Currently, there are ten aspects about cognitive ability, including intelligence,&#xD;
      attention, memory, linguistic ability, spatial ordering, higher order cognition, ordering&#xD;
      system, action system, social interaction system and emotion. These aspects can be divided&#xD;
      further into sub-topics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes on cognitive ability are caused both by innate, genetic inherence of learning ability&#xD;
      and acquired ability enforced by learning. However, researchers have not yet clearly&#xD;
      understood the extent that innate and acquired factors influence an individual's cognitive&#xD;
      abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In learning process, students who do not perform well in academic as other students due to&#xD;
      poor cognitive ability will affect their willingness to learn. In other words, low cognitive&#xD;
      ability will affect students' willingness to learn. Deficiencies in linguistic system(&#xD;
      includes defects in listening, speaking, reading and writing), elements that affect language&#xD;
      skills (containing disabilities in phonemes, morphemes and syntax), and disagreements in&#xD;
      activities of muscles (which cause messy in writing) will make students considered to be&#xD;
      clumsy and indolent or teased by peers and lead to decreased learning motivation. Therefore,&#xD;
      Livan(2001) asserts that educationists should first understand each student's innate&#xD;
      cognitive ability, and then give a priority to develop a subject that matches a student's&#xD;
      cognitive ability, so that a student's learning interest and achievement outcome will be&#xD;
      raised, and eventually this model/strategy will also work for the subjects that do not&#xD;
      actually match student's cognitive ability. This suggestion is, to some extent, in alignment&#xD;
      with our previous work (Chang and Tsai, 2005), which we found that teacher-centered&#xD;
      instructional approach seemed to enhance more positive attitudes of less&#xD;
      constructivist-oriented learning preferences students, whereas the student-centered method&#xD;
      was more beneficial to more constructivist-oriented learning preferences students on their&#xD;
      attitudes toward earth science in a computer-assisted learning environment. In the process of&#xD;
      developing and undertaking the BCNG system, this research project starts with innate factors&#xD;
      that might affect learners' cognitive ability. Based on the understanding of relationships&#xD;
      existed between cognitive ability and genotypes of possible cognition-related genes,&#xD;
      appropriate instructional models or strategies might be appropriately developed to better&#xD;
      assist/match students' learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Using existing test batteries to understand subjects' intellectual functioning,&#xD;
           memory,visual-spatial and perceptual function, executivefunction, attention and science&#xD;
           problem-solving ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identifying genetic polymorphism of human COMT, BDNF, 5-HT6 and other genes in Taiwan by&#xD;
           investigating single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) of the genes among Taiwanese&#xD;
           subjects using PCR and DNA sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Screening and comparing the allelic distribution of each SNP among tested subjects and&#xD;
           exploring if there is cognitive-associated SNP(s) in these gene.&#xD;
