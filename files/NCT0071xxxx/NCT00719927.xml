    <textblock>
      Latinas are more likely to be obese and physically inactive than white women. Therefore, a&#xD;
      behavioral weight loss program for Latinas will be tested in this pilot study. Thirty&#xD;
      overweight or obese Latinas will be recruited for a 12 week weight loss program at the Weight&#xD;
      Control &amp; Diabetes Research Center. Participants will be provided with nutrition and physical&#xD;
      activity education and be taught behavioral skills to help them adopt lifestyle changes that&#xD;
      produce weight loss. Participants will be placed on a reduced calorie diet and instructed to&#xD;
      gradually increase their level of physical activity. To encourage participants to monitor&#xD;
      their daily eating and exercise activities, participants will be instructed to record these&#xD;
      activities in food and exercise diaries and submit them each week. Two treatment groups will&#xD;
      be tested. The first group will have participants attend sessions with a female friend&#xD;
      (comadre). The second group will have participants attend sessions without a comadre. The&#xD;
      aims of this study are to determine whether we can succeed in recruiting Latinas with their&#xD;
      comadres and whether we can reduce participant drop-out by having Latinas participate with&#xD;
      their comadres in a behavioral weight loss program.&#xD;

      National studies indicate a need for behavioral treatments for Latinas that promote&#xD;
      recommended weight loss and weight loss maintenance practices. In the national Behavioral&#xD;
      Risk Factor Surveillance System survey, Latinas were found to be more likely to attempt&#xD;
      weight loss than white or black females. However, they were least likely to follow the&#xD;
      recommendations of consuming less calories and exercising at least 150 minutes per week. In&#xD;
      fact, Latinas more than whites reported using fasting or diet pills as a method of weight&#xD;
      control. Furthermore, participating in organized weight loss programs was less common among&#xD;
      Latinas than whites. Hence, a weight control intervention aimed at helping Latinas develop&#xD;
      the behavioral skills shown to promote weight loss and weight loss maintenance is warranted.&#xD;
      We propose to recruit 30 overweight or obese adult Latinas and randomly assign them to one of&#xD;
      two conditions. Both conditions will offer 12 weekly group sessions involving a standard&#xD;
      behavioral treatment. Behavioral techniques will be taught for the promotion of weight loss&#xD;
      via adherence to a reduced caloric diet and increased physical activity. The first condition&#xD;
      will consist of women participating with a female friend (comadre), while the second&#xD;
      condition will consist of women participating without a support partner. An intervention&#xD;
      strategy in which women participate in a behavioral weight loss program with a comadre will&#xD;
      be evaluated in terms of participant recruitment and retention in this pilot study.&#xD;
