  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile, tolerability, pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), of oral vorinostat in combination with oral capecitabine given&#xD;
      on days 1-7 and 15-21 of a 28 day cycle in patients with advanced breast cancer, using RECIST&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was originally intended to be a phase 1/phase 2. The protocol was amended to make&#xD;
      this study a phase 1 only.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed advanced breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the dose escalation phase: Patients must be refractory to standard therapy or for&#xD;
             which no curative standard therapy exists, to be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the phase II: Patients with histologically confirmed metastatic breast cancer who&#xD;
             have had no more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for treatment of their metastatic&#xD;
             breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metastatic disease should not be progressing so as to require palliative treatment&#xD;
             within 4 weeks of enrollment based on clinical assessment by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Development of new lesions or an increase in preexisting lesions on bone scintigraphy,&#xD;
             CT, MRI or by physical examination. Patients in whom the sole criterion for&#xD;
             progression is an increase in a biochemical marker, e.g., carcinoembryonic antigen&#xD;
             (CEA), or an increase in symptoms, are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No radiotherapy, treatment with cytotoxic agents, or treatment with biologic agents&#xD;
             within the 4 weeks prior to beginning treatment on this study (6 weeks for mitomycin&#xD;
             or nitrosoureas). At least 2 weeks must have elapsed from any prior surgery or&#xD;
             hormonal therapy. Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxicities of any&#xD;
             prior treatment with cytotoxic drugs, radiotherapy or other anti-cancer modalities&#xD;
             (returned to baseline status as noted before most recent treatment). Patients with&#xD;
             persisting, stable chronic toxicities from prior treatment ≤ grade 1 are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  leukocytes ≥3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets ≥100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m² for patients with creatinine levels above&#xD;
                  institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to vorinostat or capecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women that are pregnant or breast-feeding are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients are ineligible because these patients are at increased risk of&#xD;
             lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy and the potential&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interaction between antiretroviral therapy and the investigational&#xD;
             agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient had prior treatment with an HDAC inhibitor. Patients who have received&#xD;
             compounds with HDAC inhibitor-like activity, such as valproic acid, as anti-tumor&#xD;
             therapy should not enroll in this study. Patients who have received such compounds for&#xD;
             other indications, e.g. valproic acid for epilepsy, may enroll after a 30-day washout&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
