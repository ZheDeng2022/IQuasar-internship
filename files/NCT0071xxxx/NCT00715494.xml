  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization saves lives but often does so at a high personal&#xD;
      cost to ICU survivors who frequently experience significant cognitive impairment and an array&#xD;
      of physical and functional disabilities that limit their recovery and quality of life. While&#xD;
      the problems experienced by these patients are likely amenable to rehabilitation, few ICU&#xD;
      survivors receive focused rehabilitation following hospital discharge. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to initiate and test the feasibility of a complex intervention incorporating a&#xD;
      cognitive, physical, and functional rehabilitation program at the time of hospital discharge&#xD;
      and implement this 12 week program using in-home visits and tele-technology. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that this interdisciplinary rehabilitation program, initiated at hospital discharge and&#xD;
      implemented using in-home visits and tele-technology, will result in improved recovery of&#xD;
      neuropsychological and physical performance and overall functional status.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term consequences of critical illness and intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization&#xD;
      in ICU survivors are profound and include cognitive, physical, and functional impairments.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to pilot test a 12-week, home-based rehabilitation program&#xD;
      targeting both cognitive functioning and physical functioning, to determine the feasibility&#xD;
      of such a rehabilitation program, and to determine whether participation in a rehabilitation&#xD;
      program will result in improved outcomes among ICU survivors. The study will rely on a&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial design, with patients assigned to either a &quot;usual care&quot;&#xD;
      control group vs. the treatment group. Individuals in the treatment group will receive a&#xD;
      protocolized cognitive rehabilitation intervention, as well as individualized physical and&#xD;
      functional rehabilitation targeted at abilities such as strength, endurance, balance, and&#xD;
      functionality in basic tasks of daily living. Cognitive, physical, and functional&#xD;
      rehabilitation interventions will be delivered in patient homes and will take place on&#xD;
      alternating weeks over a 12 week period. Televideo technology will be employed in the context&#xD;
      of these interventions, with experts from Vanderbilt University and Duke University medical&#xD;
      centers providing assistance via a video monitor in conjunction with a rehabilitation&#xD;
      specialist who will implement interventions in patient homes. The study has 3 primary&#xD;
      outcomes including: (1). Executive functioning (e.g. ability to plan, organize, multi-task)&#xD;
      over time as measured by the Tower Test, a psychometric tool evaluating executive abilities;&#xD;
      (2) Physical Impairment, as measured by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test; (3) Physical&#xD;
      Functioning, as measured by the Step Activity Monitor (SAM). These three primary outcomes&#xD;
      have been selected as areas of primary focus due to the fact that available research points&#xD;
      to the presence of significant deficits in these areas among ICU survivors. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include activities of daily living (Katz ADL) and instrumental activities of daily&#xD;
      living (Pfeffers FAQ), activity specific balance and confidence(ABC Scale), health related&#xD;
      quality of life (SF-36), 12-month mortality, and both rehospitalization rates and number of&#xD;
      rehospitalization days. We will measure change in the outcome measures of interest at 3 and&#xD;
      12-month follow up to determine short term efficacy, along with evaluating overall&#xD;
      feasibility. The study duration will include 1 year of protocol development for the complex&#xD;
      intervention and 1.5 to 2 years of enrollment.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This was a single-site, feasibility, pilot, randomized trial of 21 general medical/surgical intensive care unit survivors (8 controls and 13 intervention patients) with either cognitive or functional impairment at hospital discharge. After discharge, study controls received usual care (sporadic rehabilitation), whereas intervention patients received a combination of in-home cognitive, physical, and functional rehabilitation over a 3-month period via a social worker or master's level psychology technician utilizing telemedicine to allow specialized multidisciplinary treatment. Interventions over 12 wks included six in-person visits for cognitive rehabilitation and six televisits for physical/functional rehabilitation.</intervention_model_description>

&#xD;
          -  Enrollment in the BRAIN-ICU study (AG027472-01A1), the presence of cognitive&#xD;
             impairment defined via an abnormal Tower Test score (at the time of hospital&#xD;

             tele-video component of the RETURN intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Live greater than 125 miles from Nashville&#xD;
