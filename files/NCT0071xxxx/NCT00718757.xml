    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the maximum tolerated dose of dexamethasone given&#xD;
      for 5 consecutive days when combined with fixed doses of irinotecan (given IV, qd x 5, 2 days&#xD;
      off, qd x 5) and vincristine (given IV, 2 doses total on days 1 and 8 of schedule) in&#xD;
      children with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies. In addition we will also study&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan when given without and then with dexamethasone in each&#xD;
      patient, evaluate the relationship between irinotecan pharmacokinetic parameters and toxicity&#xD;
      and describe any antitumor effects.&#xD;

      TREATMENT PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment This is a phase I trial of irinotecan, vincristine, and dexamethasone administered&#xD;
      over a 2-week period. Each treatment course will be a minimum of 21 days from the first day&#xD;
      of irinotecan. Cycles may be repeated after hematologic recovery every 21 days if in the&#xD;
      opinion of the primary physician the patient received some benefit from the chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Irinotecan pharmacokinetic studies for each patient will be performed with the first course&#xD;
      of therapy. From 4 to 18 patients will be treated to determine the MTD, irinotecan&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and biologic effects of this combination of chemotherapeutic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Dosages for Each Course Irinotecan, 20 mg/m2/day IV, Days 1-5, 8-12&#xD;
&#xD;
      **Dexamethasone Days 6-10 Vincristine 1.5 mg/m2/day IV (max 2 mg), Days 1, 8 (patients &lt; 1&#xD;
      year of age or &lt; 10kg in weight: Vincristine 0.05 mg/kg)&#xD;
&#xD;
      CNS Chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      No intrathecal therapy will be given during the first course for any patients. Triple&#xD;
      intrathecal chemotherapy (MHA) will be given on day 1 of subsequent courses (if patient is&#xD;
      eligible) for patients with NHL or ALL. The age adjusted dosages are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;12 months Methotrexate 6 mg, Hydrocortisone 12 mg, Ara-C 18 mg 12 -24 months Methotrexate 8&#xD;
      mg, Hydrocortisone 16 mg, Ara-C 24 24-35 months Methotrexate 10 mg, Hydrocortisone 20 mg,&#xD;
      Ara-C 30 ≥36 months Methotrexate 12 mg, Hydrocortisone 24 mg, Ara-C 36&#xD;
&#xD;
      **Dose Escalation for Dexamethasone&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doses for irinotecan and vincristine are fixed. The starting dose for dexamethasone will&#xD;
      be 10 mg/m2/day po divided TID for 5 days. Intra-patient dose escalation will not be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Level Dose (mg/m2/day) Dose Level 1 10 Dose Level 2 20 Dose Level 3 30 If the MTD is&#xD;
      exceeded at the first dose level, then the subsequent cohort of patients will be treated at a&#xD;
      dose that is 50% (5 mg/m2) lower than the starting dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inter-Patient Escalation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Escalations are planned in groups of three patients, with up to three additional patients to&#xD;
      be added at the first indication of DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When 3 patients who are evaluable for toxicity have completed 3 weeks of therapy at a dose&#xD;
      level without evidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) subsequent patients may be enrolled at&#xD;
      the next dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a dose-limiting toxicity is observed in 1 patient from the initial cohort of 3 patients at&#xD;
      a given dose level, up to 3 additional patients will be entered at that dose level. If none&#xD;
      of these additional patients experience a DLT (1/6 with DLT), the dose level will be&#xD;
      escalated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time a second patient has a DLT at a dose level (≥ 2 out of 2 to 6 patients), the MTD&#xD;
      has been exceeded and the next lower dose will be considered the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the MTD is exceeded at the first dose level, then the subsequent cohort of patients will&#xD;
      be treated at a dose that is 50% (5 mg/m2) lower than the starting dose. If the MTD is&#xD;
      exceeded at this lower level then the protocol will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the MTD is not reached, the maximum dose level studied will be considered the recommended&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exception to the above escalation is if the dose-limiting toxicity is diarrhea in both&#xD;
      patients required to define a MTD, then another cohort of patients will be treated at the&#xD;
      same dose level with the addition of oral cefixime. If there are no dose-limiting toxicities&#xD;
      in the cohort that receives cefixime, then dose escalation will continue as above with all&#xD;
      further patients receiving oral cefixime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Courses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may receive additional courses if in the opinion of the primary physician the&#xD;
      patient received some benefit from the chemotherapy at intervals of 21 days as soon as&#xD;
      hematologic recovery from the therapy has occurred. In addition, patients may receive&#xD;
      intrathecal therapy as directed by the primary physician during these subsequent courses.&#xD;
      Intra-patient escalation will not be allowed.&#xD;
