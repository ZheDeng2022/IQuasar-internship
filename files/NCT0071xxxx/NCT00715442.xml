    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if Sutent® (sunitinib malate), given&#xD;
      before surgery, can help control renal cell carcinoma. The safety of sunitinib malate will&#xD;
      also be studied.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Study Drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sunitinib malate is designed to block pathways that control important events such as the&#xD;
      growth of blood vessels that are essential for the growth of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take sunitinib malate&#xD;
      once a day (either with or without food) for 4 weeks in a row, followed by 2 weeks of rest&#xD;
      with no study drug. These 6 weeks are considered 1 cycle of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Cycle 2, you will have surgery to remove the tumor. You will start taking sunitinib&#xD;
      malate again after surgery (at least 14 days after surgery) on the same schedule as before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of each new cycle (Cycles 1-6), you will have the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your complete medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs, and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any medicines you are currently taking and if you have&#xD;
           experienced any side effects since your last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have blood drawn (about 4 teaspoons) for routine testing. This blood will also&#xD;
           be tested to check the function of your thyroid gland.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have follow-up scans (the same ones you had during screening to check the&#xD;
           disease status) at the beginning of Cycle 2, after you have surgery, and at the&#xD;
           beginning of each of the next 4 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG to measure the health of your heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 2 Cycles, you will have a follow-up echocardiogram or MUGA scan to check your heart&#xD;
      function, if your doctor feels it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning in Cycle 7, you will be asked to return to the clinic every other cycle (about&#xD;
      every 12 weeks), unless your doctor thinks you should return more often. This means you would&#xD;
      return for clinic visits at the start of Cycles 8, 10, 12, and so on, and may be asked to&#xD;
      come back at other times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit, you will have the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your complete medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any medicines you are currently taking and if you have&#xD;
           experienced any side effects since your last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have blood drawn (about 4 teaspoons) for routine testing at the beginning of&#xD;
           each cycle. If you are scheduled to return to M. D. Anderson every 2 cycles (12 weeks),&#xD;
           you may have the blood drawn for routine tests at your local doctor's office during the&#xD;
           &quot;non-visit&quot; cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG to measure the health of your heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an echocardiogram or MUGA scan to check your heart function, if your&#xD;
           doctor feels it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have follow-up scans (the same ones you had during screening to check the&#xD;
           disease status).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will continue taking sunitinib malate on this study, unless the disease gets worse, you&#xD;
      experience intolerable side effects, and/or you need an alternative treatment during the&#xD;
      course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early Withdrawal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early withdrawal is defined as a patient not being able to complete a full cycle of sunitinib&#xD;
      malate. If you withdraw early, you will return to clinic for the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your complete medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs, and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have blood drawn (about 4 teaspoons) and urine collected for routine testing.&#xD;
           This blood will also be tested to check the function of your thyroid gland.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG to measure the health of your heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any medicines you are currently taking and if you have&#xD;
           experienced any side effects since your last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have follow-up scans (the same ones you had during screening to check the&#xD;
           disease status).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post Treatment Evaluation (within 1 month of the last dose):&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 30 days after your last dose of sunitinib malate, you will return to the clinic for a&#xD;
      follow-up visit. You will have the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your complete medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs, and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have blood drawn (about 4 teaspoons) and urine collected for routine testing.&#xD;
           This blood will also be tested to check the function of your thyroid gland.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any medicines you are currently taking and if you have&#xD;
           experienced any side effects since your last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have follow-up scans (the same as at screening) to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG to measure the health of your heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the post-treatment visit, you will be contacted regularly to check the status of&#xD;
      the disease. You will be contacted (by telephone or routine clinic visit) every 6-12 weeks&#xD;
      for the first 2 years, and every 6 months after that for up to 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Sunitinib malate is commercially available and FDA approved&#xD;
      for treatment of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. At this time, its use in combination with&#xD;
      surgery is for research only. Up to 50 patients will take part in this study. All will be&#xD;
      enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic clear cell RCC who&#xD;
             are eligible for cytoreductive nephrectomy. The determination of resectability will&#xD;
             ultimately lie in the clinical judgment of the urologist and medical oncologist&#xD;
             involved in the care of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Measurable disease is defined as a lesion that can be accurately measured in at least&#xD;
             one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) and measures &gt;/= 20 mm with&#xD;
             conventional techniques or &gt;/= 10 mm with spiral CT scan. This does not include&#xD;
             primary tumors, which will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. ECOG performance status &lt;/= 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function within 14 days as defined below:&#xD;
             a) absolute neutrophil count &gt;/= 1,500/microL b) platelets &gt;/= 75,000/microL c) Hgb &gt;&#xD;
             9.0 g/dL (may be transfused or receive epoetin alfa [e.g., Epogen®] to maintain this&#xD;
             level) d) total bilirubin &lt;/= 2.0 mg/dl • serum creatinine &lt;/= 1.5 times the upper&#xD;
             limit of normal (ULN) e) AST(SGOT) and/or ALT (SGPT) &lt;/= 2.5 X institutional ULN for&#xD;
             subjects without evidence of liver metastases f) AST(SGOT) and/or ALT (SGPT) &lt;/= 5 X&#xD;
             institutional ULN for subjects with documented liver metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Female patients of childbearing potential (i.e. premenopausal, no hysterectomy) must&#xD;
             have a normal plasma beta human chorionic gonadotropin (betaHCG) within 24 hours prior&#xD;
             to enrolling in the study due to the possible teratogenic effect. Patients with an&#xD;
             elevated betaHCG will undergo appropriate evaluation to rule out pregnancy (i.e.&#xD;
             referral to Gyn service, pelvic ultrasound) and if pregnancy is ruled out and elevated&#xD;
             betaHCG is determined to be of tumor origin, patients will be permitted to proceed on&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients of child fathering or childbearing potential must agree to practice a form of&#xD;
             medically acceptable birth control while on study, i.e. condoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must give written informed consent prior to initiation of therapy, in keeping&#xD;
             with the policies of the institution. Patients with a history of major psychiatric&#xD;
             illness must be judged able to fully understand the investigational nature of the&#xD;
             study and the risks associated with the therapy. The only approved consent is attached&#xD;
             to this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must not have organ allografts.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must not have had major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant&#xD;

             fine needle aspirations or core biopsies within 7 days prior to Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No prior malignancy is allowed, except for non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ carcinoma&#xD;
             of any site, or other cancers for which the patient has been adequately treated and&#xD;
             disease free for 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must not have received any prior anticancer therapy for renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;

             study. Patients are permitted to be on concomitant bisphosphonates and megestrol&#xD;
             acetate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must not have a primary brain tumor (excluding meningiomas other benign&#xD;
             lesions), any brain metastases, leptomeningeal disease, seizure disorders not&#xD;
             controlled with standard medical therapy, history of stroke within the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of serious systemic disease, including myocardial infarction or unstable&#xD;
             angina within the last 12 months, history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive&#xD;

             time of enrollment, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive&#xD;
             heart failure, unstable symptomatic arrhythmia requiring medication (subjects with&#xD;
             chronic atrial arrhythmia, i.e., atrial fibrillation or paroxysmal supraventricular&#xD;
             tachycardia are eligible), significant vascular disease or symptomatic peripheral&#xD;
             vascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must not have history of other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical&#xD;
             examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a&#xD;
             disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that&#xD;
             might affect the interpretation of the results of the study or render the subject at&#xD;
             high risk from treatment complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients receiving any concomitant systemic therapy for renal cell cancer are&#xD;
             excluded, but patients taking bisphosphonates and megestrol acetate are not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients must not require total parenteral nutrition with lipids.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients must not have clinical history of coagulopathy, bleeding diathesis or&#xD;
