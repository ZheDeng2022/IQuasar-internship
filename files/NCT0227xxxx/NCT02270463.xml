    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized open label multi-center study. Patients who are in their first&#xD;
      complete remission (CR) following induction therapy will be treated with SL-401, which will&#xD;
      be administered as a brief intravenous infusion for 5 consecutive days every 28 days for 6 or&#xD;
      more cycles. Stage 1 will consist of a period in which approximately 6-9 patients will be&#xD;
      treated with SL-401 at 3 dose levels. During Stage 2, up to approximately 20 patients with&#xD;
      minimal residual disease (MRD) in their bone marrow will be treated at a maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose or maximum tested dose in which multiple dose-limiting toxicities are not observed&#xD;
      (identified in Stage 1).&#xD;

             criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient received any induction chemotherapy regimen and may have received&#xD;
             post-remission consolidation therapy prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient has achieved a first or second CR or CRi. For patients without evidence of&#xD;
             MRD in CR/CRi, CR (or CRi) must have been initially identified within 12 months prior&#xD;
             to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
             OR The patient has achieved first or second CR or CRi with evidence of MRD as&#xD;
             determined locally at least 6 months post stem cell transplant without evidence of&#xD;
             acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease post-transplant and has not received&#xD;
             immunosuppressant therapy for at least 14 days prior to SL-401 therapy.&#xD;

             internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation, history of antecedent hematologic disorder&#xD;
             (AHD), therapy-related AML, history of requiring more than 1 cycle of intensive&#xD;
             induction chemotherapy to achieve first remission, and/or presence of persistent MRD&#xD;
             (detected by cytogenetics, molecular markers, or flow cytometry) at any point after&#xD;
             the initial induction cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. For patients enrolling in Stage 2, the bone marrow evaluation determined locally&#xD;
             within the previous 6 months indicates the presence of MRD.&#xD;

             transplant as determined by the investigator.&#xD;

             or urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior to SL-401 treatment (intervals shorter&#xD;
             than 1 week are acceptable if required by institutional guidelines).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. A written and voluntarily signed informed consent must be obtained from the patient or&#xD;
             legally authorized representative, in accordance with local regulations, before the&#xD;
             initiation of any study related procedures. The patient or legally authorized&#xD;
             representative must be able to read and understand the informed consent form (ICF).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. The patient is able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol&#xD;
             requirements, including follow-up for survival assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             .&#xD;
&#xD;
             .&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient has a diagnosis of AML associated with karyotype t(15;17).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient has persistent and clinically significant Grade ≥2 toxicities from&#xD;
             induction or consolidation therapy (excluding alopecia, nausea, fatigue, and liver&#xD;
             function tests [as mandated in the inclusion criteria]) not readily managed with&#xD;
             supportive measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient received treatment with another investigational agent within 14 days of&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient previously received treatment with SL-401.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The patient has an active malignancy and/or cancer history (excluding AML or&#xD;
             antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS]) that may confound the assessment of the&#xD;
             study endpoints. Patients with a past cancer history (within 2 years of entry) with&#xD;
             substantial potential for recurrence and/or ongoing active malignancy must be&#xD;
             discussed with the Sponsor before study entry. Patients with the following neoplastic&#xD;
             diagnoses are eligible: non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ (including&#xD;
             superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder), cervical intraepithelial&#xD;
             neoplasia, organ-confined prostate cancer with no evidence of progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The patient has clinically significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., uncontrolled or&#xD;
             any New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             uncontrolled angina, history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina or stroke&#xD;
             within 6 months prior to study entry, uncontrolled hypertension or clinically&#xD;
             significant arrhythmias not controlled by medication).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The patient has uncontrolled, clinically significant pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic&#xD;
             obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension) that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator would put the patient at significant risk for pulmonary complications&#xD;
             during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The patient has known active or suspected central nervous system (CNS) leukemia. If&#xD;
             suspected, CNS leukemia should be ruled out with relevant imaging and/or examination&#xD;
             of cerebrospinal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The patient has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             uncontrolled infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The patient is pregnant or breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The patient has known positive status for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active&#xD;
             or chronic Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The patient is oxygen-dependent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. The patient has any medical condition which in the opinion of the Investigator places&#xD;
             the patient at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities.&#xD;
