      Background: The actual literature is consistent in considering potential negative effects of&#xD;
      sub-gingival prosthetic margins on the periodontal health, but no research has focused the&#xD;
      attention on the type of prosthetic margin designs. Hence, the aim of the present study is to&#xD;
      evaluate if a horizontal finishing line (deep chamfer preparation) may have a different&#xD;
      influence on periodontal soft tissue in comparison with a vertical finishing line (feather&#xD;
      edge preparation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A prospective randomized controlled double blind clinical trial with one single&#xD;
      operator and three experienced examiners was performed. One hundred and six crowns were&#xD;
      prepared with horizontal tooth preparation while ninety-four with vertical tooth preparation.&#xD;
      All the margins were positioned within the periodontal sulcus, at 0.5mm sub-gingivally and&#xD;
      all the all-ceramic restorations were cemented with resin cement. Periodontal Probing Depth&#xD;
      (PPD), Plaque Index (PI), Gingival Index (GI) and Gingival Bleeding on Probing (BOP) were&#xD;
      recorded prior to tooth preparation and twelve month after crown cementation. Also, at 12&#xD;
      months follow-up, the gingival margin position was related to the crown margin position.&#xD;
