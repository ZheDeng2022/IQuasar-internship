  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity and exercise have become an accepted and valued component of cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis care. Regular physical activity and exercise can slow the rate of decline of&#xD;
      pulmonary function, improve physical fitness, and enhance quality of life. However,&#xD;
      motivating people to be more active is challenging. Supervised, facility-based exercise&#xD;
      programs are expensive and labor intensive (since groups of patients with CF cannot exercise&#xD;
      together in the same physical location). Home-based exercise using an interactive exergame&#xD;
      device may be an effective way to improve adherence to an exercise program for patients with&#xD;
      CF. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of a 12-week,&#xD;
      home-based exergame exercise intervention on aerobic capacity (peak VO2). The secondary&#xD;
      endpoint is nasal potential difference, an indicator of how well sodium and chloride flow&#xD;
      across the mucous membranes in the nose. Other outcomes include patient-reported quality of&#xD;
      life and habitual physical activity level. Following baseline assessments participants will&#xD;
      be begin a 12 week, partially-supervised exercise program consisting of at least 90 minutes&#xD;
      per week of aerobic and resistance exercise training using the Nintendo Wii Fit Plus&#xD;
      exergaming device. Participants will receive at least monthly follow-up phone calls to&#xD;
      provide additional exercise counseling and motivation. After 12 weeks, they will continue&#xD;
      with the exergame intervention for another 12 weeks, but without external supervision.&#xD;
