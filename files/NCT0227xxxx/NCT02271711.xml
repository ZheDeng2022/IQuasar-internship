      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of expanded natural killer cells in&#xD;
      treating younger patients with brain tumors that have come back or do not respond to&#xD;
      treatment. Infusing a particular type of a patient's own white blood cells called natural&#xD;
      killer cells that have been through a procedure to expand (increase) their numbers may work&#xD;
      in treating patients with recurrent/refractory brain tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the safety, feasibility, efficacy, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      administering autologous natural killer (NK) cells that have been propagated ex vivo with&#xD;
      artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPC) and administered directly into the ventricle in&#xD;
      recurrent /refractory malignant posterior fossa tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the antitumor activity based on imaging and cytology of autologous NK cell&#xD;
      locoregional administration directly into the lateral or fourth ventricle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the persistence of adoptively-transferred expanded NK cells (as performed&#xD;
      with excess NK cells, via optional correlative studies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the immunophenotype and function of expanded NK cells. IV. Determine the&#xD;
      overall response of medulloblastoma to NK-cell therapy. V. Correlate NK cell persistence,&#xD;
      phenotype, and function with overall response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive autologous expanded NK cells intravenously (IV) into the ventricle over 3&#xD;
      minutes once weekly on weeks 1-3. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 3 courses in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients experiencing disease&#xD;
      progression may continue treatment at the discretion of the treating physician if&#xD;
      pseudo-progression or benefit of slowed progression is suspected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days.&#xD;
