      The aims of the study: Main objective of the current study is to decrease sedentary behavior&#xD;
      and increase physical activity among mothers and their offspring by using music-to-movement&#xD;
      video program. Primary outcomes of the study are objectively assessed sedentary behavior and&#xD;
      physical activity time measured both in minutes and as a proportion of measurement time.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes of the study are quantity and quality of self-reported screen time among&#xD;
      mothers and children and motivational quality of music and music-to-movement video.&#xD;
      Additional secondary outcomes are mother's weight, workability, mental health and mood.&#xD;
      Specific aim is to study effectiveness of intervention with accelerometer use only or with a&#xD;
      combination of accelerometer plus music-to-movement video program for mother-child pairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods: Participants (mother and child -pairs) of the Movement-to-music video&#xD;
      program (Moving Sound) -study will be recruited from the cohort of the original Lifestyle,&#xD;
      counselling and exercise in maternity care (NELLI) -project from 14 municipalities of&#xD;
      Pirkanmaa area. Participants will be randomized in two groups: accelerometer (ACC) vs.&#xD;
      accelerometer plus movement-to-music video program (ACC+DVD) groups. Objective measurement of&#xD;
      sedentariness and physical activity is based on accelerometer. Information on current health&#xD;
      behavior will be based on intervention questionnaires. In the analysis physical activity,&#xD;
      sedentary time and body weight of the intervention and control group will be compared.&#xD;
      Effects of mother's musical (and PA) background and other mediating factors will be analyzed&#xD;
      separately in subgroup analyses.&#xD;

      The aims of the study Quite many people use music during exercise for example while jogging&#xD;
      or in the gym. Anyhow some mothers might have difficulties to exercise when they have small&#xD;
      children and thereby importance of physical activity at home increases. Consequently, there&#xD;
      is a need to perform an experimental study which combines the understanding of the benefits&#xD;
      of music, objective physical activity measurement in decreasing sedentariness and thereafter&#xD;
      transgenerational obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective of the current study is to decrease sedentary behavior and increase physical&#xD;
      activity among mothers and their offspring by using music-to-movement video program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim is to study effectiveness of intervention with accelerometer use only or with a&#xD;
      combination of accelerometer plus music-to-movement video program for mother-child pairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Are there changes in sedentary time and physical activity while using accelerometer and&#xD;
      movement-to-music video program? Hypothesis: Movement-to-music video program developed for&#xD;
      mother-child pairs decrease sedentary time more than wearing accelerometer only. There are no&#xD;
      changes in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, although amount of light intensity&#xD;
      physical activity increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. How does motivational effects of music affect to physical activity? Hypothesis:&#xD;
      Movement-to-music video motivates mother-child pairs increase physical activity and decrease&#xD;
      sedentary behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Is there any relationship between mothers' musical background and physical&#xD;
      activity/sedentary behavior? Hypothesis: Mothers' musicality motivates them exercise more&#xD;
      with video program than mothers' without musical background.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research methods Accelerometer measures and pretest. Main aim of the project is to reduce&#xD;
      sedentariness among women and their children. Accelerometer measures continuously tri-axial&#xD;
      acceleration caused by any movement and permits accurate individual assessment of both&#xD;
      physical activity and sedentary behavior. Data on physical activity and sedentary behavior&#xD;
      will be collected with tri-axial accelerometer (Hookie AM 20, Traxmeet Ltd, Espoo, Finland).&#xD;
      The data will be collected in raw mode and analyzed as the mean signal amplitude deviation&#xD;
      (MAD) of acceleration, which permits accurate individual assessment of both physical activity&#xD;
      and sedentariness. The algorithms used in the present study are based on pilot studies&#xD;
      conducted at the UKK Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accelerometers were pretested with eleven 2-9 years old children. Children did different kind&#xD;
      of free movements, play, and games in test track field during one hour. That was done to find&#xD;
      out how scurry-like movements appear in accelerometers. Another test in running track tested&#xD;
      different speeds from the slow walking to the maximum rate of running. In addition&#xD;
      accelerometers piloted with ten 4-7 years children during one week. On the basis of these&#xD;
      tests acceleration signal acted as expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Movement-to-music DVD production and pretest. There will be three separate movement-to-music&#xD;
      video programs prepared by the Sibelius-Academy music education students in the specific&#xD;
      course for children's music programs during spring 2014. Directors, Soili Perki√∂ and&#xD;
      Eeva-Leena Pokela are children's music professionals. The student group is called&#xD;
      Mutaveijarit (The Mud Mates). Video programs were produced for this study. First and second&#xD;
      videos last about 10 minutes including two songs and their movement preparation. There are&#xD;
      three songs altogether, because the title song Mutaveijarit is in both tracks. The third&#xD;
      video includes all songs together without their movement preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To rate the motivational qualities of these three songs, a panel of 8 physiotherapists (all&#xD;
      female) assessed each song by using Brunel Music Rating Inventory-2 (BMRI-2; BMRI-3). Another&#xD;
      reason for pretest was to find out the influence of visual stimuli on the responses to the&#xD;
      music. BMRI-2 was translated in Finnish by investigators of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each song was rated by indicating one number between 1 (strongly disagree) and 7 (strongly&#xD;
      agree) for six statements about how much the song would motivate a person during exercise.&#xD;
      The possible range of scores is 6-42, wherein scores below 24 mean low/oudeterous, middle&#xD;
      range 24-35 moderately and scores over 36 mean highly motivating ratings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video group (n=4, mean age 41 years, SD 16,2 years) was first watching DVD and assessed all&#xD;
      three songs separately using BMRI-2. Then they listened music only (without illustration) and&#xD;
      rated the motivational qualities of each song. Music group (n=4, mean age 42,8 years, SD 15,8&#xD;
      years) assessed first only the motivational qualities of the songs. After that music group&#xD;
      was watching DVD and appraised the music and illustration together. In addition both groups&#xD;
      moved to DVD and rated the motivational qualities of music during movement. All songs were&#xD;
      rated moderately motivating (ratings between 31,4 and 34,6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rhythm, style, melody, tempo and beat motivated movement more in video group than in&#xD;
      music group. Music group assessed sound motivated them more than sound did in video group.&#xD;
      During movement rhythm, style, and beat motivated video group more while melody, tempo, and&#xD;
      sound motivated music group. As expected in both groups music and picture together motivated&#xD;
      movement more than music alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection. Objective measurements of sedentary behavior and physical activity of the&#xD;
      mothers and their children will be collected at first, second and eighth weeks of the&#xD;
      intervention by using accelerometer. Body weight of the mothers will be measured at baseline.&#xD;
      Information on current physical activity, screen time, diet, and self-reported weight, as&#xD;
      well as information on quality of life will be collected at the baseline by using same&#xD;
      questionnaires as in the NELLI 5-years follow-up study (based on one-year follow-up&#xD;
      questionnaires of the NELLI cohort). At 2 and 8 weeks after baseline information on physical&#xD;
      activity, screen time, self-reported weight and motivation to exercise by using&#xD;
      movement-to-music video program will be collected by questionnaires. Information of the&#xD;
      children's physical activity and screen time will be collected at baseline, 2nd and 8th weeks&#xD;
      after baseline by questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods. Effect of the intervention will be analyzed following the&#xD;
      intention-to-treat principle by comparing the changes in the main outcomes between&#xD;
      intervention and control group participants. Multivariate methods corresponding to analysis&#xD;
      of covariance and logistic regression will be used. Non-paramet¬¨ric methods will also be&#xD;
      utilized if needed. In the analysis physical activity, sedentary time and body weight of the&#xD;
      intervention and control group will be compared. Subgroup analysis in intervention group will&#xD;
      be conducted for mother's motivation to exercise with movement-to-music video program and&#xD;
      effects of musical background.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research materials Participants of the Moving Sound -study will be recruited from the cohort&#xD;
      of the original NELLI-RTC. Mother and child -pairs (n=837) will be invited to NELLI 5-years&#xD;
      follow-up study and to Moving Sound -study from 14 municipalities of Pirkanmaa area. We&#xD;
      expect to get involved 30-40 % of the original cohort, which will be 251-335 mother and child&#xD;
      -pairs, altogether.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be done for 2:2 ratios, which means two mother-child pairs to intervention&#xD;
      group per two pairs of control participants. For allocation of the participants an&#xD;
      appointment order list for NELLI 5-years follow-up study will be used. Mothers will be&#xD;
      randomized to intervention or control group by using sealed envelopes in contact of sampling&#xD;
      for NELLI-study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculations for the study show that approximately 91 mother and child -pairs are&#xD;
      needed, if there are 80 % sedentary women at baseline and the anticipated difference in&#xD;
      sedentariness is 25 % between the ACC (accelerometer) and ACC + DVD (accelerometer plus&#xD;
      movement-to-music video program) groups after intervention. If the anticipated difference&#xD;
      between groups is smaller (than 25 %), the number of pairs needed is 135 per group. In this&#xD;
      study sedentary women are defined as being sitting or in reclining posture more than 76 % of&#xD;
      waking hours.&#xD;
