  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find the optimal dose of AllerT that should be used to treat&#xD;
      moderate to severe allergies due to birch tree pollen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 4 treatment groups in this study; 3 treatment groups will receive AllerT at&#xD;
      different doses and 1 treatment group will receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also assess the effectiveness and safety of AllerT compared to placebo in&#xD;
      relieving allergy symptoms.&#xD;

      Primary Objective: To evaluate the dose-response trend of three doses of adjuvanted AllerT&#xD;
      and of placebo in reducing symptoms of allergic rhino-conjunctivitis in subjects exposed to&#xD;
      birch tree pollen in an environmental exposure chamber (EEC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate three dose regimens of AllerT , versus a placebo in reducing symptoms of&#xD;
           allergic rhino-conjunctivitis in subjects exposed to birch tree pollen in an EEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of a two month treatment with three dose regiments&#xD;
           of AllerT (10 µg, 25 µg and 50 µg with Al(OH)3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the immunological response to AllerT.&#xD;
