  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, X-rays and blood tests often miss pancreatic cancer. In this study, we are&#xD;
      collecting and studying the fluid produced by the pancreas as a way to detect pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer at an earlier stage.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is very difficult to detect and treat, and patients with this cancer&#xD;
      generally live fewer years than patients with other types of cancer. Part of the reason why&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer is so hard to treat is because it is usually discovered when it is too&#xD;
      advanced to be able to treat. The goal of this protocol is to find a way to detect pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer earlier, when it is still treatable in order to improve the survival of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pancreas is a gland which produces digestive juices that mix with food in the intestines.&#xD;
      Normal patients as well as patients with pancreatic cancer produce these juices. Other&#xD;
      researchers have collected this fluid from very small numbers of patients and their results&#xD;
      suggest that pancreatic fluid can be used to detect pancreatic cancer. One of the major&#xD;
      issues with these results is that pancreatic fluid from only a very few number of patients&#xD;
      has been collected and analyzed. In order to find out whether the pancreatic fluid can be&#xD;
      used as a standard test for pancreatic cancer, the fluid from a greater number of patients&#xD;
      needs to be analyzed. Also, of all the different chemicals in the pancreatic fluid, in this&#xD;
      study we will try to figure out what the most important chemicals are in diagnosing&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

        Group A: Participants with a confirmed diagnosis of a pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be&#xD;
        enrolled in this study. Potential participants will be identified from the Surgical&#xD;
        Oncology and Gastroenterology outpatient settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group B: Participants with a confirmed diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis will be enrolled&#xD;
        in this study. Participants will be derived from the Gastroenterology and Gastrointestinal&#xD;
        Surgery outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group C: Participants undergoing endoscopy for non-pancreatic, non-neoplastic indications.&#xD;
        The typical patient population we anticipate recruiting to this group with be those with&#xD;
        non-malignant, non-pancreatitis biliary calculous disease. Participants will be derived&#xD;
        from the Gastroenterology outpatient setting.&#xD;
