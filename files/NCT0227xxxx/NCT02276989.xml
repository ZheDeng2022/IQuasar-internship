      In a small, well-characterized sample of prescription opioid abusers (POAs) with chronic pain&#xD;
      and on buprenorphine therapy, this supplement study will investigate the utility and&#xD;
      feasibility of two novel tracer compounds, and in combination with a standard marker&#xD;
      (riboflavin), to monitor adherence to study drug prescription in the parent clinical trial&#xD;
      (NCT01821430).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We will examine the ability of two benign (in the doses used) medications, quinine&#xD;
           (80mg) and acetazolamide (15mg) to serve as valid and reliable markers of medication&#xD;
           use. The relative utility of each will be described for use with the study medication&#xD;
           (PGB 400mg/day), a drug dependent on primarily renal excretion. In that both PGB and&#xD;
           acetazolamide are eliminated unchanged in the urine, we will examine if the latter can&#xD;
           be used without altering the elimination rate of the former, or whether a maker with&#xD;
           both hepatic and renal modes of elimination (quinine) would serve as a better indicator&#xD;
           of adherence in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Being a standard in clinical trials, the medication adherence marker riboflavin is used&#xD;
           in the parent study (NCT01821430), as it can be readily detected in urine samples by&#xD;
           simple visual inspection. However, riboflavin is a relatively gross indicator of&#xD;
           medication use; it does not reside in the body for the time period typically required in&#xD;
           outpatient trials, can be affected by dietary riboflavin and has variable absorption.&#xD;
           Capitalizing on riboflavin's ease of detection, the second aim of this supplement will&#xD;
           be to examine whether riboflavin when combined with one of the new candidate tracers,&#xD;
           can provide a superior indicator of adherence, in that riboflavin can be qualitatively&#xD;
           observed immediately, and the other tracer being quantitatively detected during&#xD;
           subsequent urine toxicology analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cross over design of the study will allow us to address these aims in an efficient and&#xD;
      straightforward manner. Following examination of the pharmacokinetics (PK) of PGB alone, it's&#xD;
      PK will then be reexamined when compounded with acetazolamide, and again with both&#xD;
      acetazolamide and riboflavin present. Next, after a short washout period, the studies PGB PK&#xD;
      will be repeated with acetazolamide replaced by quinine. If the new tracers do not interfere&#xD;
      with the PK of PGB, one of them will be chosen to be formulated (along with riboflavin) with&#xD;
      PGB for use in the parent study, thereby providing both qualitative and quantitative&#xD;
      indicators of adherence.&#xD;

    <description>On evening of Day 0, subjects will arrive at the session previously stabilized on buprenorphine and pregabalin. Pregabalin titration = 6 days prior to Day 0, during which time they will receive 100mg/day x 2 days, 200mg/day x2 days, and 300mg/day x 2 days, with the subjects receiving the full dose of 400mg/day beginning Day 0.&#xD;
On Day 1, pregabalin PK measures will be collected.&#xD;
On the mornings (8am) of Days 1 - 5, PGB compounded with the first tracer, ACZ will be administered.&#xD;
On Day 5, subjects will again undergo PK testing on PGB + ACZ tracer.&#xD;
On Day 6, subjects will be administered PGB and ACZ compounded with RIBO, and PK measures again collected.&#xD;
On the mornings of Days 7-8 subjects will receive their PGB dose only.</description>
