  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A successful non-operative management strategy for early appendicitis will decrease the&#xD;
      number of children requiring surgery and may improve the quality of care related to the&#xD;
      treatment of appendicitis. To account for the child-family perspective and treatment&#xD;
      preferences, the investigators will perform a study in which patients and their families&#xD;
      choose between antibiotics alone (Non-operative group) or appendectomy (Surgery group) at ten&#xD;
      U.S. hospitals. This study will determine the effectiveness of non-operative management of&#xD;
      early appendicitis with antibiotics alone in children and compare differences in morbidity,&#xD;
      disability, quality of life, satisfaction, and cost between families choosing surgery or&#xD;
      non-operative management.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several randomized controlled trials comparing appendectomy to antibiotics alone in adults&#xD;
      with acute appendicitis have been reported from non-U.S. countries. These studies reveal that&#xD;
      non-operative management of appendicitis is a safe treatment for appendicitis and is&#xD;
      associated with a significantly lower risk of complications than appendectomy. We have&#xD;
      recently completed the first study in the U.S. examining the feasibility of non-operative&#xD;
      management of uncomplicated appendicitis in children. In our pilot study, patients and their&#xD;
      families chose between urgent appendectomy or antibiotics alone for treatment of&#xD;
      uncomplicated appendicitis. The success rate of non-operative management was 90% at 30 days&#xD;
      and 80% at a median follow-up of 8 months. In addition, patients in the non-operative group&#xD;
      demonstrated a significantly faster return to normal activity and reported higher quality of&#xD;
      life scores. The current proposal seeks to further investigate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      non-operative management with antibiotics alone as a treatment option for children with&#xD;
      uncomplicated appendicitis. When randomized trials are not feasible due to strong treatment&#xD;
      preferences or when only a small proportion of patients will accept randomization, a parallel&#xD;
      group non-randomized study where participants are allocated to their preferred treatment is a&#xD;
      valuable alternative. Based on feedback from a multi-disciplinary stakeholder group that was&#xD;
      convened to assess the potential impact of family preferences on study outcomes, recruitment,&#xD;
      and generalizability, we propose a multi-institutional trial in which patients and their&#xD;
      families choose between antibiotics alone (Non-operative group) or appendectomy (Surgery&#xD;
      group). We hypothesize that non-operative management will be successful in 75% of patients at&#xD;
      1 year follow-up and will be associated with fewer disability days, higher quality of life&#xD;
      scores, and lower costs than appendectomy. This study will enroll 795 patients, age 8-17&#xD;
      years, with uncomplicated appendicitis at 10 children's hospitals. The primary outcomes are:&#xD;
      1) differences in treatment-related disability between non-operative management and surgery&#xD;
      in children with uncomplicated appendicitis across 10 children's hospitals; and 2) the&#xD;
      success rate of non-operative management of uncomplicated appendicitis at 10 children's&#xD;
      hospitals, defined as the percent of patients treated non-operatively who do not undergo an&#xD;
      appendectomy. Secondary outcomes include differences between the groups in rates of&#xD;
      complicated appendicitis, post-treatment related complications, disability days of the&#xD;
      parent, quality of life and healthcare satisfaction measures, and total costs and the&#xD;
      incremental cost-effectiveness of non-operative management relative to appendectomy. The&#xD;
      proposed study will expand upon our previous pilot study by including patients from both&#xD;
      freestanding and non-freestanding children's hospitals with both urban and rural demographies&#xD;
      to determine the success rate and morbidity associated with non-operative management in a&#xD;
      population that better represents the overall population of children in the U.S. Successful&#xD;
      completion of this study may provide evidence for the effectiveness of non-operative&#xD;
      management of uncomplicated appendicitis as an alternative first line therapy in children.&#xD;
