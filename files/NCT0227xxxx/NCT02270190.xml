  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main research question is to see if Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation (PTNS) can&#xD;
      improve the symptom of tenesmus in patients with pelvic floor disorders. This includes those&#xD;
      who have rectal cancer in situ or who are post-rectal cancer treatment and have Anterior&#xD;
      Resection Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary research questions are to see if other pelvic floor symptoms and quality of&#xD;
      life improves for this patient group and if levels of anxiety and depression improve for&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to discover if PTNS can be used to reduce the symptoms in those&#xD;
      patients with tenesmus due to their pelvic floor disorders. These pelvic floor disorders&#xD;
      include rectal cancer in situ, Anterior Resection Syndrome developed after rectal-cancer&#xD;
      treatment, or gynaecological problems. Gynaecological problems that can cause tenesmus&#xD;
      include radiotherapy for gynaecological cancer, ovarian cysts, pelvic organ prolapse and&#xD;
      hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is a lack of treatment options available to manage patients with tenesmus&#xD;
      and it is hoped that PTNS will provide a simple, non-invasive treatment to this wide patient&#xD;
      group with distressing symptoms. Assessment of symptom improvement will be used by analysing&#xD;
      the change in scores on the COREFO, e-PAQ and HADS questionnaires, which will be completed&#xD;
      pre and post treatment. COREFO is a validated questionnaire which includes questions&#xD;
      specifically relating to tenesmus. e-PAQ is a validated questionnaire which looks at all&#xD;
      aspects of the pelvic floor (bowel, urinary, vaginal, sexual) along with quality of life.&#xD;
      HADS is a validated questionnaire classifying the patient's degree of anxiety and depression&#xD;
      as either &quot;normal&quot;, &quot;borderline abnormal&quot; or &quot;abnormal&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been two pilot studies looking into the effect of PTNS in improving symptoms in&#xD;
      Anterior Resection Syndrome patients. However, full papers have not been published of this&#xD;
      data. These two studies assessed symptom improvement using questionnaires, but they did not&#xD;
      use COREFO, e-PAQ or HADS, or include patients who currently have rectal cancer (i.e. not&#xD;
      Anterior Resection Syndrome patients) or gynaecological problems and have the same tenesmus&#xD;
      symptoms. Thus this makes this research an original proposal. e-PAQ is widely used in STH to&#xD;
      assess pelvic floor symptoms, and thus its use here enables comparison with other patient&#xD;
      groups who also have PTNS as a treatment option.&#xD;

    <description>The degree of success of the PTNS treatment will be measured by comparing the results from the COREFO, e-PAQ and HADS questionnaires before and after the 12 weeks of treatment. The treatment will be deemed successful if the post-treatment score is significantly lower than the pre-treatment score.</description>
