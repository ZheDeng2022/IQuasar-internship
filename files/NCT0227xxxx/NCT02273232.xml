    <textblock>
      Remote ischemic Preconditioning (RIPC) is a phenomena first observed in cardio-thoracic&#xD;
      patients in which exposing the limbs for periods of short intermittent ischemia produces&#xD;
      protective effect on heart muscle. The concept was applied to many other parts of the body&#xD;
      and the results are positive so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No human trials on this concept has been conducted in patients with peripheral vascular&#xD;
      disease so far but applying the concept for healthy individuals shows vessels dilatation and&#xD;
      animal trials shows degree of new vessels formation in addition to reports of symptoms&#xD;
      improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial candidates will be allocated blindly in 4 groups. All groups will have advice about&#xD;
      exercise which is the standard practice now. The first group will have supervised exercise.&#xD;
      The second group will in addition to the supervised exercise get the ischemic preconditioning&#xD;
      with the blood pressure cuff. The third group will get the ischemic preconditioning and the&#xD;
      fourth group will get the standard exercise advice. All candidates will have Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Image Scan (MRA) for their blood vessels in the beginning of the trial and again at&#xD;
      the end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of the RIPC (Remote ischemic Preconditioning) and exercises on patient symptoms,&#xD;
      new vessel formation and other parameters will be recorded&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) is a major health problem, affecting approximately 20% of&#xD;
      adults over 55 years of age and about 27 million people in North America and Europe . Most&#xD;
      PVD is asymptomatic. Intermittent claudication is the typical clinical manifestation,&#xD;
      developing in about 5% men aged 60 years and increases with age . For every patient with&#xD;
      symptomatic PAD there are another three to four subjects in general population with PVD who&#xD;
      do not meet the clinical criteria for intermittent claudication [4] . There are no precise&#xD;
      figures for PVD's health economic impact in Ireland. In the United States, the estimated&#xD;
      total cost of PVD exceeds $21 billion annually .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment options for non-lifestyle limiting claudication include watchful waiting,&#xD;
      medical management, exercise training, endovascular treatment and surgical reconstruction&#xD;
      with uncertainty regarding the optimal approach in many patients. PVD patients usually have&#xD;
      multiple co-morbidities. Decisions regarding optimal management seek to balance the risk of&#xD;
      intervention in patients with multiple co-morbidities, the likely benefit in terms of symptom&#xD;
      relief and quality of life and the overall life-expectancy of these patients . There is a&#xD;
      need for safer, non-invasive interventions which are cost-effective and acceptable to&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ischemic preconditioning was first described by Murry et al, almost 30 years ago when he&#xD;
      observed that protection was conferred on ischemic myocardium by preceding brief periods of&#xD;
      sub lethal ischemia separated by periods of reperfusion . Subsequent experiments demonstrated&#xD;
      that brief periods of ischemia-reperfusion in any tissue conferred protection on any other&#xD;
      tissue exposed to a significant ischemic insult. For example, brief periods of skeletal&#xD;
      muscle ischemia-reperfusion confers protection on the heart. This phenomenon is referred to&#xD;
      as remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trials in cardiac surgery and percutaneous coronary intervention suggest that RIPC&#xD;
      reduces cardiac injury, critical care stay and inotropes use. However, the effects of&#xD;
      preconditioning in peripheral vascular disease patients remain largely un evaluated, apart&#xD;
      from some small studies on symptomatic relief and the exercise induced preconditioning effect&#xD;
      . Remote preconditioning affects blood supply in other limbs. Enko et al demonstrated that&#xD;
      intermittent arm ischemia by applying 3 cycles of 200mmHg pressure for 5 minutes, followed by&#xD;
      5 minutes of reperfusion produced dilatation of the contralateral brachial artery in healthy&#xD;
      individuals. In a more recent study, Karakyoun et al evaluated RIPC and direct&#xD;
      preconditioning in a rat model of critical limb ischemia. Iliac artery ligation was used to&#xD;
      create critical limb ischemia in the rats. Both direct preconditioning (intermittent&#xD;
      tourniquet application in the ischemic limb) and RIPC (intermittent tourniquet application on&#xD;
      the contralateral leg) produced significant increases in perfusion and microvasculature&#xD;
      density in the ischemic limb with true new blood vessels formation in both direct the IC and&#xD;
      RIPC groups .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that remote preconditioning as an adjunct to exercise therapy&#xD;
      or alone could stimulate greater microvessel formation in the legs of claudication patients,&#xD;
      improving clinical outcomes in terms of symptoms and delayed complications. It may provide a&#xD;
      new non-invasive option for PVD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Frame All peripheral vascular disease patients referred to UCHG (University Collage&#xD;
      Hospital Galway) OPD (Out Patients) in addition to inpatients during trial period will be&#xD;
      actively searched to identify medical profiles which fulfill the trial criteria. Recruitment&#xD;
      for the trial will be stopped at 15 months of 24 months' time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design Patients referred to vascular service OPDs (out patients) with claudication&#xD;
      symptoms for the first time are usually assessed a by consultant or specialty registrar.&#xD;
      Further investigations and course of management depends mainly on their symptoms and co&#xD;
      morbidities. Many end up with diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease. From this group in&#xD;
      addition to in patients group those with moderate peripheral vascular disease i.e.,&#xD;
      Rutherford stage 2 and Fontaine stage 2a. Will be recruited&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target number will be 40 patients divided into 4 groups. All groups candidate will&#xD;
      undergo base line assessment which include history, examination, MRA and ABIs. The candidates&#xD;
      will be randomized into:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supervised Exercise Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All PVD patients will get the standard advice regarding exercises but this group will have a&#xD;
      constructed exercise program under supervision of Dr. Miche√°l Newell who is qualified Sports&#xD;
      and Exercise Scientist with a Doctorate degree in Integrated Biology. This include six minute&#xD;
      walk test, Chair Stand Test and symptoms free distance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RIPC and supervised Exercise Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This group will have structured intermittent periods of induced remote ischemic&#xD;
      preconditioning using standard blood pressure cuffs. The cuff will be applied for 5 minutes&#xD;
      alternatively with 5 minutes rest to the total of 4 cycles, which needs 40 minutes per day.&#xD;
      The RIPC group will receive an exercise program identical to the first group. The total&#xD;
      number of days for each participant will be 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RIPC with Standard Care Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in this group will receive standard care advice regarding exercise in addition&#xD;
      to RIPC as in the 2nd group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group (Standard Care):&#xD;
&#xD;
      This group will get the standard advice regarding exercise for PVD patients and all the&#xD;
      information available in OPD settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be a pilot study to obtain preliminary data and evaluate the need for&#xD;
      full-scale trial hence there is no human trial in this particular area so far. The initial&#xD;
      target will be 40 patients distributed in 4 groups of 10 patient each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Age and DM (Diabetes Mellitus ) are associated with many comorbidities.&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified for these two confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All trial candidates will have unique numbers to identify them and conceal their identity.&#xD;
      Patients files will be locked in trial office with one person access and each candidate will&#xD;
      get their numbers in sequential way according to their allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Projected recruitment Galway University hospital provides vascular services for a population&#xD;
      of approximately 750000 served by the West-North West Hospitals Group. The patients for the&#xD;
      trial will be actively recruited from out patients clinics, in patients and GP clinics by&#xD;
      sending letters to GPs ( General practitioners ) about the trial. Information about the trial&#xD;
      will be given to all vascular team including criteria for selection and exclusion. Those who&#xD;
      qualified will be counselled by the trial team and consented if the agree to join. The target&#xD;
      of 40 patients should be achievable within the recruitment window.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment &amp; consent Eligible candidates will be given all the information about the&#xD;
      trial in written and verbal explanation for all the steps. Patients who are willing to take&#xD;
      part will be asked to provide written informed consent. Three copies of the consent form will&#xD;
      be signed: one for the patient, one for the patient's clinical notes file and a one copy for&#xD;
      the patient's trial folder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Demographic and clinical data of eligible candidates who agree to participate&#xD;
      will be collected. The candidates will be assign a trial number identifier after informed&#xD;
      consent is signed and no personal information will be available on the data entry sheets. The&#xD;
      original data-entry proforma will be retained together with a copy of the consent form in the&#xD;
      trial office with other trial documents in the trial office in CSI( Clinical Science&#xD;
      Institute) building. The code key for the trial numbers will be limited to the Chief&#xD;
      Investigator. Encrypted back up copy will be prepared at the end of each data entry and will&#xD;
      be kept looked separately. All data will be retained in the care of the principal&#xD;
      investigator for a period of five years from the closure of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The statistical analysis with respect to the primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will be performed by a trial team member blinded to trial allocation. The&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed under the supervision of the trial&#xD;
      health-economist (to be confirmed). This is a pilot study the results will identify if there&#xD;
      is a need for larger trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial monitoring Day-to-day management of the trial will be the responsibility of the trial&#xD;
      manager, supervised by the principal investigator. A meeting will be held every two weeks&#xD;
      between the trial manager and the principal investigator to monitor recruitment, data&#xD;
      collection etc.&#xD;
