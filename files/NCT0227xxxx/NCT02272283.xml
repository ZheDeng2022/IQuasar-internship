    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease is one of the most prevalent diseases in the western countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A waxy substance called plaque can build up inside the coronary arteries. Over time, plaque&#xD;
      can harden or rupture, and cause narrowing (stenosis) of the arteries and reduce the flow of&#xD;
      oxygen-rich blood to the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard treatment of symptomatic coronary stenosis is percutaneous coronary intervention&#xD;
      (PCI) with balloon dilation followed by stent implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A stent is a small metallic grid that stabilizes the coronary vessel wall after the balloon&#xD;
      dilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, drug-eluting stents (DES) are the most widely used stent types. DESs consist of a&#xD;
      metallic backbone and an antiprolifetive drug-coating bound by a polymer (glue). These&#xD;
      devices have reduced the incidence of excessive formation of new tissue (in-stent restenosis)&#xD;
      dramatically in comparison with previously used bare-metal stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are &quot;safety concerns&quot; with DES, since later thrombotic events have been&#xD;
      reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On one hand excessive tissue formation inside the stent can cause in-stent restenosis, and on&#xD;
      the other hand insufficient coverage of the stent can cause persistently exposed metalllic&#xD;
      material that can induce platelet aggregation and thrombus-formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology to stent thrombosis is multifactorial. Possible predisposing factors are, among&#xD;
      others: 1) hypersensitivity towards the polymer-coating, which may induce delayed healing&#xD;
      inside and around the stent, and 2) insufficient contact between the stent and the underlying&#xD;
      coronary vessel wall (incomplete stent apposition), which may cause flow-disturbance and&#xD;
      delayed healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed healing causes persistently exposed metallic material that can induce platelet&#xD;
      aggregation and thrombus-formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Nobori stent is a new-generation DES, coated with a thin layer of drug and a&#xD;
      bioabsorbable polymer. The drug is localized on the outer side of the stent, and decreases&#xD;
      the release of drug to the blood circulation. The bioabsorbable polymer is degraded after 6-9&#xD;
      months after implantation, and decreases the risk of hypersensitivity-reactions in the vessel&#xD;
      wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The improved pharmacokinetic profile of the stent is thought to improve the healing pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At routine coronary angiography, a small plastic tube is inserted in the femoral artery under&#xD;
      local anesthesia. Thin, flexible catheters are then advanced through the artery system&#xD;
      (femoral artery and aorta) to the coronary arteries. Contrast is injected in to the blood&#xD;
      stream by the catheters, and the arteries are depicted by a special X-ray technique during&#xD;
      dye-release. By angiography, the outer sides of the coronary arteries are visualized, and&#xD;
      balloon dilations and stent implantations are guided by this standard technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newer studies have documented that stent placement and expansion is superiorly visualized if&#xD;
      supplementary intravascular imaging is performed during stent implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small imaging catheters are wired through the vessel after stent implantation, and film the&#xD;
      stent retrogradely through the vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) visualizes the complete vessel wall by use of sound waves,&#xD;
      and stent expansion is evaluated in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a newer light-based, high-resolution technology. The&#xD;
      technique can depict every thread (strut) from the stent, enabling visualization of both&#xD;
      contact between struts and underlying vessel wall immediately after the procedure, and strut&#xD;
      coverage at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether OCT-guided PCI can improve healing and&#xD;
      coverage of the stent in comparison with routine angiographic guidance alone in patients&#xD;
      indicating PCI due to myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If OCT-guidance improves coverage of the stent, this might lower the later thrombotic risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients hospitalized due to myocardial infarction are randomized either to OCT-guided or&#xD;
      angio-guided stent implantation in the present study. In both groups the Nobori stent is&#xD;
      implanted according to standard techniques. In the angio-guided group, implantations are&#xD;
      guided by angiography alone. OCT- and IVUS analysis are performed after an angiographic&#xD;
      optimal result for documentary reasons. The operator is blinded towards the image findings,&#xD;
      and analysis is performed offline later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the OCT-guided group, both OCT and IVUS analysis is interpreted immediately after the&#xD;
      acquisition. If stent apposition and/or expansion is deemed suboptimal, additional balloon&#xD;
      dilation and/or stenting is performed. In case of OCT-driven stent optimization, a&#xD;
      documentary OCT and IVUS is performed to document the final result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are readmitted 6 months later for a control angiogram inclusive OCT to assess stent&#xD;
      coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, patients are readmitted 12 months after the index procedure for a control&#xD;
      angiogram including OCT and IVUS to assess dynamic vessel wall responses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Drug-eluting stents (DES) have reduced the rate of in-stent restenosis dramatically in&#xD;
      comparison with bare-metal stents (BMS). Still, there are &quot;safety concerns&quot; in form of late&#xD;
      and very late stent thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multifactorial predictors may be associated with later thrombotic events, but delayed&#xD;
      arterial healing has been documented the most powerful predisposing factor in previous&#xD;
      histo-pathological studies. Culprit lesions in patients having DES-implantation due to&#xD;
      myocardial infarction are associated with substantial delay in arterial healing in comparison&#xD;
      with patients having DES-implantation due to stable coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous procedural factors are also of significant importance with regard to sufficient&#xD;
      coronary vessel wall healing. Particularly, acute incomplete stent apposition (ISA) is a&#xD;
      strong procedural risk factor for delayed coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a high-resolution intravascular imaging modality, which&#xD;
      enables detailed in-vivo assessment of the immediate stenting result and the vascular healing&#xD;
      pattern, including strut coverage, at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some procedural factors can be modified using OCT-guidance, potentially leading to a decrease&#xD;
      in the proportion of uncovered struts at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that OCT-guided PCI can reduce the incidence of acute and late&#xD;
      ISA, and thereby provide improved strut coverage following Nobori-stent implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to assess whether OCT-guided optimization following Nobori&#xD;
      stent implantation in patients with Non ST segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)&#xD;
      improves the coronary vascular response in comparison with routine angiographic guidance&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is designed as a prospective, randomized trial conducted at a single center&#xD;
      (Odense University Hospital). One-hundred patients were enrolled (Between August 2011 and May&#xD;
      2013). Prior to the PCI procedure, patients were loaded with a 300 mg dose of aspirin, and a&#xD;
      loading dose of 180 mg ticagrelor. An unfractionated heparin dose (70 IU/kg) was administered&#xD;
      just before the PCI-procedure. In all cases the third-generation biolimus-eluting stent&#xD;
      (Nobori, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was implanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stents were implanted according to standard techniques. Recommended post-procedure dual&#xD;
      antiplatelet regimens were 75 mg aspirin daily lifelong and 90 mg ticagrelor twice daily for&#xD;
      1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-implantation, after acquisition of an angiographic optimal result, patients were&#xD;
      randomly assigned 1:1 to either: 1) OCT-guided PCI, or 2) angio-guided PCI. Random&#xD;
      assignments were distributed in sealed envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both treatment arms had post-procedure OCT and IVUS performed after administration of 200&#xD;
      micrograms of intracoronary nitroglycerin. It was not possible to blind the operator,&#xD;
      investigator or patient for the allocated implantation technique, but the operator was&#xD;
      blinded to the post-procedure OCT- and IVUS images in the angio-guided group, as the operator&#xD;
      screen-side was turned off, and the entire pullbacks remained uncommented on. In the&#xD;
      OCT-guided group, images were interpreted online by a dedicated OCT-analyst and the&#xD;
      PCI-operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the post-procedure OCT revealed: 1) under expansion of the stent with a minimal stent area&#xD;
      (MSA) &lt;90% of the distal/proximal reference vessel lumen area, and/or 2) significant acute&#xD;
      ISA (defined as more or equal to 3 struts per cross sectional area detached more than 140&#xD;
      microns (thickness of strut + drug/polymer coating)) from the underlying vessel wall, and/or&#xD;
      3) edge dissection(s) causing significant reduction in minimal lumen area(s) (MLA&lt;4 mm2)&#xD;
      and/or 4) significant residual stenosis (MLA&lt;4 mm2) at the proximal and/or distal reference&#xD;
      segment(s) additional intervention was encouraged. The degree of optimization based upon OCT&#xD;
      findings was left to the judgement of the PCI-operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were scheduled for both a 6-months clinical and invasive (including angiogram and&#xD;
      OCT) and a 12-months clinical and invasive (including angiogram, OCT and IVUS) follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to follow-up imaging, 5,000 IU of unfractionated heparin and 200 micrograms of&#xD;
      intracoronary nitroglycerin was administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT was performed both post-procedure, at 6-months and at 12-months using a frequency-domain&#xD;
      OCT system (C7-XR or Ilumien system). A 2.7 Fr C7 Dragonfly imaging catheter flushed with 20&#xD;
      ml undiluted contrast was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motorized pullback was performed at a pullback rate of 20 mm/s throughout the stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative OCT analysis is performed using the LightLab OCT proprietary software (Offline&#xD;
      Review Workstation). Analysis is performed by one dedicated OCT-analyst, who is blinded to&#xD;
      the implantation technique, when assessing 6-months images for strut coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An inter-observer reliability analysis of apposition and coverage will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lesions are analyzed at the cross sectional level with an interval of 1 mm (every 5 frames).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Struts devoid of coverage at any part are deemed &quot;uncovered&quot;. The neointimal thickness is&#xD;
      measured for all covered struts (the thickness is measured as the distance between the&#xD;
      endoluminal side of the strut from the midpoint of its long axis and the intersection of the&#xD;
      lumen contour with a straight line between the endoluminal side of the strut and the&#xD;
      gravitional center of the vessel). Apposition is assessed by measuring the distance between&#xD;
      the center of the endoluminal strut side and the gravitional center of the vessel (malapposed&#xD;
      strut = detached more than 140 microns from the underlying vessel wall).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malapposition distances and areas are also traced. The percentage of malapposed and/or&#xD;
      uncovered struts are calculated as the number of malapposed and/or uncovered struts/total&#xD;
      number of struts in all cross sections of the lesion, multiplied by 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IVUS system (Boston Scientific) utilized a 40 MHz, 2.6 Fr IVUS catheter (Atlantis SR&#xD;
      Pro). Image acquisition using automated transducer pullback at 0.5 mm/s was performed from at&#xD;
      least 10 mm distal to 10 mm proximal of the stented segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Offline analysis is performed with a computerized planimetry program (EchoPlaque). For each 1&#xD;
      mm of axial length, lumen and external elastic membrane (EEM) areas are traced. Stent and&#xD;
      reference site parameters (areas and volumes) are calculated. Remodeling (based on baseline&#xD;
      and 12-months analysis) is assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPSS version 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago Illinois) is used for the statistical analysis. All&#xD;
      tests are two-tailed, and a p-value &lt;0.05 is considered statistically significant.&#xD;
      Categorical data will be presented as numbers and frequencies, and compared with chi-square&#xD;
      or Fisher´s exact statistics. Continuous data will be presented as mean +- SD and compared&#xD;
      with the Student´s t-test. If the distributions are skewed, a non-parametric test will be&#xD;
      performed, and the median with an interquartile range will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary and secondary endpoints will be assessed by the Kruskal-Wallis test, and an&#xD;
      ordered logistic regression analysis adjusted for confounders will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Powercalculation: A powercalculation with an expected frequency of 0.66 and 0.90 covered&#xD;
      struts after 6 months in the angio-guided and OCT-guided group, respectively, shows that 43&#xD;
      patients are to be included in each arm to reach statistical significance. With 43 patients&#xD;
      in each treatment arm and a two-sided statistical significance level of 0.05, the study will&#xD;
      have a power of 0.8 to show a proportion of 0.66 and 0.90 covered struts at 6-months&#xD;
      follow-up in the angio- and OCT-guided group, respectively. With an expected dropout of 14%&#xD;
      due to invasive non-compliance and with subject to suboptimal imaging quality, 100 patients&#xD;
      are to be enrolled.&#xD;
