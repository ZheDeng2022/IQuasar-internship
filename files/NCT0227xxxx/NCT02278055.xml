  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if Radium-223 is effective in reducing cancer pain&#xD;
      within 12 weeks of treatment. In order to see if Radium-223 is effective, the patient's level&#xD;
      of pain will be followed throughout the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males aged 18 years of age and above&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who have experienced disease progression despite initial hormonal therapy,&#xD;
             either by orchiectomy or by using a GnRH agonist in combination with an anti-androgen,&#xD;
             must first progress through anti- androgen withdrawal prior to being eligible. The&#xD;
             minimum time frame to document failure of anti-androgen withdrawal will be four weeks.&#xD;
             Patients on second-line (or beyond) hormonal maneuvers, and patients who had no PSA&#xD;
             decline on combined androgen blockade as first line therapy, need not progress through&#xD;
             AAW in order to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known progressive castration-resistant disease, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum PSA progression defined as two consecutive increases in PSA over a previous&#xD;
                  reference value within 6 months of first treatment, each measurement at least one&#xD;
                  week apart. Serum PSA at screening ≥ 2 ng/mL or&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Pain at baseline as measured by a BPI worst pain score average of ≥ 3. The BPI worst&#xD;
             pain score average will be based on the worst pain scores completed by the patient in&#xD;
             the 7 consecutive pretreatment days. A minimum of 4 days of pain scores must be&#xD;
             completed by the patient in the 7 day window in order to calculate the average worst&#xD;
             pain score. The investigator will optimize the subject's pain regimen prior to study&#xD;
             entry.&#xD;
