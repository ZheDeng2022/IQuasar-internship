      The investigators will test the hypothesis that positron emission tomography (PET) imaging&#xD;
      with the imaging agent 18F-thymidine (FLT) can rapidly assess treatment response in patients&#xD;
      with unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will test the hypothesis that positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the imaging&#xD;
      agent 18F-thymidine (FLT) can rapidly assess treatment response in patients with non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In particular, we hypothesize that FLT-PET imaging will offer the&#xD;
      potential of rapidly triaging therapy efficacy within hours to days following the start of&#xD;
      therapy start by non-invasively monitoring metabolic changes in the tumor, rather than the&#xD;
      conventional approach of waiting months for tumors to grow or shrink on computed tomography&#xD;
      (CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose two approaches to evaluate the potential of FLT-PET for assessment of response to&#xD;
      therapy in NSCLC. In the first, we will exploit a specific effect (the FLT &quot;flare&quot;) induced&#xD;
      by pemetrexed, which is first-line chemotherapy for non-squamous NSCLC, to evaluate the&#xD;
      utility of FLT-PET to assess successful response to pemetrexed (PEM) therapy within 24 hours.&#xD;
      In the second approach, we will utilize FLT as a marker of cell proliferation, as has been&#xD;
      done in other cancers, to determine whether chemotherapy has produced a decrease in tumor&#xD;
      growth at 2 weeks after starting therapy. Since approximately 70% of patients will fail&#xD;
      PEM-based therapy, an imaging technique that could reliably detect PEM efficacy in hours to&#xD;
      days rather than months would save valuable time and allow for switch to a more effective&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

Baseline 18F-thymidine (FLT) PET/CT: FLT is a fluoro-labelled thymidine analog used as a radiotracer of tumor proliferation in PET/CT imaging. This baseline scan will be used to compare post-therapy FLT-PET/CT in order to assess change in tumor accumulation of FLT.&#xD;
Post-therapy 18F-thymidine (FLT) PET/CT to assess for pemetrexed induced tumor FLT &quot;flare&quot;: This scan will be performed on the day of starting pemetrexed therapy (within 24hrs of starting pemetrexed) and used to compare to baseline FLT-PET/CT in order to assess change in tumor accumulation of FLT. The objective is to assess for early pemetrexed induced changes in tumor accumulation of FLT known as FLT &quot;flare&quot;.&#xD;
