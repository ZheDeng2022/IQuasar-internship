  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide&#xD;
      and is caused most commonly by poor uterine muscle tone after delivery. The first line agent&#xD;
      used in the prevention and treatment of PPH is oxytocin, which acts by binding with the&#xD;
      oxytocin receptor (OTR) found on myometrial cells to cause uterine contraction. It does this&#xD;
      by increasing levels of calcium within the myometrial cell, which promotes contraction. Women&#xD;
      who require augmentation of labor with intravenous oxytocin because of inadequate labor&#xD;
      progression have been shown to be at increased risk of PPH. In-vitro human myometrial models&#xD;
      have shown that following prolonged exposure to oxytocin there is desensitization of the&#xD;
      myometrium resulting in a significant reduction in contractility upon delivery of further&#xD;
      oxytocin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimal levels of calcium are very important for contraction of the uterine muscle. Too&#xD;
      little calcium results in a reduced contraction. Too much calcium may result in either&#xD;
      stronger contractions, or even possibly relaxation of the muscle and therefore a reduced&#xD;
      contraction. The investigators currently do not know the effects of calcium on the&#xD;
      desensitized uterine muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that myometrial contractility following desensitization of the&#xD;
      myometrium would be reduced in myometrial samples exposed to low calcium, when compared to&#xD;
      normal calcium or high calcium exposure. These results will help in establishing whether&#xD;
      myometrial contraction can be augmented by increasing calcium levels within the body, or by&#xD;
      optimizing normal physiological calcium levels, in the setting of a augmented prolonged&#xD;
      labor, which is at higher risk of poor uterine contraction and PPH.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The increased incidence of uterine atony and PPH following exogenous oxytocin administration&#xD;
      during labor augmentation is related to myometrial OTR desensitization to oxytocin. Calcium&#xD;
      is an important messenger required within the uterine muscle cell to result in muscle&#xD;
      contraction following administration of oxytocin. A physiological level of calcium is known&#xD;
      to provide optimal contractility to normal myometrium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characterization of the importance of low, normal or high calcium levels in a setting of&#xD;
      prolonged exogenous oxytocin administration may provide guidance for the use of exogenous&#xD;
      calcium as a uterotonic adjunct; or for the optimization of serum calcium levels during&#xD;
      augmented labor. In the clinical setting of failed labor augmentation and OTR&#xD;
      desensitization, the role of serum calcium levels is not currently known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' previously validated in-vitro model provides a solid foundation for the&#xD;
      study of myometrial contractility under controlled conditions, without any confounders that&#xD;
      could be encountered in clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will provide insight into the effect of low, normal or high calcium&#xD;
      levels on the oxytocin pretreated (desensitized) and non-pretreated myometrium. Based on&#xD;
      oxytocin dose-response curves after pretreatment to oxytocin and then subsequent exposure to&#xD;
      either low, normal or high levels of calcium, the investigators will be able to determine the&#xD;
      role of calcium on desensitized myometrium.&#xD;
