    <textblock>
      A multicenter, randomized, parallel assignment, double blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      safety/efficacy phase II study of two different dosages of subcutaneous F8IL10 in patients&#xD;
      with active rheumatoid arthritis receiving MTX.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to formally demonstrate the superiority of F8IL10 vs placebo and to&#xD;
      further evaluate safety and efficacy of two different dosages of F8IL10 when administered to&#xD;
      patients receiving MTX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled and double-blind, parallel assigned (via automated randomization&#xD;
      system) in a 1:1:1 fashion to one of three different arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1: placebo + MTX&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2: F8IL10 30 µg/kg + MTX&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 3: F8IL10 160 µg/kg + MTX&#xD;
&#xD;
      F8IL10 or placebo will be subcutaneously injected once a week for 8 weeks. Treatment will&#xD;
      terminate at the earliest of the following: completion of the 8 weeks of therapy, withdrawal&#xD;
      of informed consent, unacceptable toxicity/intolerability of the study drug or need to&#xD;
      increase MTX, oral corticosteroids or NSAIDs dosages above baseline levels or need to&#xD;
      introduce a new DMARD or biologic therapy to control rheumatoid arthritis activity. The study&#xD;
      will be conducted in a double blind fashion.&#xD;
