      The purpose of this study is to see if patients who receive an email reinforcing their&#xD;
      discharge instructions after being discharged from the emergency department will have an&#xD;
      affect on follow-up care with their primary physician.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When a patient is treated in the emergency department (ED), they experience a whirlwind of&#xD;
      care involving multiple diagnostics and treatments. They are often discharged home with&#xD;
      instructions to follow up with their primary care physician. This follow up care is crucial&#xD;
      to ensuring optimal patient outcomes and re-establishing continuity of care. Despite efforts&#xD;
      to communicate clearly and effectively, ED patients often have difficulty understanding their&#xD;
      follow-up care instructions. Several different methods have been employed to attempt to&#xD;
      improve the follow-up rates after emergency department care, including providing patients&#xD;
      with an easily read, printed copy of discharge instructions, having a nurse or mid-level&#xD;
      provider call patients days after discharge from the ED to ensure that they understood&#xD;
      discharge instructions. One medium for communication that has become increasingly relevant in&#xD;
      recent years is electronic mail (email). Because of its pervasiveness and relative ease of&#xD;
      use, email offers a potentially valuable resource for augmenting and improving communication&#xD;
      between physicians and patients. This study will assess whether an email reminder with follow&#xD;
      up instructions one day after ED visit occurs will increase follow up rates and timely follow&#xD;
      up rates.&#xD;

             Joseph Mercy Hospital-Ann Arbor Emergency Department 2. Primarily English speaking. 3.&#xD;
             &gt;18 years of age 4. Have a primary physician who is part of Integrated Health&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Patients triaged to category 1 or 5 placed in a room at Stl Joseph Mercy&#xD;
             Hospital-Ann Arbor (category 1 patients are not typically discharged home from the&#xD;
             hospital. Category 5 patients could potentially be interfered with if attempting&#xD;
             implementation of the communication instrument. Category 5 patients are typically very&#xD;
             straightforward visits with minimal requirement for follow-up appointments) 2.&#xD;
             Patients &lt; age 18 3. Prisoners or institutionalized persons 4. Patients with a&#xD;
             mental-health related chief complaint 5. Not primarily English speaking (the potential&#xD;
             language barriers could interfere with ability to communicate via email which will be&#xD;
             written in English) 6. Under temporary or permanent custodianship (used as a surrogate&#xD;
             for ongoing lack of mental competence or consciousness) 7. Prior participation in this&#xD;
