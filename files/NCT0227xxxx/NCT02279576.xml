  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Penile cancer is an uncommon disease, with devastating physical and psychological effects on&#xD;
      patients. Penile carcinoma even in advanced stages is responsive to several chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      agents. However, due to the low incidence of penile cancer, no large studies have been&#xD;
      reported concerning chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various single agents were tested for activity en penile cancer in de 70s and 80s. Response&#xD;
      rates ranged from 10 to 27% with cisplatin, 20 to 21% with bleomycin, and 0-62% with&#xD;
      methotrexate. These agents in combination were tested in different studies. Other&#xD;
      chemotherapy schemes have been studied, as combination of cisplatin with 5 fluorouracil with&#xD;
      or without taxol, and cisplatin plus irinotecan. All of them in limited phase II studies,&#xD;
      with described higher responses rates in some of them but without results confirmation in&#xD;
      phase III studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, tested regimens so far have not been very successful in advanced stages of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antiangiogenic therapy has been demonstrated effective in the treatment of similar cancer&#xD;
      types as lung and head and neck, so it can be postulated that antiangiogenic therapy can be&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of penile carcinoma. Pazopanib is a new potent oral antiangiogenic&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytotoxic agents, such as paclitaxel, when administered at low doses and frequent intervals,&#xD;
      may exert antiangiogenic effects, thereby enhancing anticancer activity. Recently,&#xD;
      combination of pazopanib and paclitaxel administered in a metronomic schedule (80mg/m2 weekly&#xD;
      3 weeks every 4 weeks cycle) obtained a 40% response rate and an 80% of disease control in&#xD;
      the first-line treatment of melanoma patients. Treatment was well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As paclitaxel and antiangiogenic drugs seem a very active treatment, combination of pazopanib&#xD;
      and paclitaxel seems a good combination to be tested in patients with penile carcinoma.&#xD;
