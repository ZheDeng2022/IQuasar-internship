      The purpose of this study is to further characterize early CF lung disease in newborns,&#xD;
      infants and toddlers with cystic fibrosis (CF).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal genetic multisystem disease in Germany.&#xD;
      Although life expectancy increased over the last decades, most of the CF patients die in&#xD;
      young adulthood due to chronic CF lung disease with respiratory failure. CF lung disease is&#xD;
      caused by a disturbed transport of salt and water by airway epithelia and dehydration of&#xD;
      airway surfaces as a result of the underlying genetic defect in the Cystic Fibrosis&#xD;
      Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gen. Up to now, no causal therapies for the&#xD;
      majority of patients with CF are available. Little is known about onset and natural course as&#xD;
      well as influencing factors of CF lung disease. Therefore, the first aim of this prospective,&#xD;
      multicenter, uncontrolled, non-randomized, explorative longitudinal study is characterization&#xD;
      of the onset and early course of CF lung disease. For this reason we will primarily include&#xD;
      patients diagnosed by CF newborn screening (CF-NBS) or for any other reason in the first four&#xD;
      months of life (early diagnosed, ED). In a second step we will compare data from these&#xD;
      patients to those diagnosed clinically later in life (late diagnosed, LD). This will allow us&#xD;
      to investigate the effect of early diagnosis and start of therapy. Starting at diagnosis, we&#xD;
      will use data from annual routine check-ups (imaging like chest MRI, pulmonary function&#xD;
      tests, microbiology from swabs and sputum, laboratory values, anthropometry) as well as data&#xD;
      from a facultative, study-related bronchoscopy with lavage (microbiology, inflammation and&#xD;
      immunology) for correlation with the course of CF lung disease (generation of hypotheses).&#xD;
      Further study-related investigations are monthly telephone interviews on bronchopulmonary&#xD;
      symptoms by a study nurse on the basis of a questionnaire and quarterly assessment of&#xD;
      health-related quality of life on the basis of a validated questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect to gain a deeper insight into onset and early course of CF lung disease from the&#xD;
      results of this study. So far, there is no trial that investigated the different aspects of&#xD;
      CF lung disease (function, morphology, infectiology, inflammation) complementary in a&#xD;
      longitudinal setting. We assume that knowledge on the natural history of CF lung disease in&#xD;
      the vulnerable phase of early childhood has a great impact on the future development of new&#xD;
      therapies (from symptomatic to causal). This shall lead to a further improvement in life&#xD;
      expectancy and quality of life of patients with CF.&#xD;

        Patients with CF diagnosed in the first 4 months of life (corrected age of 4 months in&#xD;
        preterms) not before January 1st, 2006 build up the early diagnosed (ED) group. Early&#xD;
        identification can be achieved by newborn screening, clinical diagnosis (e.g. patients with&#xD;
        meconium ileus), due to positive family history or prenatal diagnosis. Patients with CF&#xD;
        diagnosed after the first 4 months of life and after January 1st, 2006, are included as a&#xD;
        comparison group with clinically diagnosed patients (late diagnosed, LD). Both groups (ED&#xD;
        and LD) are investigated after the same investigational plan with all investigations that&#xD;
        are part of the annual check-up and additional, study-related monthly telephone interviews&#xD;
        on bronchopulmonary symptoms, quarterly assessment of QoL and voluntarily yearly&#xD;
        bronchoscopy with broncho-alveolar lavage.&#xD;

          2. Age and mode of diagnosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Early diagnosed (ED): Initial diagnosis following CF-NBS or for other reasons in&#xD;
                  the first 4 months of life (in preterms corrected age of 4 months) after January&#xD;
                  1st, 2006. Other reasons could be prenatal diagnostics, meconium ileus or&#xD;
                  positive family history.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Late diagnosed (LD): Diagnosed after the fourth month of life due to clinical&#xD;
                  symptoms; initial diagnosis after January 1st, 2006.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients are excluded who themselves or whose parents do not want to participate or&#xD;
        that withdraw from the study; or those in whom the diagnosis of CF is unsure.&#xD;
&#xD;
