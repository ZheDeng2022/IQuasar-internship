  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome, liver function&#xD;
      abnormality and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in early pregnancy patients, and the risk&#xD;
      of pregnancy complications.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In cases in which metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver are risk factors of&#xD;
      obstetric complications, such as gestational diabetes (GDM) or preeclampsia (PE), we are able&#xD;
      to offer systematic clinical results from determining the independent risk factor and&#xD;
      developing a predictable model. Recently, obstetric complications, especially GDM and PE,&#xD;
      have increased due to the growth of elder pregnancy. In addition, as liver dysfunction has&#xD;
      been known to be an independent risk factor of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, high blood&#xD;
      pressure and renal dysfunction, its clinical importance has risen. Metabolic syndromes, such&#xD;
      as obesity, hypertension, type II diabetes and abnormal lipid profile, have been known for&#xD;
      its importance in development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Considering abnormal&#xD;
      liver function being an independent risk factor of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, high&#xD;
      blood pressure and renal dysfunction in normal adult patients, we are able to predict that&#xD;
      liver dysfunction might be a high risk factor of obstetric complications in pregnant women.&#xD;
      In previous studies, the frequency of liver dysfunction in normal pregnant women was&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this current study was to investigate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome,&#xD;
      abnormal liver function and non-alcoholic fatty liver in early pregnancy and the related&#xD;
      risks of obstetric complications.&#xD;
