    <textblock>
      The primary and well-known challenge with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the&#xD;
      incomplete adherence of patients to this therapy. Successfully improving CPAP use is likely&#xD;
      through emphasizing patient education regarding the risks associated with obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea (OSA), potential benefits of therapy, teaching techniques to acclimate to CPAP, and&#xD;
      providing a system of accountability through a follow-up process. With the changing landscape&#xD;
      of healthcare reimbursement which emphasizes achieving positive clinical outcomes,&#xD;
      discovering more automated and self-directed methods of educating and follow-up is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to investigate the impact of adjunct Web education and automated&#xD;
      follow-up on CPAP use and other measurements of patient engagement. The specific aims of this&#xD;
      pilot study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess impact of Telemedicine mechanisms on CPAP use 3 months after initiating therapy&#xD;
           in comparison to usual standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess impact of Telemedicine mechanisms on functional outcomes and parameters of&#xD;
           healthcare utilization at 3 months after initiation of therapy in comparison to usual&#xD;
           standard of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent condition which based on polysomnographic&#xD;
      criteria affects 24% of men and 9% of women in the middle-aged population. Due to its high&#xD;
      prevalence, its association with cardiovascular disease, and impact on neurocognitive&#xD;
      function such as daytime vigilance, it carries a high healthcare burden in a given&#xD;
      population. A recent assessment estimated that the yearly economic cost of OSA to Australia&#xD;
      (population around 23 million) to be $21 billion. Thus, it is important for us to consider&#xD;
      effective treatment not just for the individual, but cost effective management of the&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy remains the gold standard treatment given&#xD;
      its ability to provide near-complete physiologic effectiveness regardless of OSA phenotype.&#xD;
      This therapy improves daytime vigilance and is currently the only therapy with substantial&#xD;
      evidence suggesting improvement in cardiovascular risk. The primary and well-known challenge&#xD;
      with CPAP is the incomplete adherence of patients to this therapy (long-term CPAP compliance&#xD;
      defined by percentage of days with at least 4 hours usage is typically reported to be around&#xD;
      50%.) Advances in CPAP technology (such as with autoCPAP) have not been shown to enhance use.&#xD;
      Rather successfully improving CPAP use is likely through emphasizing patient education&#xD;
      regarding the risks associated with OSA, potential benefits of therapy, teaching techniques&#xD;
      to acclimate to CPAP, and providing a system of accountability through a follow-up process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of providing a system of accountability with further education/troubleshooting was&#xD;
      reflected in a study showing improved CPAP adherence when usage was tracked daily (through a&#xD;
      remote wireless process) followed by a telephone encounter if a problem with CPAP use was&#xD;
      revealed. Compared to a control group (usual clinical follow-up), average CPAP use per night&#xD;
      was higher (321 minutes versus 207 minutes; p&lt;0.0001) 3 months after initiation of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The challenge with replicating this telemedicine workflow in a real-world setting is the&#xD;
      labor-intensive nature of tracking patients on a daily basis and logistics of dispensing and&#xD;
      retrieving wireless modems. Furthermore, patient education is very time-consuming, and the&#xD;
      ability to provide comprehensive education without built-in efficiencies could potentially&#xD;
      affect the financial health of the provider. With the changing landscape of healthcare&#xD;
      reimbursement which emphasizes achieving positive clinical outcomes, discovering more&#xD;
      automated and self-directed methods of educating and follow-up is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Web-Based Education&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emmi Solutions produces Web-based, simple to understand, healthcare related educational&#xD;
      programs. These programs are interactive sessions that last about 15 minutes, educating&#xD;
      patients on the risk of certain medical conditions or assists in preparing patients for&#xD;
      procedures. Emmi has also produced OSA related programs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. OSA program - this program educates patients on symptoms of OSA, provides animated&#xD;
           videos depicting airway narrowing during OSA events, discusses health related risks of&#xD;
           OSA such as cardiovascular disease and impact on daytime vigilance, preliminarily&#xD;
           discusses CPAP as potential therapy, and discusses the testing process with ambulatory&#xD;
           or in-lab polysomnography&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CPAP program - this program educates patients on how to properly use CPAP and wear the&#xD;
           mask, discusses potential benefits of CPAP use including impact on health risks and&#xD;
           daytime vigilance, provides methods of acclimating to CPAP, encourages patients to give&#xD;
           a dedicated trial of CPAP even if initially having trouble, and instructs on how to care&#xD;
           for their device and need to replace equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Links to each of these programs are emailed to the patient and date of birth needs to be&#xD;
      verified before the program will start. The programs ask the patient for feedback at regular&#xD;
      intervals and provide opportunities throughout to make notes or write down questions that can&#xD;
      be later printed. These programs are already approved for clinical use within Kaiser&#xD;
      Permanente which has a contract with the vendor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interactive Voice Response Interactive Voice Response (IVR) is a protocol in which automated&#xD;
      messages are delivered to patients to provide feedback regarding their CPAP use, intended to&#xD;
      improve therapy adherence. While IVR refers to voice calls via telephone, we use this term to&#xD;
      also include messages that are delivered by text messaging and email. The basic protocol&#xD;
      involves the use of CPAP devices that wirelessly send usage data to a cloud platform.&#xD;
      Automated algorithms will assess the usage data and send messages to the patient when there&#xD;
      is suboptimal usage or excessive leak, or to provide encouragement for successful use (See&#xD;
      Figure 1 for programmed thresholds that will trigger a message).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators will use CPAP devices with built-in modems (AirSense 10;&#xD;
      ResMed Corporation) which will send usage data via cellular network (Verizon or Sprint&#xD;
      depending on signal availability) to cloud based platform (AirView; ResMed Corporation). This&#xD;
      data will be transferred to a second cloud-based platform (U-Sleep; Umbian), and it is this&#xD;
      second platform that will automatically analyze the usage data and send the automated&#xD;
      messages back to the patients. With each message, there will be a reminder to contact the&#xD;
      sleep center for questions or problems regarding CPAP usage. Patients also have the ability&#xD;
      to login to the U-Sleep platform at any time to track their own therapy information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Proposal&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to investigate the impact of adjunct Web education and automated&#xD;
      follow-up on CPAP use and other measurements of patient engagement. The Kaiser Permanente&#xD;
      Fontana Sleep Disorders Center (Fontana, California) is an integrated sleep center that&#xD;
      functions as a closed-loop system which balances diagnostic testing with a wide array of&#xD;
      different follow-up programs. The primary diagnostic pathway within our center for suspected&#xD;
      OSA is with home sleep testing that begins with classroom education and includes setup of&#xD;
      home sleep testing device. Subsequent clinical visits are individual appointments, and&#xD;
      patients undergo a 1 week autoCPAP trial if OSA is present. If appropriate, patients are&#xD;
      subsequently ordered a CPAP for long-term use, and a 3 month follow-up visit is scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study enrolls patients into one of four pathways: 1) One-fourth of our patients will&#xD;
      follow our usual workflow that functions as our primary control group (Traditional Pathway);&#xD;
      2) One-fourth will follow the usual workflow with the addition of Emmi OSA education prior to&#xD;
      the initial OSA class and Emmi CPAP education in those undergoing an autoCPAP trial&#xD;
      (Telemedicine Education Pathway); 3) One-fourth will follow usual workflow with the addition&#xD;
      of IVR follow-up (Telemedicine IVR Pathway); 4) One fourth will follow usual workflow with&#xD;
      addition of both Emmi programs and IVR follow-up (Telemedicine Both Pathway)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this pilot study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess impact of Telemedicine mechanisms on CPAP use 3 months after initiating therapy&#xD;
           in comparison to Traditional pathway patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess impact of Telemedicine mechanisms on functional outcomes and parameters of&#xD;
           healthcare utilization at 3 months after initiation of therapy in comparison to&#xD;
           Traditional pathway patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This performance improvement initiative is structured as a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial designed to assess impact of automated educational and follow-up mechanisms on measure&#xD;
      of patient engagement in patients with OSA. Consecutive patients triaged to home sleep&#xD;
      testing for suspected OSA are scheduled to attend an OSA class (the investigators schedule 5&#xD;
      classes of 13 patients per week). Classes will be variably assigned to follow one of the 4&#xD;
      Pathways (1 Traditional and 3 Telemedicine) thus result in pseudo-randomization effect&#xD;
      (classes rather than individual patients are randomized) - See Figure 2. The investigators&#xD;
      plan to analyze outcomes between the four pathways after 1000 consecutive patients&#xD;
      (anticipated about 250 in each pathway) have attended OSA class and completed their 3 month&#xD;
      CPAP follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional Pathway Patients will attend a 1 hour OSA Class (class size 13) where OSA&#xD;
      education is provided and home sleep testing (Nox T3, Carefusion) is set up. These patients&#xD;
      return the next day for individual appointments where study is scored and test results are&#xD;
      discussed with patient. If study is consistent with OSA based on Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI4%)&#xD;
      at least 5/hour, patients undergo a 1 week autoCPAP trial. During this week, wireless remote&#xD;
      monitoring (AirView; ResMed) is performed and troubleshooting is provided via telephone&#xD;
      encounter if problems with CPAP use are identified. The autoCPAP is returned during an&#xD;
      individual visit, and CPAP is ordered for long-term use based on trial results and patient&#xD;
      feedback. Patients are scheduled a 3 month follow-up appointment but are also instructed to&#xD;
      call their sleep center case manager (or visit the walk-in clinic) prior to that visit if&#xD;
      there are problems with CPAP use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telemedicine Education Pathway Patients follow our usual workflow as outlined in the&#xD;
      Traditional Pathway. In addition, patients are emailed a link to view the Emmi OSA program&#xD;
      within 2 weeks prior to their initial OSA class. If the patient tests positive for OSA and&#xD;
      agrees to an autoCPAP trial, the patient is emailed a link to view the Emmi CPAP program.&#xD;
      These patients are also scheduled for a 3 month follow-up visit to check CPAP usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telemedicine IVR Pathway Patients follow our usual workflow as outlined in the Traditional&#xD;
      Pathway. Additionally, if CPAP is ordered for long-term therapy, the patient is enrolled into&#xD;
      an IVR protocol (U-Sleep) that automatically analyzes the patient's CPAP use. If specific&#xD;
      provider-defined thresholds are met (Figure 1), the platform will automatically deliver&#xD;
      feedback messages to the patient (via patient's choice of phone call, text messaging, or&#xD;
      email) with the intention of encouraging better CPAP use. Patients are instructed to contact&#xD;
      the sleep center for any issues with their therapy. This platform also includes a method for&#xD;
      patients to track their own usage online. Automated messaging mechanism will be active for 3&#xD;
      months after CPAP is ordered, after which the messaging will stop. These patients are also&#xD;
      scheduled for a 3 month follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telemedicine Both Pathway Patients follow our usual workflow as outlined in the Traditional&#xD;
      Pathway. In addition, patients are provided both Emmi education programs and IVR follow-up as&#xD;
      previously outlined. These patients are also scheduled for a 3 month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measured Variables Age, gender, body mass index, polysomnography respiratory parameters, ESS&#xD;
      (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire - 10 Questions&#xD;
      (FOSQ-10) will be assessed at baseline. CPAP use, Epworth sleepiness Scale, and FOSQ-10 will&#xD;
      be assessed at 3 month follow-up. These measured variables are already part of our standard&#xD;
      clinical assessment. The investigators will also evaluate measures of patient engagement and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of care by collecting information regarding adherence and number of&#xD;
      provider encounters.&#xD;
