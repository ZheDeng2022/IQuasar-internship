  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to demonstrate safety and efficacy of the XP1000 RF for non-invasive&#xD;
      temporary reduction of waist circumference by disruption of adipocyte cells.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, two-arm sham-controlled study of&#xD;
      circumferential waist reduction following 4 treatment sessions delivered once a week over a&#xD;
      4-week period. The objective of the study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      treatment after 30-day and 90-day Follow Up in achieving waist circumference reduction of ≥3&#xD;
      cm across the waist line relative to the base line assessment and their mean waist&#xD;
      circumferential reduction is ≥1 cm than the average circumferential reduction of sham group.&#xD;
