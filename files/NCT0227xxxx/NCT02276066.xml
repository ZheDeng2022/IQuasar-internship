  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the mechanism by which kidney dysfunction perpetuates inflammation,&#xD;
      immunosuppression, and catabolism (PICS) in chronic critical illness. The investigators will&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that persistent kidney dysfunction in sepsis associated by chronic&#xD;
      critical illness contributes to decreased survival through the development of PICS. In&#xD;
      chronic critical illness, the persistence of the inflammatory state may lead to capillary&#xD;
      rarefication in the kidney causing accelerated chronic kidney disease. Progression of chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease during chronic critical illness can drive PICS. Indeed, many of the features&#xD;
      of chronic critical illness are consistent with the protein-energy malnutrition and muscle&#xD;
      wasting associated with chronic kidney disease. Thus, the kidney can play a contributory role&#xD;
      in chronic critical illness and PICS.&#xD;

      The main goal of this project is to measure kidney filtration function at day 14 or the day&#xD;
      of discharge from hospital (whichever occurs first), in order to determine the presence and&#xD;
      magnitude of persistent kidney dysfunction after sepsis episode and to longitudinally assess&#xD;
      further decline of kidney function at one year follow-up. The measure of the glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate (GRF) in patients with chronic critical illness and controls (sepsis patients&#xD;
      discharged from ICU before day 14) will be used to determine to what degree of kidney&#xD;
      dysfunction contributes to decreased survival and increase in chronic kidney disease at year&#xD;
      one after sepsis onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One and/or all of the three ways for GFR assessment will be used, both at approximately day&#xD;
      14 or approximately at the day of discharge from the ICU and at the one year follow up :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine clearance of Iohexol from blood after Iohexol injection and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine apperance of Iohexol in urine after Iohexol injection (this would be the same&#xD;
           injection as in one, and would not require two injections) and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A timed urine collection to determine clearance of urea and creatinine and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Estimated GFR using calculations with serum creatinine and cystatin C,&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will provide an opportunity to validate the different measurements.&#xD;
