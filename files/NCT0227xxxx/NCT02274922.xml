  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For a long time, culture was the only way to detect Campylobacter. It appears that rapid&#xD;
      immunochromatographic tests (ICT) have detected more positive cases compared to culture,&#xD;
      ELISA and molecular tests. The aim of our study is to evaluate the specificity of the ICT&#xD;
      which are really interesting tools to use since they allow a diagnosis in about 15 min, in&#xD;
      comparison to different methods of detection even serology.&#xD;

      All of the patients coming to an emergency care unit and for whom a stool culture is&#xD;
      prescribed will be included, corresponding to an estimate number of 1,000 patients for two&#xD;
      years. Every stools will be tested for Campylobacter using two different ICT tests in&#xD;
      addition to the standard culture. Then, in function of the ICT test result : 1) in case of&#xD;
      negative result, no other Campylobacter detection will be performed except the standard&#xD;
      culture, 2) in case of positive result, stools will be tested for Campylobacter by two ELISA&#xD;
      tests, one PCR and a serology at two different times (D0 and D15) will be performed. Around&#xD;
      70 patients should be detected positive with ICTs, according to precedent studies. The 70&#xD;
      patients detected positive with at least one of the two ICT will have a serology control 15&#xD;
      days after the ICT test. The reference test will be the combination of culture result,&#xD;
      evolution of the serology between D0 and D15 and the PCR and ELISA results. We want to define&#xD;
      a procedure to follow in order to detect as soon as possible and with the best results, the&#xD;
      Campylobacters in the stool of patients. This has the aim of being able to manage patients&#xD;
      who need appropriate antibiotic treatment, and also to reduce the time of hospitalization of&#xD;
      patients quickly detected as suffering from a Campylobacter infection.&#xD;
