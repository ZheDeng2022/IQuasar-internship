  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this laboratory research study is to learn if using molecular information&#xD;
      (matched therapy) or not using molecular information and having the study doctor choose the&#xD;
      therapy based on your past experience are more effective ways to choose the best cancer&#xD;
      treatment for you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 200 participants will take part in this study. Up to 50 will be enrolled at MD&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;

      If you agree to take part in this study, your tumor tissue and blood samples will be tested&#xD;
      for molecular profiling. Molecular profiling is the classification of tissue based on the&#xD;
      expression of certain genes within a tumor compared to normal tissue. This may be used to&#xD;
      predict how the tumor responds to therapy. Your doctor may use the results of the molecular&#xD;
      profiling to help decide which treatment might be the most beneficial for the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn and you will have a tumor biopsy and a biopsy of&#xD;
      normal tissue when you enroll in this study. Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn again&#xD;
      about 2-3 weeks after you begin treatment. The type of biopsy you have will depend on the&#xD;
      type of disease you have. The risks of this procedure will be discussed in more detail with&#xD;
      you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is not enough tissue with which the study doctor can perform the study tests&#xD;
      (described below), you may need to have a second biopsy. The study staff will discuss this&#xD;
      with you if it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A series of tests to find which gene mutations you have, if any, will be performed. Depending&#xD;
      on the results of your molecular testing, you may be enrolled on 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your molecular profile shows that you have a gene mutation that may benefit from study&#xD;
      drugs that are believed to target your gene mutation, you will be enrolled in Arm A and will&#xD;
      receive these targeted drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your molecular profile shows that you do not have a gene mutation, you will be enrolled in&#xD;
      Arm B. In Arm B, the doctor will choose a therapy based on other studies rather than gene&#xD;
      mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will last about 2 years. Your participation on this study will be complete after&#xD;
      the last blood draw and tumor biopsy is collected.&#xD;
