    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate two group CBT interventions delivered by school health nurses, in&#xD;
      cooperation with community psychologist and mental health care personnel, to adolescents with&#xD;
      mild to moderate levels of anxiety symptoms. The two interventions have different intensity&#xD;
      (5 versus 10 group meetings). The two group interventions will be compared to a waitlist&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders are among the major mental health problems in children and adolescents,&#xD;
      with regard to prevalence and long-term consequences. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has&#xD;
      proven to be effective as treatment, early intervention and prevention of youth anxiety&#xD;
      disorders. The majority of youth with anxiety problems, however, is not in contact with&#xD;
      mental health services and do not receive effective help. This is due to shortage of&#xD;
      personnel, resources and time among mental health-personal delivering treatment, as well as&#xD;
      health services not being easily accessable for adolescents. School-based, low-intensity&#xD;
      early intervention programs (indicated prevention) may improve access to effective treatment&#xD;
      for youth with internalizing problems, and also promote more effective use of health&#xD;
      services. The present study is a multi-site randomized controlled study with early&#xD;
      intervention to be conducted within the primary health care service in three parts of Norway;&#xD;
      including nine municipalities from west, east and south of Norway. A brief CBT program will&#xD;
      be compared to a longer CBT program, and a wait-list control group. The effects will be&#xD;
      evaluated with regard to decrease in youth internalizing symptoms. The CBT interventions are&#xD;
      given to adolescents with mild to moderate levels of anxiety symptoms. Interventions are&#xD;
      delivered by trained school-health nurses in collaboration with and/or supervised by&#xD;
      experienced CBT therapists. The study involves researchers from three research environments&#xD;
      in Norway, and collaboration with prominent international researchers from USA and&#xD;
      Australia.The study has potential impact on how to deliver effective low-threshold&#xD;
      interventions to anxious youth.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. An overall score of &gt; 25 on the anxiety inventory Spence Children's Anxiety Scale&#xD;
             (SCAS) and a score of &gt; 1 on the first question of the Children's Anxiety Life&#xD;
             Interference Scale (CALIS), indicating that anxiety interferes with daily life of the&#xD;
             youth, rated either by the adolescents or by one parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The adolescent and at least one parent understand and read Norwegian.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Assent from the youth and signed informed consent from the parent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The adolescent has a behavior that makes participation in groups with other adolescents&#xD;
        challenging. This is evaluated by the school nurse, based on information from the&#xD;
        adolescent, the parent and the teacher. In each case, the school nurse makes an evaluation&#xD;
        based on the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Is the adolescent able to follow group-rules?&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Will the adolescent behave in ways that disrupts the group?&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Does the adolescent have learning problems to an extent that will make it difficult to&#xD;
             follow the group program?&#xD;
