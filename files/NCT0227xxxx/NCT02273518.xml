        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants in the study should be healthy males or females, range from 21 to 50&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior to admission to the study all volunteers will have given, in accordance with&#xD;
             good clinical practice (GCP) and the local legislation, their written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subsequently each subject will have his medical history taken and will receive a&#xD;
             complete medical examination (incl. blood pressure and pulse rate measurements) as&#xD;
             well as a 12-lead ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hematopoietic, hepatic and renal function tests will be carried out in the laboratory&#xD;
