    <textblock>
      The aim of this RCT is to evaluate the survival of different glass ionomer cement in&#xD;
      minimally invasive restorations, with different handling characteristics: hand-mixed versus&#xD;
      encapsulated.&#xD;

      Detailed Description: This study was approved by the research ethics committee of the School&#xD;
      of Dentistry (University of São Paulo, Brazil) and written informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
      from the parents or legal guardians. The sample size was calculated based on the data&#xD;
      obtained in a systematic review, which reported average longevity of 78% after 2 years of&#xD;
      follow up (mean survival of occlusal and occlusoproximal surfaces). The minimum difference of&#xD;
      15% in the success rate between the control and treatment groups after 2 years of follow-up,&#xD;
      with and α of 5% and power (strength) of 80% using paired test. As more than one tooth per&#xD;
      children might be included, we must add a 20% for clustering. Adding 20% for possible losses&#xD;
      the final estimate is 116 teeth per group, reaching a final sample of 232 teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children who have sought treatment in the School of Dentistry, University of Sao Paulo;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children between 3 and 10 years old without systemic diseases;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children presenting at least one dentin caries cavity in primary teeth (occlusal or&#xD;
           oclusoproximal) with no signs of pulp involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children whose parents did not agree to participate in the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children with behavioural issues at the initial exam or who did not assent to&#xD;
           participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the occlusal and occlusoproximal restorations will be performed by two operators on the&#xD;
      dental chair. The operators will be assisted by another dentist, who will be previously&#xD;
      trained to mix the GIC according to the manufacturers' protocol. The children will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned into two groups: Hand-mixed and encapsulated materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The restorative technique will be performed according to the Minimal Intervention Dentistry.&#xD;
      No local anaesthesia will be used during treatment. Rotary instruments can be used to open or&#xD;
      to expand the cavity opening, removing only enamel. Infected carious dentin will be removed&#xD;
      with hand instruments. The use of hand instruments on the dentin surface results in a smear&#xD;
      layer and need to be removed by the use of dentine conditioner. The liquid component of the&#xD;
      hand-mixed powder-liquid GIC, containing the acid component, will be used and saliva&#xD;
      isolation will be done with cotton wool rolls. The cavities will be restored with one of the&#xD;
      two GIC brands: Fuji IX (GC Europe, Leuven, BE) and EQUIA (GC Europe, Leuven, BE). A thin&#xD;
      layer of petroleum jelly will be rubbed over the index finger and the restoration will be&#xD;
      pressed for 20 seconds. The material will include sealing pits and the fissure. After&#xD;
      preparing for a balanced occlusion, a new layer of petroleum jelly will be applied to the GIC&#xD;
      restoration. The amount of GIC used, element number, cavity dimension and dmft will be&#xD;
      recorded. The duration of the restorative procedure will be recorded with a stopwatch. The&#xD;
      participating children will be instructed not to eat for one hour after the restoration is&#xD;
      placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The success of the restorations will be evaluated after 6 months according to the Frencken&#xD;
      and Holmgren criteria for occlusal surfaces, and modified version of Roeleveld et al. (2006)&#xD;
      criteria for occlusoproximal surfaces. A restoration will be considered as 'failure' when&#xD;
      there is a defect in the filling when secondary caries is observed, when the restoration is&#xD;
      not present or when the pulp is inflamed. When the restoration is still present or a slight&#xD;
      defect is observed, it will be considered as 'success'. When the tooth is unavailable for&#xD;
      evaluation, it will be censored. All evaluations will be carried out by two independent&#xD;
      evaluators, who did not restore the cavities, trained and calibrated by a benchmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimation of cost-effectiveness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The material cost (GICs) will be estimated per restoration. The average cost per restoration&#xD;
      will be estimated. Costs of equipment, autoclave and hand instruments, disposables (hand&#xD;
      gloves, face masks, cotton wool rolls), articulating paper and petroleum jelly used for the&#xD;
      restorations are equal for both GIC groups and will be excluded. There will be no labour&#xD;
      costs for the operators.&#xD;
