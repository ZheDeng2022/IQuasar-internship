      Using a specific jet injector for the administration of a rapid-acting insulin analogue has&#xD;
      been shown to advance the absorption of insulin from the subcutaneous area into the&#xD;
      bloodstream by 40-50%, when compared to conventional injection by insulin pens. The&#xD;
      reproducibility of the jet stream method has not been previously determined in vivo. It is&#xD;
      also unknown how the efficacy of injecting regular insulin by jet stream compares to that of&#xD;
      rapid-acting analogues injected by conventional pen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: 1. To compare the pharmacologic reproducibility of the rapid-acting insulin&#xD;
      analogue aspart (Novorapid®) injected by jet-injection to that of the same insulin injected&#xD;
      with a conventional pen. 2. To compare pharmacokinetic and -dynamic profile of regular&#xD;
      insulin injected by jet injection to that of aspart insulin injected by conventional pen.&#xD;

      1. Introduction Insulin administration by a jet injector is a needle-free alternative to&#xD;
           conventional administration of insulin by insulin pens or syringes. Jet injectors&#xD;
           deliver insulin at a high velocity (typically &gt;100m/s) across the skin in the&#xD;
           subcutaneous tissue and dispense the insulin over a larger area than insulin injected&#xD;
           with a syringe. This significantly accelerates absorption of rapid-acting insulin from&#xD;
           the subcutaneous area into the systemic circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Reproducibility of the insulin effect is an essential, but easily overlooked, issue for&#xD;
           a product that needs to be administered so frequently in daily practice. When identical&#xD;
           doses of aspart insulin were injected by a common syringe on two different days&#xD;
           separated by at least a week, the intra-individual and inter-individual variability of&#xD;
           various pharmacokinetic and -dynamic parameters was found to vary between 11-21% and&#xD;
           18-36%, respectively. Reproducibility has not been investigated when insulin was&#xD;
           administered by jet injectors. The investigators previous studies indicated smaller&#xD;
           between-subjects variability in insulin absorption after injection by this jet injector&#xD;
           than after injection by conventional pen, providing some evidence that reproducibility&#xD;
           is at least comparable, but potentially even better when using a jet injector.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aim of the present research proposal is to compare the variability of the metabolic&#xD;
           effect of insulin aspart when administered by jet injection to that when injected by&#xD;
           conventional insulin pen, under controlled experimental conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An additional aim is to investigate the pharmacokinetic and -dynamic comparability&#xD;
           between regular soluble insulin injected by the jet stream device with aspart insulin&#xD;
           administered by conventional pen. The reason the investigators wanted to investigate the&#xD;
           comparability is that rapid-acting insulin analogs are not worldwide available and very&#xD;
           costly compared to regular insulin. If you could achieve the same pharmacological&#xD;
           benefits as rapid acting insulin with a less costly type of insulin, this would be of&#xD;
           great benefit for patients with diabetes in less developed countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypotheses The variability of the metabolic effect of insulin administered&#xD;
           subcutaneously by jet injection is similar to or better than that of insulin&#xD;
           administered by a conventional insulin pen. The investigators also hypothesize that the&#xD;
           metabolic effect of soluble insulin administered by jet injection is similar to that of&#xD;
           insulin aspart administered by conventional insulin pen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Population For this study, a total of 30 healthy volunteers will be recruited.&#xD;
           Subjects are potentially eligible when they are between 18 and 50 years of age and in&#xD;
           good clinical condition. Additional participants will be recruited in case of drop-out.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Investigational medicinal products Main study: Insulin aspart (Novorapid® Penfill 100&#xD;
           units/ml, 3 ml ampoule): rapid-acting analogue of human insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sub-study: Regular Human Insulin (Humulin® Penfill 100 units/ml, 3ml ampoule): human&#xD;
           regular insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Summary of known and potential risks and benefits Novorapid® insulin is indicated for&#xD;
           the treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children above the age of&#xD;
           2 years. The study comprises a risk of hypoglycemia. However, the risk of hypoglycaemia&#xD;
           during the experiment is negligible, since glucose is measured at 5-10 minute intervals&#xD;
           and additional glucose will be administered should glucose levels tend to drop below 4.8&#xD;
           mmol/l. Intravenous glucose 20% may cause local irritation and occasionally phlebitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Methods 6.1 Randomisation The study will have a randomised controlled parallel design.&#xD;
           Randomisation will be done by a computer program with the use of blocks of two subjects,&#xD;
           to randomize which of the two devices will contain insulin and which placebo solution.&#xD;
           This will ensure that equal number of subjects will have the experiment with the&#xD;
           investigational product (InsujetTM pen) or with the control device (Novopen® IV insulin&#xD;
           pen).&#xD;
&#xD;
           To ensure blinding, both pen devices will be prepared by a nurse who is not otherwise&#xD;
           involved in conducting the experiments. There is no indication for prematurely breaking&#xD;
           the randomisation code, as subjects will receive the same amount of insulin with one of&#xD;
           the two devices in each experiment, with frequent glucose-monitoring to prevent&#xD;
           hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.2 Study procedures Potentially eligible study participants will be recruited using&#xD;
           websites or by using the RUMC social media. Should this be insufficient, advertisements&#xD;
           in local newspapers will be placed. Eligibility will be determined at the screening&#xD;
           visit after a medical interview and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Experimental procedures All participants will be examined on two occasions, within 1&#xD;
           week, with one of the two devices containing insulin and the other device as a placebo&#xD;
           device.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be instructed to consume a low-glycemic index meal the evening before&#xD;
           experiments and remain in fasting condition from 20:00 hours onwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
           On the first and second experimental day, participants will be admitted to the research&#xD;
           unit at 08.00 hours in fasting condition and having abstained from smoking, alcohol use&#xD;
           and caffeine use for at least 24 hours. A catheter will be inserted in retrograde&#xD;
           fashion in a dorsal hand vein for frequent blood sampling, whereby the hand will be&#xD;
           placed inside a heated box (air temperature, ~55°C) to arterialize venous blood. Another&#xD;
           catheter will be inserted in the antecubital vein of the other arm, which will be kept&#xD;
           patent by saline drip, and which will be used for administration of 20% glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After cannulations, blood will be taken for direct measurement of plasma glucose and&#xD;
           stored for later measurement of plasma insulin levels. Thereafter, an independent&#xD;
           research nurse will administer insulin at a dose of 0.2 units per kg body weight&#xD;
           subcutaneously at the abdominal site, with either the jet injector (InsujetTM) or the&#xD;
           conventional pen (Novopen® IV). The device not used for insulin administration will be&#xD;
           prepared by the research nurse as well. However, this device is empty although to the&#xD;
           patient it will look and feel the same way as the pens filled with insulin. The insulin&#xD;
           injection and the simulated injection will be given simultaneously. After injection, the&#xD;
           administration site will be covered by the research nurse with a bandage to prevent that&#xD;
           the investigator and patient will be able to see whether there has remained some insulin&#xD;
           on the skin or not. The investigators as well as the participants will be blinded to&#xD;
           which pen contains the insulin and which pen was the placebo device. Subsequently, a&#xD;
           6-hour normoglycemic glucose clamp will be employed, as described previously. To this&#xD;
           end, glucose 20% will be administered intravenously at a sufficient rate to maintain&#xD;
           normoglycemia, based on plasma glucose levels measured at 5-minute intervals during the&#xD;
           first 3 hours and at 10-minute intervals during the remainder of the experiment. Also,&#xD;
           blood will be drawn and stored at -80°C every 5 minutes during the first hour after&#xD;
           insulin injection and every 15 minutes during the hour thereafter for later&#xD;
           determination of plasma insulin and C-peptide levels. During the last four hours,&#xD;
           insulin will be measured with 30 minutes intervals. Six hours after the insulin&#xD;
           injection, the experiment will be terminated and the patients will be given a meal. The&#xD;
           total duration of the study day, including preparation and recovery time, will be 7&#xD;
           hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will be asked separately to return to the research unit a third time for a&#xD;
           similar 6-hour normoglycemic glucose clamp. On this occasion, the insulin aspart will be&#xD;
           replaced by regular soluble insulin. The insulin will be administered by the jet&#xD;
           injector. Pharmacokinetic and -dynamic data obtained from this experiment will be&#xD;
           compared with data obtained after injection of aspart insulin by conventional pen both&#xD;
           in this study and in a previous investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will also ask the subject on both experimental days, within 30 minutes&#xD;
           after insulin injection, to point out on a numeric rating scale from 0 to 10 the amount&#xD;
           of discomfort or pain and the ease of use experienced with the two administration&#xD;
           methods. After the second experiment day, patients will be asked which of the two&#xD;
           devices they would prefer for insulin injection, should they have a choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Withdrawal of study subjects Subjects can leave the study at any time for any reason if&#xD;
           they wish to do so without any consequences. The investigator can decide to withdraw a&#xD;
           subject from the study in case of a severe adverse event or another condition requiring&#xD;
           immediate medical care. Appropriate follow up and treatment of withdrawn subjects will&#xD;
           be assured. Every subject that withdraws from the study will be replaced with an&#xD;
           additional study participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Premature termination of the study The study will be terminated prematurely when&#xD;
           unexpected serious adverse events are experienced which endanger other subjects. If the&#xD;
           trial is prematurely terminated the investigator will promptly inform the trial&#xD;
           subjects, the METC and competent authority. A detailed written explanation of the&#xD;
           termination will be provided. Appropriate follow up and treatment of trial subjects will&#xD;
           be assured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Safety reporting The investigator will inform the subjects and the reviewing accredited&#xD;
           METC if anything occurs, on the basis of which it appears that the disadvantages of&#xD;
           participation may be significantly greater than was foreseen in the research proposal.&#xD;
           The study will be suspended pending further review by the accredited METC, except&#xD;
           insofar as suspension would jeopardise the subjects' health. The investigator will take&#xD;
           care that all subjects are kept informed. All (serious) adverse events reported&#xD;
           spontaneously by the subject or observed by the investigator or his staff will be&#xD;
           recorded and reported at the METC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Statistical analysis Descriptive parameters will be presented as mean ± standard error&#xD;
           of the mean. Unpaired T-tests will be performed to compare all main and secondary study&#xD;
           endpoints as well as most ease of use and safety endpoints. A Chi2 test will be used to&#xD;
           compare the number of patients experiencing post injection hypoglycaemia with the two&#xD;
           injection devices. A P-value of &lt; 0.05 will be considered as statistically significant.&#xD;
           All statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS 20.0 or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Administrative aspects, monitoring and publication The investigator will preserve&#xD;
           confidentiality of all subjects taking part in the study, in accordance with GCP and&#xD;
           local regulations. The investigator must ensure that the subjects anonymity is&#xD;
           maintained. Al data and material from one individual subject will be coded by an unique&#xD;
           identification code. The key to the code is maintained by the investigator and research&#xD;
           nurses. The validated data management system Castor will be used for data handling,&#xD;
           according to GCP. Data will be stored for 15 years. Human material will be stored for 10&#xD;
           years. Source document and database verification will be performed by an independent&#xD;
           monitor, according to a predefined monitoring plan. There will be minimal monitoring,&#xD;
           once per year, as the study is judged to cause only marginal potential risk to the&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Public disclosure and publication policy This study has been made possible by an&#xD;
           unrestricted grant from European Pharma Group (EPG), division Needle Free Insulin&#xD;
           Products, the manufacturer of the InsujetTM jet-injector. EPG was not involved in the&#xD;
           study design or writing of the protocol and will also not be involved in conducting the&#xD;
           study, analysis of the data, presentation of the results, writing of the manuscript and&#xD;
           the decision to submit for publication.&#xD;
