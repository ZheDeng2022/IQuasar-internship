      Phase I-II trial that combines trabectedin plus radiotherapy for tumor reduction response&#xD;
      measure in two cohorts of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A: Patients with diagnosis of non-operable or unresectable or not oncologically&#xD;
      recommended metastasectomy of limited to lung metastases soft tissue sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B: Patients with locally advanced resectable Myxoid Liposarcoma. Cohort C: Patients&#xD;
      with retroperitoneal and resectable soft tissue sarcoma (liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma)&#xD;
      Phase I: escalating dose of 1.3 or 1.5 mg/m2. Phase I for cohort C: de-escalating dose of 1.5&#xD;
      or 1.3mg/m2 Radiotherapy for cohort A: 30Gy in 10 fractions (3Gy/fraction) Radiotherapy for&#xD;
      cohort B: 45Gy in 25 fractions (1.8Gy/fraction) Radiotherapy for cohort C: 45Gy in 25&#xD;
      fractions (1.8Gy/fraction) A translational substudy is developed to analyse different&#xD;
      biomarkers predictive value.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study investigators plan to measure tumor response (RECIST and Choi criteria) when&#xD;
      administering trabectedin standard dose or inferior with simultaneous radiotherapy treatment.&#xD;
      The hypothesis states that administering trabectedin at 1.3mg/m2 or ≤1.5mg/m2 plus&#xD;
      Radiotherapy 30-45Gy shows synergic activity that turns into tumor shrinkage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase I trial (dose escalation -or de-escalation for cohort C- level of 1.3 or 1.5 mg/m2)&#xD;
      will provide the proper dose level to perform a phase II trial to measure RECIST and Choi&#xD;
      response, progression free survival, overall survival and register safety and quality of life&#xD;
      details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three cohorts are indicated for this trial, A: Patients with diagnosis of non-operable or&#xD;
      unresectable or not oncologically recommended metastasectomy of limited to lung metastases&#xD;
      soft tissue sarcoma and cohort B: Patients with locally advanced resectable Myxoid&#xD;
      Liposarcoma, C:Patients with retroperitoneal and resectable soft tissue sarcoma (liposarcoma&#xD;
      and leiomyosarcoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlimited cycles of chemotherapy are considered to be beneficial for cohort A patients,&#xD;
      whereas cohort B and C only 3 cycles are indicated. About radiotherapy treatment, 30Gy will&#xD;
      be given to cohort A patients, whereas cohort B and C will receive 45Gy. TCs and MRI are&#xD;
      selected for imaging purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cohorts A and B:Trabectedin at two dose escalation levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      0 1.3 mg/m2 as a 24h I.V. infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 1.5 mg/m2 as a 24h I.V. infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cohort C:Trabectedin at two dose de-escalation levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      0 1.5 mg/m2 as a 24h I.V. infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      -1 1.3 mg/m2 as a 24h I.V. infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of trabectedin with a portable pump, i.v infusion of 24h, in cycles of 3&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premedication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 mg oral dexamethasone 24h and 12h before chemotherapy administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20 mg I.V. dexamethasone 30minutes before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ondansetron or analogue will also be given prior to trabectedin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathology review, radiology review and radiotherapy review are performed to every patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several biomarkers are selected to perform FFPE tumor assays in relation to prediction&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient must sign voluntarily the informed consent form before any study test is&#xD;
             conducted that is not part of routine patient care.&#xD;

             lung, and not suitable for metastasectomy or surgery resection or not oncologically&#xD;
             recommended metastasectomy.A centralized diagnostic will be performed, the tumor&#xD;
             sample must be available and sent prior to inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Disease distribution allows meeting with normal tissue constraints of radiation&#xD;
             therapy. Radiation oncologist must confirm this point.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Metastatic spread could be present in two organs at maximum (i.e. lungs and pelvic&#xD;
             fosa).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Those lesions considered for radiation therapy have to be considered as target lesions&#xD;
             as well. (i.e. in a patient with nodules in lungs, those lesions selected for&#xD;
             radiation therapy have to include at least the target lesions)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. It is allowed that not all the lesions will be under radiation fields. As a general&#xD;
             rule, it will be prioritized to select, as target-irradiating lesions, those with&#xD;
             greater increase in size and those largest lesions. It should be discouraged to&#xD;
             irradiate pulmonary lesions with infiltration of pleural serosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must have documentation of disease progression within 6 months prior to study&#xD;
             entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The patient must have been considered eligible for systemic chemotherapy. A maximum of&#xD;
             two previous lines for advanced/metastatic disease are allowed as long as trabectedin&#xD;
             has not been included.&#xD;

          3. The following histological subtypes may be included: High grade leiomyosarcoma (G2-3),&#xD;
             liposarcoma, if at least 30% of the tumour is dedifferentiated, pleomorphic&#xD;
             liposarcoma. A centralised diagnosis will be made to confirm that the patient can be&#xD;
             included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The tumour must be located in the retroperitoneum and it must be resectable and&#xD;
             without evidence of regional or distal spread after the appropriate staging process.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The location and size of the disease in the retroperitoneum must allow for compliance&#xD;
             with radiotherapy limitations in healthy tissue. This point must be confirmed by the&#xD;
             site's radiation oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Measurable disease according to RECIST V 1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. ECOG performance status 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Adequate haematological parameters (haemoglobin &gt;10 g/dl, leukocytes ≥3,000/mm3,&#xD;
             neutrophils ≥1,500/mm3, platelets ≥100,000/mm3). Patients with plasma creatinine ≤1.6&#xD;
             mg/dl, transaminases ≤2.5 times the ULN, total bilirubin ≤ ULN, CPK ≤2.5 times ULN,&#xD;
             alkaline phosphatase ≤2.5 times ULN are acceptable. If the increase in alkaline&#xD;
             phosphatase is &gt;2.5 times the ULN, the liver fraction of alkaline phosphatase and/or&#xD;
             GGT should be ≤ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Fertile men or women must use an effective contraceptive method before starting the&#xD;
             study, during the study and for 6 months following the conclusion thereof. Women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential who participate in the study must undergo a pregnancy test&#xD;
             before starting the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Normal cardiac function with LVEF ≥50% by echocardiogram or MUGA.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. HBV and HCV serology must be performed before including the patient in the study. If&#xD;
             HbsAg is positive, it is advisable to rule out a replicative phase (HbsAg*, DNA HBV+).&#xD;
             If positive, the patient's inclusion in the trial is not recommended, and it is at the&#xD;
             discretion of the investigator to administer preventive treatment with lamivudine. If&#xD;
             a potential patient is positive to anti-HCV antibodies, the presence of the virus will&#xD;
             be ruled out with a qualitative PCR, or the patient cannot be included in the study&#xD;
             (if the qualitative PCR test cannot be performed on the patient, they cannot be&#xD;
             included in the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patient may have had one previous chemotherapy line.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. The patient must have a central venous catheter for the administration of the&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Unresectable tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Location other than the retroperitoneum&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who have previously received systemic treatment (chemotherapy or&#xD;
             trabectedin).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who underwent prior local treatment for retroperitoneal sarcoma: surgery or&#xD;
             radiotherapy in the tumour bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. ECOG performance status ≥2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Presence of metastasis or lymph node involvement of the tumour.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Previous history of another neoplastic disease with less than 5 years free of disease&#xD;
             except for basal cell carcinoma or properly treated in situ cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Significant cardiovascular disease (e.g. dyspnoea &gt;2 NYHA).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. A significant grade 3 or greater systemic disease on the NCI-CTCAE v4.03 scale, which&#xD;
             may limit the availability of the patient or which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, may contribute to the toxicity caused by the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Uncontrolled viral, mycotic or bacterial infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Known HIV-positive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Pregnant or breast-feeding women.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Psychological, familial, social or geographical circumstances that limit the patient's&#xD;
             ability to comply with the protocol or informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients who have participated in another clinical trial and/or have received another&#xD;
             investigational product in the 30 days prior to inclusion in the trial.&#xD;
