    <measure>Percentage Of Participants With Normalized Concentrations Of NCC</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Normalized concentrations of NCC was defined as who achieving or maintaining normalized levels of NCC (0.8 to 2.3 micromole [μmol]l/liter [L]]) adjusted for Mo plasma concentration or reaching a reduction of at least 25% in NCC corrected for Mo if above the normal reference range at the time of enrollment. NCC was calculated by subtracting the amount of copper (Cu) bound to ceruloplasmin (CP) from the total plasma Cu concentration. Post-baseline NCC values were adjusted (corrected) to account for Cu bound in tripartite complexes with ALXN1840 and albumin. Descriptive statistics are reported.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline In NCC Concentrations Adjusted For Mo Plasma Concentration At Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The change from Baseline in NCC adjusted for Mo plasma concentration over 24 weeks were analyzed and descriptive statistics are reported. Change from Baseline = (Week 24 NCC concentrations adjusted for Mo plasma concentration) - (Baseline NCC concentrations). Least square means and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-based mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) with fixed effects for Baseline, cohort, visit, Baseline-by-visit, and cohort-by-visit interaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time To Normalization Of NCC Adjusted For Mo Plasma Concentration In Participants With Elevated Baseline NCC</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to last assessment (up to Week 176)</time_frame>
    <description>For time to normalization of NCC adjusted for Mo plasma concentration, a Kaplan-Meier approach was used where participants not normalized were censored at the latest observed time point. To achieve a normalized NCC concentration, participants must have demonstrated 2 consecutive measures within the normal range (0.8 to 2.3 μmol/L). Analyses includes all data up to the last assessment in the extension period for participants who reached the event of normalization of NCC corrected concentrations. Last Assessment is a summary of the last available post-baseline result for each participant. Analyses includes all data up to the last assessment in the extension period; up to Week 176.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline In Psychiatric Status Dimension Using Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) Tracking Standardized Scores At Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The M.I.N.I. is a short structured diagnostic interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV and the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems. It was used to &quot;track&quot; the severity of symptoms by using a combination of questions in 16 Psychiatric Status dimensions that are summarized using a single standardized score for each dimension, ranging from 0 (interpreted as &quot;did not occur at all&quot;) to 4 (interpreted as &quot;occurred extremely often&quot;). The standardized score is an average of these responses.&#xD;
Change from Baseline = Week 24 standardized score - Baseline standardized score. Least square means and 95% CIs were calculated using an REML-based MMRM with fixed effects for Baseline, cohort, visit, Baseline-by-visit, and cohort-by-visit interaction.&#xD;
Decrease from Baseline (a lower score) is indicative of a decrease in symptoms and a better outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L Descriptive System provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status (United Kingdom [UK] Health Index Score). The EQ-5D-5L consists of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), each of which can have 1 of 5 responses that represent 5 levels of severity (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems). The participant was asked to indicate his/her health state for each of the 5 dimensions. The 5-item index score was transformed into a utility score between 0 (worst health state) and 1 (best health state).&#xD;
Change from Baseline = Week 24 index score - Baseline index score. An increase in score indicates improvement.&#xD;
The least square means and their 95% CIs were calculated using a REML-based MMRM with fixed effects for Baseline, cohort, visit, Baseline-by-visit, and cohort-by-visit interaction.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants meeting all inclusion and no exclusion criteria were enrolled into the study and studied as outpatients. Participants enrolled as pre-treated with other de-coppering agents were required to undergo a 48-hour washout from their previous Wilson Disease (WD) treatment just prior to initiation of study treatment. Participants who completed the 24-week treatment period and had favorable safety profiles and WD control were offered the opportunity to participate in the Extension Period.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>ALXN1840</title>
          <description>Treatment Period: ALXN1840 at individualized doses ranging from 15 to 60 milligrams (mg) per day. Dose increases or dose reductions were dependent on the individual non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC) concentrations adjusted for molybdenum (Mo) plasma concentration. ALXN1840 may have been administered every other day, once daily, or twice daily, depending on individualized dosing regimen, for 24 weeks.&#xD;
Extension Period: Participants continued the same ALXN1840 daily dose maintained at Week 24 of the Treatment Period and the same dosing regimen. During the Extension Period, no up-titration was made unless NCC concentrations adjusted for Mo plasma concentration did not remain stable within (or below) the reference range.</description>

        <title>Time To Normalization Of NCC Adjusted For Mo Plasma Concentration In Participants With Elevated Baseline NCC</title>
        <description>For time to normalization of NCC adjusted for Mo plasma concentration, a Kaplan-Meier approach was used where participants not normalized were censored at the latest observed time point. To achieve a normalized NCC concentration, participants must have demonstrated 2 consecutive measures within the normal range (0.8 to 2.3 μmol/L). Analyses includes all data up to the last assessment in the extension period for participants who reached the event of normalization of NCC corrected concentrations. Last Assessment is a summary of the last available post-baseline result for each participant. Analyses includes all data up to the last assessment in the extension period; up to Week 176.</description>

Extension Period: Participants continued the same ALXN1840 daily dose maintained at Week 24 of the Treatment Period and the same dosing regimen. During the Extension Period, no up-titration was made unless NCC concentrations adjusted for Mo plasma concentration did not remain stable within (or below) the reference range.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline In Neurological Status Using The UWDRS (Neurological Subscore; Parts II, III, And Total Score) At Week 24</title>
        <description>The UWDRS is a clinical rating scale designed to evaluate the neurological manifestations of WD. UWDRS comprises 3 parts: UWDRS I (consciousness), UWDRS II (disability), and UWDRS III (neurological status). Change from Baseline in the UWDRS II, III, and total score are presented.&#xD;
UWDRS I: range 0 to 3, maximum score of 3&#xD;
UWDRS II: range 0 to 40, maximum score of 40&#xD;
UWDRS III: range 0 to 175, maximum score of 175&#xD;
UWDRS total score: sum of the UWDRS I, II, and III: range 0 to 218, maximum score of 218&#xD;
UWDRS I and III were assessed by a neurologist, while UWDRS II was reported by the participant or caregiver.&#xD;
Change from Baseline was calculated as: Week 24 score - Baseline score. Least square means and their 95% CIs were calculated using a REML-based MMRM with fixed effects for Baseline, cohort, visit, Baseline-by-visit, and cohort-by-visit interaction. A decrease in score from Baseline is indicative of an improvement in condition and a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline In Psychiatric Status Dimension Using Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) Tracking Standardized Scores At Week 24</title>
        <description>The M.I.N.I. is a short structured diagnostic interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV and the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems. It was used to &quot;track&quot; the severity of symptoms by using a combination of questions in 16 Psychiatric Status dimensions that are summarized using a single standardized score for each dimension, ranging from 0 (interpreted as &quot;did not occur at all&quot;) to 4 (interpreted as &quot;occurred extremely often&quot;). The standardized score is an average of these responses.&#xD;
Change from Baseline = Week 24 standardized score - Baseline standardized score. Least square means and 95% CIs were calculated using an REML-based MMRM with fixed effects for Baseline, cohort, visit, Baseline-by-visit, and cohort-by-visit interaction.&#xD;
Decrease from Baseline (a lower score) is indicative of a decrease in symptoms and a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline In Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale (CGI-S) At Week 24</title>
        <description>The CGI-S is a 7-point scale where the investigator rated severity of participant's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the investigator's past experience with participants who have the same diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, a participant was assessed on severity of illness at time of rating as: 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, extremely ill.&#xD;
Change from Baseline = Week 24 score - Baseline score. Decrease in CGI-S score and increase indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline In Quality Of Life (QoL)/Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Assessed By The European Quality Of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) At Week 24</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D VAS records the participant's self-rated health as indicated on a scale from 0 to 100 with 0 being &quot;the worst health you can imagine&quot; and 100 being &quot;the best health you can imagine, with higher scores for a higher quality of life. Change from Baseline = Week 24 score - Baseline score. An increase in score indicates improvement.&#xD;
The least-square means and their 95% CIs were calculated using a REML-based MMRM with fixed effects for Baseline, cohort, visit, Baseline-by-visit, and cohort-by-visit interaction.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline In Quality Of Life (QoL)/Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Assessed By The European Quality Of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) At Week 24</title>
          <description>The EQ-5D VAS records the participant's self-rated health as indicated on a scale from 0 to 100 with 0 being &quot;the worst health you can imagine&quot; and 100 being &quot;the best health you can imagine, with higher scores for a higher quality of life. Change from Baseline = Week 24 score - Baseline score. An increase in score indicates improvement.&#xD;
The least-square means and their 95% CIs were calculated using a REML-based MMRM with fixed effects for Baseline, cohort, visit, Baseline-by-visit, and cohort-by-visit interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline In Quality Of Life (QoL)/Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Assessed By The EQ-5D Descriptive System UK Health Index Scores At Week 24</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D-5L Descriptive System provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status (United Kingdom [UK] Health Index Score). The EQ-5D-5L consists of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), each of which can have 1 of 5 responses that represent 5 levels of severity (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems). The participant was asked to indicate his/her health state for each of the 5 dimensions. The 5-item index score was transformed into a utility score between 0 (worst health state) and 1 (best health state).&#xD;
Change from Baseline = Week 24 index score - Baseline index score. An increase in score indicates improvement.&#xD;
The least square means and their 95% CIs were calculated using a REML-based MMRM with fixed effects for Baseline, cohort, visit, Baseline-by-visit, and cohort-by-visit interaction.</description>

        <title>Extension Period: Percentage Of Participants With Normalized Concentrations Of NCC</title>
        <description>Normalized concentrations of NCC was defined as who achieving or maintaining normalized levels of NCC (0.8-2.3 μM) adjusted for Mo plasma concentration or reaching a reduction of at least 25% in NCC corrected for Mo if above the normal reference range at the time of enrollment. NCC was calculated by subtracting the amount of Cu bound to Cp from the total plasma Cu concentration. Post-baseline NCC values were adjusted (corrected) to account for Cu bound in tripartite complexes with ALXN1840 and albumin. Last Assessment is a summary of the last available post-baseline result for each participant. Analyses includes all data up to the last assessment in the extension period; up to Week 176.</description>

Extension Period: Participants continued the same ALXN1840 daily dose maintained at Week 24 of the Treatment Period and the same dosing regimen. During the Extension Period, no up-titration was made unless NCC concentrations adjusted for Mo plasma concentration did not remain stable within (or below) the reference range.</description>

        <title>Extension Period: Change From Baseline In NCC Levels Adjusted For Mo Plasma Concentration</title>
        <description>The change from Baseline in NCC adjusted for Mo plasma concentration over 176 weeks were analyzed. Last Assessment is a summary of the last available post-baseline result for each participant. Analyses includes all data up to the last assessment in the extension period, up to Week 176. Change from Baseline = (Last assessment [up to Week 176] NCC concentrations adjusted for Mo plasma concentration) - (Baseline NCC concentrations). Least square means and their 95% CIs were calculated using an REML-based MMRM with fixed effects for Baseline, cohort, visit, Baseline-by-visit, and cohort-by-visit interaction.</description>
