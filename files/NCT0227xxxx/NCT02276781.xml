  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that among people with lower extremity peripheral artery&#xD;
      disease (PAD), biomarker levels are higher during time periods immediately preceding an acute&#xD;
      coronary event compared to time periods not immediately preceding an acute coronary event.&#xD;
      Biomarkers the investigators will study are CRP, SAA, and D-dimer. Biomarkers will be&#xD;
      measured at baseline and every two months during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aims of this study are as follows. Specific Aim #1. Among participants with PAD&#xD;
      who experience an acute coronary event during follow-up, the investigators will determine&#xD;
      whether biomarker levels measured immediately prior to the coronary event are higher than&#xD;
      levels that do not immediately precede coronary events. Specific Aim #2, Part 1. The&#xD;
      investigators will determine whether participants who experience a coronary event (cases)&#xD;
      have higher biomarker levels at the visit immediately prior to the event than participants&#xD;
      who have not experienced a coronary event (controls) at the time of the case event. Specific&#xD;
      Aim #2, Part 2. The investigators will determine whether participants who experience a&#xD;
      coronary event (cases) have a greater increase in biomarkers during the time period leading&#xD;
      up to the event compared to participants who have not experienced a coronary event&#xD;
      (controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve these aims, the investigators will enroll up to 650 participants with PAD and&#xD;
      follow them prospectively, measuring blood samples every two months, and ascertaining the&#xD;
      presence of acute coronary events every two months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Peripheral arterial disease defined as an ABI less than or equal to 0.90 in either leg&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will also include PAD patients with an ABI &gt; 0.90 who meet any of the following&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of documented lower extremity revascularization. A written report from the&#xD;
             medical record will be required as documentation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An angiogram demonstrating &gt;50% stenosis in one or more lower extremity arteries.&#xD;
             Again, a written report will be required to document this. Participants with an&#xD;
             angiogram noting moderate or greater stenosis will also be considered eligible, when a&#xD;
             specific amount of stenosis is not denoted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A report from the non-invasive vascular laboratory demonstrating a toe brachial&#xD;
             pressure less than 0.60. Other criteria (i.e. PVR data) from the non-invasive vascular&#xD;
             laboratory will not be considered sufficient for inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment for cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer during the previous 2 years.&#xD;
             (However, persons treated for non-invasive breast cancer or prostate cancer during the&#xD;
             previous year will be potentially eligible if their physician indicates that their&#xD;
             life expectancy is &gt; 24 months, since non-invasive breast and prostate cancer often&#xD;
             have an excellent prognosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unintentional weight loss of &gt; 7.5 pounds in the last six months;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) score &lt; 23 out of 30 or other history of cognitive&#xD;
             impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Communication difficulty due to language barriers&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Refusal to have regular blood draws or inability to obtain a blood sample at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Coronary or cerebrovascular event during the previous six months (these persons may&#xD;
             become eligible at a later date)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosis, or&#xD;
             polymyalgia rheumatic, gout), however participants with gouty arthritis will be&#xD;
             eligible if the last episode was more than three months ago&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Residence more than 40 miles away from the medical center and unwillingness to travel&#xD;
             to the medical center for every two month blood collection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to return for follow up testing for &gt; a consecutive six month period in the&#xD;
             next two years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Heart transplant surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery (one that required general anesthesia) within the past 3 months These&#xD;
             persons may become eligible at a later date&#xD;
