      Immune response analysis after the combination of PCV13 and PPV23 will lead to evaluate if a&#xD;
      prime with PCV13 help to obtain a good response to repeated dose of PPV23.The&#xD;
      hyporesponsiveness following the unconjugated vaccine is associated with high polysaccharide&#xD;
      antigen concentration. Several issues limit the development and recommendation of&#xD;
      anti-pneumococcal vaccine in adult's patients at risk. Reduced doses of unconjugated&#xD;
      polysaccharide antigens would bypass the hyporesponsiveness and maintain the expanded&#xD;
      coverage serotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better knowledge of immune response following the combination of two vaccines in adults is&#xD;
      essential. In addition, adults are required to be exposed to repeated doses of polysaccharide&#xD;
      antigens by vaccine or by natural exposure, it is important to determine the extend and&#xD;
      duration of any hyporesponsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate if non conjugate polysaccharidique fractionated doses&#xD;
      administered after a conjugate vaccine help to avoid hyporesponse in a schedule with repeated&#xD;
      injections of pneumococcal polysaccharidique vaccine&#xD;

      administered after a conjugate vaccine help to avoid hyporesponse in a schedule with repeated&#xD;
      injections of pneumococcal polysaccharidique vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
      The projects aims are :&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Primary is to evaluate if non conjugate polysaccharidique fractionated doses administered&#xD;
      after a conjugate vaccine help to avoid hyporesponse in a schedule with repeated injections&#xD;
      of pneumococcal polysaccharidique vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the immune response involved when combining conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and&#xD;
           non-conjugate polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23 full dose or fractionated booster dose) and&#xD;
           assesses an eventual prime-boost effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the impact of fractioned PPV23 on the immune response to PPV23 serotypes,&#xD;
           measured as the extension of the serotype coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the sustainability and evolution of the immune response over time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the clinical tolerance to an initial dose of PCV13 followed by repeated&#xD;
           doses of PPV23 vaccines&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe any invasive infections pneumococcal and community acquired pneumonia&#xD;
           occurring during the time course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration Recruitment: 6 months Participation: 36 months Total duration of the study: 42&#xD;
      month&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Vaccine trial Open randomized 1:1:1:1 phase II comparing the immunogenicity of&#xD;
      four pneumococcal vaccination strategies administered by intramuscular route in healthy&#xD;
      volunteer's adults aged 18 to 49 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four dose combination of two vaccines will be assessed, Pneumo23® and Prevenar13®. Volunteers&#xD;
      will receive three vaccine injections during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty (60) healthy volunteers will be enrolled and randomized into the four following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: 15 subjects receiving at M0 one dose of Prevenar13®, at M2 one dose of&#xD;
           Pneumo23® and at M12, 1/5 dose of Pneumo23®&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: 15 subjects receiving at M0 one dose of Prevenar13®, at M2 1/5 dose of&#xD;
           Pneumo23® and at M12, 1/5 dose of Pneumo23®&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group C: 15 subjects receiving at M0 one dose of Prevenar13®, at M2 1/5 dose of&#xD;
           Pneumo23® and at M12, one dose of Pneumo23®&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group D: 15 subjects receiving at M0 one dose of Prevenar13®, at M2 one dose of&#xD;
           Pneumo23® and at M12, one dose of Pneumo23®&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of visits per volunteer: 9 visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 vaccination visits: M0, M2, M12&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 follow-up visits: M1, M3, M13, M18, M24, M36.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unscheduled visit if suspected invasive pneumococcal infection (meningitis, bacteraemia,&#xD;
           pneumonia, pleural-pneumonia)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total number of scheduled subjects :&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 healthy volunteers will be recruited at the CIC 1417: 15 volunteers per group There was no&#xD;
      statistical determination of sample size. Data from this trial will identify one or more&#xD;
      vaccine strategies that could be tested in clinical trials on population at risk for invasive&#xD;
      pneumococcal diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from published studies don't give homogeneous references about geometric means titers in&#xD;
      OPA with fractional of polysaccharidique vaccine. This is the first study evaluating combined&#xD;
      vaccination strategies with a schedule with one initial dose of PCV13 and complete or&#xD;
      fractional doses of PPV23.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected patient or public health benefit A better assessment of the immunogenicity induced&#xD;
      by the combination of Prevenar13® and Pneumo23® will allow to adapt pneumococcal vaccine&#xD;
      recommendations for adults. The Pneumo23® has been for a long time the only vaccine&#xD;
      recommended in adults with a condition that places them at high risk of invasive pneumococcal&#xD;
      infection: splenectomy or functional asplenia, homozygous sickle cell disease, HIV infection&#xD;
      (regardless of the immunovirological status), nephrotic syndrome, respiratory failure, heart&#xD;
      failure, patients with chronic liver disease, with a history of pulmonary infection or&#xD;
      invasive pneumococcal disease. It has to be repeated every 5 years (BEH-vaccination schedule&#xD;
      and vaccine recommendations), given the absence of an immune memory. But its immunogenicity&#xD;
      is limited and repeated doses may induce hyporesponsiveness. The recent availability of&#xD;
      Prevenar13®, polysaccharide conjugate vaccine, in adults led to reassess recommendations for&#xD;
      adults advising the combination of two vaccines: PCV13 and PPV23 2 months apart (then&#xD;
      repeated doses of PPV23 at 5 years), to induce a response called &quot;prime-boost&quot;, that is to&#xD;
      say PPV23stimulation of memory response initiated by PCV13 (Advisory Committee on&#xD;
      Immunization Practices (ACIP) Recommended Immunization Schedule for Adults Aged 19 Years and&#xD;
      Older - United States, 2013 --MMWR/January 28 2013/Vol. 62). These recommendations need to&#xD;
      rely on more solid immunological substrate, including more data in adults whose immune status&#xD;
      differs from children. To our knowledge, there is no data examining the various mechanisms of&#xD;
      the immune response in the combination of these two vaccines, and taking into account the&#xD;
      effect of dose of polysaccharide antigens in the same study, with such immunological&#xD;
      monitoring in adults. Data from this clinical trial will therefore support these&#xD;
      recommendations, either on the induction of immunological memory response by the PCV13, or on&#xD;
      the impact of repeated doses of PPV23. Preventing pneumococcal infections would decrease&#xD;
      morbidity; extend life expectancy and quality of life in patients at risk. In a public health&#xD;
      perspective, by reducing the number and duration of hospitalization, it would reduce&#xD;
      dramatically the vaccine cost.&#xD;
