      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of fluorouracil when given together&#xD;
      with radiation therapy followed by combination chemotherapy before and after surgery in&#xD;
      treating patients with rectal cancer that has spread from where it started to nearby tissue&#xD;
      or lymph nodes. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink&#xD;
      tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and&#xD;
      oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving more than&#xD;
      one drug (combination chemotherapy) before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the&#xD;
      amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving additional combination chemotherapy&#xD;
      after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy and fluorouracil&#xD;
      followed by combination chemotherapy before and after surgery may be a better treatment for&#xD;
      rectal cancer.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of fluorouracil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHEMORADIATION: Patients undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) once daily (QD)&#xD;
      over 5 days for a total of 5 fractions and concurrently receive fluorouracil intravenously&#xD;
      (IV) continuously over 96 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PREOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY: Within 2 weeks of completing chemoradiation, patients receive&#xD;
      oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and fluorouracil IV as a&#xD;
      push followed by IV continuously over 46 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for&#xD;
      4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURGERY: Within 4-8 weeks of completing preoperative chemotherapy, patients undergo total&#xD;
      mesorectal excision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POSTOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY: Within 4-8 weeks after surgery, patients receive oxaliplatin,&#xD;
      leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil as in preoperative chemotherapy. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      14 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 1 year or until removal from the study or death, whichever occurs&#xD;
      first.&#xD;
