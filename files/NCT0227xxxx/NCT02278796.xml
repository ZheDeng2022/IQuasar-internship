  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the treatment of patient with lymphoma the most common high-dose chemotherapy regimen used&#xD;
      prior to autologous transplantation (ASCT) is the BEAM regimen. It consists of four&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs together (BCNU, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, melphalan), whose initial&#xD;
      letters are grouped together for BEAM regimen. One of the most common organ damage this&#xD;
      intensive treatment is caused by the drug BCNU; it involves a lung injury, which manifests&#xD;
      itself in the months after ASCT with increasing shortness of breath and cough, and can result&#xD;
      in pulmonary fibrosis. The drug bendamustine is used successfully in different lymphoma&#xD;
      types, and its efficacy in lymphoma therapy is well documented. Moreover bendamustine doesn't&#xD;
      cause lung injury. Initially experience with bendamustine instead of BCNU - in the so-called&#xD;
      BeEAM scheme - shows that this scheme is quite effective and well tolerated, without lung&#xD;
      injury. In BeEAM scheme therefore bendamustine replace the BCNU, while the other three drugs&#xD;
      are administered in the same dosage and order. The aim of the present study conducted at four&#xD;
      centers (Bern and Zurich in Switzerland, Vienna and Linz in Austria) is to compare these two&#xD;
      high-dose chemotherapy schemas and to show that the BeEAM scheme causes significantly less&#xD;
      lung injury than the BEAM regimen.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is&#xD;
      considered the treatment of choice for relapsed/refractory lymphomas. On the basis of the&#xD;
      results of the PARMA study group trial, high-dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT has become&#xD;
      the standard of care for patients with relapsed, chemo-sensitive aggressive lymphoma and it&#xD;
      is the treatment of choice in patients relapsing with follicular lymphoma and Hodgkin's&#xD;
      disease. The BEAM (BCNU, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, melphalan) chemotherapy regimen is the&#xD;
      most frequently used conditioning regimen since more than thirty years. Toxic pneumonia with&#xD;
      interstitial infiltration and impairment of the diffusion capacity of the lung is a&#xD;
      recognized complication of HDCT regimens containing BCNU. Recently, it has been shown that&#xD;
      the EAM regimen (thus omitting BCNU) is not sufficient to obtain equal response rates if&#xD;
      compared with BEAM and poorer disease control resulted in impaired disease-free survival&#xD;
      (DFS). Thus, it might be detrimental for patients just to eliminate BCNU without an&#xD;
      appropriate substitution. Replacing BCNU by Bendamustine with its potential to eradicate&#xD;
      residual or treatment-resistant lymphoma cells could be a promising clinical approach and&#xD;
      should be investigated in a randomized phase II clinical trial comparing standard BEAM with&#xD;
      BeEAM. Bendamustine combines the alkylating activity of the mustard group with the&#xD;
      antimetabolite activity of the purine analogue and was studied in several entities of B-cell&#xD;
      neoplasms and demonstrated significantly superior efficacy compared with standard therapies&#xD;
      in the treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and indolent NHL and myeloma.&#xD;
      The BRIGHT study confirmed the non-inferiority of a immunochemo-therapy with&#xD;
      Rituximab-Bendamustine when compared with R-CHOP or Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine,&#xD;
      Prednisone (R-CVP) in indolent lymphoma or mantle cell lymphoma. Recently, Visani et al have&#xD;
      shown that Bendamustine, coupled with fixed doses of Etoposide, Cytarabine, and Melphalan&#xD;
      (ie, BeEAM) in the conditioning regimen for ASCT for resistant/relapsed lymphoma (HD and NHL)&#xD;
      patients is highly active and resulted in promising results concerning safety and efficacy.&#xD;
      No treatment mortality was observed and no relevant pulmonary toxicity was seen.&#xD;
      Non-hematological toxicity was moderate, and most prominent toxicities were gastroenteritis&#xD;
      grade 3 to 4 in 34% and mucositis grade 3 to 4 in 35%, respectively. No grade 3 to 4 cardiac&#xD;
      toxicity or toxic pneumonia was observed. Engraftment was rapid and trilinear, and stable&#xD;
      hematopoiesis was observed. BeEAM was very effective, with 81% of patients in complete&#xD;
      response after a median observation time of 18 months. A recent update of this study showed&#xD;
      that at 41 months still 72% of the patients are still in complete remission and the 3-year&#xD;
      performance status (PS) was 75%. Four patients showed a first remission ever with the&#xD;
      Bendamustine containing regimen. In 35 patients treated at the Vienna centre according to the&#xD;
      Visani BeEAM protocol, these encouraging data of Visani et al could be reproduced; similar&#xD;
      toxicities and rapid and stable engraftment were observed. Finally, the combination of&#xD;
      Bendamustine with sequential application of high-dose Cytarabine was reported to improve the&#xD;
      response rates in relapsing lymphomas. In conclusion, it seems promising to integrate&#xD;
      Bendamustine in myeloablative regimens in ASCT, but a randomized clinical trial is lacking so&#xD;
      far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Replacing the chemotherapeutic drug BCNU by Bendamustine within the four-drug chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimen BEAM reduces the occurrence of early and late pulmonary toxicity in lymphoma patients&#xD;
      undergoing high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation. Primary&#xD;
      Objective: To show a clinically meaningful reduction of lung toxicity - defined as a a&#xD;
      decrease of the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) by 20% or more from&#xD;
      baseline before ASCT - from 25% of patients in the BEAM group to 4% of patients in the BeEAM&#xD;
      group at 3 months after ASCT. Use Dinakara equation for adjusting DLCO for hemoglobin.&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: Acute and late toxicity/adverse events (CTCAE 4.0). Hematologic&#xD;
      recovery and engraftment after 3 months. Early and late lung toxicity Cardiac assessment by&#xD;
      ECHO/ECG and quality of life before,3 and 12 months after ASCT. Overall survival and&#xD;
      progression free survival after 12 months and then yearly as routine follow-up assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two high-dose chemotherapy regimens (BeEAM versus BEAM) used for conditioning treatment&#xD;
      before autologous stem cell transplantation will be compared in a 1:1 randomization. The&#xD;
      experimental arm is the BeEAM regimen. The BEAM regimen is the control treatment. Lung&#xD;
      toxicity will be assessed by spiroergometry at the 60% level of maximum exercise capacity, as&#xD;
      well as by assessing the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). This&#xD;
      analysis will be performed before ASCT, as well as 3 months and 12 months after ASCT.&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed for cardio-pulmonary toxicity before ASCT, as well as 3 and 12&#xD;
      months after ASCT. Thereafter, patient follow-up will be performed clinically once per year.&#xD;
