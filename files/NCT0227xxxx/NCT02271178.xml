  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who survive an acute coronary syndrome are at high risk of recurrent events and&#xD;
      death in the first months of evolution. Aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, beta-blockers&#xD;
      and statins decrease the risk of recurrent events and death, so are the recommended treatment&#xD;
      for most patients who had a heart attack, and adherence to these recommendations is&#xD;
      associated better clinical outcome. However, numerous studies show high dropout rate of&#xD;
      medical treatment. The cause of nonadherence, common problem in chronic diseases, is&#xD;
      multifactorial (economic, cultural, adverse effects), the complexity of the treatment being&#xD;
      prescribed a relevant factor as a cause of non-compliance. The investigators goal is to&#xD;
      assess whether the simplification of treatment for secondary prevention in a once-daily&#xD;
      capsule containing four drugs increased adherence to it, compared to the standard treatment&#xD;
      of each drug separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators design a controlled, randomized, open, parallel-group clinical study.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to one of the following treatment regimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combined-Capsule: capsule containing an adjusted patient combination scheme for&#xD;
           secondary prevention of once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Usual-treatment: each component of the dish separately as is the usual practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the adherence of the treatment regimen to secondary prevention. For&#xD;
      the study was considered adherent to a patient taking at least 80% of medication that belongs&#xD;
      in the period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sample Size Is estimated according to previous studies adherence to medical treatment 40%,&#xD;
      and the objective of the study is to demonstrate an increase in adherence of 25% in absolute&#xD;
      terms (40 to 65%) by simplifying the treatment regimen. With a parallel design, a type I&#xD;
      error of 5%, a sample of 200 patients would give the study a power of 80% to detect this&#xD;
      difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study of this size would also give us increased 80% power to detect a difference of 14 mg /&#xD;
      dl in serum cholesterol (estimated standard deviation 30 mg / dl) with an alpha error rate of&#xD;
      5%; and 80% power to detect a difference of 4 mmHg in systolic blood pressure (standard&#xD;
      deviation 10 mmHg), also with a type I error of 5%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the written informed consent patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, one of&#xD;
      the study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Conventional treatment: is a daily tablet of ramipril (5-10 mg / day), atenolol&#xD;
           (50-100 mg / day), aspirin 100 mg / day and simvastatin 40 mg / day. The doses of drugs&#xD;
           may be increased according to blood pressure and heart rate of patients in follow-up&#xD;
           visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: one capsule containing ramipril (5 to 10 mg), atenolol (50 to 100 mg), 100 mg&#xD;
           aspirin, 40 mg simvastatin. In follow-up visits doses of atenolol and ramipril capsules&#xD;
           may be adjusted according to blood pressure and heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All other medications that the patient receives will be determined and adjusted doses as&#xD;
      determined by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients receiving 100 mg / day and atenolol 10 mg / day of ramipril and require&#xD;
      additional treatment to control blood pressure will recommend using thiazide diuretics,&#xD;
      calcium channel blockers and alpha-methyldopa, in that order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All other medications that the patient receives will be determined and adjusted doses as&#xD;
      determined by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients receiving 100 mg / day and atenolol 10 mg / day of ramipril and require&#xD;
      additional treatment to control blood pressure will recommend using thiazide diuretics,&#xD;
      calcium channel blockers and alpha-methyldopa, in that order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first supply of study medication will be held on discharge from hospital. Patients will&#xD;
      be referred for follow-up at 7 days (with an additional 7 days), a month, 3 months and six&#xD;
      months (final visit). For visits 2, 3 and 4 be tolerated fifteen (15) days before considering&#xD;
      that the patient did not attend the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization After signing the informed consent, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      to receive study treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was carried out with lists of random numbers generated by computer with a block&#xD;
      diagram of 4 and 6. Was also a scheme will use stratified by gender and diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mapping is done using consecutive sealed opaque envelopes. To minimize the risk of&#xD;
      predicting the next treatment, the envelopes will be handled by the pharmacy staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the informed consent was informed pharmacy staff concerned in the study, who&#xD;
      will open the appropriate envelope and will be responsible for the preparation and supply of&#xD;
      medication (Appendix 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Anthropometric data, risk factors, cardiovascular history, blood pressure measurements&#xD;
      and basal heart rate were collected. All patients will have lab tests including blood count&#xD;
      with platelet count, fasting blood glucose, creatinine, urea, electrolytes, liver function&#xD;
      tests, total cholesterol, cholesterol bound to high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density&#xD;
      (LDL) , and triglycerides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure and pulse It is measured on the left arm with the subject seated, after 5&#xD;
      minutes of rest. Three blood pressure measurements separated by a minute averaged realized&#xD;
      and the last two (discarding the first value). Diastolic blood pressure will be recorded in&#xD;
      the fifth Korotkoff sound. Heart rate will be measured by averaging two measurements of 30&#xD;
      seconds; rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation, two periods of 1 minute averaged. These&#xD;
      measurements were repeated at each follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiogram ECG were performed at baseline and follow-up, with the subject in supine&#xD;
      position after 5 minutes of rest. All are made with automatic ECG 12-lead equipment and will&#xD;
      be printed to be analyzed manually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory The baseline analysis was performed on admission to the coronary care unit&#xD;
      (routine practice), in this analysis is considered basal level of lipids (total cholesterol&#xD;
      and fractions) on admission to hospital and the rest of the determinations, the values of the&#xD;
      day following fasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory analysis at the end of the study will be conducted with the patient 12 hours of&#xD;
      fasting, before stopping the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses were performed in the hospital laboratory Crossing according to standard techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessing platelet aggregation was performed by aggregometry evaluated by turbidimetric&#xD;
      method (AggRAM, Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, Texas, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In tracking the value of blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at each visit, as well&#xD;
      as pill counts were also conducted to assess adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be collected in a form designed for the study and stored in a database. The&#xD;
      data input to the system will be performed to minimize duplicate entry errors in the&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Follow-up visits will be conducted through interviews with one of the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The monitoring scheme is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  7 days: an additional 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 30 days: an additional 15 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 3 months: an additional 15 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 6 months: an additional 15 days (final visit). Each visit will be an interview,&#xD;
           physical examination and ECG. Counting capsules or pills to assess adherence is&#xD;
           performed and a new supply of medication will be provided for the period until the next&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the final visit, prior consultation with the researcher, a blood with 12 hours of fasting&#xD;
      to corresponding laboratory evaluations will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Medication Study medication will be prepared in the hospital pharmacy Crossing&#xD;
      protocolized according to procedures .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Losses to follow up Patients who did not attend one or more follow-up visits will be excluded&#xD;
      from study analysis of adhesion. In all cases, telephone contact will attempt to determine&#xD;
      the occurrence of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations Participants will be invited to participate in the study and will be&#xD;
      explained in detail the objectives. Be given a copy of the written informed consent for their&#xD;
      participation and can decide evacuate their doubts about the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, the guidelines of&#xD;
      international harmonization and local laws. In addition, the protocol will be conducted in&#xD;
      accordance with the guidelines for good clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They brighten at all times to patients the voluntary nature of participation in the study&#xD;
      during the informed consent process. At each visit will be asked verbally about his desire to&#xD;
      continue in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Qualitative variables are described using numbers and percentages.&#xD;
      Continuous variables were described using means and standard deviations or medians and&#xD;
      interquartile ranges, if you have normal or non-normal distribution, respectively. Normality&#xD;
      is determined by evaluating the quantile-quantile graphics and the Shapiro-Wilk test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat analysis of all patients&#xD;
      according to the group to which they were assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint analysis was performed by Pearson chi2 test. Further estimate the&#xD;
      relative risk of adhesion in the experimental treatment group compared to the control group,&#xD;
      with their corresponding confidence intervals using a 2 x 2 table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The differences between groups in levels of cholesterol and blood pressure were made using&#xD;
      Student's t test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analyzes according to age (greater or less than the median), sex, education,&#xD;
      diabetes, previous myocardial infarction and angioplasty was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyzes were performed two-tailed and a p value less than 0.05 was used to indicate&#xD;
      statistical significance.&#xD;
