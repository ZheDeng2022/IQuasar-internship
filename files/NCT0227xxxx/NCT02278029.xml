      This study will synthesize a behavioral profile of impaired driving performance for teenage&#xD;
      patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), or concussion, from one week&#xD;
      post-concussion to six weeks post-concussion. It will also elucidate the relation between&#xD;
      decreased reaction times exhibited by these patients and their functional response to driving&#xD;
      hazards. While a few studies have examined driving performance in adult patients with mTBI,&#xD;
      to the investigators knowledge this will be the first investigation of driving performance&#xD;
      for teenage patients with mTBI. Therefore, it will provide the foundation for the future&#xD;
      development of return-to-drive protocols for physicians and clinical practitioners. This&#xD;

      3A. Teen driving Motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) are the leading cause of death for teens in the&#xD;
      U.S.1 Young people aged 15 to 24 years account for approximately $26 billion of the total&#xD;
      costs related to motor vehicle injuries each year.2 In the state of Ohio for 2013, this age&#xD;
      group accounted for over 240 deaths with costs exceeding $200 million for medical expenses&#xD;
      and lost work time.3,4 Teen drivers aged 16 to 19 years account for much of this morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. Teens are at the highest risk of an MVC compared to any other age group5-per&#xD;
      mile driven, they are three times more likely to be in a fatal MVC than drivers 20 years and&#xD;
      older.6 Driving an automobile requires a complex set of cognitive, perceptual and motor&#xD;
      skills that must be utilized in concert for successful and safe driving performance.&#xD;
      Specifically, it involves the simultaneous control of the lateral and longitudinal position&#xD;
      of the vehicle in combination with a high amount of visual attention to the roadway, which is&#xD;
      necessary to inform decisions and resultant driving actions to manage current and future&#xD;
      driving situations.7-9 Driving also requires timely and efficient responses to a complex&#xD;
      array of stimuli (e.g., traffic signs and signals), and potential challenges (e.g.,&#xD;
      pedestrians and other automobiles). Accordingly, the latency of a driver's perceptual-motor&#xD;
      responses (i.e., reaction times) to these stimuli and challenges may be critically important&#xD;
      for the avoidance of MVCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, teen drivers are known to drive faster and allow shorter headways than older,&#xD;
      more experienced drivers10. Even more troubling is that teen drivers are more likely to use&#xD;
      attention-distracting technologies (e.g., cell phones) while driving11, and are more prone to&#xD;
      attentional lapses with two or more passengers in the automobile than experienced adults.10&#xD;
      Thus, given their inattentiveness, teen drivers likely are forced to rely more heavily on&#xD;
      reaction times and shorter cognitive and perceptual-motor responses to avoid adverse driving&#xD;
      events than experienced drivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3B. Driving related deficits in patients with mTBI Closed head injuries such as concussion&#xD;
      are becoming more prevalent in teenage populations: Over a recent 10-year period there was a&#xD;
      200% increase in sports related emergency room visits for concussion among teens 14 to 19&#xD;
      years of age.12 Negative sequelae associated with concussion include reduced attention span,&#xD;
      longer reaction times, impaired cognitive function and deficits in oculomotor&#xD;
      control13-17-all critically important factors for safe, effective driving performance.&#xD;
      Moreover, these symptoms tend to linger even after patients are cleared to return to normal&#xD;
      activities, and in some cases may persist for several months following the initial injury.18&#xD;
      Very little is known about the severity and duration of perceptual-motor and cognitive&#xD;
      deficits related to acute concussion (â‰¤ 1 week from initial injury) in pediatric populations,&#xD;
      although some conclusions can be drawn from research on young adult mTBI populations. For&#xD;
      example, adults with mTBI exhibit slower reaction times at the time of initial injury and for&#xD;
      up to 6-weeks post-injury compared to healthy, matched controls13. Moreover, adult patients&#xD;
      exhibited longer performance times on simple reaction-based response and memory tasks even&#xD;
      after their physical symptoms resolved and the patients were cleared to resume normal&#xD;
      activities14. In fact, in that particular study no patient returned to baseline reaction time&#xD;
      performance on the day clearance was given to return to contact sports (M = 4 days).&#xD;
      Similarly, a series of studies on high school and collegiate football players demonstrated&#xD;
      that both groups exhibited greater cognitive impairment, as indexed by the Standardized&#xD;
      Assessment of Concussion (SAC) test for the evaluation of neurocognitive functioning, in the&#xD;
      first several days after initial injury.15,19 Specifically, both age groups exhibited below&#xD;
      pre-injury baseline performance in orientation, concentration and memory for up to 48 hours&#xD;
      after the initial injury; however, cognitive processing was found to have resolved 7 days&#xD;
      post-injury for collegiate athletes.15 Disruptions to the neurological networks associated&#xD;
      with oculomotor control impair visual task performance in patients with mTBI as well20. For&#xD;
      example, adults with mTBI exhibited impaired eye movements17,20 which were manifested as&#xD;
      longer, more frequent self-paced saccades and slower reflexive saccades. These impairments&#xD;
      gave rise to lower visuospatial accuracy as well as decreased smooth pursuit tracking&#xD;
      performance.17,20 Other work has demonstrated that the variability of saccades during working&#xD;
      memory tasks correlates with white matter integrity in the brains of patients with mTBI, and&#xD;
      indicates that oculomotor behavior may be linked to the degree of diffuse axonal injury in&#xD;
      these patients.21-23 Similar oculomotor deficits have been observed in children (6-16 years&#xD;
      of age) with acquired brain injury.24 Those deficits were shown to constrain their ability to&#xD;
      process high frequency sensory information, making it difficult for the children to utilize&#xD;
      anticipation strategies and feedback. Taken in combination, this evolving oculomotor symptom&#xD;
      profile may be emblematic of problems these patients have participating in activities of&#xD;
      daily living, including driving, and the symptoms that arise (e.g., nausea, dizziness,&#xD;
      fatigue) due to participation in such activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3C. The profile of driving performance for patients with mTBI is incomplete At present, there&#xD;
      is no data on if or when it is safe to allow acutely concussed teenagers to drive. This is a&#xD;
      critical gap in the literature. Acute concussion symptoms have the potential to greatly&#xD;
      exacerbate the already high-risk driving behaviors exhibited by healthy teenagers. Further,&#xD;
      in the absence of return-to-drive criteria, physicians are forced to decide whether a teen is&#xD;
      fit to drive following a concussion with limited information. This has the potential to put&#xD;
      the teen at higher risk for MVCs and the accompanied costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, research has begun to examine the relation between neurocognitive deficits and&#xD;
      negative characteristics of driving performance in adults with mTBI.25,26 Patients with mTBI&#xD;
      were required to watch videos of genuine traffic scenes filmed from a driver's point of view&#xD;
      and to respond with a mouse click to potential traffic hazards as early as possible. The&#xD;
      results indicate that patients demonstrated slower responses to traffic hazards in the&#xD;
      initial 24 hours after injury compared to matched controls.26 More directly, actual driving&#xD;
      performance of adults with mTBI up to 3 days post-injury has been assessed on a driving&#xD;
      simulator.27,28 In one such study patients exhibited greater deviation from the center of the&#xD;
      driving lane in the absence of deficits in speed management.27 However, a separate study by&#xD;
      the same research group found speed management to be more variable, while overall deviation&#xD;
      from the center lane was not found to differ between patients and controls.26 While&#xD;
      conflicting, the results from both studies indicated improvements in measures of driving&#xD;
      performance that positively correlated with improvements in cognitive performance and&#xD;
      reaction time (assessed with ImPACT testing), as well as reductions in clinical deficits from&#xD;
      three days post-injury (session 1) compared to when patients were cleared to return to normal&#xD;
      activities (session 2).27,28 Thus, changes in driving performance in this population are&#xD;
      believed to be correlated with changes in cognition and reaction time performance in the&#xD;
      first several days after injury. However, the link between these measures and driving&#xD;
      performance is not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several additional gaps in the current literature on concussion and driving&#xD;
      performance. First, while reaction time deficits are known to manifest as longer response&#xD;
      latencies to identify adverse risks, the underlying mechanisms that drive such behavior are&#xD;
      not well understood. In order to understand how longer response times manifest in this&#xD;
      context, it is necessary to examine several testable components of reaction time behavior:&#xD;
      (1) adequate and efficient visual attention to the roadway (2) the oculomotor control that&#xD;
      drives the visual search, (3) the efficiency of cognitive-perceptual processes to identify&#xD;
      the situation as one of &quot;adverse risk&quot;, (4) the decision making that dictates whether or not&#xD;
      action(s) be taken to avoid the risk, and (5) the motor output that drives the specific&#xD;
      action(s) for risk avoidance. Therefore, the identification of response latencies in this&#xD;
      population is merely the first step in understanding the underlying mechanisms that lead to&#xD;
      any potential changes in their driving performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate and efficient visual attention to the roadway is one potential mechanism for slower&#xD;
      response times by patients with mTBI. Healthy and experienced adult drivers utilize a&#xD;
      strategy called timesharing to safely shift attention to and from the roadway. This strategy&#xD;
      involves a set of saccadic eye movements toward and away from the secondary task (e.g.,&#xD;
      changing a radio station) until it is completed (Figure 1),29,30 and successful timesharing&#xD;
      limits the duration of each glance away from the roadway to less than or equal to 2&#xD;
      s29,31(this translates to approximately 160 feet of distance if driving 55 mph). However, 45%&#xD;
      of teen drivers exhibit glances greater than or equal to 2.5 s away from the roadway (a&#xD;
      critical threshold for MVC risk), compared to only 10% of experienced drivers.32 The&#xD;
      investigation of this question therefore requires an analysis of oculomotor performance, and&#xD;
      specifically self-paced and reflexive saccade behaviors. This is because patients with mTBI&#xD;
      may timeshare equally to their healthy peers, but simply exhibit slow reaction times&#xD;
      transitioning out of the timeshare. Alternatively, a lack of control of visual saccades may&#xD;
      potentially lead to greater inefficiency in timesharing for these patients, as precious&#xD;
&#xD;
      milliseconds may be spent correcting for inexact self-paced saccades. This behavior might&#xD;
      take away from time attending to a given task, and may thus lead to protracted glances away&#xD;
      from the roadway. For similar reasons, inefficient self-paced and reflexive saccades may lead&#xD;
      to greater delays (slower reaction times) before recognition of an adverse event, decreasing&#xD;
      driver response time. Further, inefficiencies in tracking moving objects (smooth-pursuit&#xD;
      tracking deficits) may lead to miscalculations in purposeful steering deviations for risk&#xD;
      avoidance once an object has been identified, or potentially, poor risk assessment altogether&#xD;
      as visual information (e.g., time to contact) may be degraded. Such smooth-pursuit tracking&#xD;
      deficits, combined with slower cognitive and processing times in these patients, may&#xD;
      ultimately lead to reduced performance capabilities that may be difficult for the patient to&#xD;
      overcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, to the investigators knowledge no research has examined the effect of oculomotor&#xD;
      control deficits on driving performance for individuals with mTBI. This is surprising given&#xD;
      that such oculomotor processes likely underlie perceptual-motor and cognitive behaviors that&#xD;
      are critical to safe and effective driving. Also, while standardized assessments of cognition&#xD;
      and simple reaction time are sensitive and specific measures of concussion33,34, evidence is&#xD;
      lacking as to their relation to driving performance for teenage patients with mTBI. In&#xD;
      addition, no research has examined such a profile of driving performance in teenage drivers&#xD;
      over the time-course of recovery.&#xD;
