  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) including moderate acute malnutrition (MAM:&#xD;
      weight-for-height z-score &lt;-2 to -3, or mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) 115 to &lt; 125 mm)&#xD;
      is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in under-5 children of developing/low-income&#xD;
      countries. Approximately 14.6% of all under-5 mortality worldwide is attributed to MAM.&#xD;
      Prevalence of MAM among under-5 children in Bangladesh is ~12% (~1.7 million). Providing a&#xD;
      diet containing adequate nutrients is the mainstay of treatment of children with MAM. Dietary&#xD;
      protein is mostly derived from vegetable sources for the middle and low income population&#xD;
      among whom the prevalence of MAM and other forms of PEM is high. It is now possible to&#xD;
      process fish into fish peptides with longer shelf-life without refrigerator, known as 'fish&#xD;
      Surimi' and consumed by different categories of people who need more well-balanced protein;&#xD;
      this could be an attractive alternative to supply fish protein in the diet of children in&#xD;
      low-income countries like Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fish Surimi peptide is broken down from white fish meat using plant-derived enzyme and the&#xD;
      ingredient is just fish meat consisted of 20 different kinds of amino acids including nine&#xD;
      essential amino acids. In human studies it is found to help lowering blood lipids, glucose,&#xD;
      IgE, hypertension, and increasing serum albumin and total protein, and bone density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is designed to assess acceptability and efficacy of 'fish Surimi' in 2-5&#xD;
      years old children suffering from MAM. A pilot study with two phases: to assess the i)&#xD;
      acceptability with a small convenience sample (N=30) (phase 1); and ii) efficacy (rate of&#xD;
      weight gain) of this fish peptide in a small convenience sample (N=70: 35 intervention 35&#xD;
      control) (phase 2) is proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptability trial (first phase): The investigators will conduct this study in the study&#xD;
      ward of Dhaka Hospital of icddr,b. For each child the study will be for two days: i.e. direct&#xD;
      observation of food intake of two lunches and two suppers. In a randomly manner and cross&#xD;
      over design, an individual child will be offered 5g of fish Surimi during lunch and 5g during&#xD;
      supper in one day or the same meal without any fish peptide on the other day in a blinded&#xD;
      manner. The investigators will observe the completeness and eagerness of eating and any&#xD;
      possible side effect (e.g. allergy, vomiting, diarrhea etc.) over these two days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot efficacy trial (second phase): The investigators will conduct a pilot trial to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy (mainly on child weight gain) of fish Surimi given at home with various&#xD;
      foods/meals in 2-5 years old children with MAM will be conducted in Dhaka City of Bangladesh.&#xD;
      Children will be enrolled from the Dhaka Hospital of icddr,b after improvement of any acute&#xD;
      illness. The intervention group will receive (as take home supplementation) two-week's ration&#xD;
      of fish Surimi (@10g/day in two doses i.e. 5g + 5g each in airtight packet), which will be&#xD;
      served twice daily mixed with family diet. The control group will not be provided any&#xD;
      supplements but the parents will be given dietary advice to provide nutritious food to the&#xD;
      child in adequate amounts, and children of both groups will receive micronutrient sprinkle.&#xD;
      The child's guardian will be supplied with fish Surimi during initial discharge from icddr,b&#xD;
      hospital and requested to come for a fortnightly follow up at the nutrition follow-up unit&#xD;
      (NFU) of icddr,b. During each follow-up visit the study research assistant/health worker will&#xD;
      do the anthropometry, collect morbidity history since the last visit/follow up and dietary&#xD;
      history will also be taken to find out how the child is doing along with the fish Surimi&#xD;
      intake. Treatment of any illness will be provided as per standard method by on duty physician&#xD;
      of the Dhaka Hospital of icddr,b. The ration for next two weeks will be provided and in such&#xD;
      way each child will be followed for ~ 3 months over six NFU-follow-up visits. To reduce the&#xD;
      possible drop-out the both-way transportation cost (~ 150 to 250 taka) during each follow-up&#xD;
      visit will be reimbursed to the guardians. In the middle of the two scheduled follow-up days&#xD;
      the research assistant will call the family by cell phone to monitor the child's feeding and&#xD;
      morbidity status. Approximately 5ml blood will be collected from the ante-cubital vein of the&#xD;
      children for biochemical test on enrolment and at the end of 3 months and will be analyzed&#xD;
      for haemoglobin (Hb), c-reactive protein, zinc, ferritin, albumin, total protein, and IgE.&#xD;
      During the blood drawing days each child will be given a toy (take home).&#xD;
