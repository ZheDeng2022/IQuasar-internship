      High-protein diets better preserve lean mass than conventional low-fat diets. However, they&#xD;
      are costly and have potential health risks. Preserving lean mass is important for sustaining&#xD;
      high resting energy expenditure, leading to greater initial weight loss, better weight&#xD;
      maintenance and improving blood sugar levels. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) supplements&#xD;
      are known to preserve lean mass but their effects during weight loss have not been examined.&#xD;
      Investigators want to investigate if a BCAA-supplemented diet is more effective than a&#xD;
      standard hypocaloric diet in terms of the aforementioned benefits, and yet has less&#xD;
      detrimental effects than a high-protein diet for weight loss. Using a 16-week weight loss and&#xD;
      8-week weight maintenance intervention, overweight and obese men and women will be randomized&#xD;
      to either a hypocaloric diet with BCAA or placebo supplements or a high-protein diet with&#xD;
      placebo supplements. Participants' compliance to the diet versus supplements will be&#xD;
      compared. Body composition, resting and diet-induced energy expenditure, insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      will be measured and blood samples taken before and after weight loss. These findings will&#xD;
      inform on the benefits of BCAA-supplementation during energy restriction and may offer an&#xD;
      alternative cost-effective strategy for weight loss and maintenance, without the adverse&#xD;
      health effects of a high-protein load.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity globally and in Singapore continues to rise despite increased&#xD;
      public awareness and efforts to control weight. Its association with chronic metabolic&#xD;
      diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, signify the serious&#xD;
      implications of obesity on public health. There remains, however, no scientific consensus on&#xD;
      the optimal methods for weight loss and its maintenance over longer periods of time. The&#xD;
      Atkins diet was introduced in the late 1990s and has since fuelled the popularity of using&#xD;
      high-protein diets for weight loss. Scientific evidence have since shown high-protein diets&#xD;
      to be more effective than conventional low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets in producing greater&#xD;
      weight loss, at least in the short-term. More importantly, high-protein diets also reduce the&#xD;
      amount of lean tissue lost during weight loss and may help to maintain weight loss to a&#xD;
      greater extent than conventional diets. However, high-protein diets are also known to raise&#xD;
      esterol, albeit improving TG and HDL-cholesterol levels. This could be due to the higher&#xD;
      amounts of saturated fats that accompany foods rich in animal protein. In addition,&#xD;
      high-protein diets may lower bone mineral density and impact on kidney function. High-protein&#xD;
      diets are also more expensive than conventional low-fat, high carbohydrate foods , which is&#xD;
      an important consideration for longer term compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplements containing branched-chain amino acids (BCAA:leucine, isoleucine and valine) are&#xD;
      commonly used among muscle builders and athletic community. BCAAs have been shown to&#xD;
      stimulate protein synthesis and preserve lean mass. While a few studies have examined BCAA&#xD;
      supplementation with low protein diets for weight loss and found depletion of other essential&#xD;
      amino acids, the effects of BCAA supplementation with moderate-protein hypocaloric diets on&#xD;
      lean mass preservation during weight loss in energy-restricted obese patients has, to our&#xD;
      knowledge, not been investigated. Compared to consuming a high (animal) protein diet, which&#xD;
      is also rich in BCAAs, taking BCAA supplements would be a much more convenient and affordable&#xD;
      way to obtain similar if not greater quantities of BCAA, without the adverse health effects&#xD;
      of a high-protein load on the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study investigators primarily aim to investigate in overweight/obese subjects,&#xD;
      whether a BCAA-supplemented (moderate-protein) hypocaloric diet (BCAA) when compared to a&#xD;
      standard (moderate-protein) hypocaloric diet (CT) will result in greater lean mass&#xD;
      preservation, resting and diet-induced energy expenditure, and improved insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
      Investigators will also examine the effects on lean mass preservation and insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      changes between BCAA-supplemented diet and high-protein hypocaloric diet (HP). As a secondary&#xD;
      aim, investigators have also powered the study to examine if the BCAA-supplemented diet has&#xD;
      added advantage to the high-protein diet by incurring less negative effects on bone mineral&#xD;
      density and renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, investigators will determine the participant's compliance to the diet versus&#xD;
      supplements as a weight loss and maintenance strategy. The findings of this study will&#xD;
      provide us novel insight on BCAA-supplementation in the hypocaloric diet. If this study is&#xD;
      successful, BCAA-supplementation on a hypocaloric diet could provide an alternative to a&#xD;
      standard (moderate-protein) hypocaloric diet for weight reduction strategy without the&#xD;
      attending potential health risks of a high protein load e.g. reduced bone mineral density and&#xD;
      detrimental effects on renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three main hypotheses which investigators propose to examine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: A BCAA-supplemented hypocaloric diet (BCAA) would lead to greater lean mass&#xD;
      preservation during weight loss compared to a standard (moderate-protein) hypocaloric diet&#xD;
      (CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diets with varying diet composition, including low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets to&#xD;
      high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets have been tested in search of the optimal macronutrient&#xD;
      composition for weight loss. High-protein diets have been highly favored for their ability to&#xD;
      initiate greater initial weight loss. However, accumulative data from recent studies has&#xD;
      shown no significant differences in amount of weight loss between high-protein diets and&#xD;
      other traditional (normally low-fat, high-carbohydrate) energy-restricted diets in the longer&#xD;
      term (16 weeks to 1 year). It appears that total energy intake, rather than diet composition,&#xD;
      is the most important determinant of longer term weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, an overriding advantage of high-protein diets is their favorable effects on body&#xD;
      composition, that is preserving greater lean mass, compared to high-carbohydrate diets,&#xD;
      during weight loss in adult obese patients, independent of energy intake. A recent&#xD;
      meta-analysis demonstrated that high protein diets (protein &gt; 1.05g/kg body weight) are&#xD;
      associated with up to 1.21 kg additional fat-free mass retention compared with diets of lower&#xD;
      protein intake. Lean mass or fat-free mass is a main determinant of basal (resting) energy&#xD;
      expenditure. Its greater preservation would reduce the weight loss-induced decreased in&#xD;
      energy expenditure, which might have two important implications. Firstly, higher basal energy&#xD;
      expenditure during weight loss could lead to greater weight loss for the same amount of&#xD;
      calories consumed. Secondly, the amount of lean mass preserved at the end of weight loss&#xD;
      might mitigate weight regain during maintenance phase of weight loss, i.e. success of weight&#xD;
      maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Branched-chain amino acids like leucine, isoleucine and valine are substrates for protein&#xD;
      synthesis and also potent nutrients that regulate protein metabolism. Supplementation with&#xD;
      leucine or leucine-rich protein sources have been suggested to develop muscle mass or prevent&#xD;
      protein loss in conditions characterized by muscle protein wasting. In human studies, the use&#xD;
      of leucine or leucine-rich protein sources supplementation have been well-investigated to&#xD;
      optimize the effects of exercise on body composition.Several studies have examined the impact&#xD;
      of chronic (average of 3 months) leucine-rich amino acid supplementation in healthy elderly&#xD;
      humans, and have demonstrated significant improvement in lean body mass, muscle strength and&#xD;
      physical capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether the lean mass preservation during high-protein hypocaloric diet is due to the&#xD;
      presence of the higher amounts of BCAA content is less clear. Two studies have examined the&#xD;
      use of whey protein (rich in BCAA) in weight loss but it was uncertain if the benefits of&#xD;
      enhanced weight loss with less lean muscle loss can be attributed to the BCAA alone or due to&#xD;
      the enrichment of other nutrients like calcium and bioactive peptides in the whey protein&#xD;
      fraction. It is also not clear whether animal sources of protein (rich in BCAAs) are more&#xD;
      beneficial than plant sources of protein on energy expenditure, body composition , satiety&#xD;
      and fat loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigators' knowledge, no studies have specifically examined the beneficial effect of&#xD;
      BCAA supplementation with a moderate-protein diet on lean mass preservation during weight&#xD;
      loss in energy-restricted obese patients. Investigators hypothesize that similar to a&#xD;
      high-protein diet (as shown in literature), a BCAA-supplemented hypocaloric diet would also&#xD;
      lead to greater lean mass preservation than a standard (moderate-protein) hypocaloric diet&#xD;
      during weight loss. In addition, investigators want to examine the effects on lean mass&#xD;
      preservation between BCAA-supplemented hypocaloric diet and high protein hypocaloric diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Improvement in insulin sensitivity with a BCAA-supplemented hypocaloric diet&#xD;
      (BCAA) is greater than a standard (moderate-protein) hypocaloric diet (CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The insulin stimulating effects of proteins maybe mediated through specific amino acids,&#xD;
      making them potent modulators of insulin action and glucose metabolism. In animal models,&#xD;
      BCAA supplementation has been found to improve glucose tolerance and stimulate glucose uptake&#xD;
      in skeletal muscle by mechanisms involving glycogen synthase activity. While energy&#xD;
      restriction and weight loss have positive effects on insulin sensitivity , whether diet&#xD;
      composition further impacts on insulin sensitivity is still inconclusive. Several studies&#xD;
      found significant improvement in insulin sensitivity after high-protein diets compared to&#xD;
      control diets, independent of weight loss, while others did not. As skeletal muscle mass is a&#xD;
      major determinate of insulin sensitivity, investigators postulate that due to greater lean&#xD;
      mass preservation, the BCAA diet would result in greater improvement in insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      compared to CT diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: The BCAA-supplementation diet (BCAA) would be easier to adhere to and has less&#xD;
      detrimental effects on bone mineral density and renal function than the high-protein diet&#xD;
      (HP), leading to better (short-term) weight maintenance and less weight regain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintaining weight loss is a greater challenge than the weight loss process and may not be as&#xD;
      easily achieved. Studies have shown that weight regain is significantly lesser in subjects in&#xD;
      the high-protein group compared to control group after six months to a year on a&#xD;
      weight-maintenance diet. In these studies, study foods are provided and may not reflect&#xD;
      real-life free-living situations during weight maintenance phase. Achieving a high-protein&#xD;
      diet long term can be costly and requires careful planning of meals. To what extent subjects&#xD;
      can continue to maintain the same diet composition as their weight loss diet on their own&#xD;
      accord at energy balance during weight maintenance has not been well-investigated The&#xD;
      effectiveness of longer term BCAA supplementation in hypocaloric diet has also not been fully&#xD;
      investigated. If BCAA supplementation could induce similar metabolic improvement as of a&#xD;
      high-protein diet during the weight loss phase, it might help to maintain body weight through&#xD;
      easy administration and greater compliance in the longer term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, investigators proposed to provide BCAA supplements to the BCAA group and&#xD;
      placebo supplements provided to the HP and CT groups throughout the entire study (weight loss&#xD;
      and maintenance phases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study foods will, however, only be provided during the weight loss phase. Investigators&#xD;
      speculate that overall, adherence to supplementation would be better than adherence to the&#xD;
      respective diet compositions at the end of the weight maintenance phase for subjects in all&#xD;
      three groups. Investigators hypothesize that while subjects on the HP and BCAA diets will&#xD;
      have less weight regain in the initial weight maintenance phase (due to greater lean mass)&#xD;
      than the CT group, the BCAA group will have the least weight regain at the end of weight&#xD;
      maintenance phase due to better compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerns have been raised over the safety of high-protein diets. Studies have indicated that&#xD;
      increase protein intake is associated with increased renal calcium excretion, negative&#xD;
      calcium balance, bone resorption and causes hyperfiltration. At the same time, it is also&#xD;
      known that loss of bone mass often accompanies weight loss induced by calorie restriction.&#xD;
      Whether high-protein diets have a detrimental impact on bone mineral density and renal&#xD;
      function is still inconclusive. In this study, investigators hypothesize that the&#xD;
      BCAA-supplemented diet would result in lesser detrimental effects on bone mineral density and&#xD;
      renal function than the high-protein diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other secondary hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three dietary interventions may lead to significant differences in markers of&#xD;
      cardiometabolic outcomes including inflammatory markers&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resting/basal metabolic rate change with time, and diet induced thermogenesis, may differ&#xD;
      between the three groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resting basal metabolic rate change in the subjects with weight loss at 16 weeks predicts&#xD;
      the weight gain/rebound at 24 weeks.&#xD;
