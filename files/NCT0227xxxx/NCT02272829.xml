      This project will develop a novel collaborative treatment, based on the primary care&#xD;
      behavioral consultation model and behavior therapy techniques including motivational&#xD;
      interviewing and functional assessment, in which a patient, a Behavioral Health Consultant&#xD;
      (BHC) and a HIV primary care provider share a unified plan targeting misuse of prescribed&#xD;
      opioid analgesics in older HIV+ adults. The intervention will involve meetings between the&#xD;
      BHC and the PCP, the BHC and the participant, and the BHC, PCP and the participant. Opioid&#xD;
      misuse will be the primary outcome variable. Quality of the patient-provider relationship,&#xD;
      pain, problematic use of other substances, antiretroviral adherence, and psychosocial&#xD;
      functioning will be secondary outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 20% of HIV patients receive prescriptions for chronic opioid therapy (COT) to treat&#xD;
      chronic pain. This project will develop a novel collaborative treatment, based on the primary&#xD;
      care behavioral consultation model and behavior therapy techniques including motivational&#xD;
      interviewing and functional assessment, in which a patient, a Behavioral Health Consultant&#xD;
      and a HIV primary care provider share a unified plan targeting misuse of prescribed opioid&#xD;
      analgesics in older HIV+ adults. This would be the first theoretically-driven,&#xD;
      empirically-tested intervention that specifically attends to the difficult issues around&#xD;
      chronic pain and opioid prescription in HIV clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will develop a collaborative, brief, behavioral consultation intervention&#xD;
      targeting misuse of prescribed opioids in older HIV+ adults. The intervention, CHOACOT&#xD;
      (Consultation for HIV+ Older Adults on Chronic Opioid Therapy), will consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. three meetings between the Behavioral Health Specialist (BHS) and the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. two brief consultations between the BHC and the HIV-PCP&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. a joint meeting of the patient, BHC, and HIV-PCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve our aims, we will develop CHOACOT beginning with an iterative open trial (n=10).&#xD;
      Next, we will conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial (n=30) of CHOACOT versus enhanced&#xD;
      Treatment-As-Usual. Opioid misuse will be the primary outcome variable. Quality of the&#xD;
      patient-provider relationship, pain, problematic use of other substances, antiretroviral&#xD;
      adherence, and psychosocial functioning will be secondary outcomes. The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Develop and refine CHOACOT so that it meets standards of feasibility and acceptability&#xD;
      for HIV PCPs, BHCs, and participants;&#xD;
&#xD;
      1a. To develop and field test a CHOACOT BHC manual;&#xD;
&#xD;
      1b. To develop a reliable measure of BHC manual adherence;&#xD;
&#xD;
      1c. To develop and field-test BHC training and supervision procedures. Aim 2. Refine research&#xD;
      procedures (e.g., consent and randomization processes, assessment procedures), and establish&#xD;
      their feasibility and acceptability to participants while confirming recruitment goal&#xD;
      targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Misuse of prescribed opioids is the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes are problematic use&#xD;
      of substances with a high potential for lethality when used with COT (benzodiazepines,&#xD;
      cocaine, alcohol, heroin), ARV adherence, viral load, pain, psychosocial functioning,&#xD;
      patient-provider alliance, and treatment satisfaction and acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This line of work could lead to the incorporation into HIV care of a theoretically-driven and&#xD;
      empirically-tested brief intervention for older HIV patients who are prescribed opioids for&#xD;
      chronic pain and for whom there is concern about opioid misuse.&#xD;
