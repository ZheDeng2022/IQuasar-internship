  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients enrolled on this study will have received a stem cell transplant. After a&#xD;
      transplant, while the immune system grows back the patient is at risk for infection. Some&#xD;
      viruses can stay in the body for life, and if the immune system is weakened (like after a&#xD;
      transplant), they can cause life-threatening infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adenovirus (AdV) is a virus that just causes symptoms of a common cold normally, but which&#xD;
      can cause serious life-threatening infections in patients who have weak immune systems. It&#xD;
      usually affects the lungs and can cause a very serious pneumonia, but it can also affect the&#xD;
      gut, the liver, the pancreas and the eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators want to see if they can use a kind of white blood cell called T cells to treat&#xD;
      adenovirus infections that occur after a transplant. Investigators have observed in other&#xD;
      studies that treatment with specially trained T cells has been successful when the cells are&#xD;
      made from the transplant donor. However as it takes 1-2 months to make the cells, that&#xD;
      approach is not practical when a patient already has an infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have now generated AdV-specific T cells from the blood of healthy donors and&#xD;
      created a bank of these cells. Investigators have previously successfully used frozen&#xD;
      virus-specific T cell lines generated from healthy donors to treat virus infections after&#xD;
      bone marrow transplant, and have now improved the production method and customized the bank&#xD;
      of lines to specifically and exclusively target AdV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, investigators want to find out if the banked AdV-specific T cells derived from&#xD;
      healthy donors are safe and can help to treat adenoviral infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AdV-specific T cells (Viralym-A) are an investigational product not approved by the Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To make AdV-specific T cells (Viralym-A cells), small pieces of protein called peptides that&#xD;
      come from AdV were mixed with blood cells from healthy donors. These peptides train a kind of&#xD;
      white blood cell called T cells to recognize and kill cells that are infected with AdV. These&#xD;
      T cells were then grown in special growth factors in special flasks in the lab. Once we made&#xD;
      sufficient numbers of cells, we tested them to make sure they recognized cells infected by&#xD;
      adenovirus, and then we froze them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When we think the subject needs them, Viralym-A cells will be thawed and injected into the&#xD;
      intravenous line. To prevent an allergic reaction, prior to receiving Viralym-A cells the&#xD;
      subject may be given diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and acetaminophen (Tylenol). The subject will&#xD;
      remain in the clinic for at least one hour after the infusion. After the subject receives the&#xD;
      cells, the transplant doctor will monitor the levels of adenovirus in the blood. We will also&#xD;
      take blood to see how long the cells we gave the subject are lasting in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will continue to be followed by their transplant doctors after the injection. The&#xD;
      subject will either be seen in the clinic or they will be contacted by a research nurse to&#xD;
      follow up for this study every week for 6 weeks, then at 3, 6 and 12 months. The subject may&#xD;
      have other visits for their standard care. Subjects will also have regular blood tests done&#xD;
      to follow their counts and the viral infection as part of their standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about the way Viralym-A cells are working in the body, an extra 30-40 ml (6-8&#xD;
      teaspoons) of blood will be taken before the infusion and then at study follow-up visits at&#xD;
      1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 weeks, and 3 months after the infusion. Blood should come from the central&#xD;
      intravenous line, and should not require extra needle sticks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants on this study will be infused with the same number (dose) of cells. If&#xD;
      Viralym-A infusion has helped the subjects infection or if they have had a treatment, for&#xD;
      example with steroid drugs that might have destroyed the T cells the subject was given, then&#xD;
      they are allowed to receive up to 4 additional infusions of the Viralym-A cells at the same&#xD;
      initial dose level from 28 days after their initial infusion. Following infusions should be&#xD;
      at least 14 days apart. After each Viralym-A cells infusion, subjects will be monitored as&#xD;
      described above.&#xD;
