      Medication adherence is especially critical in regions like rural Alabama, where residents&#xD;
      have among the worst health outcomes in the US. This project was designed in collaboration&#xD;
      with our community member partners and builds on a 5-year partnership of community-engaged&#xD;
      research on diabetes peer coaching interventions and our experience with peer storytelling.&#xD;
      The investigators will test the hypothesis that an intervention designed within the Corbin&#xD;
      and Strauss framework can improve adherence and health outcomes compared to usual care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Improving medication adherence is one of the greatest challenges in modern medicine. Despite&#xD;
      decades of research on the topic, as many as half of patients with chronic diseases are not&#xD;
      taking medications as recommended, and costs of nonadherence have been estimated at $290&#xD;
      billion annually. One reason for this persistent finding could be that interventions rarely&#xD;
      acknowledge medications within the larger context of the lived experience of illness. Drawing&#xD;
      on hundreds of patient interviews, Corbin and Strauss showed that chronic illness is a&#xD;
      fundamentally destabilizing influence that forces us to confront the potential limitations of&#xD;
      our &quot;new&quot;, chronically ill self. Accepting our illness may be a crucial step in embracing&#xD;
      medication adherence and other self-management behaviors as ways to restore balance following&#xD;
      this disruption. The Corbin and Strauss framework is not often used to develop and test&#xD;
      interventions to improve medication adherence, and this is the central objective of this&#xD;
      proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication adherence is especially critical in regions like rural Alabama, where residents&#xD;
      have among the worst health outcomes in the US. Rates of cardiovascular mortality, diabetes&#xD;
      and obesity are very high, but resources are scarce and the area's predominately black&#xD;
      residents have deep-seated mistrust of the healthcare system (the region includes Tuskegee,&#xD;
      site of the infamous syphilis study). This project was designed in collaboration with our&#xD;
      community member partners and builds on a 5-year partnership of community-engaged research on&#xD;
      diabetes peer coaching interventions and our experience with peer storytelling. The&#xD;
      investigators will test the hypothesis that an intervention designed within the Corbin and&#xD;
      Strauss framework can improve adherence and health outcomes compared to usual care. Our Aims&#xD;
      are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: With our community partners, using qualitative research methods, build on already&#xD;
      developed culturally tailored education material to develop the medication adherence&#xD;
      intervention. The intervention will consist of educational DVDs with integrated storytelling&#xD;
      about how community members accepted their disease and overcame barriers to medication&#xD;
      adherence, plus one-on-one telephonic peer coaching. Activities include conducting focus&#xD;
      groups with patients; creating the DVDs and the coaching intervention protocol; training peer&#xD;
      coaches; and pilot testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Conduct a randomized controlled trial with 500 individuals with type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      medication nonadherence. The trial will compare the effect of usual care and the intervention&#xD;
      on medication adherence and physiologic risk factors including A1c, blood pressure and low&#xD;
      density lipoprotein cholesterol (primary outcomes), and quality of life and self-efficacy&#xD;
      (secondary outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This innovative approach would be a major shift in how patients are helped in under resourced&#xD;
      areas living with chronic diseases commit to taking medications, improving health and&#xD;
      eventually reducing health disparities.&#xD;

          <description>Diabetes specific quality of life will be assessed using the validated Diabetes Distress Scale.The DDS is a 17-item instrument that measures diabetes-related emotional distress. Participants rate the degree to which each item is problematic for them on a 6-point Likert scale, from 1 (no problem) to 6 (serious problem). A score of 3 or greater = moderate distress.</description>
