      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (the study of the way a drug&#xD;
      enters and leaves the blood and tissues over time) of golimumab administered intravenously&#xD;
      (IV) to pediatric participants with polyarticular (affects 5 or more joints) juvenile (an&#xD;
      onset before age 16) idiopathic (of unknown cause) arthritis (joint pain) (pJIA) manifested&#xD;
      by greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 5 joints with active arthritis despite methotrexate (MTX)&#xD;
      therapy for &gt;= 2 months.&#xD;

      This is a single arm, Open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention),&#xD;
      multi-center (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research&#xD;
      study) study to determine the pharmacokinetics (the study of the way a drug enters and leaves&#xD;
      the blood and tissues over time), efficacy (effectiveness) and safety of intravenous&#xD;
      golimumab in participants with pJIA despite current treatment with methotrexate (MTX). The&#xD;
      study will consist of 3 parts: Screening Phase (6 weeks); an Open-label Treatment Phase&#xD;
      (consists of golimumab and MTX treatment for 52 weeks, wherein after Week 28, MTX dose change&#xD;
      is allowed); Long-term Extension Phase (after Week 52 through Week 252) and Extended&#xD;
      Treatment Period (after week 252). The maximal study duration for a participant will not&#xD;
      exceed 832 weeks. All the eligible participants will be administered golimumab IV infusion&#xD;
      and commercial MTX. Blood samples will be collected for evaluation of pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      study treatment. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis must be made per Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) International League of&#xD;
             Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) diagnostic criteria and the onset of disease must&#xD;
             have been before the participant's 16th birthday&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure or inadequate response to at least a 2 month course of methotrexate (MTX)&#xD;
             before screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 5 joints with active arthritis at&#xD;
             screening and at Week 0 as defined by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria&#xD;
             (that is, a joint with either swelling, or in the absence of swelling, limited range&#xD;
             of motion associated with pain on motion or tenderness)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have a screening C-reactive protein (CRP) of &gt;=0.1 milligram&#xD;
             (mg)/deciliter (dL) with the exception of approximately 30 percent (%) of the study&#xD;
             population&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA)&#xD;
             despite current use of oral, intramuscular, or subcutaneous MTX for &gt;=2 months before&#xD;
             screening. For participants with body surface area (BSA) less than (&lt;)1.67 meter&#xD;
             square (m^2), the MTX dose must be between 10 to 30 milligram per meter square&#xD;
             (mg/m^2) per week and stable for &gt;=4 weeks before screening. For participants with BSA&#xD;
             &gt;=1.67 m^2, the MTX dose must be a minimum of 15 mg/week and must be stable for &gt;=4&#xD;
             weeks before screening. In situations where there is documented intolerance of doses&#xD;
             greater than (&gt;)10 mg/m^2 weekly (for participants with BSA &lt;1.67 m^2) or &gt;=15 mg/week&#xD;
             (for participants with BSA &gt;=1.67 m^2); or where documented country or site&#xD;
             regulations prohibit use of &gt;=15 mg of MTX per week in participants with BSA &gt;=1.67&#xD;
             m^2, participants may be entered into the trial on a lower dose of MTX&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has initiated disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and/or&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy within 4 weeks prior to first study agent administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has been treated with intra-articular, intramuscular or intravenous&#xD;
             corticosteroids (including intramuscular corticotropin) during the 4 weeks before&#xD;
             first study agent administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has been treated with any therapeutic agent targeted at reducing&#xD;
             Interleukin (IL)-12 or IL 23, including but not limited to ustekinumab and ABT-874,&#xD;
             within 3 months before first study agent administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has been treated with natalizumab, efalizumab, or therapeutic agents that&#xD;
             deplete B or T cells (eg, rituximab, alemtuzumab, or visilizumab) during the 12 months&#xD;
             before first study agent administration, or have evidence at screening of persistent&#xD;
             depletion of the targeted lymphocyte after receiving any of these agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has been treated with alefacept within 3 months before first study agent&#xD;
             administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a participant has been previously treated with an anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha&#xD;
             (TNF alpha) agent, the reason for discontinuation of the anti-TNF alpha agent cannot&#xD;
             have been a severe or serious adverse event consistent with the class of anti-TNF&#xD;
             alpha agents&#xD;
