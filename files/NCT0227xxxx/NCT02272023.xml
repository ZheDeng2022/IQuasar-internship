    <textblock>
      A Phase II Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) is proposed to compare a 9-session model of&#xD;
      intensive motivational interviewing (IMI) to standard motivational interviewing techniques&#xD;
      (SMI) among alcohol dependent women. Preliminary work studying 87 women randomly assigned to&#xD;
      IMI or a standard single session of motivational interviewing showed significantly better&#xD;
      drinking outcomes for women in the IMI condition at 4- and 6-month follow-up. Interestingly,&#xD;
      mean trajectories for women assigned to IMI showed continuing declines in drinking problems&#xD;
      during and after treatment. Differences between study conditions grew larger between 4-month&#xD;
      (p&lt;.05) and 6-month (p&lt;.01) follow-up and the effect size at 6 months was medium to large&#xD;
      (Cohen's d=0.63) The study will use mixed model quantitative and qualitative methods to&#xD;
      respond to the PA's call for studies assessing mechanisms of change. Unlike many previous&#xD;
      studies of SMI, we will employ limited exclusion criteria and will enroll participants who&#xD;
      present with co-existing drug and psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for the proposed study draw from our current successful RCT assessing IMI for&#xD;
      methamphetamine (MA) dependence. Successful aspects of the current study include achievement&#xD;
      of recruitment goals, strong adherence to the treatment and research protocols, and excellent&#xD;
      rates for follow-up interviews (&gt;90%). The proposed study will take place at the same&#xD;
      outpatient treatment program as the current study, New Leaf Treatment Center in Lafayette,&#xD;
      California.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will include 220 alcohol dependent women who will be randomly assigned to IMI or&#xD;
      SMI. Those in SMI will also receive an attention component (nutrition education) to achieve&#xD;
      time equivalence between the two study conditions. Participants in both groups will receive&#xD;
      standard weekly group treatment offered at the program. In addition, referrals to Alcoholics&#xD;
      Anonymous will be provided to all participants. The primary outcomes will be measures of&#xD;
      drinking, heavy drinking (4+ drinks), and severity of alcohol problems assessed at baseline&#xD;
      and 2, 6, and 12 months. Secondary outcomes will include Addiction Severity Index scales,&#xD;
      psychiatric problems, and symptoms of trauma. The study will include standard quantitative&#xD;
      testing of potential mediators, including, the therapeutic alliance, self-efficacy,&#xD;
      motivation, satisfaction, and use of outside services. However, the application also proposes&#xD;
      an innovative use of qualitative procedures to identify unrecognized factors influencing&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study responds to the Program Announcement PA-10-100, &quot;Alcohol Use Disorders:&#xD;
      Treatment, Services Research, and Recovery&quot; (R01) issued by the National Institute on Alcohol&#xD;
      Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). Our application addresses the priorities of this announcement&#xD;
      by proposing a phase II randomized clinical trial comparing intensive motivational&#xD;
      interviewing (IMI) to standard motivational interviewing techniques (SMI) for alcohol&#xD;
      dependent women. The study will use mixed model quantitative and qualitative methods to&#xD;
      respond to the program announcement's call for studies assessing mechanisms of change. Unlike&#xD;
      many previous studies of SMI we will employ limited exclusion criteria and will enroll&#xD;
      participants who present with co-existing drug and psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMI was initially developed as a brief intervention (typically 1-3 sessions) for the&#xD;
      treatment of problem drinkers (Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002). The general strategy of SMI is to&#xD;
      strategically combine supportive and directive interventions as a way to elicit ambivalence&#xD;
      about substance use (i.e., pros and cons) and thereby increase motivation for change.&#xD;
      Systematic reviews of the alcohol treatment literature have consistently shown SMI to be&#xD;
      effective for treating alcohol use disorders (Hettema, Steele, &amp; Miller, 2005; Dunn, Deroo,&#xD;
      Rivera, 2001). Studies have shown SMI to be effective as a stand-alone treatment for alcohol&#xD;
      problems (Project MATCH Research Group, 1997; Miller, 1993; Sellman, Sullivan, Dore, Adamson,&#xD;
      &amp; MacEwan, 2001) and as preparation for more intensive treatment (Burke, Arkowitz, &amp;&#xD;
      Menchola, 2003). Perhaps the best-known and largest study of an SMI based was an assessment&#xD;
      of &quot;motivational enhancement therapy&quot; (MET) as a stand-alone, 4 session condition conducted&#xD;
      by the Project MATCH Research Group (Sellman, Sullivan, Dore, Adamson, &amp; MacEwan, 2001;&#xD;
      Project MATCH Research Group, 1998). Participants were randomly assigned to 4 sessions of&#xD;
      MET, 12 sessions of cognitive behavioral counseling (CBT), or 12 sessions of 12-step&#xD;
      facilitation (TSF). Despite fewer sessions in MET, outcomes among the 3 conditions were&#xD;
      comparable. A limitation of the study was that individuals with serious co-occurring drug or&#xD;
      mental health problems were excluded as were those with housing instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Like Project MATCH, most studies of SMI for alcohol problems have excluded participants who&#xD;
      have serious co-occurring drug and mental health problems. However, these are precisely the&#xD;
      types of individuals that treatment practitioners are likely to encounter in publicly funded&#xD;
      treatment programs. When SMI interventions have targeted illicit drug dependence the results&#xD;
      have been mixed. While a number of reviews (Dunn, Deroo, Rivera, 2001) and meta-analyses&#xD;
      (Burke, Arkowitz, &amp; Menchola, 2003; Hettema, Steele, &amp; Miller, 2005) have concluded standard&#xD;
      low-dose SMI is effective as preparation for more intensive drug treatment, some studies&#xD;
      contradict these findings (Downey, Rosengren, &amp; Donovan, 2001; Miller, Yahne, Tonigan, 2003;&#xD;
      Winhusen et al., 2008; Mullins, Suerez, Ondersman, Page, 2004; Schneider, Casey, Kohn, 2000).&#xD;
      When effects have been found for drug and co-occurring disorders they have most commonly been&#xD;
      for retention, not substance use (Carroll et al., 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for the proposed study draw from our current successful RCT assessing IMI for MA&#xD;
      dependence. Successful aspects of the current study include achievement of recruitment goals,&#xD;
      strong adherence to the treatment and research protocols, and excellent rates for follow-up&#xD;
      interviews (&gt;90%). The proposed study will take place at the same outpatient treatment&#xD;
      program as the current study, New Leaf Treatment Center in Lafayette, California. Two hundred&#xD;
      and twenty alcohol dependent women will be randomly assigned to IMI or SMI with an attention&#xD;
      component for time equivalence (nutrition education). Participants in both groups will&#xD;
      receive standard group treatment offered at the program. The primary outcomes will be&#xD;
      measures of drinking, heavy drinking (4+ drinks), and severity of alcohol problems assessed&#xD;
      at baseline and 2, 6, and 12 months. Secondary outcomes will include Addiction Severity Index&#xD;
      scales, psychiatric problems, and symptoms of trauma. The study will include standard&#xD;
      quantitative testing of potential mediators, including, the therapeutic alliance,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, motivation, satisfaction, and use of outside services. However, the&#xD;
      application also proposes an innovative use of qualitative procedures to identify&#xD;
      unrecognized factors influencing outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To compare drinking and alcohol problems among women receiving IMI and SMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.1: During the active phase of treatment (weeks 1-9) women in IMI will have fewer&#xD;
      positive breathalyzer screens, drinking days, and heavy drinking days (4+ drinks) than women&#xD;
      in SMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.2: Women in IMI will demonstrate fewer drinking days and heavy drinking days (4+&#xD;
      drinks) and lower scores on the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) Alcohol Scale at 2, 6, and 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To assess potential mediators of drinking and alcohol problems. Hypothesis 2.1:&#xD;
      Measures of retention, therapeutic alliance, social support, and motivation will mediate the&#xD;
      relationship between study condition and drinking outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To Use qualitative interviews to identify additional factors that influence outcome.&#xD;
      Content areas will include perceptions of the therapist, IMI &amp; SMI interventions, the CBT&#xD;
      group, and external influences such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), intimate partners, friends,&#xD;
      and family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aims: 1) To compare IMI and SMI outcomes on ASI scales, psychiatric symptoms, AA&#xD;
      involvement, and trauma symptoms.&#xD;
