  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hydroxytyrosol is peculiar to olives (and, hence, to olive oil) and is being exploited as a&#xD;
      potential supplement or preservative to be employed in the nutraceutical, cosmeceutical, and&#xD;
      food industry. One of the properties described for the hydroxytyrosol is its high antioxidant&#xD;
      activity. Also, hydroxytyrosol is able to modulate several enzymatic activities linked to&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Animal experiments confirm hydroxytyrosol retains its antioxidant&#xD;
      activity once ingested (though the human metabolic pathway has been elucidated and shows&#xD;
      extensive glucuronidation and subsequent urinary excretion), protects from second hand&#xD;
      smoke-induced oxidative damage, inhibits platelet aggregation, ameliorates lipid profile and&#xD;
      decreases atherosclerosis development, increases brain cell resistance to oxidation and&#xD;
      mitochondrial membrane potential Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how&#xD;
      biologically polyphenols protect against degenerative diseases. It is now thought more likely&#xD;
      that some phytochemicals, including polyphenols, are processed by the body as xenobiotics.&#xD;
      They stimulate stress- related cell signalling pathways that result in increased expression&#xD;
      of genes encoding cytoprotective genes. Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) is a transcription&#xD;
      factor which binds to the Antioxidant Response Element (ARE) in cells and thus regulates&#xD;
      enzymes involved in antioxidant functions or detoxification (e.g. thioredoxin reductase-1 and&#xD;
      glutathione peroxidases). Polyphenols might increase gene transcription of Nrf2 mediated by&#xD;
      such response elements. This provides grounds for the theory of hormesis, i.e. when mild&#xD;
      stress triggers defense mechanisms. In the case of polyphenols it indicates how they could&#xD;
      have an indirect antioxidant action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      That is why plans to carry this study to explore the detoxifying potential of hydroxytyrosol&#xD;
      and its effects on Phase II enzyme expression (leading to xenobiotics detoxification in the&#xD;
      liver). It´ll be a randomized crossover, pilot study examining the effects of two doses of&#xD;
      hydroxytyrosol, in the form of a commercially-available raw mixture: 1) providing 5 mg/d; 2)&#xD;
      25 mg/d, for one week with a one-week washout period in between, during 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit 20 healthy volunteers, from within those who participate in&#xD;
      the Genyal Platform studies AT IMDEA-Food Institute.&#xD;

    <description>The analyses of gene expression will be carried out at the ad-hoc platform in use at IMDEA-Food (see www.food.imdea.org for details). Total RNA will be extracted from mononuclear cells with TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA) and purified with RNeasy MiniElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Recovered RNA will be quantified using a Nanodrop ND-1000 v3.5.2 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop TechnologyR, Cambridge, UK). RNA integrity will be assessed using 1.6% agarose gel, 1× TBE. RNA will be judged suitable for array hybridization only if samples exhibited intact bands corresponding to 18S and 28S ribosomal RNAs. During the study blood samples will be obtained from venous puncture and blood samples will be collected in tubes containing EDTA, maintained on ice and rapidly centrifuged to obtain plasma. Plasma will be immediately distributed in aliquots for the different determinations and stored at -70 °C until analysis.</description>
