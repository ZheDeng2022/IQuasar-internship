  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm multi-center pilot trial within the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology&#xD;
      Consortium (PNOC). The current study will use a new treatment approach based on each&#xD;
      patient's tumor genomic profiling consisting of whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing as&#xD;
      well as predictive modeling.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study will test whether patients gain a clinical benefit from such a treatment&#xD;
      approach by comparing overall survival at 12 months (OS12) to historical controls. Newly&#xD;
      diagnosed patients will receive an individualized treatment recommendation including up to&#xD;
      four FDA approved drugs based on the molecular profile of the patient's tumor as determined&#xD;
      by gene expression analysis, Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and predictive modeling, age of the&#xD;
      patient and other existing medical conditions. Initial therapy will consist of standard&#xD;
      radiation therapy per institutional guidelines followed by molecular based therapy with FDA&#xD;
      approved drugs.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria for Newly Diagnosed Patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma&#xD;
        (DIPG):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis: Patients with newly diagnosed DIPG, defined as tumors with a pontine&#xD;
             epicenter and diffuse involvement of the pons who undergo a biopsy are eligible.&#xD;
             Patients with disseminated disease are not eligible, and MRI of the spine must be&#xD;
             performed if disseminated disease is suspected by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Enrollment within 28 days of the date of radiographic diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≤ 25 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky score ≥ 50 for patients ≥ 16 years of age and Lansky score ≥ 50 for patients&#xD;
             ≤15 years of age. Patients who are unable to walk because of paralysis but who are up&#xD;
             in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the&#xD;
             performance score .&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Organ Function Requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate Bone Marrow Function Defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1000/mm 3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm 3 (transfusion independent, defined as not receiving&#xD;
             platelet transfusions for at least 7 days prior to enrollment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dl (can be transfusion dependent)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate Renal Function Defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Creatinine clearance or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 70ml/min/1.73 m 2&#xD;
        OR a serum creatinine within normal limits based on age/gender as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Maximum Serum Creatinine (mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age Male Female 3 to &lt; 6 years 0.8 0.8 6 to &lt; 10 years 1 1 10 to &lt; 13 years 1.2 1.2 13 to &lt;&#xD;

             to study entry and for the duration of study participation, and 30 days after&#xD;
             completion of study drug administration. Should a female become pregnant or suspect&#xD;

             inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol&#xD;
             must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of&#xD;
             study participation, and 30 days after completion of study drug administration&#xD;

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or breast-feeding.&#xD;
             Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine&#xD;
