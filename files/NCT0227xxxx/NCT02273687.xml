  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to show that &quot;diaphragmatic excursion measures upon&#xD;
      emergency admission&quot; (CDA values) on patients with acute respiratory failure are predictive&#xD;
      of the need to use mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-) in the first four hours.&#xD;

      The secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A-determine a prognostic threshold for diaphragmatic excursion measures able to predict the&#xD;
      use of mechanical ventilation (invasive or not) in the first four hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B-to study the association between CDA values and persistence of respiratory distress during&#xD;
      the first 4 hours of care among patients who, at 4 hours, are not mechanically ventilated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C-to study the association between CDA values and respiratory re-exacerbation or a continuing&#xD;
      need for mechanical ventilation during the 24 first hours after admission to the emergency&#xD;
      room D-to study the association between diaphragmatic excursion measures made after initial&#xD;
      emergency care (at 4 hours; =CDH4), and the persistence of respiratory distress at 4 hours,&#xD;
      in patients who at 4 hours are not mechanically ventilated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E-to study the association between CDH4 values and respiratory re-exacerbation during the 24&#xD;
      first hours after admission to the emergency room among patients who, at 4 hours, are not&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated F-to study the association between changes in values of diaphragmatic&#xD;
      excursion measure before and after initial emergency care (CDA → CDH4) and respiratory&#xD;
      re-exacerbation during the 24 first hours after admission to the emergency room among&#xD;
      patients who, at 4 hours, are not mechanically ventilated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G-analyze patient outcomes by subgroup according to diagnosis (decompensated COPD, OAP, lung&#xD;
      disease, asthma, pleural disease).&#xD;

    <description>Diaphragmatic ultrasound will be performed by the physician supporting the patient on arrival and also at 4 hours later in the beginning of therapeutic management. The patient will be monitored for 24 hours following inclusion.&#xD;
The exams will all be done with the same ultrasound system (Vivid S6 GE Ultrasound) and a phased array probe, also called a cardiac probe.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has given informed consent (and signed the consent form) or, in case of an&#xD;
