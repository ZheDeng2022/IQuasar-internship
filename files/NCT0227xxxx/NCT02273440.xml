             (including medication washout)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All volunteers in the study should be healthy males, aged 18-50 years (inclusive) and&#xD;
             willing to use condoms until 60 days after the last dose&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All volunteers should be within +- 20% of their ideal body weight (Metropolitan Scale,&#xD;
             1983)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-smokers (volunteers who have never smoked) or ex-smokers for at least one year&#xD;
             with a smoking history, no greater than five pack-years (1 pack year = 20 cigarettes&#xD;
             per day for one year)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to comply with the concomitant therapy restrictions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers will be off all prescription drugs. O.T.C. drugs must be discontinued for&#xD;
             at least two weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. If throughout the study,&#xD;
             volunteers need any O.T.C. medication, the investigator will call the clinical monitor&#xD;
             and this will be reviewed on a case-by-case bases. Restrictions for different&#xD;
             medications apply&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers will have no evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease based&#xD;
             upon complete medical history, physician global assessment, complete physical&#xD;
             examination, ECG, and clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Viral respiratory tract infection, respiratory tract infection within the six weeks&#xD;
             preceding the first day of dosing with study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Small of difficult to locate arm or hand veins that would impair the clinician's&#xD;
             ability to draw blood samples or to place a venous catheter&#xD;
&#xD;

             years) or who drink more than 60 g of alcohol per day&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of significant allergic reactions to drugs or sensitivity to aspirin or&#xD;
             positive drug screen&#xD;
&#xD;

             (whichever is greater) prior to the first screen at Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donation of blood during the preceding 3 months of Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers receiving hyposensitization therapy whom are not on a stable dose for the&#xD;
             last three months before Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers with known gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular,&#xD;
             metabolic, immunological, or hormonal disorders&#xD;

             psychiatric disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers with known history of orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers with chronic or relevant acute infections&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers with history of allergy/hypersensitivity (including drug allergy) with is&#xD;
             deemed relevant to the trial as judged by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers with eosinophilia &gt; 7%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers who received any other drugs which might influence the results of the trial&#xD;
             during the week previous to the start of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Volunteers who participated in excessive physical activities (e.g. competitive sports)&#xD;
             within the last week before the study&#xD;
