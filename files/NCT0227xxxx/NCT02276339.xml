  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the activity patterns of the peroneal muscle group, in&#xD;
      individuals with a history of chronic ankle instability (CAI) of the ankle injuries compared&#xD;
      with individuals without ankle problems. The study also aims to determine the effect of a&#xD;
      targeted exercise programme on this muscle group in patients with CAI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research on this topic may provide important insight on the roles of these muscles in chronic&#xD;
      ankle instability and investigate whether specific strengthening programmes are effective in&#xD;
      this complex patient category.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of the peroneus brevis (PB) and peroneus&#xD;
      longus (PL) muscles in patients with chronic ankle instability and to determine whether an&#xD;
      eccentric- concentric focused training intervention has an effect on these muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be recruited from Orthopaedic Clinics and the Musculoskeletal Assessment&#xD;
      Clinics in St. Vincent's University Hospital. Posters and information leaflets will be&#xD;
      supplied to areas where volunteers are being sought. A study information sheet will be given&#xD;
      to the patient and written consent will be obtained prior to commencing the investigative&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria The selection criteria for chronic ankle instability (CAI) patients will&#xD;
      be based on the position statement of the International Ankle Consortium (Gribble et al.&#xD;
      2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A history of at least 1 significant ankle sprain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A history of the previously injured ankle joint &quot;giving way&quot;, and/or recurrent sprain,&#xD;
           and/or &quot;feelings of instability&quot;. Self-reported ankle instability confirmed with&#xD;
           validated ankle instability-specific questionnaire: The Cumberland Ankle Instability&#xD;
           Tool (CAIT). CAIT is a simple, valid, and reliable tool to measure severity of&#xD;
           functional ankle instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A general self-reported foot and ankle function questionnaire is also completed. The&#xD;
           Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM): The FAAM is a reliable, responsive, and valid&#xD;
           measure of physical function for individuals with a broad range of musculoskeletal&#xD;
           disorders of the lower leg, foot, and ankle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute injury to musculoskeletal structures of other joints of the lower extremity in the&#xD;
           previous 3 months that impacted joint integrity and function (ie, sprains, fractures),&#xD;
           resulting in at least 1 interrupted day of desired physical activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any Neurological problem that would affect muscle function of the lower limb&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant Women&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants under 18 and over 65 Controls&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy Volunteers (Control) will be age and sex matched to their CAI variants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Will have no previous history of significant ankle sprain, which interrupted desired&#xD;
           physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAI patients will then be referred on for two radiological examinations in St. Vincent's&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital to aid diagnosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A diagnostic ultrasound will be performed by Dr. Eric Heffernan to look at peroneal&#xD;
           tendon pathology and ligament character (thickening and continuity).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Stress Fluoroscopy (Anterior Drawer and Talar Tilt) will be performed by Professor&#xD;
           Robert Flavin to assess for biplanar instability and to out rule subtalar instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both participants with CAI and participants without ankle instability will undergo Surface&#xD;
      electromyography (S-EMG) assessment of the PL, PB and Tibialis Anterior (TA) in both static&#xD;
      and dynamic conditions in the University College Dublin School of Public Health,&#xD;
      Physiotherapy &amp; Population science (SPHPPS) motion analysis laboratory (This assessment&#xD;
      process will initially be piloted on a healthy volunteer) Muscle onset will be determined and&#xD;
      S-EMG will also normalized to Max Voluntary Contraction (MVC) determining the magnitude of&#xD;
      activation, during Single leg Stance, wobble-board standing, walking, calf-raise exercise,&#xD;
      tip-toe walking, jogging and a jump-landing task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kinematic variables (degrees of movement and speed) will also be re-coded using CODA motion&#xD;
      capture system during the movement tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be performing the functional tests on a force platform to allow for&#xD;
      assessment of kinetic variables measuring ground reaction force and measures of postural&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following S-EMG testing the CAI subjects will commence a six-week eccentric-concentric&#xD;
      focused exercise programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise intervention will consist of an individual home-based progressive&#xD;
      eccentric-concentric strengthening programme. Patients will be reviewed every two weeks&#xD;
      during their rehabilitation; exercises will be progressed accordingly by their&#xD;
      physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be supplied with exercise diaries to assist with adherence to the exercise&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the six-week programme they will undergo repeat S-EMG testing and complete the&#xD;
      self-reported ankle questionnaires used at pre-test phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If using a power level of 80% and 5% significance, a sample size of 13 participants for each&#xD;
      study group would be required for this study. To allow for a 23% dropout rate we will aim to&#xD;
      recruit 16 patients to each group.&#xD;
