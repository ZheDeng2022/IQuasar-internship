    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if researchers can successfully and&#xD;
      safely give patients who have had a stem cell transplant an infusion of white blood cells&#xD;
      (called T-cells) that have been collected from an unrelated person, and that have been&#xD;
      genetically changed. The process of changing the DNA (genetic material) of these T-cells is&#xD;
      called &quot;gene transfer.&quot; The gene transfer involves drawing blood from an unrelated donor,&#xD;
      separating out T cells using a machine, changing the cells' DNA in the laboratory, and&#xD;
      returning the genetically changed cells back to the body. T-cells are a type of white blood&#xD;
      cell that fight infection. The type of gene transfer being used in this study is designed to&#xD;
      help your T-cells to better fight cancer by targeting a chemical marker that is found on&#xD;
      certain cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn if these genetically-changed T-cells can help to control B-cell&#xD;
      leukemia or lymphoma after a stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers want to find out the highest tolerable dose of these T-cells that can be given to&#xD;
      patients with relapsed leukemia or lymphoma.&#xD;

      Study Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has 2 steps: chemotherapy and gene transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chemotherapy combination in this study (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide) is given to try&#xD;
      to help the T-cells work better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, the participant will&#xD;
      be assigned to a dose level of T-cells based on when the participant joined this study. The&#xD;
      first group of 3 participants will receive the lowest dose of T-cells. Each new group will&#xD;
      receive a higher dose of T-cells than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects&#xD;
      were seen. Up to 6 dose levels of T-cells will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy and Gene Transfer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day -8 (8 days before the T-cell infusion) and Day -7, the participant will receive&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide by vein over about 4 hours. the participant will receive mesna by vein&#xD;
           over 30 minutes every 4 hours to lower the risk of bleeding in the bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day -6 through Day -2, the participant will receive fludarabine 1 time a day by vein&#xD;
           over about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sometime between 2-7 days after chemotherapy ends, the participant will receive the T cell&#xD;
      infusion by vein over 15-30 minutes. The infusion will be divided into 2 parts at least 24&#xD;
      hours apart. During and after the infusion, your vital signs will be checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the participant will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. the&#xD;
      participant may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their&#xD;
      risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the doctor thinks it is needed based on the status of the disease, the participant may&#xD;
      receive up to 2 more courses of this study therapy given at least 6 weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      the participant will be in the hospital from Day -8 through 2 days after the stem cell&#xD;
      transplant. Every day while you are in the hospital, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn&#xD;
      for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 1 week before the T-cell infusion, the following tests and procedures will be&#xD;
      performed. These tests will not be repeated again if the T-cell infusion is repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the participant's medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the participant will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This routine blood draw&#xD;
           will include a pregnancy test if the participant is able to become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part of the blood drawn for routine tests will also be used to test for antibodies the&#xD;
           participant may develop against the mouse antibodies that are used in the gene transfer&#xD;
           process. These antibodies are called human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA). If your body&#xD;
           becomes immune to these proteins, the participant may develop HAMA. The results of this&#xD;
           HAMA test will be used to compare against a sample of your blood collected after the&#xD;
           transplant is complete, to make sure the participant have not developed an immune system&#xD;
           reaction against these mouse protein antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the participant will have a chest x-ray to check for pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the participant will have an ECG to check your heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the T-cell infusion and up to 2 times within 24 hours after the T-cell infusion, blood&#xD;
      (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn to measure your body's response to the T cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within about 12 hours, 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks after the T-cell infusion, the following&#xD;
      tests and procedures will be performed. These tests will be repeated again if the T-cell&#xD;
      infusion is repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the participant's medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the participant will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the physical exam, you will be checked for possible reactions to the study&#xD;
           therapy, such as graft versus host disease (GVHD). GVHD occurs when the donor cells&#xD;
           attack the cells of the recipient's body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the participant will be asked about any side effects you may have had.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and for research to look for&#xD;
           the genetically changed T-cells and to count the number of B-cells (other white blood&#xD;
           cells) and other non-changed T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 3 times during the first 7 days after the T-cell infusion, blood (about 4 tablespoons)&#xD;
      will be drawn to measure your body's response to the T cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 2 weeks during the first month, then 1 time a month until 1 year after the T-cell&#xD;
      infusion, blood (2 teaspoons) will be drawn for tests of your immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At about 6 weeks, and then 1, 2, and 3 months after the T-cell infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the participant's medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the participant will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the participant will be checked for possible reactions to the study therapy, such as&#xD;
           GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the participant will be asked about any side effects you may have had.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At about 3 months after the T-cell infusion, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check&#xD;
      for HAMA, and you will have breathing tests to check your lung function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 1 time during the 3 months after the T-cell infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the participant will have a PET-CT scan and/or a CT scan to check the status of the&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have other tests and procedures to check&#xD;
           your health, such as a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the disease comes back or a side effect occurs during the 12 months after the T-cell&#xD;
      infusion, you may be asked to return for additional follow-up visits if the doctor thinks it&#xD;
      is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      the participant may receive up to 3 courses of study therapy. the participant will no longer&#xD;
      be able to receive the study therapy if the disease gets worse, if infections or intolerable&#xD;
      side effects occur, or if the participant is unable to follow study directions. the&#xD;
      participant may withdraw from the study at any time, but the infusion of the T cells is not&#xD;
      necessarily reversible and these types of products have the potential for long-term survival&#xD;
      in the body. If the participant withdraw from the study it will only include withdrawal from&#xD;
      any procedures specifically preformed for this protocol and long-term follow-up. Please note,&#xD;
      long-term follow-up is important for your safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over once the participant have completed the&#xD;
      follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For safety reasons, the FDA requires patients receiving gene transfer to have long-term&#xD;
      follow-up for at least 15 years after receiving the gene transfer. The participant will be&#xD;
      asked to sign a separate consent form (Protocol 2006-0676) for long-term follow up that&#xD;
      begins 1 year after this study ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The chemotherapy drugs in this study are commercially&#xD;
      available and FDA approved for the treatment of B-cell leukemia or lymphoma. The gene&#xD;
      transfer (infusion with genetically modified T-cells) is not commercially available or FDA&#xD;
      approved. It is currently being used for research purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 42 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
