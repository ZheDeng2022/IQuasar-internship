      The global prevalence of dementia is close to 36 million (2010). Furthermore the number is&#xD;

      Introduction Dementia The estimated prevalence of dementia in Denmark is 85.000 (2011) and&#xD;
      the global prevalence is close to 36 million (2010). Furthermore the number is predicted to&#xD;
      double in the next 20 years, primarily due to the demographic ageing. The costs of dementia&#xD;
      accounts for 1% of the world's GDP - a perspective that will challenge the current healthcare&#xD;
      systems and national economies (1,2,3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dementia includes a number of progressive degenerative brain diseases. Dementia is&#xD;
      characterized by progressive deterioration in cognition, function and behavior that is&#xD;
      sufficiently severe to compromise social and occupational functioning. Dementia is&#xD;
      characterized by loss of episodic memory, difficulty in naming and word finding, apraxia,&#xD;
      executive dysfunction and changes in personality and mood. The most common cause of dementia&#xD;
      is Alzheimer's disease (4, 5, 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of Alzheimer dementia remains elusive. For many years the pathophysiological&#xD;
      hallmark of Alzheimers dementia has been the toxicity caused by the accumulation of the&#xD;
      proteins amyloid-beta in plaques and phosphorylated tau associated with neurofibrillary&#xD;
      tangles. However, this theory is based on the genetic &quot;early-onset familial Alzheimers&quot;,&#xD;
      which is a less frequent inherited type. Currently, the hypotheses on the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      Alzheimer actually disagree with that of the amyloid-beta theory. Thus, there is a need to&#xD;
      increase our understanding of the mechanisms leading to the most common forms of Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease. A better understanding of the disease may enable an earlier diagnosis and&#xD;
      importantly, a causal treatment of Alzheimer as opposed to the merely symptomatic options&#xD;
      available to day (4, 7, 8, 9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IGF-system One of the main areas of recent research in dementia is the role of neurotrophic&#xD;
      support, a research area which embraces insulin and the insulin-like growth factor system.&#xD;
      Insulin and the IGF system are important in normal somatic growth, development, tissue repair&#xD;
      and regeneration throughout life. Earlier studies have indicated that impairments in cerebral&#xD;
      glucose utilization and energy metabolism represent very early abnormalities that precede or&#xD;
      accompany the initial stages of cognitive impairment. However, type 2 diabetes, which is&#xD;
      often characterized by insulin resistance, has not been established as a cause of Alzheimer&#xD;
      although there is a correlation between insulin resistance and cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cellular signaling pathways of IGF-I and IGF-II overlap to a great extent with the&#xD;
      pathways used by insulin, and all three proteins bind to the same receptors though with&#xD;
      different affinities. Several studies have shown that the ratio between the concentrations of&#xD;
      IGF-I in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma (the CSF/plasma ratio) is reduced in Alzheimer&#xD;
      patients. Interestingly, IGF-I seems to promote amyloid-beta clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IGF-II has been less studied but it is expressed in the brain both during development and in&#xD;
      adulthood and declines with ageing. In the brain the relative concentration is highest in the&#xD;
      hippocampus. (10-14). Furthermore, our group has novel data indicating that in CSF, IGF-II is&#xD;
      the most important growth factor when it comes to activating the IGF-I receptor (Mia-Maiken&#xD;
      Kallestrup et al., manuscript in preparation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Memory Memory is a question of consolidation whereby newly learned labile information becomes&#xD;
      stronger and resilient to disruption. This process depends on de novo RNA and protein&#xD;
      synthesis and the function of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and the CCAAT&#xD;
      enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), both of which are transcription factors. Former studies&#xD;
      have shown that there is a binding site for C/EBP in the promoter region of the IGF-II gene&#xD;
      in liver and other tissues (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IGF-II and memory To solve the puzzle of dementia it is important to explain early changes in&#xD;
      biomarkers in early stages of dementia and thereby possibly reveal the pathogenesis and&#xD;
      possible treatments. An experiment with rats and memory might already have taken the first&#xD;
      step towards this. It has been demonstrated that administration of IGF-II to rats&#xD;
      significantly enhances memory retention and prevents forgetting. Furthermore inhibitory&#xD;
      avoidance learning (a paradigm in which the subject learns to associate a particular context&#xD;
      with the occurrence) leads to an increase in the hippocampal expression of IGF-II. Finally,&#xD;
      yet importantly, injections of recombinant IGF-II into hippocampus after training or memory&#xD;
      retrieval significantly enhance memory retention and prevent forgetting (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurotrophic growth factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human adult brain is able to generate new neurons even though it has a limited capacity.&#xD;
      Possibly this capacity depends on sufficient neurotrophic growth factors. The neurotrophic&#xD;
      factors include nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BDNF is important in neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity and memory, which along with the&#xD;
      tendency of increased levels of BDNF in early stages of Alzheimer's indicate a connection.&#xD;
      The increase of BDNF in early stages of Alzheimer's could be a reflection of compensation for&#xD;
      the neurodegeneration. During the progression of Alzheimer's the level of BDNF is decreasing&#xD;
      to a level of healthy elderly people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NGF induces growth of neurons and maintains neuron proliferation interacting with other&#xD;
      growth factors. Levels of NGF in serum, CSF or brain do not seem to differ from Alzheimer's&#xD;
      patients to normal elderly patients but seem to vary between different brain regions. Finally&#xD;
      the expression pattern of BDNF and NGF highly correlates with amyloid concentration (15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cluster of differentiation 163(CD-163) CD-163 is a scavenger receptor, which recognizes and&#xD;
      uptakes macromolecules for the hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex and its levels in an indication&#xD;
      of monocyte-macrophage activation. The soluble form of the receptor is called sCD163 and is&#xD;
      found in plasma. Plasma sCD163 levels are up-regulated in a large range of inflammatory&#xD;
      diseases (16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Patients with dementia have a deregulated concentration and/or activity of IGF-I,&#xD;
      IGF-II, NGF, BDNF and sCD-163 in cerebrospinal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose To define the concentration and biological activity of IGF-I, IGF-II, BDNF, NGF and&#xD;
      sCD-163 in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum in patients with Alzheimer's compared with&#xD;
      controls (patients with unspecified neurological symptoms or disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Study population All participating patients must be over the age of 18 years old. They&#xD;
      are excluded from the study in case of acute bacterial neuro infection and acute bleeding The&#xD;
      study population of this project will include all patients with established or suspected&#xD;
      dementia, who will undergo a lumbar puncture at the Department of Neurology at Aarhus&#xD;
      University Hospital as part of their diagnostic work-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controls include patients with unspecified neurological symptoms or diseases who will undergo&#xD;
      a lumbar puncture at the Department of Neurology at Aarhus University Hospital as part of&#xD;
      their diagnostic work-up irrespective of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will receive information about the research project and will be asked to give&#xD;
      their content to participation. The participation implies extraction of 2-3 ml extra of&#xD;
      spinal fluid and an extra blood sample(10ml), which will be used for analysis of IGF system&#xD;
      components and neurotrophic factors. Participants will not receive any form of payment, but&#xD;
      can receive compensation for transportation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all times during the diagnostic work-up and consequently in the research project we will&#xD;
      take the patients mental and physical condition into consideration. The research project will&#xD;
      be carried out according to the Act on Processing of Personal Data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Department of Neurology at Aarhus University Hospital, the Dementia Clinic use lumbar&#xD;
      puncture as a diagnostic tool in approximately three patients per week. It is estimated that&#xD;
      about 1/3 to 1/2 of these patients will end up with the diagnosis Alzheimer and these&#xD;
      patients will ultimately be included in the project during a period of 36-40 weeks. Overall&#xD;
      during the study period this will enable inclusion of 50-60 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis The spinal fluid and the serum will be analysed at the Medical Research Laboratory.&#xD;
      The spinal fluid and blood samples will be deposited in a research biobank at Aarhus&#xD;
      University Hospital. The plan is to carry out all the biochemical analyses at the same time&#xD;
      when all samples are collected. In case of knew knowledge in the field we intend to deposit&#xD;
      the samples for 5 years after this project. If the samples are to be used for another project&#xD;
      The National Committee on Health Research Ethics and the Danish Data Protection Agency will&#xD;
      demand an application once more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immunological concentrations of IGF-I and IGF-II are measured by validated in-house&#xD;
      analyses. Furthermore, Aarhus University Hospital has a unique technique, whereby it is&#xD;
      possible to measure the bioactivity of IGF-I and -II in the cerebrospinal fluid. The&#xD;
      technique is based on a cell-based in-house bioassay developed in 2003. This method takes in&#xD;
      to account that a large part of the IGF-I and IGF-II is bound to proteins and thereby to be&#xD;
      considered biological inactive. The bioassay is able to measure the ability of both serum and&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid to stimulate IGF-IR in vitro which makes the method much more specific.&#xD;
      Pilot investigations from our group have shown that it is possible to measure the biological&#xD;
      IGF-IR activity in cerebrospinal fluid. It has been proven that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) The biological IGF in vitro activity of cerebrospinal fluid primarily comes from IGF-II&#xD;
      ii) The biological activity is far higher than expected as compared to simple measures of&#xD;
      concentration owing to the low concentrations of IGF-binding proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immunological concentrations of the IGF-binding proteins will be measured by commercial&#xD;
      or in-house developed immunoassays and ligand blotting techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concentrations of NGF, BDNF and sCD-163 in spinal fluid and serum will be analysed by&#xD;
      already established techniques and the spinal fluid will be examined with spectrometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examination The clinical examination will be performed as a natural part of the&#xD;
      examination of dementia. This includes medical history and an objective examination, CT scan&#xD;
      and cognitive tests including MMSE (mini-mental state examination) and ACE (Adenbrooke´s&#xD;
      Cognitive Examination). In the case of doubt a more extended examination will be performed by&#xD;
      a neurophysiologist. Information from the clinical examination in form of medical record will&#xD;
      be used to evaluate the possibility of dementia as diagnosis including the progression of the&#xD;
      disease and thereby to evaluate the possible deregulated concentrations and/or activities of&#xD;
      IGF-I, IGF-II, NGF, BDNF and sCD-163 in cerebrospinal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power The bioactivity of IGF in cerebrospinal fluid in patients with dementia have not&#xD;
      earlier been determined. Pilot data indicate that bioactivity from IGF-II in healthy&#xD;
      people(n= 9) is 57 ± 13 ng/ml(mean ± SD). If the difference in a patient group is set to&#xD;
      26ng/ml ( ̴ 2 x SD) then inclusion of 10 persons per group give the project a power of 90% by&#xD;
      use of ANOVA and a significant level of 5 %. It has therefore been chosen to include 15&#xD;
      patients in the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic The program ANOVA will be used for statistical analyses. Parametric or&#xD;
      non-parametric tests will be used depending of the normal distribution of data. In all&#xD;
      statistical analysis a 5% level of significance will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective As earlier mentioned the costs of dementia already account for 1% of the world's&#xD;
      GDP and the prevalence of dementia is expected to double within the next twenty years. The&#xD;
      progressive nature of the disease means that estimated 43% of cases with dementia need a high&#xD;
      level of care (equivalent to a nursing home). Therefore, it is obvious that prevention,&#xD;
      delayed onset, slowed progression and potential curability are crucial factors for not only&#xD;
      the well-being of patients and relatives but also for the economy of the health care systems.&#xD;
      (2,17) This research project is based on the recent theory of dementia as a disease in the&#xD;
      IGF-system, but as opposed to other studies we are able to measure concentrations as well as&#xD;
      bioactivity. This will potentially open up for further knowledge about the dynamic of&#xD;
      dementia and thereby potentially reveal further understanding of the pathogenesis and medical&#xD;
      targets of dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical consideration Ethical considerations in general The tests performed on the patients&#xD;
      involved in this research project are lumbar puncture and blood samples. Both of these tests&#xD;
      will be performed as part of the diagnostic workup irrespective of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It involves some risks to perform a lumbar puncture, which include post lumbar puncture&#xD;
      headache with a incidence of 12 %, but is most common in younger patients. Most frequently,&#xD;
      the headache has a short duration and it may be cured with application of a blood-patch. The&#xD;
      use of a needle to the lumbar puncture can cause temporary lumbar pain and an accumulation&#xD;
      Ethical considerations for patients with dementia The concerned patient group causes an&#xD;
      extended ethical consideration. As mentioned earlier the symptoms of dementia causes memory&#xD;
      loss, difficulty in finding the right words and understanding what people are saying. As such&#xD;
      it is questionable whether the patients are able to make an independent decision on whether&#xD;
      to participate in the project (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the dementia patients will have all the tests performed as part of the standard&#xD;
      diagnostic work up for dementia. Therefore this study does not introduce any additional&#xD;
      investigation defending the ethical aspect of this study. In consideration of the low risk&#xD;
      involved in this project, the mild dementia forms and the high prevalence and seriousness of&#xD;
      the disease we evaluate this project to be ethically acceptable. Furthermore it is of great&#xD;
      importance to examine the pathogenesis and possible targets of dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim Positive, negative as well as inconclusive results from this study will be published. The&#xD;
      results will be the foundation of a research year report and an article for publication in an&#xD;
      English written peer reviewed journal.&#xD;
