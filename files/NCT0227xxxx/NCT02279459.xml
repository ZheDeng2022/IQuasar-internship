  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to utilize dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) to investigate&#xD;
      changes in tumor iodine concentration in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas&#xD;
      (HNSCC). Dual-energy computerized tomography could easily replace a standard CT neck with the&#xD;
      added benefit of providing functional information that would only be possible with advanced&#xD;
      computerized tomography perfusion, magnetic resonance diffusion (MRI) or positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) imaging techniques.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with head and/or neck tumors routinely have head and neck imaging completed with a&#xD;
      computerized tomography scan, commonly called a CT scan. A CT scan combines a series of x-ray&#xD;
      views that are taken from many different angles and uses computer processing to create&#xD;
      cross-sectional images inside your body. These cross-sectional images are very thin slices,&#xD;
      often less than 1 mm thick and allow the radiologist to examine parts of your tissue very&#xD;
      closely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dual energy computed tomography (DECT) is a fairly new technology that uses both the normal&#xD;
      x-ray and also a second less powerful x-ray to make the images. The Ottawa Hospital has&#xD;
      scanners in use that are able to take the images that oncologists typically order for&#xD;
      patients and can also be set to obtain DECT images at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether DECT images can provide helpful&#xD;
      information to better predict how the tumor will respond to treatment and the likely course&#xD;
      of head and neck tumors.&#xD;

    <description>Patients head and neck CT scans performed as standard of care done prior to radiation treatment and approximately 12 weeks following treatment, will be acquired in the dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) mode. Participants will have one additional scan, also in the DECT mode, 2 to 3 weeks after the start of their radiation treatment.</description>
