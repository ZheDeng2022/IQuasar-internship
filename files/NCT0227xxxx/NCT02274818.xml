  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a cluster randomized trial in a sample of 63 internal&#xD;
      medicine (IM) training programs that are randomly assigned to either the current duty hour&#xD;
      standards or less restricted flexible duty hour standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial includes a main protocol in which all randomized IM programs participate and two&#xD;
      substudies. &quot;Time and Motion&quot; and &quot;Sleep and Alertness&quot;, each conducted at a subset of IM&#xD;
      programs and focusing on more detailed data collection at the intern level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main protocol will examine patient safety and costs as well as quality of education. The&#xD;
      &quot;Time and Motion&quot; substudy examines additional educational outcomes. The &quot;Sleep and&#xD;
      Alertness&quot; substudy examines intern sleep time and alertness.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current internal medicine program in the United States Continued Accreditation status&#xD;
             with the ACGME - Program director agrees to:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Randomization to one of the two study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Develop, and share with the study team, institutional duty hour schedules and&#xD;
                  regulatory policies/procedures that will ensure adherence to, and enforcement of,&#xD;
                  the duty hour regulations that apply to their study arm&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Allow access and analysis of de-identified resident duty hour adherence&#xD;
                  data/logs, call schedules, and rotation schedules to the Study Team.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Participate, and encourage trainee participation at your institution, in&#xD;
                  beginning and end of year iCOMPARE surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The investigators excluded 119 programs that comprise the bottom 50% in&#xD;
             resident-to-bed ratio and the bottom 25% in patient volume related to the diagnoses by&#xD;
             which the patient population will be selected for evaluation of safety outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Within the 260 programs that remain, the investigators excluded the 65 in the lowest&#xD;
             quartile of program size to ensure we can feasibly obtain sufficient trainee&#xD;
             measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The 195 remaining programs are eligible for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The investigators have also excluded children and VA hospitals.&#xD;
