  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone and muscle losses occur during ageing leading to increased risk of osteoporosis (there&#xD;
      are more than 200 million people affected by osteoporosis worldwide), sarcopenia, loss of&#xD;
      functionality and mobility. From around 45-50 years onwards, there is a progressive loss of&#xD;
      muscle mass and strength (sarcopenia). This is partially due to an impairment of muscle&#xD;
      protein synthesis in response to dietary proteins. Insufficient dietary protein may&#xD;
      contribute to age-related loss of lean body mass (LBM) and strength which ultimately affects&#xD;
      body movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key ingredients in selected investigational product are:Milk proteins, Calcium, Vitamin D,&#xD;
      Vitamin C, Glucosamine Sulfate, Zinc. They have effects to improve physical mobility and&#xD;
      functionality. The investigators expect improved effects of a nutritional intervention&#xD;
      combined with a physical activity program on mobility in healthy aging subjects with joint&#xD;
      discomfort.&#xD;
