      The purpose of the study is to find out if the small dose of radioiodine, that is used for&#xD;
      the dosimetry study on patients with differentiated thyroid cancer, may stun the cancer cells&#xD;
      and make the thyroid cancer treatment less effective.&#xD;

      This study plans to learn more about a medical problem called thyroid stunning. Thyroid&#xD;
      stunning is a temporary decrease in the function of thyroid cells after small doses of&#xD;
      radioiodine, a radioactive drug that is commonly used to treat thyroid cancer. Thyroid&#xD;
      stunning can be an important medical problem in patients who have thyroid cancer that has&#xD;
      spread beyond the thyroid gland (metastases). In patients with thyroid cancer metastases,&#xD;
      some researchers believe it is good to give the maximum safe dose of radioiodine in order to&#xD;
      have the greatest chance of destroying the cancer. The maximum safe dose is the highest dose&#xD;
      of radioiodine that a patient can safely receive, and this dose is unique to each person.&#xD;
      This special personalized dose is determined by first doing a dosimetry study. Dosimetry&#xD;
      study is a planning study that calculates the safest dose that the patient can receive.&#xD;
      Currently, it is not known whether the small dose of radioiodine that is used for the&#xD;
      dosimetry study may stun the cancer cells and make the thyroid cancer treatment less&#xD;
      effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two important types of radioiodine. I-123 is a form of radioiodine that is used to&#xD;
      take pictures of the thyroid gland. I-131 is a form of radioiodine that is used to treat&#xD;
      thyroid cancer. It is hoped that this study will produce important information that may be&#xD;
      the first step in resolving the thyroid stunning question. Investigators will use I-123, a&#xD;
      form of iodine that is currently not known to cause thyroid stunning, before thyroid cancer&#xD;
      treatment with I-131. Investigators will try to prove that I-123 does not cause thyroid&#xD;
      stunning and does not make the thyroid cancer treatment less effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are being asked to be in this research study because they have differentiated&#xD;
      thyroid cancer, and they have no evidence of thyroid cancer that has spread to the other&#xD;
      parts of their body. As a result, those patients thyroid cancer treatment with radioiodine&#xD;
      will be a smaller amount than what is needed to treat patients with thyroid cancer that has&#xD;
      spread to other parts of the body. Thyroid stunning is not a medical problem for patients&#xD;
      like these. However, by participating in this study, the information investigators gather&#xD;
      from those patients treatment of thyroid cancer may help those patients with thyroid cancer&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;

    <description>All patients will receive one extra imaging scan with I-123 in addition to their routine care as described above. This research portion of their care will be similar to the scan that they undergo for the I-123 planning scan that is already a part of their routine care. The research study, which will be performed in the middle of the patient's normal standard of care treatment, will take 4 days.&#xD;
On days 1 and 2, all patients will receive a intramuscular injection of rhTSH (Thyrogen).&#xD;
On day 3, all patients will be given 3 mCi of I-123 in the form of a pill to take by mouth.&#xD;
On day 4, all patients will receive a I-123 Whole Body Imaging Scan and a thyroid camera scan of the neck and thigh.</description>
