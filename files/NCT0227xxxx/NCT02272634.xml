    <measure>Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Screen) to Day 55</time_frame>
    <description>Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is the amount of air that can be exhaled in one second. FEV1 is measured by spirometry performed at approximately the same time of day on each visit to avoid diurnal variation. A positive change from baseline in FEV1 indicates improvement in lung function.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Inspiratory Capacity (IC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Screening) to Day 55</time_frame>
    <description>Inspiratory capacity (IC) is the maximum volume of air that can be inhaled into the lungs from the normal resting position after breathing out normally. IC is measured by spirometry performed at approximately the same time of day on each visit to avoid diurnal variation.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second/Forced Vital Capacity (FEV1/FVC) Ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 55</time_frame>
    <description>The ratio is calculated as the amount of air expelled from the lungs in one second after a full inspiration (FEV1) divided by the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out after a full inspiration (FVC).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) Focal Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 55</time_frame>
    <description>Dyspnea at baseline (Day -1) will be assessed with the Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI). This instrument has 3 domains (functional impairment, magnitude of task and magnitude of effort) with the values added for a combined focal score. Functional impairment determines the impact of breathlessness on the ability to carry out activities; magnitude of task determines the type of task that causes breathlessness, magnitude of effort establishes the level of effort that results in breathlessness. The BDI scores range from 0 (very severe impairment) to 4 (no impairment) for each domain with the baseline focal score consisting of the sum of each domain (0 to 12). Dyspnea throughout the study will be performed at the time points. The change from baseline is measured by the Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) score which ranges from -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement) for each domain with the TDI focal score consisting in the sum of each domain (-9 to +9).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Assessment Test (CAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 55</time_frame>
    <description>The chronic obstructive pulmonary disease assessment test (CAT) is a short and simple questionnaire of 8 items completed by patients to be performed at the time points. Scores for each of the 8 items are summed to give a single, final score ranging from 0 (no impact on daily activities) to 40 (very high impact on daily activity).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Dyspnea (Modified Borg Dyspnea Scale)</title>
        <description>Severity level of patient's dyspnea is accessed via the modified Borg dyspnea scale programmed within the e-diary. The modified Borg dyspnea scale is a self-administered categorical scale with a score from 0 to 10, where 0 (as a measure of dyspnea) corresponds to the sensation of normal breathing (absence of dyspnea) and 10 corresponds to the patient's maximum possible sensation of dyspnea.</description>

        <title>Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) Focal Score</title>
        <description>Dyspnea at baseline (Day -1) will be assessed with the Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI). This instrument has 3 domains (functional impairment, magnitude of task and magnitude of effort) with the values added for a combined focal score. Functional impairment determines the impact of breathlessness on the ability to carry out activities; magnitude of task determines the type of task that causes breathlessness, magnitude of effort establishes the level of effort that results in breathlessness. The BDI scores range from 0 (very severe impairment) to 4 (no impairment) for each domain with the baseline focal score consisting of the sum of each domain (0 to 12). Dyspnea throughout the study will be performed at the time points. The change from baseline is measured by the Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) score which ranges from -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement) for each domain with the TDI focal score consisting in the sum of each domain (-9 to +9).</description>

          <title>Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) Focal Score</title>
          <description>Dyspnea at baseline (Day -1) will be assessed with the Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI). This instrument has 3 domains (functional impairment, magnitude of task and magnitude of effort) with the values added for a combined focal score. Functional impairment determines the impact of breathlessness on the ability to carry out activities; magnitude of task determines the type of task that causes breathlessness, magnitude of effort establishes the level of effort that results in breathlessness. The BDI scores range from 0 (very severe impairment) to 4 (no impairment) for each domain with the baseline focal score consisting of the sum of each domain (0 to 12). Dyspnea throughout the study will be performed at the time points. The change from baseline is measured by the Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) score which ranges from -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement) for each domain with the TDI focal score consisting in the sum of each domain (-9 to +9).</description>

          <description>The blood samples are collected at the the time points of the study for pharmacodynamics (PD) assessments of biomarkers. The blood samples are analyzed for concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-13, MCP-1, and MMP-9. Baseline is Day 1 predose measurement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)</title>
        <description>Forced vital capacity (FVC) is the volume of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. FVC is measured by spirometry performed at approximately the same time of day on each visit to avoid diurnal variation. A positive change from baseline in FVC indicates improvement in lung function.</description>
