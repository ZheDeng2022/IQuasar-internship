  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this observational study, a motion monitoring system including body-worn sensors,&#xD;
      communication portals, data capture system, and algorithms will be tested with geriatric&#xD;
      patients in Garrison Geriatric Education and Care Center (Lubbock, TX). The study is part of&#xD;
      a long-term effort to improve the quality of life and safety of geriatric patients by using&#xD;
      autonomous systems that can alert care givers of mobility issues and falls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medical monitoring systems have become an important area of research and development due to&#xD;
      the possibility of allowing improved quality of life and care while reducing overall medical&#xD;
      costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is significant because it will allow researchers to understand the efficacy of the&#xD;
      autonomous sensor system used with actual residents of a geriatric care center. This study is&#xD;
      one of the first attempts to monitor movements of geriatric residents as they go about their&#xD;
      activities of daily living. This type of system has the potential to improve the quality of&#xD;
      life and safety of geriatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of autonomous patient monitoring technologies that will eventually improve&#xD;
      the quality of life and safety of patients in geriatric care facilities and other&#xD;
      environments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the performance and usability of the wearable sensor system in a geriatric care&#xD;
      facility with actual residents going about their daily lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine performance of motion data collect ion system for monitoring geriatric&#xD;
           residents as they go about their daily life in a geriatric center&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine tolerability of wearing sensors by geriatric residents&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Understand how medical staff interacts with monitored residents and the sensor devices&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine if the sensor system's algorithms can identify falls&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Analyze the motion data generated by the system to determine system performance. The&#xD;
           list of performance metrics will include: (a) system up-time, (b) continuity of data&#xD;
           collection (c) sensor device failure rate, (d) sensor device battery life (e)&#xD;
           simultaneous collection of data when multiple monitored residents are in the same&#xD;
           localized area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the tolerability of wearing the devices over the course of a day using a survey&#xD;
           administered to residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the usability of the sensor system using a survey administered to care givers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Compare events flagged as falls by system algorithms with the fall log produced by&#xD;
           Garrison staff, cross-verified against personal fall logs, to determine the ability of&#xD;
           the system to detect falls.&#xD;
