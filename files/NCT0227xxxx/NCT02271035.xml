  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is the most common urologic diagnosis in neonates estimated at 1%&#xD;
      of newborns, and 30-45% of the children who present with urinary tract infection (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional treatments of children with VUR include conservative therapy with or without&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotics, and endoscopic, laparoscopic, or open surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an endoscopic technique, the injecting needle is inserted through the working channel of&#xD;
      the cystoscope. The procedure is relatively short and is performed as out-patient surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2000, Dextranomer/Hyaluronic acid (DefluxR) was approved by the FDA, and subsequently has&#xD;
      become the treatment of choice in VUR grades 2-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2004, the hydrodistention-implantation technique (HIT) was introduced by Kirsch. HIT&#xD;
      involves the use of a pressurized stream of fluid directed into the ureter to aid&#xD;
      visualization, and injection into the submucosa within the ureteric tunnel to improve&#xD;
      coaptation of the ureter (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the disadvantages attributed to Deflux is the loss of 20% of the injected material&#xD;
      over time (a result of absorption of the hyaluronic acid), which may explain the lower&#xD;
      success rate of the endoscopic treatment of VUR compared with open surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2005, Polyacrylate Polyalcohol (VantrisR), a non- absorbable chemical preparation was&#xD;
      introduced for endoscopic treatment of VUR, aiming to improve on the results of Deflux by&#xD;
      preventing volume loss. Preliminary results of a three year follow-up using Vantris have&#xD;
      shown high a level of reflux resolution(4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to compare the rate of resolution of the VUR using Deflux&#xD;
      versus Vantris in bilateral VUR&#xD;

      Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is the most common urologic diagnosis in neonates estimated at 1%&#xD;
      of newborns, and 30-45% of the children who present with urinary tract infection (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional treatments of children with VUR include conservative therapy with or without&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotics, and endoscopic, laparoscopic, or open surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first endoscopic treatment was presented in 1981 by Matouschek, who injected Teflon into&#xD;
      the submucosa of the ureteral orifice, at the six o'clock position (STING). In this&#xD;
      technique, the injecting needle is inserted through the working channel of the cystoscope.&#xD;
      The procedure is relatively short and is performed as out-patient surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2000, Dextranomer/Hyaluronic acid (DefluxR) was approved by the FDA, and subsequently has&#xD;
      become the treatment of choice in VUR grades 2-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2004, the hydrodistention-implantation technique (HIT) was introduced by Kirsch. HIT&#xD;
      involves the use of a pressurized stream of fluid directed into the ureter to aid&#xD;
      visualization, and injection into the submucosa within the ureteric tunnel to improve&#xD;
      coaptation of the ureter (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A review of Deflux therapy for VUR in 63 studies, including 8101 ureters, found a success&#xD;
      rate of 51%-79% depending on VUR grade. (grade 1,2 79%, grade 3 72%, grade 4 63%, grade 5&#xD;
      51%) (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the disadvantages attributed to Deflux is the loss of 20% of the injected material&#xD;
      over time (a result of absorption of the hyaluronic acid), which may explain the lower&#xD;
      success rate of the endoscopic treatment of VUR compared with open surgery.&#xD;

      versus Vantris in bilateral VUR&#xD;
