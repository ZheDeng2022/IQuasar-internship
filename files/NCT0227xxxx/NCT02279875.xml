      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the mycobactericidal activity, safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      and pharmacokinetics of 6 doses of linezolid: 300 mg once per day, 300 mg twice per day, 600&#xD;
      mg once per day, 600 mg twice per day and 1200 mg once per day administered orally for 14&#xD;
      consecutive days or 1200 mg administered three times per week for two weeks in adult subjects&#xD;
