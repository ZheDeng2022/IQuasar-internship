      Aims of study While various communication aids have been evaluated separately, no studies&#xD;
      have taken a coordinated approach combining aids with different goals to evaluate their&#xD;
      combined impact. In this study the investigators will use two communication aids; a QPL and&#xD;
      an audio recording of the consultation. QPLs includes question concerning treatment options,&#xD;
      but few studies involving QPLs have explored whether QPLs result in patients taking a more&#xD;
      active role in the consultation. To our knowledge there have not been studies which&#xD;
      objectively try to explore whether patients receiving QPLs participates in shared decision&#xD;
      making to a greater extent, except for one ongoing Italian trial of breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore and describe how communication aids as a QPL and an audio recording of the&#xD;
      consultation improve the first doctor-patient consultation at the oncology outpatient clinic&#xD;
      by&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Encouraging patients/caregivers to ask more questions, particularly about sensitive&#xD;
           topics such as prognosis (as an effect of QPL alone)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increasing shared decision-making (as an effect of QPL alone)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improving overall satisfaction with the consultation and information retrieved (as an&#xD;
           effect of both communication aids)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Affecting quality of life/anxiety/depression (as an effect of both communication aids)&#xD;

      Methods/study plan&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Translation of QPL to Norwegian&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reference group&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pilot project&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. RCT&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Translation of Question Prompt List (QPL) and evaluation of Norwegian version This QPL&#xD;
      consists of a list of 49 questions covering 9 topics and is not yet used in Norway nor&#xD;
      translated into Norwegian. Our collaborating partners , professor Phyllis Butow and professor&#xD;
      Martin Tattersal at the Centre for Medical Psychology and Evidence-based Decision-making at&#xD;
      the University of Sydney have developed several QPLs for different settings. In collaboration&#xD;
      with prof. Butow and colleagues we have selected the QPL &quot;Questions to ask your medical or&#xD;
      radiation oncologist&quot; which can be considered as suitable for the consultation at the&#xD;
      outpatient oncology clinic at the University hospital of North Norway and will be translated&#xD;
      to Norwegian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The translation of the QPL will be done in 5 steps using the European organization for&#xD;
      research and treatment of cancer (EORTC) gold-standard approach&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Two independent translators with Norwegian as their mother tongue translate QPL from&#xD;
           English to Norwegian.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Merge of the two translations after discussion between the two translators and the study&#xD;
           coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Back translation into English of an independent third translator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Discussion of the translation in a committee of researchers and clinicians. The versions&#xD;
           agreed on will be the prefinal version.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Norwegian version of QPL The Norwegian QPL must be culturally sensitive for&#xD;
           Norwegian speaking cancer patients and there may be questions in the Australian QPL that&#xD;
           are not relevant for Norwegian conditions. The investigators will arrange approximately&#xD;
           3 focus groups of 6-10 experienced cancer patients or former cancer patients to provide&#xD;
           information of any questions that are lacking in the Australian version and questions&#xD;
           that might be excluded in the Norwegian version.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients who participated in the nationwide survey &quot;Outpatient experiences with cancer&#xD;
           clinics in Norway 2011&quot; reported lack of information about side effects of treatment,&#xD;
           and lack of information about pain / pain relief. Due to those results the researchers&#xD;
           want to discuss weather to add some questions to the QPL, regarding side effects of&#xD;
           treatment and pain/ pain treatment with members of the focus group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Discussion of the information retrieved from the focus groups in a committee of&#xD;
           researchers and clinicians and changes might be done on the prefinal version.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Test the prefinal Norwegian version (that might have been altered after the focus&#xD;
           groups) on approximately 30 experienced cancer patients. The patients are invited to&#xD;
           give their opinion on each of the prompted questions. The investigators will ask them to&#xD;
           grade all the questions according to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Usefulness 2. Clarity 3. The amount of discomfort such a question would generate The&#xD;
      patients will also be asked to suggest additional questions if important issues are missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experienced cancer patients in 4) and 6) will be recruited from Vardesenteret.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators want to make a small change in the design by leaving space in&#xD;
      front of the prompted questions for patients to make their own questions as suggested in a&#xD;
      study by Voltz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Reference group There may be culturally differences between Australian and Norwegian&#xD;
      cancer patients. As studies with use of QPLs and audio recording have not been done with&#xD;
      Norwegian cancer patients, the investigators need a reference group to study how Norwegian&#xD;
      cancer patients in general participate during the first consultation with the oncologist and&#xD;
      to what extend Norwegian patients are involved in decision making. The investigators plan to&#xD;
      record 30 consecutive first time consultations with cancer patients not receiving QPL and&#xD;
      have this as a reference group and count questions and issues that are discussed in the&#xD;
      consultation and code the consultation according to Option scale. They will also be asked to&#xD;
      fill inn one questionnaire of baseline characteristics and information retrieved. The&#xD;
      reference group will be necessary to be able to calculate sample size of participants needed&#xD;
      in the RCT. The patients will receive written information before their consultation and will&#xD;
      also be contacted by phone prior to the consultation to agree to participate and sign a&#xD;
      written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Pilot study (Interim analyses) Before starting an RCT the study concept will be tested in&#xD;
      a pilot study. These patients will receive written information before their consultation and&#xD;
      will also be contacted by phone prior to the consultation. 30 consecutive cancer patients at&#xD;
      their first consultation at the outpatient clinic will be provided with a QPL and an audio&#xD;
      file of the consultation. These patients will be encouraged from their oncologist to ask&#xD;
      questions after a standard statement. They will also receive the same questionnaires which&#xD;
      will be used in the RCT (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also conduct training of the oncologists prior to the pilot study to&#xD;
      ensure that they encourage the use of QPL in a standard manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. RCT This is a single center, randomized control trial at the oncology outpatient clinic at&#xD;
      the University hospital North Norway. The clinic is situated as a separate part of the cancer&#xD;
      department and is served by specialists in oncology and junior doctors in training. The&#xD;
      consultation length is usually about 40-60 minutes for first time consultations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants - Study design All patients who are referred to the oncology outpatient clinic&#xD;
      and meet the inclusion criteria are invited to participate in the study along with the letter&#xD;
      for their first appointment. There are approximately 15 new referrals every week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If agreeing to participate and having signed a written informed consent, patients will be&#xD;
      randomized into intervention or control arm (see below). Participants in both groups are&#xD;
      asked to fill out questionnaires to detect baseline characteristics, anxiety/depression and&#xD;
      their wish for shared decision-making (control preference scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the intervention group will receive the QPL at home in advance of the&#xD;
      consultation along with information about the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All specialists in oncology and also junior physicians with at least one years of training in&#xD;
      oncology are invited to participate. The doctors will be instructed to address the QLP in a&#xD;
      standardized way as early in the consultation as possible. They will also be asked to&#xD;
      encourage use of QPL on further consultation within the two month period, as the patients&#xD;
      will be asked to fill out questionnaires (see below) one week and two months after the first&#xD;
      consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consultations will be recorded in both the control and intervention group. The recording&#xD;
      will be done on the computer, and the patients in the intervention group will be given the&#xD;
      recording immediately after the consultation on a memory stick. For both groups the&#xD;
      audiotapes will be analyzed after standard procedures (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint in RCT Primary endpoint Difference in number of questions asked, and especially&#xD;
      concerning prognosis. Secondary endpoint Difference in shared decision making. Difference in&#xD;
      anxiety/depression/health related quality of life. Difference in satisfaction with the&#xD;
      consultation and information retrieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the audio recorded consultations Our collaborators in Sydney have developed a&#xD;
      manual and coding sheet to enable standardization of the coding procedure for the&#xD;
      consultations with &quot;Question prompt lists&quot;.This will be translated to Norwegian. The audio&#xD;
      recordings will be transcribed and patients questions and concerns will be counted and&#xD;
      categorized according to topics covered by the QPL. Physician endorsement of the QPL will be&#xD;
      coded as either absent, basic or extended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coders will also be trained to use the &quot;Option scale&quot; to score patient involvement in&#xD;
      decision making. The option scale consists of 12 dimensions of a collaborative decision&#xD;
      making process and the dimensions will be registered by frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coders will be blinded to group allocation. Intra-rater and inter-rater reliability will&#xD;
      be tested. Training of coders will be under the guidance of Prof. Svein Bergsvik in&#xD;
      collaboration with Prof. Butow. The coders will probably be 2nd year students in psychology&#xD;
      who can follow the project for the three year period and will be paid on an hourly basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations To calculate sample size for the study, the investigators need to&#xD;
      know average numbers of questions asked by Norwegian cancer patients in general. The&#xD;
      investigators will get this information from the reference group. In the absence of data from&#xD;
      Norway, the investigators assume it will be the same as from Australia were studies report a&#xD;
      mean number of 9 questions (range 0-53). A sample size calculation suggest that we need n=80&#xD;
      patients in each group in order to have 80% power to detect a significance difference between&#xD;
      the groups when we anticipate a mean difference between the groups of 3 and a standard&#xD;
      deviation of 5 using a 5% significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Patients will be randomly assigned and stratified for age, sex, education, type&#xD;
      of cancer (breast cancer vs non-breast cancer) and curative or palliative treatment&#xD;
      intention. The randomization will be done with a concealed, computer- generated randomization&#xD;
      procedure. As the same doctor will meet patients in both the intervention and the control&#xD;
      arm, this must be taken into consideration either in the randomization or the statistical&#xD;
      analyzes or both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses Analysis will be by intention to treat, using all available data from&#xD;
      randomly assigned patients according to group assignment. Comparison between groups will be&#xD;
      performed using chi-square tests or logistic regression for binary variables and with two&#xD;
      sample t-test or linear regression models for continuous variables. Data will be analyzed&#xD;
      using the SPSS version 19 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois) and SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute,&#xD;
      Cary, NC).&#xD;
