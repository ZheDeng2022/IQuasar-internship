    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I/II trial studies the best dose of erlotinib hydrochloride and to see how&#xD;
      well it works in preventing liver cancer in patients with scarring (cirrhosis) of the liver.&#xD;
      Erlotinib hydrochloride may help to inhibit the development of fibrous tissue and prevent&#xD;
      liver cancer from forming in patients with cirrhosis of the liver.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the safe and minimum effective dose (MED) of daily erlotinib (erlotinib&#xD;
      hydrochloride) that inhibits epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in the target&#xD;
      organ (liver) as assessed by phosphorylated (phospho)-EGFR staining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the relationship between erlotinib dose-schedule and side effects in&#xD;
      participants with cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the relationship between erlotinib dose-schedule and immuno-histochemical&#xD;
      staining pattern of phospho-ERK, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor (EGF), and alpha smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) in the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the relationship between erlotinib dose-schedule and gene expression signature&#xD;
      associated with prognosis in cirrhosis participants following hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)&#xD;
      resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the relationship between erlotinib dose-schedule and viral load in&#xD;
      participants with hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive (+).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the relationship between erlotinib dose-schedule and erlotinib plasma level on&#xD;
      day of liver resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation/de-escalation study followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 7 days (depending on&#xD;
      the date of surgery, treatment range may be 5-14 days).&#xD;

    <description>Graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4. The maximum grade for each type of adverse event will be recorded for each participant and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine the overall patterns.
