    <textblock>
      This partially randomized clinical trial studies surgery or non-surgical management in&#xD;
      treating patients with intra-abdominal cancer and bowel obstruction. Bowel obstruction is a&#xD;
      common problem for advanced cancer patients and can negatively affect quality of life. It is&#xD;
      not yet known whether surgery or non-surgical management is the best treatment option for&#xD;
      bowel obstruction and can lead to better quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>The primary analysis will pool data from both components using a multivariate linear regression model, including a parameter for study component. Factors considered likely to confound the association of treatment and outcome in the non-randomized component will be carefully modeled in the regression. Potential residual bias in the treatment group comparison from the non-randomized component will be assessed by estimating the interaction term between treatment group and study component (randomized vs. non-randomized).</description>
