  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial assesses whether a newly designed algorithm which looks at the genomic&#xD;
      signature of each patient's tumor to predict their sensitivity to standard of care treatment&#xD;
      verses being placed on a personally designed treatment trial can improve the responses in&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Testing the primary tumor&#xD;
      biopsy for certain proteins and monitoring the lymphocyte infiltration into the tumors may&#xD;
      help doctors determine the sub-type of TNBC, and direct treatments that may work well. It is&#xD;
      not yet known whether assigning treatment based on the patient's tumor classification will&#xD;
      improve how well the tumor responds.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To conduct a prospective single arm, non-randomized trial to determine the impact of&#xD;
      implementation of a research platform that includes diagnostic imaging to assess response to&#xD;
      the initial phase of neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with subtyping of TNBC in order to&#xD;
      select the appropriate targeted therapy trial to complete neoadjuvant chemotherapy in&#xD;
      patients found to have chemo-insensitive disease by imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Measured as defined by Standardized Definitions for Efficacy End Points (STEEP) criteria&#xD;
      using the following prioritization: distant recurrence free interval (DRFI), recurrence free&#xD;
      survival (RFS), distant relapse-free survival (DRFS), overall survival (OS), invasive disease&#xD;
      free survival (IDFS), disease free survival including ductal carcinoma in situ (DFS-DCIS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the rates of enrollment into clinical trials for patients identified as having&#xD;
      chemotherapy insensitive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Compare the rates of enrollment into therapeutic clinical trials between the two arms of&#xD;
      the trial, i.e. those who do, versus do not, receive the results of molecular genomic&#xD;
      prediction of chemotherapy response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Evaluate the frequency of pathologic response rates (pCR, RCB I-III residual disease) in&#xD;
      patients identified as chemotherapy sensitive versus insensitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Compare the pathologic response rates of tumors between the two arms of the trial for the&#xD;
      patients whose tumor was molecularly classified as chemotherapy- sensitive or&#xD;
      chemotherapy-insensitive, and in whose neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed the&#xD;
      recommendation of the trial schema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Determine the estimates of DRFI, RFS, DRFS, IDFS and DFS-DCIS at 3 years, and OS at 5&#xD;
      years in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Compare the estimates between the two arms of the trial for the patients whose tumor was&#xD;
      molecularly classified as chemotherapy-sensitive or chemotherapy-insensitive, and for whose&#xD;
      NACT followed the recommendation of the trial schema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Determine the pathologic response based on molecular characterization. IX. Determine&#xD;
      the estimates of DRFI, RFS, DRFS, IDFS and DFS-DCIS at 3 years, and OS at 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. Subset analyses of pathologic response and 3-year DRFI, RFS, DRFS, IDFS and DFS-DCIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XI. Estimate for the subsets where gene expression levels of receptor status (estrogen&#xD;
      receptor [ER], progesterone receptor [PR] and HER2) were, or were not concordant with TNBC&#xD;
      status as defined by routine diagnostic tests (immunohistochemistry and/or fluorescent in&#xD;
      situ hybridization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XII. Compare the results of pathologic node-negative status (sentinel and/or non-sentinel&#xD;
      nodes) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy according to a genomic predictor of nodal response to&#xD;
      NACT, in subsets defined by pre-treatment clinical nodal status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Future re-analysis of residual samples using a customized genomic diagnostic platform&#xD;
      (integrated &quot;prospective-retrospective&quot; biomarker analysis) to predict chemotherapy&#xD;
      sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Generation and subsequent molecular characterization of patient derived xenograph (PDX)&#xD;
      models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Clinical diagnostic development studies using residual samples (fresh and/or&#xD;
      formalin-fixed) within the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-compliant&#xD;
      Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory and patient derived xenographs (PDX), to formally evaluate&#xD;
      the clinical validity and utility of future clinical genomic diagnostic tests that would&#xD;
      predict both response, recurrence, and survival from the treatments used in this clinical&#xD;
      trial (correlative &quot;retrospective-prospective&quot; biomarker analyses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Correlative science studies to identify molecular therapeutic targets for&#xD;
      treatment-insensitive TNBC using residual samples and PDX models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Correlation of tumor features or changes as measured by diagnostic imaging to determine&#xD;
      potential predictors of treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Determine polymerase chain reaction (pCR) rates in a cohort of patients who undergo&#xD;
      surgical resection after achieving complete radiological response after 4 cycles of adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy (AC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo baseline molecular and immunohistochemistry (IHC) evaluation of their tumor&#xD;
      biopsy, and receive the results. Patients then receive standard anthracycline-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy and undergo standard ultrasound at baseline, after 2 courses, and after 4&#xD;
      courses of treatment. Patients and physicians are notified of the results of the molecular&#xD;
      evaluation. Patients may then choose to continue with standard taxane +/- platinum-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy or participate in an experimental clinical trial designed to match the molecular&#xD;
      profile and triple-negative subtype. Patients with tumors predicted to be insensitive to&#xD;
      chemotherapy are advised to participate in a clinical trial treating their tumor subtype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 5 years.&#xD;
