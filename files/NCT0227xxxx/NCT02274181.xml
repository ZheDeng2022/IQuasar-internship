          4. History or presence of alcoholism or drug abuse within the past 2 years prior to&#xD;
             screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History or presence of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to the study drug or&#xD;
             related compounds (e.g., clomiphene citrate)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History or presence of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Renal disease or a history of renal dysfunction;&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Unable to refrain from or anticipates the use of:&#xD;
&#xD;

                  drugs known to be significant inhibitors of CYP enzymes and/or P gp and/or OATP),&#xD;
                  herbal remedies, or vitamin supplements beginning 14 days prior to dosing of&#xD;
                  study drug and throughout the study. Acetaminophen (up to 2 g per 24 hour period)&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Any drugs known to be significant inducers of CYP enzymes and/or P gp, including&#xD;
                  St. John's Wort, for 28 days prior to dosing of study drug and throughout the&#xD;
                  study. Appropriate sources will be consulted by the PI or designee to confirm&#xD;
                  lack of PK/pharmacodynamics (PD) interaction with study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Have been on a diet incompatible with the on study diet, in the opinion of the PI,&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. Have received radiolabeled substances or have been exposed to radiation sources over&#xD;
             the past 12 months or is likely to receive radiation exposure or radioisotopes within&#xD;
             the next 12 months such that participation in this study would increase their total&#xD;
             exposure beyond the recommended levels considered safe (i.e., weighted annual limit&#xD;
             recommended by the ICRP of 3000 mrem)&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Donation of blood or significant blood loss within 56 days prior to dosing of study&#xD;
             drug&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Plasma donation within 7 days prior to dosing of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Participation in another clinical trial within 28 days prior to dosing of study drug.&#xD;
             The 28 day window will be derived from the date of the last blood collection or&#xD;
             dosing, whichever is later, in the previous study to Day 1 of the current study&#xD;
