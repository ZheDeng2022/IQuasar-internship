      The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of NT 201 compared with&#xD;
      placebo for the treatment of chronic troublesome sialorrhea associated with neurological&#xD;
      disorders (e.g. cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury) and/or intellectual disability in&#xD;
      children and adolescents naïve to Botulinum neurotoxin treatment and aged 2-17 years.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Unstimulated Salivary Flow Rate (uSFR) at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>This endpoint was planned to be analyzed in double-blind, MP, 6 to 17 years participants only. uSFR was assessed by weighing of absorbent swabs with safety threads soaked with saliva over 5 minutes and the procedure was repeated after 30 minutes. Salivary flow rate was equal to weight increase of swabs/time of collection. The average of the 2 results for flow rate was calculated. The reduction of measured weight over the study relates to improvement of sialorrhea.</description>

    <measure>Global Impression of Change Scale (GICS) at Week 4 Assessed by the Carer/Parent(s)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>This endpoint was analyzed in double-blind, MP, 6 to 17 years participants. The GICS was used to measure the carer's/parent's impression of change due to treatment. The response option was a common 7-point Likert scale, with the following values: +3 (very much improved); +2 (much improved); +1 (minimally improved); 0 (no change); -1 (minimally worse); -2 (much worse); -3 (very much worse).</description>

             endocrine, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, or psychiatric diseases or conditions, which in&#xD;

             could influence the results of the study, or negatively impact the subject's ability&#xD;
             to participate in the study.&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 28 investigational sites in Georgia, Hungary, Poland, Russia, Serbia, and Ukraine.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 281 participants were screened, out of which 256 participants were enrolled/randomized into the study. Of these 256 participants, 255 participants received the study treatment. A total of 247 participants who completed the Main Period (MP) entered the Open-label Extension Period (OLEX) of the study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Unstimulated Salivary Flow Rate (uSFR) at Week 4</title>
        <description>This endpoint was planned to be analyzed in double-blind, MP, 6 to 17 years participants only. uSFR was assessed by weighing of absorbent swabs with safety threads soaked with saliva over 5 minutes and the procedure was repeated after 30 minutes. Salivary flow rate was equal to weight increase of swabs/time of collection. The average of the 2 results for flow rate was calculated. The reduction of measured weight over the study relates to improvement of sialorrhea.</description>

        <description>This endpoint was analyzed in double-blind, MP, 6 to 17 years participants. The GICS was used to measure the carer's/parent's impression of change due to treatment. The response option was a common 7-point Likert scale, with the following values: +3 (very much improved); +2 (much improved); +1 (minimally improved); 0 (no change); -1 (minimally worse); -2 (much worse); -3 (very much worse).</description>

          <description>This endpoint was analyzed in double-blind, MP, 6 to 17 years participants. The GICS was used to measure the carer's/parent's impression of change due to treatment. The response option was a common 7-point Likert scale, with the following values: +3 (very much improved); +2 (much improved); +1 (minimally improved); 0 (no change); -1 (minimally worse); -2 (much worse); -3 (very much worse).</description>

        <description>This endpoint was analyzed in double-blind, MP, 6 to 17 years participants. uSFR was assessed by weighing of absorbent swabs with safety threads soaked with saliva over 5 minutes and then procedure was repeated after 30 minutes. Salivary flow rate was equal to weight increase of swabs/time of collection. The average of the 2 results for flow rate was calculated. The reduction of measured weight over the study relates to improvement of sialorrhea.</description>
