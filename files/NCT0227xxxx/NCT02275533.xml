    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab works in eliminating any remaining cancer&#xD;
      cells and preventing cancer from returning in patients with acute myeloid leukemia that had a&#xD;
      decrease in or disappearance of signs and symptoms of cancer after receiving chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune&#xD;
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate and compare the progression free survival rate after randomization in the two&#xD;
      treatment arms (nivolumab versus [vs.] observation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine and compare the overall survival rates in the two arms. II. To determine and&#xD;
      compare the incidence of non-relapse mortality in the two arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the toxicities of nivolumab as maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To analyze programmed cell death (PD)-ligand (L)1 expression on acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      (AML) cells from peripheral blood and/or bone marrow samples at diagnosis if available and at&#xD;
      the time of study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To monitor AML minimal residual disease (MRD) by Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction (PCR) at enrollment and at subsequent defined time points in the nivolumab-treated&#xD;
      and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To perform an exploratory analysis on the frequencies, absolute numbers and subsets of T&#xD;
      cells (including regulatory T cells) in the nivolumab-treated and control groups with an&#xD;
      emphasis on activation markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To perform deep sequencing of T cell receptor (TCR)-alpha and TCR-beta chains on&#xD;
      polyclonal T cells at baseline and at subsequent time points in the nivolumab and control&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes once every 2 weeks.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 46 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo standard of care clinical observation for up to 2 years. Upon&#xD;
      disease relapse, patients may cross-over to Arm I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 2 years, every&#xD;
      6 months for 1 year, and then yearly thereafter.&#xD;

    <description>Kaplan-Meier plots will be used to estimate PFS in each arm and a stratified log rank test will be performed to compare the two groups. In addition, Cox proportional hazards models will be fit to provide estimates of the hazard ratio (HR) and associated 95% confidence interval (CIs), both unadjusted and adjusted for baseline covariates. Descriptive, subset analysis of PFS will be performed for minimal residual disease (MRD) positive patients.</description>

    <description>For overall survival, Kaplan-Meier plots will be generated for each treatment arm and the curves will be compared using a log rank test. Kaplan-Meier estimates with 95% CI will be summarized every 6 months using Greenwood's formula for the standard error of the Kaplan-Meier estimate. In addition to the Kaplan-Meier estimates, Cox proportional hazards models will be fit to estimate HRs and to assess and adjust for the effects of covariates.

    <time_frame>Up to 100 days post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. Summary tables for adverse events (AEs) will include only AEs that started or worsened after randomization. The incidence of treatment-related adverse events (new or worsening from baseline after randomization) will be summarized by system organ class and/ or preferred term, severity (based on CTCAE grades), type of adverse event, and relation to study treatment by treatment group. Toxicity rates will be compared between the two treatment arms via chi-squares or Fisher's exact tests.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AML patients in first complete remission (CR) (CR1) or first complete remission with&#xD;
             incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) after induction and consolidation chemotherapy;&#xD;
             except young (&lt; 60 years) AML patients in European LeukemiaNet favorable group; (Since&#xD;
             young AML patients in the European LeukemiaNet favorable group have excellent 2 year&#xD;
             progression free survival [PFS] at around 64%, further maintenance therapy might ot&#xD;
             provide additional benefit; thus the current trial will exclude young favorable group&#xD;
             AML patients), patients could receive any cycle consolidation or no consolidation per&#xD;
             the discretion by the treating physician&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Within 60 days after bone marrow biopsy confirmed remission after the patients recover&#xD;
             from their last course of chemotherapy, the goal will be to consent the eligible&#xD;
             patient prior to the remission confirmation bone marrow biopsy at the end of the&#xD;
             planned chemotherapy); ideally, the research samples will be collected during the bone&#xD;
             marrow biopsy, and the patient will be enrolled to the study within 2 weeks of the&#xD;
             bone marrow biopsy; if there is delay to enroll the patient after the bone marrow&#xD;
             biopsy and research sample collection, it is ok not to repeat bone marrow biopsy&#xD;
             within 4 weeks, after the last bone marrow biopsy, if there is no sign of disease&#xD;
             relapse; a repeat bone marrow biopsy should be done if the delay of enrollment is more&#xD;
             than 4 weeks after the last bone marrow biopsy; patients with confirmed remission&#xD;
             within 60 days after the last bone marrow biopsy, without research samples collection,&#xD;
             should have a repeat bone marrow biopsy conducted within two weeks prior to enrolling&#xD;
             on the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is not a candidate for stem cell transplant due to advanced age or&#xD;
             co-morbidities; or the enrollee does not have donor available; or the enrollee&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of nivolumab on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation; WOCBP should use an adequate method&#xD;

             women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin&#xD;
             [HCG]) within 24 hours prior to the start of nivolumab; women must not be&#xD;
             breastfeeding; men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive&#xD;
             method with a failure rate of less than 1% per year; men receiving nivolumab and who&#xD;
             are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a&#xD;
             period of 31 weeks after the last dose of investigational product; women who are not&#xD;
             of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well&#xD;
             as azoospermic men) do not require contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any female who has experienced&#xD;
             menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal; menopause is defined clinically as 12&#xD;
             months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or&#xD;
             physiological causes; in addition, women under the age of 55 must have a documented&#xD;
             serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level less than 40 mIU/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WOCBP receiving nivolumab will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period&#xD;
             of 23 weeks after the last dose of investigational product; men receiving nivolumab&#xD;
             and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception&#xD;
             for a period of 31 weeks after the last dose of investigational product; these&#xD;
             durations have been calculated using the upper limit of the half-life for nivolumab&#xD;
             (25 days) and are based on the protocol requirement that WOCBP use contraception for 5&#xD;
             half-lives plus 30 days and men who are sexually active with WOCBP use contraception&#xD;
             for 5 half-lives plus 90 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she (or the participating partner) should inform the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events (AEs) due to agents administered more than 4 weeks&#xD;
             earlier&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be excluded if they have had prior treatment with an anti-programmed&#xD;

             pathways&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known central nervous system (CNS) involvement may be excluded because&#xD;
             of poor prognosis and concerns regarding progressive neurologic dysfunction that would&#xD;
             confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events; however, if CNS&#xD;
             disease is cleared before the treatment with nivolumab, patients could be allowed if&#xD;
             no permanent CNS damage&#xD;

             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because nivolumab is an agent with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with nivolumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;

             with a history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or&#xD;
             phospholipid syndrome should be excluded because of the risk of recurrence or&#xD;
             exacerbation of disease; patients with vitiligo, endocrine deficiencies including&#xD;
             thyroiditis managed with replacement hormones including physiologic corticosteroids&#xD;
             are eligible; patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthropathies, Sjögren's&#xD;

             use topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids&#xD;
             (with minimal systemic absorption); physiologic replacement doses of systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids are permitted, even if =&lt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents; a brief&#xD;
             course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for&#xD;
             treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction&#xD;
             caused by contact allergen) is permitted&#xD;
