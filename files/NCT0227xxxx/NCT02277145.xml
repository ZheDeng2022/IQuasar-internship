  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy is one of the main means for treating malignant tumor, during which&#xD;
      radioactive lung injury is inevitable. Currently there is nearly no effective clinical&#xD;
      treatment for late post-radiotherapy pulmonary fibrosis. This study intends to carry out an&#xD;
      open, single-center, non-randomized phase I clinical trial. During the treatment, the local&#xD;
      lesions will be fully lavaged, and then clinical grade umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells&#xD;
      (MSCs) will be injected directly into the lesion by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. After six-month&#xD;
      observation, the investigators will initially evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      treatment by measuring two key indicators-the CT density histogram and the patients'&#xD;
      self-evaluation, and one secondary indicator-the changes of TGF-β1 contents, both before and&#xD;
      after the treatment. Meanwhile, the investigators will make a preliminary discuss about the&#xD;
      possible immunomodulatory effects of the umbilical cord MSCs.&#xD;

    <description>Different proportions will be assigned to the three indicators. The overall curative effect can be judged with scores ranging from 0 to100. Specific proportions are as follows: full scores of 50 points for image changes, 25 for self-efficacy evaluation and 25 for TGF-β1 content changes. The image changes can be classified into four levels: significant control, improved, stable, and progressive; the self-efficacy evaluation can also be classified into four levels: effective, improved, stable and invalid; the changes of TGF-β1 content will be classified into three levels: improved, stable, and progressive. The four levels will be scored on the ratio of 5:4:3:1, the three levels will be scored on the ratio of 5:3:1.</description>
