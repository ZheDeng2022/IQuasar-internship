      Research hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is the treatment with renal denervation (RDN) early post ACS safe and effective and does it&#xD;
      leads to improved cardiac function and attenuation of pathologic left ventricular&#xD;
      remodelling? In a following study, the hypothesis will be tested in a larger ACS population&#xD;
      with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) after ACS as the endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for conducting this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACS i.e. ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non- ST-elevation myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (non-STEMI) are the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in western&#xD;
      societies. Hypertension is a major risk factor for development of ACS and heart failure but&#xD;
      it also worsens the prognosis in patients after ACS. Our research highlights the combination&#xD;
      therapy of PCI and RDN in an ACS patient population with simultaneous hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to establish safety and efficacy of combined treatment&#xD;
      with PCI and renal denervation (RDN) in hypertensive patients with acute coronary syndromes&#xD;
      (STEMI and non-STEMI ) having ventricular mass after 4 months as the primary variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point is change in left ventricular mass (LVM) at 4 months evaluated by&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:, blood pressure (office and 24-h ABPM), and left ventricular volumes and&#xD;
      ejection fraction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sympathetic nervous system plays a crucial role in the development and progression of&#xD;
      hypertension and its adverse consequences. Despite the availability of numerous effective&#xD;
      pharmacologic treatments, adequate blood pressure control is not achieved in a large number&#xD;
      of subjects. Patients with essential hypertension generally have increased efferent&#xD;
      sympathetic drive to the kidneys and an increased rate of sympathetic-nerve firing, possibly&#xD;
      modulated by afferent signalling from renal sensory nerves. Recently developed endovascular&#xD;
      catheter technology enables selective denervation of the human kidney. A safety and&#xD;
      feasibility trial of this procedure identified substantial reductions of blood pressure&#xD;
      without substantial procedure-related complications. The therapeutic value seems to be&#xD;
      present not only in hypertension but may also be of interest in many clinical conditions e.g.&#xD;
      heart failure, chronic end-stage renal disease and insulin resistance and diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study (COMBI-RDN) is a randomised clinical trial in 40 patients to investigate&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of the combination of Percutan Coronar Interventiom (PCI) and renal&#xD;
      denervation (RDN) where RDN is performed early after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This&#xD;
      study is considered a pilot study to evaluate efficacy and safety in patients with ACS. In a&#xD;
      second phase there will be a randomised, multicenter study in approximately 2500 patients to&#xD;
      demonstrate whether RDN early post ACS could decrease major adverse cardiovascular events in&#xD;
      hypertensive patients with ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis Is the treatment with renal denervation (RDN) early post ACS safe and&#xD;
      effective and does it leads to improved cardiac function and attenuation of pathologic left&#xD;
      ventricular remodelling?&#xD;
