  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have recently developed an innovative optical molecular imaging platform&#xD;
      (called PRODIGI) based on high-resolution fluorescence and white-light technologies in a&#xD;
      hand-held, real-time, high-resolution, non-invasive format. PRODIGI offers a non-contact&#xD;
      means of obtaining instantaneous image-based measurements of diagnostically-relevant&#xD;
      biological and molecular information of a wound and surrounding skin tissues for the first&#xD;
      time and could have significant impact on improving conventional wound care, management, and&#xD;
      guidance of intervention. In preliminary preclinical testing, the investigators have&#xD;
      discovered that when wounds are illuminated by violet/blue light, endogenous collagen in the&#xD;
      connective tissue matrix emit a characteristic green fluorescent signal, while most&#xD;
      pathogenic bacterial species emit a unique red fluorescence signal due to the production of&#xD;
      endogenous porphyrins. Therefore, with autofluorescence imaging, no exogenous contrast agents&#xD;
      are needed during imaging, making this approach particularly appealing as a diagnostic&#xD;
      imaging method for clinical use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of this study, PRODIGI is used to assess wound complications in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma and treated with pre-operative radiotherapy. Both pre- and&#xD;
      postoperative external beam radiotherapy combined with limb salvage surgery have similarly&#xD;
      high rates of local control in the management of extremity soft tissue sarcoma. The main&#xD;
      acute side effect associated with preoperative radiotherapy is wound healing complications.&#xD;
      Wound care overall is a major clinical challenge and presents an enormous burden to health&#xD;
      care worldwide. The objective of this clinical study is to determine if PRODIGI coupled with&#xD;
      an optical tracking platform has clinical utility in identifying, quantitatively measuring&#xD;
      and longitudinally tracking bacterial imbalance on the patient's intact skin surface at the&#xD;
      location of the surgical resection site for adult patients with lower limb soft tissue&#xD;
      sarcoma treated with preoperative intensity-modulated radiation therapy and limb salvage&#xD;
      surgery and, further, to investigate whether this bacterial imbalance is related to&#xD;
      radiotherapy dose and wound complications.&#xD;

      Optical Tracking System&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, PRODIGI was combined with a commercial optical tracking system (OTS, Polaris,&#xD;
      NDI Medical, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada) to track the movement of the device in space relative&#xD;
      to a patient over time. This addition is in the form of an infrared-light camera, which&#xD;
      tracks four IR reflective spheres (NDI Medical, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada) that are fixed to&#xD;
      the external housing of PRODIGI device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OTS has been described previously. Briefly, it consists of optical tracking technology,&#xD;
      which provides 6 degrees of freedom (x, y, z, pitch. yaw, roll), attached to the camera along&#xD;
      with software developed in house to register and visualize the tracked camera pose relative&#xD;
      to a previously acquired radiological volumetric image data. The in-house software platform&#xD;
      GTxEyes performs tracking and navigation of the imaging camera, camera calibration (including&#xD;
      any image distortion), registration of the camera coordinates with respect to the CT images,&#xD;
      and co-visualization (e.g. visual overlay) of the camera and CT images. Radiation dose&#xD;
      planning information can also be spatially co-registered and overlaid with the hybrid&#xD;
      optical-CT images/videos using methods described previously by our group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After loading a CT image of the patient, the OTS is registered to the CT coordinate space by&#xD;
      identification of known fiducials using a conventional pointer tool. With registration&#xD;
      complete, the coordinates of the PRODIGI camera can be tracked in real time relative to the&#xD;
      CT image. Viewing options include orthogonal views through the CT image, corrected PRODIGI&#xD;
      image and a virtual image based on the CT surface rendering viewed from the perspective of a&#xD;
      virtual camera at the PRODIGI coordinates. Radiation dose can be displayed on the real and&#xD;
      virtual camera views as either isodose lines or colorwash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health&#xD;
      Network (Ontario, Canada) sarcoma clinic to be treated with pre-operative external beam RT&#xD;
      followed by surgical resection of lower limb soft-tissue sarcoma. Informed consent was&#xD;
      obtained according to institutional Research Ethics Board (REB) requirements and Good&#xD;
      Clinical Practice (GCP) (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02270086). Patients with pre-existing skin&#xD;
      issues, who received prior radiotherapy or required chemotherapy were not eligible to the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the radiotherapy planning stage, a CT scan of the patient sarcoma site is acquired for&#xD;
      standard treatment planning purposes. Prior to the CT scan, small radio-opaque fiduciary&#xD;
      markers (Suremark TM skin marking labels) were placed on the patient's six radiation&#xD;
      treatment setup points, making the &lt;1 mm diameter points easy to identify in the CT images.&#xD;
      After the CT scan, these markers were replaced with ink tattoos and used during radiation&#xD;
      treatment to align the patient with radiation therapy machine reference frame. In addition to&#xD;
      the CT fiducial markers placed at the treatment setup points, a flexible radio-opaque wire&#xD;
      was overlaid on the planned surgical incision. This enabled localization of the entire&#xD;
      surgical scar during the radiation treatment plan procedure. A radiotherapy stereotactic mask&#xD;
      was also made at that stage. Following CT simulation scan acquisition, an appropriate&#xD;
      radiotherapy plan was designed as per institutional clinical standard guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging with PRODIGI and the OTS was performed throughout the sarcoma management, i.e. during&#xD;
      radiotherapy and in the operating room. Imaging was performed at three time points during RT:&#xD;
      fractions 0, 12 and 25, i.e. at the beginning, middle and end of the treatment. Four out of&#xD;
      six treatment setup points marked with radio-opaque fiduciary markers on the CT scans were&#xD;
      used to perform the optical to CT co-registration. An optically-tracked pointer tool using&#xD;
      four IR reflective spheres (identical to the ones fixed to the PRODIGI system) was used to&#xD;
      register the patient in space with respect to the IR camera. For this, the pointer was placed&#xD;
      sequentially on each tattoo mark, identified and spatially registered by the tracking IR&#xD;
      camera and visualized in real-time on the CT scans using the custom-built software GTxEyes.&#xD;
      The locations of the tattoo points in the optical tracking coordinate system were then&#xD;
      registered to the corresponding points in the CT image using the fiduciary CT markers. Once&#xD;
      registration was completed, the planned surgical scar was drawn on the patient's skin with a&#xD;
      marker by superimposing the optically-tracked pointer on the scar visible on the CT scans. An&#xD;
      imaging session consisted of both WL and corresponding AF imaging of the planned skin&#xD;
      surgical incision and surrounding tissue. Room lights were turned off during AF imaging to&#xD;
      avoid background signal and artifacts. The four reflective spheres on the PRODIGI device were&#xD;
      pointed towards the IR camera to ensure proper tracking in 3D during the entire session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform PRODIGI imaging in the operating room, a sterilization method approved by UHN's&#xD;
      control and processing department using a sterile drape was found to be the most effective&#xD;
      way to ensure proper sterile conditions without damaging the instrument or affecting its&#xD;
      performance. An elongated sterile drape (Cardinal Health Canada, 29-59029) was used to cover&#xD;
      the entire PRODIGI imaging system, i.e. the camera and electrical power cord. Six strong&#xD;
      neodymium magnets (Super Magnets, 8 mm diameter) were embedded into the emission filter&#xD;
      slider and six corresponding magnets were autoclaved prior to each use and placed on the&#xD;
      outside of the drape to hold it in place to avoid image quality degradation. Steri-strips&#xD;
      (3M, R1547) were applied on the outside of the draped device to tighten the drape around the&#xD;
      IR reflective spheres to insure adequate tracking during imaging. Imaging was performed at&#xD;
      five time points: before and after sterilization of the surgical site (OR1, OR2), once the&#xD;
      flap was raised (OR3), after tumor excision (OR4) and after closure (OR5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combined WL and AF images were part of a superset of data recorded using the tracking&#xD;
      system. The superset also included preoperative patient CT and the patient's RT dose volume.&#xD;
      A skin surface model was generated from the patient's CT, where each surface point held a&#xD;
      quantitative tuple that contained the surface normal vector, the RT dose, the WL scalar, the&#xD;
      AF scalar, and the camera pose corresponding to the AF scalar. Overlay of WL and AF images on&#xD;
      the skin surface model was visualized using the software ParaView.&#xD;
