      H7N9 viruses have caused an outbreak of severe respiratory disease in 2013-2014 in China that&#xD;
      affected many older adults. This study will evaluate the safety of and immune response to a&#xD;
      live attenuated H7N9 vaccine in adults 50 to 70 years old.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      H7N9 viruses caused an outbreak of severe respiratory disease in China in 2013-2014, which&#xD;
      was associated with severe respiratory illness, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and death. The outbreak affected older adults and&#xD;
      highlighted the need for a vaccine that is effective in this population. Prior studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated the safety and immunogenicity of a vaccination regimen in which administration&#xD;
      of the experimental H7N9 vaccine (H7N9 Anhui 2013/AA ca) was followed by an H7N9 inactivated&#xD;
      vaccine in younger adults. This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a&#xD;
      similar vaccination regimen in healthy adults, 50 to 70 years old, who are H7N9 seronegative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the inpatient unit 2 days before they will receive their&#xD;
      first vaccination with the H7N9 Anhui 2013/AA ca vaccine. All participants will receive one&#xD;
      dose of the H7N9 vaccine, delivered as a nasal spray, on Day 0. While in the inpatient unit,&#xD;
      study procedures will include physical examinations, medical history reviews, nasal swabs,&#xD;
      and blood and urine collections. On Day 9, participants will be discharged from the inpatient&#xD;
      unit provided they meet certain medical criteria. If not, they will remain in the isolation&#xD;
      unit until the criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 26, participants will be readmitted to the inpatient unit, and on Day 28, they will&#xD;
      receive one dose of the H7N9 vaccine delivered as a nasal spray. Participants will remain in&#xD;
      the inpatient unit until Day 37 and will take part in all of the same study procedures that&#xD;
      occurred during the first inpatient stay. On Day 56, all participants will attend a study&#xD;
      visit for a blood collection and nasal swab. On Day 98, all participants will receive one&#xD;
      dose of the inactivated subvirion H7N9 vaccine. They will attend study visits on Days 101,&#xD;
      105, 112, 126, 154, and 180, which will include the same study procedures that occurred&#xD;
      during the inpatient visits.&#xD;
