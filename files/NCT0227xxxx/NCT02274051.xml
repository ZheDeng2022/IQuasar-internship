  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of kinetin, a nutritional supplement that corrects the mRNA splicing defect&#xD;
      in patients with familial dysautonomia (FD, also known as Riley Day syndrome or hereditary&#xD;
      sensory and autonomic neuropathy type III). FD is a rare fatal autosomal recessive disease in&#xD;
      which the growth and development of selective neuronal populations is impaired. The disease&#xD;
      is the result of a point mutation in the gene sequence that encodes for kinase complex&#xD;
      associated protein (IKAP) in chromosome 9q31. The mutation, at the start of the non-encoding&#xD;
      intron 20, weakens the splice site, causing the spliceosome to wrongly join together exons 19&#xD;
      and 21 when transcribing the mRNA strand and miss out exon 20. The mutated mRNA produces a&#xD;
      short unstable IKAP protein that is quickly degraded. Interestingly, the mutation does not&#xD;
      lead to a complete loss of function. Instead, it results in a tissue specific deficiency in&#xD;
      splicing efficiency with both normal (wild type) and mutant IKAP mRNA being expressed in&#xD;
      different ratios in different tissues. Some cells, like fibroblasts, produce mostly normal&#xD;
      mRNA and protein, where as others, like neurons, produce mostly mutant mRNA and almost no&#xD;
      functional protein product.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Familial dysautonomia (FD, also called Riley Day syndrome or hereditary sensory and autonomic&#xD;
      neuropathy type III) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a point mutation in the&#xD;
      kinase complex associated protein (IKAP) gene sequence (1, 2). This leads to a tissue&#xD;
      specific splicing defect with variable &quot;skipping&quot; of exon 20 (1, 3, 4). The consequence is a&#xD;
      devastating congenital sensory neuropathy, affecting pain and temperature perception (5) as&#xD;
      well as afferent information from the viscera (6). As a result, patients suffer recurrent&#xD;
      aspiration pneumonias, respiratory insufficiency, proprioceptive ataxia, scoliosis and the&#xD;
      long-term consequences of volatile blood pressure including renal failure (7) and left&#xD;
      ventricular hypertrophy (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-vitro studies have shown that the plant hormone kinetin corrects the splicing defect and&#xD;
      increases the production of normal IKAP protein levels in FD derived cell lines (9, 10).&#xD;
      Preliminary studies in heterozygous carriers of the IKAP mutation showed that dietary&#xD;
      supplementation with kinetin increased the production of correctly spliced IKAP mRNA, in&#xD;
      white blood cells (11). Preliminary studies in patients with FD have demonstrated that&#xD;
      kinetin also increases the expression of correctly spliced IKAP mRNA extracted from white&#xD;
      blood cells. However, the effect of kinetin on mRNA levels in neuronal tissue is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of administering&#xD;
      kinetin in patients with FD. The specific aim of this proposal is to determine the safety of&#xD;
      a once daily dose of kinetin in patients with FD using a dose ascending titration and to&#xD;
      determine the long-term safety and tolerability during 3-years of receiving a maximum&#xD;
      tolerated steady state dose of kinetin. The investigators hope to also demonstrate early&#xD;
      proof of concept that kinetin enhances the ability of neuronal tissue to correctly splice&#xD;
      IKAP mRNA.&#xD;
