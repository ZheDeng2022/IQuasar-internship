    <textblock>
      Aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of a change in the intestinal microflora on the&#xD;
      neuro-cognitive profile of patients with HIV infection receiving HAART treatment.&#xD;
      Improvements will be evaluated with questionnaires on Quality of life and Cognitive and&#xD;
      Behavior function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 patients will be enrolled and will receive 4 sachets of VSL#3 per day.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The HIV virus has a marked tropism for the central nervous system. In 1986, the term AIDS&#xD;
      Dementia Complex (ADC) has been coined which includes in a single syndrome, a whole series of&#xD;
      severe neurologic manifestations, characterized by cognitive, motor and behavioral disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of HAART has led to a profound change of the neurological HIV-mediated&#xD;
      profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increased morbidity that occurs in HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy is related to&#xD;
      inflammatory processes and cardiovascular diseases, resulting from the damage of the mucosa&#xD;
      of the gastrointestinal tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The massive depletion of CD4 T cells in the GI tract, low frequencies of CD4 and CD8 T&#xD;
      producing IL-17, apoptosis of enterocytes (resulting in structural damage to the barrier of&#xD;
      the GI tract) and the increase in intestinal permeability, are all manifestations of&#xD;
      progressive HIV infection in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main consequence of the structural and functional disruption of the enteric mucosal&#xD;
      barrier is constituted by the passage into the systemic circulation of products of microbial&#xD;
      origin including the lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a phenomenon known as &quot;microbial&#xD;
      translocation&quot; (MT). A direct consequence of MT is the increase in the levels of systemic&#xD;
      innate and adaptive immune activation. The alteration of the intestinal mucosa also involves&#xD;
      changes in the composition of the local microbial flora, event that changes the normal&#xD;
      balance of the so-called axis &quot;brain-gut&quot;, the function of this axis is in fact influenced by&#xD;
      metabolic products of the resident bacterial flora.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disturbance of this balance can cause diseases such as anxiety and depression&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's scientifically proved the importance that the intestinal microflora (in particular&#xD;
      bifidobacteria and lactobacilli) plays in relation to the multiple tasks that you can&#xD;
      perform, such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. reduction of the intraluminal pH by the production of lactic acid, acetic acid and other&#xD;
           organic acids;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. production of nutrients (short chain fatty acids, arginine, glutathione, vitamins,&#xD;
           etc..) of extreme importance for the normal trophism of the intestinal mucosa;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. stimulation of the immune system and in particular: the macrophage activity, cytokine&#xD;
           production, natural killer activity, the proliferation of lymphocytes, the production of&#xD;
           IgA;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. competition with pathogens for nutrients and adhesion in the gut epithelium;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. production of bacteriocins;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. modulation of the inflammatory response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intestinal microflora, therefore, plays a metabolic activity of enormous importance both&#xD;
      on a purely nutritional level and for the maintenance of an efficient barrier activity of the&#xD;
      intestinal mucosa, which together with the modulation of local and systemic immune response,&#xD;
      is fundamental for the protection of the host organism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VSL # 3 (original De Simone's formulation) is a probiotic preparation at a high concentration&#xD;
      (450 billion bacteria per sachet) consisting of: 4 strains of lactobacilli (L. acidophilus,&#xD;
      L. paracasei, L. delbrueckii subs. bulgaricus, L. plantarum), 3 strains of bifidobacteria:&#xD;
      (B. breve, B. infantis, B. longum) and one strain of Streptococcus thermophilus. This product&#xD;
      is able to colonize the intestine and to modulate the intestinal microflora. The efficacy of&#xD;
      VSL#3 was proven in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis,&#xD;
      pouchitis mainly) as well as in the prevention or treatment of various gastrointestinal&#xD;
      disorders such as diarrhea from rotavirus, traveler's diarrhea, diarrhea after antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy and radiotherapy. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of VSL# in chronic&#xD;
      diseases of the liver (steatosis, steatohepatitis, NAFLD, etc ...). Recently Klatt et al&#xD;
      demonstrated that treatment antiretroviral (ARV) in association with VSL#3 at a dose of 225&#xD;
      billion / day) and prebiotics (inulin), for a period of 5 months in a population of macaques&#xD;
      resulted in an increased reconstruction and functionality of CD4 + cells and a reduced&#xD;
      fibrosis at the level of lymphoid follicles of the colon mucosa, compared to the group of&#xD;
      macaques treated with ARV therapy alone. A decrease of immuno-activation of CD4 + cells in&#xD;
      the mucosa of the colon and a decrease of plasma levels of D-dimers was observed in macaques&#xD;
      treated with ARV therapy in combination with probiotic + prebiotic, compared to the group&#xD;
      control. It is good to emphasize that the dimers are biomarkers of inflammation-related&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease in HIV patients treated with ARV therapy (Klatt, 2013). All this&#xD;
      clearly leads to an improvement of the immunity of the gastrointestinal tract, with&#xD;
      consequent reduction of inflammatory processes and improving the prognosis of HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUB-STUDIES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the implication of chronic immune activation and intestinal microbiota alterations in&#xD;
      HIV-1 disease progression and non-AIDS related damages, we considered that supplementing&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1 infected patients with a probiotic mixture might promote&#xD;
      beneficial effects in the restoration of HIV related damage of the intestinal epithelium and&#xD;
      Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the potential impact of probiotics on intestinal damage, we have designed a&#xD;
      substudy that analyzes the following parameters: T cell activation and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell&#xD;
      subsets expressing interferon (IFN)Î³ (Th1, Tc1) or interleukin (IL)-17A (Th17, Tc17) by&#xD;
      multi-parameter flow cytoflorimetric analysis, histological and immunohistochemical analysis&#xD;
      of intestinal biopsies TUNEL assay to determine enterocytes apoptosis index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Addendum: - Amendment 1 (enrollment of naive patients) Amendment 2 (enrollment of healty&#xD;
      controls) Amendment 3 (enrollment of control group) Amendment 4 (supplementation for 6&#xD;
      months)&#xD;
