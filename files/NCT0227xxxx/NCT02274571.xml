  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if a novel drug approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration [Duavee™, Pfizer, Inc] for treatment of postmenopausal symptoms (vaginal&#xD;
      dryness and hot flashes) and prevention of osteoporosis also improves insulin sensitivity by&#xD;
      decreasing body fat especially in your liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DUAVEE™ (Conjugated Estrogens/Bazedoxifene) is a new prescription medicine that contains a&#xD;
      mixture of estrogen (the main female hormone made by the ovaries) and bazedoxifene, which is&#xD;
      FDA approved. For over 60 years, estrogens have been used as hormonal treatments to help&#xD;
      manage hot flashes and help prevent postmenopausal bone loss. But in the treatment of&#xD;
      postmenopausal women, the use of estrogens alone can increase the risk of developing cancer&#xD;
      of the uterus. So estrogens have been traditionally paired with a progestin to decrease the&#xD;
      risk of hyperplasia (the thickening of the lining of the uterus), which can be a precursor to&#xD;
      cancer. DUAVEE™ uses bazedoxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), in place&#xD;
      of a progestin to help protect the uterus against thickening of the uterus that may result&#xD;
      from estrogens alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, you will get either DUAVEE™ or the placebo (a &quot;dummy pill&quot; that may look like&#xD;
      medicine but contains no active medication) first and then switch to the other pill.&#xD;

      This study involves a screening process to see if you are eligible to participate followed by&#xD;
      two 8-week treatment periods separated by an 8-week washout period. The two 8-week treatments&#xD;
      will be with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 8 weeks of treatment with TSEC (Duavee™, combination of CE and BZA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 8 weeks of treatment with a &quot;dummy pill&quot; (Placebo) The order of these 2 8-week treatment&#xD;
           periods will be decided by chance (coin flip).&#xD;
&#xD;
           STUDY VISITS (11 VISITS in total) If you participate in this study, after referral from&#xD;
           the Baton Rouge General Obstetrics and Gynecology Physicians, you will complete 1&#xD;
           screening visit at Pennington Biomedical Research Center to determine your eligibility.&#xD;
           If you are eligible and enrolled in the study, you will complete an additional 10 visits&#xD;
           (8 brief visits and 2 overnight inpatient stays).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Please note all times provided for procedures and the total times for each clinic visit&#xD;
           are approximations and may vary depending on circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
           SCREENING VISIT (1 visit, approximately 1.5 hours, fasting):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Please do not drink any food or water for 10 hours before this appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants are asked to report to the Pennington clinic fasting. After a detailed&#xD;
           explanation of the whole study by a coordinator, if you agree to the procedures by&#xD;
           signing a consent form, you will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Your height and body weight measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. You will then have an ECG (electrocardiogram) to measure your heart rate and&#xD;
                rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Your blood pressure will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. A blood sample (&lt;1 teaspoon) and urine will be collected to assess your general&#xD;
                health.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. You will have a medical history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If fully eligible according to the data collected during the screening visit, you will&#xD;
           be called to set up a second visit to provide you with the medication or the dummy pill.&#xD;
&#xD;
           VISIT 2 (30 minutes):&#xD;
&#xD;
           You will come to the Pennington to pick up your drug supply (real medication or dummy&#xD;
           pill) and meet with a nurse or a study coordinator to give you instructions on when and&#xD;
           how to take your pill once a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
           VISITS 3-5 (30 minutes each):&#xD;
&#xD;
           At week 1, 3, and 5 of your 8-week treatment period, you will come to our outpatient&#xD;
           clinic to measure your weight, blood pressure and pulse, collect some feedback on your&#xD;
           health and check your medication compliance as well as distribute new medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
           VISIT 6 (24 hours at our inpatient unit):&#xD;
&#xD;
           You will be admitted to our inpatient unit at 4pm (not fasted) for measures of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Total body fat by DXA&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Abdominal visceral fat by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Fat in your liver and muscle by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) You will then&#xD;
                receive a standard dinner at ~7pm and will be ask to switch off the light in your&#xD;
                bedroom at ~10pm&#xD;
&#xD;
           The next morning investigators will wake you up at ~4.45am to start an IV line and start&#xD;
           a 8-hour procedure (Euglycemic Clamp) to measure how your body responds to insulin. You&#xD;
           will be discharged from the inpatient unit between 2 and 3 pm after being fed a lunch.&#xD;

           sequence of visits (VISITS 7-11) as shown above for Visits 2-6 but this time with the&#xD;
           other pill.&#xD;
&#xD;
           DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
           Euglycemic IV clamp (8 hours):&#xD;
&#xD;
           This procedure measures how the body responds to insulin. Insulin is normally produced&#xD;
           by your body during meals and helps your body use sugar. There will be 2 IV lines, one&#xD;
           in your arm and one in your hand on the opposite side. Approximately 30 minutes after&#xD;
           the IV lines are inserted; investigators will perform a fat biopsy to sample fat cells&#xD;
           beneath the skin of your stomach area. Then, a muscle biopsy will be obtained to sample&#xD;
           muscle cells beneath the skin of your thigh. Small amounts of glucose and insulin will&#xD;
           be infused into your arm. Your blood sugar level will be checked every 5-10 minutes from&#xD;
           the IV in your hand to determine how much glucose you should have to keep your blood&#xD;
           sugar at a normal level. Your hand will be placed inside a warming box to increase skin&#xD;
           temperature to about 105 degrees Fahrenheit. The temperature will be warm, but not&#xD;
           uncomfortable. During your IV procedure, a small amount of your own blood (less than 1&#xD;
           teaspoon) will immediately be returned into your vein through the IV after each specimen&#xD;
           is collected&#xD;
&#xD;
           Three times during the 8-hour procedure, investigators will place a clear plastic hood,&#xD;
           through which fresh air flows, over your head to measure how many calories your body&#xD;
           burns. This measure will last 40 minutes each time. Your urine will be collected&#xD;
           throughout the test in a urine jug (at the end of the test or in 2 collections if&#xD;
           necessary).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fat biopsy (about 30 minutes):&#xD;
&#xD;
           This procedure is used to sample fat cells from underneath the abdominal skin after&#xD;
           cleansing the skin with iodine and using a local anesthetic. After cleansing the area,&#xD;
           the doctor or Nurse Practitioner will make a small incision in the skin and introduce a&#xD;
           needle under the skin to remove fat cells. About 1 gram (less than half a teaspoon size)&#xD;
           of fat will be removed. After the biopsy is completed, the skin will be held closed with&#xD;
           a sterile adhesive bandage; an antibiotic ointment will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Risks: Fat Biopsy: Mild to severe pain, soreness, and bruising, and a small scar are&#xD;
           common risks. There is a small risk of a hematoma (collection of blood in the tissue) or&#xD;
           infection at the biopsy site. Sterile technique will be used to minimize these risks and&#xD;
           the biopsy site will be monitored closely.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Muscle Biopsy (about 30 minutes):&#xD;
&#xD;
           This procedure is used to sample muscle cells from underneath the skin of the leg. After&#xD;
           cleaning the skin with iodine and using a local anesthetic, the doctor or nurse&#xD;
           practitioner will make a small incision in the skin and introduce a needle under the&#xD;
           skin to remove muscle cells. About 200-750 milligrams (less than a teaspoon size) of&#xD;
           muscle will be removed. After the biopsy is completed, the skin will be held closed with&#xD;
           a sterile adhesive bandage and an antibiotic ointment will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Risks: Muscle Biopsy: Mild to severe pain, soreness, bruising, and a small scar are&#xD;
           common risks. A hematoma (collection of blood in the tissue) may occur. There is a&#xD;
           slight risk that a superficial nerve may be cut; the nerve may heal, or it may result in&#xD;
           a permanent loss of sensation in the skin at the biopsy site.&#xD;
&#xD;
           DXA - Whole Body Scan (~4 minutes):&#xD;
&#xD;
           This scan measures the amount of bone, muscle, and fat in your body. The scan will be&#xD;
           performed using a whole-body scanner. You will be required to wear a hospital gown, to&#xD;
           remove all metal-containing objects from your body, and to lie down on the table. A&#xD;
           scanner emitting low energy X-rays and a detector will pass along your body. You will be&#xD;
           asked to remain completely still while the scan is in progress. The scan takes less than&#xD;
           four minutes. This scan is for research purposes only and not for diagnostic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           MRI Abdomen (30 minutes):&#xD;
&#xD;
           This scan measures the amount of fat in your abdomen. You will change into a hospital&#xD;
           gown and remove all objects containing metal from your body. You will lie on your back&#xD;
           on the scanner table with your arms above your head. A large coil will be placed around&#xD;
           your upper abdomen. You will then be moved into the magnet and will be instructed to&#xD;
           hold your breath 4-5 times (once for six seconds, once for 13 seconds, and 2-3 times for&#xD;
           about 18 seconds after the upper abdominal scans are completed, you will be moved up on&#xD;
           the table, and the coil will be placed over your lower abdomen. The same scans will be&#xD;
           acquired over this area with the same 4-5 breath holds. The total scan time for this&#xD;
           procedure is approximately 30 minutes. During the scan, you will hear loud tapping&#xD;
           noises. You will be given headphones for protection from the scanner noise and can&#xD;
           listen to music during the scan if desired. You will also be given a call button should&#xD;
           you need the MRI Technician during the exam. This scan is for research purposes only and&#xD;
           not for diagnostic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           MRS IHL (Intrahepatic lipid) (20-30 minutes):&#xD;
&#xD;
           This scan measures the amount of fat in your liver. You will change into a hospital gown&#xD;
           and remove all objects containing metal from your body. You will be placed on the&#xD;
           scanner table head first and on your stomach. The table will move you into the magnet&#xD;
           where data will be obtained. The scan will last for approximately 20-30 minutes. During&#xD;
           the scan, you will hear loud tapping noises. You will be given head phones for&#xD;
           protection from the scanner noise and can listen to music during the scan if desired.&#xD;
           You will also be given a call button should you need the MRI tech during the exam. This&#xD;
           scan is for research purposes only and not for diagnostic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           MRS IMCL (Intramyocellular lipid) (60 minutes):&#xD;
&#xD;
           This scan measures the amount of fat in your muscle fibers. You will change into a&#xD;
           hospital gown and remove all objects containing metal from your body. You will lie on&#xD;
           your back on the scanner table with the right leg in a special coil. The top part of the&#xD;
           coil will then be placed over your calf. Cushions will be inserted around the calf to&#xD;
           help keep the leg as still as possible. The table will then move you into the scanner&#xD;
           where a series of several scans will be obtained. The entire procedure will last&#xD;
           approximately 60 minutes. During the scan, you will hear loud tapping noises. You will&#xD;
           be given head phones for protection from the scanner noise and can listen to music&#xD;
           during the scan if desired. You will also be given a call button should you need the MRI&#xD;
           tech during the exam. This scan is for research purposes only and not for diagnostic&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
