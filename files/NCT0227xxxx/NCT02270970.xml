      This will be an open label, non-randomized trial of belimumab in at least 20 subjects to test&#xD;
      the feasibility of belimumab as a single agent and to capitalize on simplified background&#xD;
      treatment regimens to determine immunologic differences between patients who do versus do not&#xD;
      meet clinical response criteria.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Primary Objective: This study will determine clinical response to belimumab using the SRI 4&#xD;
      (SLE Responder Index) which was used in the Phase III belimumab trials which led to its&#xD;
      approval by the FDA. The population entered will be similar to the Phase III study population&#xD;
      However, in this case background medications will be withdrawn at entry and brief steroid&#xD;
      rescue with intramuscular depomedrol will provide immediate relief to cover the delay in&#xD;
      belimumab effects. The co-primary objectives will be to determine time to disease flare&#xD;
      compared to a historical control study (Biomarkers of Lupus Disease) and to determine whether&#xD;
      more belimumab responders (defined by the SLE Responder Index) have a 50% decrease in the&#xD;
      predefined BLAST signal (BlyS Activity Signal Test) than non-responders. This pilot study is&#xD;
      not powered to draw firm conclusions about response rates in the absence of ongoing standard&#xD;
      of care medications, but should 7-12 patients (of 20 completing the 6 month endpoint) meet&#xD;
      the SRI response criteria, the feasibility of a larger, placebo controlled trial would be&#xD;
      justified. The following instruments will be used to measure clinical lupus activity during&#xD;
      the study: BICLA, SRI 5, changes in joint counts, global SLEDAI, BILAG, CLASI, PGA, and SF-36&#xD;
      and LFA-REAL measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following are the definitions of these clinical outcome measures: SRI stands for SLE&#xD;
      Responder Index which is a composite score comprised of a 4 (or alternatively 5) point&#xD;
      decrease in the SLEDAI (SLE Disease Activity Index) coupled to no increase in the BILAG&#xD;
      (British Isles Lupus Assessment Group) Index and no more than 10% increase in the Physician's&#xD;
      Global Assessment. The global SLEDAI or BILAG is simply a comparison of the total SLEDAI or&#xD;
      numerical composite BILAG score at baseline and after receiving belimumab. The CLASI refers&#xD;
      to the Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index. the LFA REAL stands for&#xD;
      the Lupus Foundation of America Rapid Evaluation of Activity in Lupus. The latter is a pilot&#xD;
      instrument which will be tested in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also integrate exploratory biologic discovery into the clinical trial to support both&#xD;
      pre-specified and exploratory biomarker discovery. Data will be generated that might be used&#xD;
      to help select more appropriate patient subsets for future trials and to guide optimal dosing&#xD;
      strategies. Optimizing patient selection and dosing are important goals for further&#xD;
      increasing demonstrable effect size in trials by increasing the response rates in the&#xD;
      treatment groups. Thus, despite being a small pilot study, an ambitious goal is included to&#xD;
      provide potential preliminary data conducive to optimize the use of belimumab. In general&#xD;
      these analyses will also be descriptive, however our experience in the BOLD study suggests&#xD;
      that comparing a group of 6-12 patients (presumed clinical response rate) who are enriched in&#xD;
      expression of a particular biomarker vs a different group of 14-8 patients (defined in this&#xD;
      case on basis of non-response to belimumab, or in the BOLD study by assignment to IFN high vs&#xD;
      low subgroups) may, by virtue of representing different immunologic subsets of disease,&#xD;
      produce statistically significant results in mean/median values of a number of biomarkers.&#xD;
      More importantly, comparing &quot;before and after&quot; levels of BLyS and other cytokines may be&#xD;
      quite sensitive to belimumab when it has clinical impact as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtaining this kind of preliminary data to better understand optimal patient selection could&#xD;
      be a valuable approach to further increasing effect size in a future clinical trial. In fact,&#xD;
      the two Parts of this project (single agent assessment and biomarker assessment) are&#xD;
      co-dependent, since each increases the likelihood of interpretable data in patients with&#xD;
      moderate severity. Indeed Part 2 would be less feasible without the strategy of Part 1 to&#xD;
      decrease the conflicting immune signals of background medications, which have clouded&#xD;
      interpretation of many treatments for SLE in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Again, this will be an open label, six month study of belimumab treatment given to patients&#xD;
      who qualify to receive this treatment under the United States labeling. Additionally, at&#xD;
      entry to this study, patients must have a SLEDAI score of at least 6 which is identical to&#xD;
      the disease activity minimum required for belimumab Phase III studies. Entry criteria will&#xD;
      require results of a full clinical evaluation, CBC with differential, comprehensive metabolic&#xD;
      profile (including liver function tests) and urinalysis (with reflex protein/creatinine&#xD;
      ratio) prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first dose will be given within 4 weeks of the screening visit and may take place as soon&#xD;
      as the entry laboratories are returned. However, those patients who are stopping a major&#xD;
      immune suppressant and/or those who require a steroid injection at entry will be encouraged&#xD;
      to wait a minimum of 3 weeks before the initial belimumab dose. Blood samples for biomarkers&#xD;
      (see below) will be drawn at the screening visit and just prior to the first dose to maximize&#xD;
      disease assessment prior to steroid rescue as well as after withdrawal of background&#xD;
      treatments. These will provide baseline data on the BLAST expression profile for each&#xD;
      patient, which will be derived and standardized through the study of active SLE B Cells and&#xD;
      in vitro B Cell gene expression responses to BLyS signaling. The highest BLAST signal&#xD;
      recorded at either screening (prior to steroids) or baseline (after immune suppression&#xD;
      withdrawal) will be employed as the baseline BLAST signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated monthly by an investigator/subinvestigator who are trained for&#xD;
      SLEDAI, BILAG 2004, and CLASI. Additional assays will be patient reported outcomes including&#xD;
      the Short Form 36 (SF36) and the LFA REAL physician and patient endpoints. The co-primary&#xD;
      clinical endpoint will be time to flare after the last steroid injection compared to the&#xD;
      results of the BOLD study. The co-primary mechanistic endpoint will be measured at 3 months.&#xD;
      This will be a comparison of rates of BLAST 50 response (50% decrease in fold change&#xD;
      expression of BLAST panel genes as compared to healthy controls) in those who do or do not&#xD;
      meet the clinical endpoint of SRI 4 without use of off-protocol medications. The SRI 4&#xD;
      endpoint will be met by meeting both the SRI criteria and no initiation of off- protocol&#xD;
      immune suppressants or steroids. Although the stipulation of no off-protocol medications was&#xD;
      not integrated into the initial definition of SRI it was required to meet the endpoint of the&#xD;
      Phase III belimumab trials, since those who received off protocol treatments were removed&#xD;
      from those studies and counted as non-responders. This brings our primary clinical endpoint&#xD;
      in line with the intent of the primary endpoint in the Phase III belimumab studies. However&#xD;
      our patients will not necessarily be removed from study for use of off protocol medications.&#xD;
      After being designated a permanent non-responder in the primary endpoint such a patient might&#xD;
      be further followed for exploratory analysis of improvement on additive medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll patients until 20 have completed the protocol through the six month&#xD;
      point. All patients will receive belimumab 10 mg/kg at baseline, 2 weeks later, 2 weeks after&#xD;
      that and then q month. At each monthly visit history, physical, and blood tests (appropriate&#xD;
      and as scheduled) to complete the outcome measures will be performed, and adverse event&#xD;
      reporting and medication updates will be performed. Subjects may continue to take&#xD;
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (including prn NSAIDS) and up to 20 mg prednisone&#xD;
      (or oral steroid equivalent) daily at screening and during the study although steroids will&#xD;
      be tapered as tolerated. If the patient is taking hydroxychloroquine or an immune suppressant&#xD;
      (e.g. mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, leflunomide, methotrexate, or a calcineurin&#xD;
      inhibitor) at screening, these standard of care treatments must be stopped prior to the&#xD;
      baseline visit, preferably a minimum of two weeks before baseline. Patients can elect to&#xD;
      receive one or more depomedrol injection(s) up to a total of 320 mg total in individualized&#xD;
      increments beginning at the time of the screening visit (if necessary) and/or up to and&#xD;
      including the Month 2 visit. Daily oral steroids will be tapered as tolerated if and when the&#xD;
      patient begins to improve.&#xD;
