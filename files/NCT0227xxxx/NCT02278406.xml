    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if deep brain stimulation can change brain oxygen&#xD;
      levels in people with Parkinson's Disease. Measurements will be taken using a non-invasive&#xD;
      device while subjects are both on and off their medications, and while their stimulator is in&#xD;
      the on and off setting.&#xD;

      The investigators will study the effects of electrical stimulation at the subthalamic nucleus&#xD;
      on frontal cerebral perfusion in 10 patients with advanced PD who have already undergone&#xD;
      successful STN DBS (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) surgery as evidenced by a 20% or&#xD;
      greater improvement in their Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) motor sub-score&#xD;
      (UPDRS-III) with stimulation on vs off, three or more months after surgery. The UPDRS-III is&#xD;
      a widely employed and validated rating scale of Parkinson's disease symptom severity that is&#xD;
      based on the neurological examination. For the purposes of this study, a movement disorders&#xD;
      neurologist will perform all of the neurological assessments. Patients must also be&#xD;
      demonstrated to be cognitively intact as evidenced by a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)&#xD;
      Score of 24 or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an experimental study in which we will compare frontal cerebral perfusion (measured&#xD;
      non-invasively with the NIRS device) and UPDRS-III scores (as determined by neurological&#xD;
      examination) in four clinical states: medications off/stimulation off; medication&#xD;
      off/stimulation on; medication on/stimulation off; and medications on/stimulation on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary question to be answered is: Can we detect significant changes in cerebral&#xD;
      perfusion with the NIRS device in response to subthalamic stimulation delivered via implanted&#xD;
      DBS devices?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will be conducted in 10 PD patients who have undergone successful DBS&#xD;
      surgery in the past. The study will be completed in one day as detailed below and will take&#xD;
      about 6 hours to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will arrive to the movement disorders center on the morning of their scheduled study&#xD;
      visit having discontinued their medications from the night before (12 hours 'off&quot;). They will&#xD;
      arrive with their stimulators on and set to the therapeutic parameters. Dr. Shih will perform&#xD;
      a neurological examination and determine the UPDRS-III score in this, the off med/on stim&#xD;
      state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to perform the NIRS/perfusion measurements the subject will be fitted with a&#xD;
      multipart plastic helmet, which holds a number of optical fibers against the surface of the&#xD;
      subject's head. This helmet will be adjusted to fit comfortably. Additional probes will be&#xD;
      positioned on the fingers in order to monitor peripheral blood oxygenation (i.e. pulse&#xD;
      oximetry) to ensure that any changes observed in cerebral perfusion are due to changes in&#xD;
      brain physiology, not a general physiological factor. The fibers are connected to 32 low&#xD;
      power infrared laser diodes. The power emitted by these lasers is far below the typical&#xD;
      maximum permissible exposure (MPE) level for skin exposure to a laser beam, as indicated by&#xD;
      the American National Standards Institute, and subjects will not feel any effect from them.&#xD;
      The laser light will be pointed at the top of their head, and there will be no risk to their&#xD;
      eyes. The initial cerebral perfusion measurement will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's DBS devices will then be turned off and 60 min will be allowed to pass,&#xD;
      allowing for washout of both the clinical and CBF effects of DBS. During this time, cerebral&#xD;
      oxygenation will be monitored and documented every five minutes. At the end of this period&#xD;
      the UPDRS-III score will be determined (off meds/off stim) and recorded, confirming a washout&#xD;
      of the clinical effects. The DBS will then be turned on employing the settings employed for&#xD;
      therapy except that the stimulation frequency will be set to 20Hz, a low frequency that is&#xD;
      known not to be therapeutically effective in PD. All other settings will be maintained&#xD;
      constant. Again, the cerebral oxygenation will be recorded every 5 min for 60 min after which&#xD;
      the UPDRS-III score will be recorded The DBS will then be reprogrammed to the patient's&#xD;
      steady state therapeutic settings, the cerebral oxygenation will be recorded every 5 min for&#xD;
      60 min, and at the end of the 60 min period the UPDRS-III score will be recorded again,&#xD;
      completing the on stimulation/off medication evaluation. The patient will then be instructed&#xD;
      to take his/her usual dose of medications, and will be sent for lunch for one hour. After&#xD;
      lunch, the patient will return in the on medication/on stimulation state, the NIRS and pulse&#xD;
      oximetry probes will be reapplied, and the process described for the off medication state&#xD;
      will be repeated in the on medication state. After the on medication assessments are&#xD;
      completed the patient will be sent home with his/her devices on and set to their therapeutic&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
