  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to look at the effect of a treatment regimen called&#xD;
      CACTUX on head and neck cancer. The CACTUX regimen is a combination of three drugs called&#xD;
      cisplatin, nab-paclitaxel, and cetuximab (although carboplatin may be given in place of&#xD;
      cisplatin if participants have previously had problems receiving cisplatin). The use of&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel in this combination is different from routine care, in which a drug called 5FU&#xD;
      is often given instead, but the investigators group has conducted previous research where the&#xD;
      investigators incorporated nab-paclitaxel into routine treatment with cisplatin, 5FU, and&#xD;
      cetuximab. The investigators are looking at the incidence of side effects with the CACTUX&#xD;
      regimen as well as response of the disease and health status.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Currently receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known brain metastases. Patients with known brain metastases must be excluded from&#xD;
             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop&#xD;
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic&#xD;
             and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Patient must have a negative pregnancy test within 72&#xD;
             hours of start of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positivity on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the potential&#xD;
             for pharmacokinetic interactions with the study drugs. In addition, these patients are&#xD;
             at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
             Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
