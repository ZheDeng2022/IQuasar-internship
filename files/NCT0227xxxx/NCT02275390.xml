      The study aims to test the effectiveness of a nurse-led psycho-education program based on&#xD;
      motivational interviewing technique for Chinese patients with first-onset mental illness over&#xD;
      a 12-month follow-up. A randomized controlled trial will be conducted with 180 Chinese&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia newly referred to one outpatient clinic in Hong Kong. They will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to either the eight-session nurse-led psycho-education program or usual&#xD;
      psychiatric outpatient care (both n=90). The patients' general and mental health, illness&#xD;
      insight, self-efficacy, services utilization, and hospitalization rates were measured at&#xD;
      recruitment and one week, six months and 12 months post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Those who were approached in the clinic and not eligible to participate in this trial&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in another controlled trial. The controlled trial tests the&#xD;
      effects of a self-help problem-solving based bibliotherapy program (SPBB) for Chinese family&#xD;
      caregivers in recent onset psychosis (not more than 1 year onset) at one psychiatric clinic,&#xD;
      in comparison to routine outpatient service and family support (control group) for 116&#xD;
      randomly selected family caregivers of outpatients with psychotic disorders over a 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up.)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of APNs in Hong Kong is in line with nursing development internationally.&#xD;
      Since 2001, the Hospital Authority has appointed about 530 nurses as APNs, in whom about 50&#xD;
      are in mental health practice. Five of these psychiatric APNs function independently and&#xD;
      interdependently with other health care team members to excel to health educators and care&#xD;
      coordinators with fulfilments in health assessment, education and care coordination for&#xD;
      clients with noticeable mental health problems, being referred to psychiatric outpatient&#xD;
      service. A structured one-to-one psycho-education program has been developed and trial run to&#xD;
      provide early psychiatric and psychosocial intervention and support to the clients who have&#xD;
      been triaged by the psychiatric nurses in two outpatient clinics in the Kowloon East Cluster&#xD;
      as categorised as those who present noticeable mental symptoms but low risks of self-harm or&#xD;
      violence. These clients are arranged to have their first psychiatrist consultation in the&#xD;
      clinic within two to eight weeks following triage. Prior to the consultation appointment,&#xD;
      they are referred to the psychiatric APN in the nurse-led clinic for providing further&#xD;
      psychosocial health assessment and early intervention and psychological support. As estimated&#xD;
      by the clinic staff, there are 60% of the clients (i.e. 60 cases per month) triaged and&#xD;
      classified as such category in the two outpatient clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the one-to-one, nurse-led psycho-education&#xD;
      program provided by the psychiatric APN for those newly referred clients with mental health&#xD;
      problems on improving their mental and emotional conditions, quality of life, and&#xD;
      satisfaction with service, and on reducing their rates of hospitalization and default&#xD;
      follow-up in two psychiatric outpatient clinics (OPD) in Kowloon East region of Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the effects of the nurse-led psycho-education program for newly referred&#xD;
           clients with mental health problems triaged as Category 2 on improving their mental&#xD;
           state, anxiety state, insight and treatment attitude, self-efficacy in life situations,&#xD;
           general health, and utilisation of and satisfaction with mental health care services&#xD;
           provided over a period of 12 months follow-up; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the effects of the nurse-led psycho-education program on reducing the&#xD;
           clients' rate of hospitalization and default follow-up in the psychiatric OPD over the&#xD;
           12-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Note: Those are not eligible to participate in this trial will be assessed by an Advanced&#xD;
      Practice Nurse to join the randomised controlled trial with repeated measures, parallel-group&#xD;
      (2-arm) design will be carried out at one psychiatric clinic. This pilot trial aims to&#xD;
      evaluate the effects between the treatment group (i.e., a problem-solving based self-learning&#xD;
      program, SPBB) and routine outpatient service (control group) for 116 randomly selected&#xD;
      family caregivers of outpatients with recent-onset psychosis over a 6-month follow-up. The&#xD;
      study outcomes include the caregivers' burden of care, caregiving experiences, and&#xD;
      problem-solving abilities, and the patients' mental state, functioning, and&#xD;
      re-hospitalization rates. They will be measured at recruitment, one week, and 6 months&#xD;
      following the interventions. Objectives of the study are: 1. To investigate the effects of&#xD;
      the SPBB program for family caregivers of recent onset psychosis on improving their&#xD;
      caregivers' burden of care, caregiving experiences, and problem-solving abilities, and the&#xD;
      patients' mental state, and functioning over a period of 6 months follow-up; and 2. To&#xD;
      investigate the effects of the SPBB program on reducing the clients' rate of hospitalization&#xD;
      and default follow-ups in the psychiatric outpatient clinic over the 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
