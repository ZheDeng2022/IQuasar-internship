      The overall objective of this study is to determine whether serum BPA and/or phthalate&#xD;
      concentrations differ in fertile versus infertile men and women in Saskatchewan. The&#xD;
      investigators will test the following hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Serum BPA and/or phthalate concentrations will be greater in women with unexplained&#xD;
           infertility or PCOS compared to a control group&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Serum BPA and/or phthalate concentrations will be greater in men with male factor&#xD;
           infertility compared to a control group&#xD;

      Study Sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Couples undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) and/or Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection&#xD;
      (ICSI) for assisted reproduction at ARTUS as well as healthy male and female volunteers 18-43&#xD;
      years of age will be asked to participate. In order for infertility patients to be eligible,&#xD;
      both the male and female partners must agree to participate. Couples with a combination of&#xD;
      both male and female factor infertility will not be eligible to participate. Couples&#xD;
      undergoing infertility treatment for the following reasons will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  unexplained infertility (n=15 men, n=15 women)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PCOS (n=15 men, n=15 women)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Male factor infertility (n=15 men, n=15 women)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Couples with male factor infertility will serve as controls for the female comparisons (i.e.,&#xD;
      follicular fluid analyses), and couples with PCOS will serve as controls for the male&#xD;
      comparisons (i.e., seminal plasma analyses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional participants will be assigned to the following control groups (for blood sample&#xD;
      analyses):&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Healthy volunteers with no history or current diagnosis of reproductive dysfunction (n=15&#xD;
      men, n=15 women)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infertile couples will be recruited from the clinical practices of Drs. Allison Case and&#xD;
      Adrian Gamelin at the Assisted Reproductive Technologies Centre at the University of&#xD;
      Saskatchewan (ARTUS). Posters for recruiting ARTUS patients will also be placed in the&#xD;
      waiting room and examining rooms in the Dept of OB/GYN, Division of REI. Healthy male and&#xD;
      female volunteers will be recruited from advertisements on the PAWS website at the University&#xD;
      of Saskatchewan and Health E-News newsletters in the Saskatoon Health Region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be asked to visit the ARTUS Centre for a pre-study appointment. At&#xD;
      this appointment, study procedures will be discussed with participants and consent will be&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and follicular fluid samples will be obtained from female partners of infertile&#xD;
      couples. Blood and seminal plasma samples will be obtained from male partners of infertile&#xD;
      couples. Only blood samples will be collected from healthy men and women. All samples will be&#xD;
      collected in both fertile and infertile couples over a 2 week time interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Infertile couples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infertile couples participating in this study will undergo fertility treatment as per the&#xD;
      normal standard of care. In other words, the fertility medications, ultrasound assessments,&#xD;
      blood work during treatment, oocyte retrieval, semen collection, laboratory procedures and&#xD;
      embryo transfer procedures will not be affected by participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the male and female partner will be asked to provide 1 extra blood sample (approximately&#xD;
      7 mL or 1 teaspoon of blood) on each of the following regularly-scheduled appointments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First ultrasound visit (approximately day 1 of FSH therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Day of egg retrieval&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Day of embryo transfer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women normally undergo regular blood draws during their IVF treatment; therefore, one&#xD;
      additional tube will be drawn for research purposes at the regularly-scheduled blood draw&#xD;
      appointments. Men do not normally provide a blood sample during IVF treatment, but will be&#xD;
      asked to do so in this study. Blood draws will be performed by phlebotomists (staff that&#xD;
      specialize in drawing blood) at Royal University Hospital, physicians, nurses and/or&#xD;
      researchers with training in phlebotomy. The blood samples will be processed to remove the&#xD;
      cells, and the serum will be frozen for 12-24 months until the completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follicles in the woman's ovaries will be drained and the eggs will be retrieved from the&#xD;
      follicular fluid, as per the standard of care. After the eggs are collected, the follicular&#xD;
      fluid is normally thrown away. In this study, we will collect the fluid from the follicles on&#xD;
      each ovary after the eggs are retrieved. The follicular fluid will be frozen for 12-24 months&#xD;
      until study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A semen sample will be provided by the man on the day of the oocyte retrieval procedure, as&#xD;
      per standard of care. The semen sample is processed by allowing the semen to pass through a&#xD;
      column to separate the most motile sperm (moving very quickly) from the less motile and&#xD;
      non-motile sperm. The seminal plasma is the fluid portion of the semen that remains after the&#xD;
      most motile sperm have been obtained. The seminal plasma is normally thrown away after the&#xD;
      motile sperm are obtained. In this study, we will collect the seminal plasma and freeze it&#xD;
      for 12-24 months until the study is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Healthy Volunteers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers will be asked to provide 1 blood sample (approximately 7 mL or 1 teaspoon&#xD;
      of blood) on 3 separate days. Blood draws will be performed by physicians, nurses and/or&#xD;
      researchers with training in phlebotomy (i.e., drawing blood). Appointments for blood draws&#xD;
      will be made approximately 4-7 days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of the study all of the frozen blood, follicular fluid, and seminal plasma&#xD;
      samples will be transported to the Toxicology Center at the University of Saskatchewan. The&#xD;
      levels of exposure to BPA and phthalates will be evaluated. The samples will be destroyed&#xD;
      upon completion of the study. The expected duration of study participation is approximately&#xD;
      13-20 days (in accordance with standard fertility therapy) for fertility patients and 3 days&#xD;
      for healthy volunteers. All samples will be obtained over a 2 week time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Include a summary of the primary and secondary end-points/outcomes, the planned sample size&#xD;
      (with justification) and planned statistical and interim analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure to phthalates will be determined by quantifying concentrations of 5 different&#xD;
      pthalates. Concentrations of Bisphenol A (BPA), di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), di-n-octyl&#xD;
      phthalate (DNOP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DNBP), n-butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), diethyl&#xD;
      phthalate (DEP), diisononyl phthalate (DINP) and diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP) will be&#xD;
      quantified in the blood cells, blood plasma, and follicular fluid (individual and pooled&#xD;
      samples) by use of liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry methods already&#xD;
      developed in our laboratory. Analyses will be conducted by use of an Agilent 1200 series High&#xD;
      Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system interfaced to an ABI SCIEX 3200 triple&#xD;
      quadrapole mass spectrometer system or to a QToF II quadrapole time of flight mass&#xD;
      spectrometer (Micromass, Beverly MD). Toxicant concentrations will be the dependent&#xD;
      variables. Reproductive status (i.e, unexplained infertility, PCOS, male factor infertility,&#xD;
      controls) will be the independent variable. Concentrations of BPA and phthalates in blood&#xD;
      cells, blood plasma, seminal plasma and pooled follicular fluid will be compared between&#xD;
      study groups using multivariate Analyses of Variance (ANOVA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      n=15 per group is appropriate for conducting this pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Significance/Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Greater knowledge about the possible effects of BPA and phthalates on reproductive function&#xD;
      may increase our understanding of the causes of infertility, assist in preventing&#xD;
      reproductive disease, and optimize reproductive health, which will thereby improve patient&#xD;
      care. We believe that the results of our study, whether positive or negative, will be of&#xD;
      interest to the general public, health professionals and scientific community.&#xD;
