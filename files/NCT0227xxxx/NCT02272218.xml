      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate laparoscopic gastric banding (LAGB) surgery&#xD;
      as a treatment option for obese patients with pain from knee osteoarthritis (KOA) refractory&#xD;
      to medical treatment. The primary outcome will be the reduction in OA-related pain and&#xD;
      disability after LAGB.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of 15 (may need to consent/screen 30 patients to have 15 enrolled)&#xD;
      obese patients (BMI 30-40) with painful knee osteoarthritis. Although prior studies have&#xD;
      reported musculoskeletal secondary outcomes following various types of bariatric surgery,&#xD;
      investigators propose the evaluation of laparoscopic gastric banding (LAGB) to treat a cohort&#xD;
      of patients with moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once eligible patients are identified by rheumatologists and/or bariatric team and consented&#xD;
      for the study, they will have bilateral knee radiographs (standard of care) to ensure they&#xD;
      have a sufficient degree of OA. Patients will then be referred to the bariatric surgeons, who&#xD;
      will then confirm the patients' interest, understanding and suitability for the LAGB surgery&#xD;
      which is a FDA approved procedurefor patients with a BMI &gt;30 and at least one obesity-related&#xD;
      comorbidity (including knee OA)37. It is the application of this approved procedure that&#xD;
      constitutes the research question should LAGB surgery be considered as a treatment option to&#xD;
      improve pain and physical disability in patients with knee OA? During the pre-operative&#xD;
      process patients will be given study questionnaires to evaluate knee pain and function, have&#xD;
      a musculoskeletal exam and blood/urine will be collected.These procedures will be repeated at&#xD;
      post-operative intervals to track response of the knees to the LAGB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is improvement in OA-related knee pain and physical disability.&#xD;
      Improvement of pain and function will be defined by changes in the VAS, WOMAC, AORC and KOOS&#xD;
      scores. The degree of improvement required to qualify as such will be described in the&#xD;
      methods sections below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures include (1) radiographic evidence of OA progression or worsening&#xD;
      despite the LABG, (2) weight loss, and (3) reduction or discontinuation of pain medication.&#xD;
