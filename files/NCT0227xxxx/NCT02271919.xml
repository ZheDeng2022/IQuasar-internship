    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot phase IV trial studies the side effects and how well varenicline works&#xD;
      compared to nicotine replacement therapy in helping patients that smoke to quit. Varenicline&#xD;
      is a drug that acts the same way as nicotine in the brain but is not habit-forming. Nicotine&#xD;
      replacement therapy consists of nicotine patches and lozenges. It is not yet known if&#xD;
      varenicline is more effective than nicotine replacement therapy in helping patients quit&#xD;
      smoking.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the main effects of varenicline 2 mg (VAR) and nicotine patch + lozenge (NPL)&#xD;
      on smokers who remain on these medications throughout the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the probability that abstinence at twelve weeks as a function of treatment&#xD;
      assignment at six weeks (augmentation) is moderated by initial treatment assignment (i.e. at&#xD;
      baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate the probability that abstinence at twelve weeks as a function of treatment&#xD;
      assignment at six weeks (switching) is moderated by initial treatment assignment (i.e. at&#xD;
      baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To estimate the probability that treatment continuation, switching, or augmentation&#xD;
      confers benefit conditional upon failing to quit after the initial treatment with nicotine&#xD;
      patch + lozenge (NPL) for six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To estimate the probability that treatment continuation, switching, or augmentation&#xD;
      confers benefit conditional upon failing to quit after initial treatment with VAR for six&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients receive varenicline orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID),&#xD;
      placebo patches QD, and placebo lozenges PO QD beginning on day 9 and continue for 6 weeks.&#xD;
      Patients that are abstinent at week 6 may continue treatment for an additional 6 weeks.&#xD;
      Patients also receive behavioral smoking cessation counseling consisting of 4 in-person&#xD;
      visits, 4 phone visits, and 4 brief supportive phone calls lasting 10-15 minutes each over&#xD;
      the 12 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients receive placebo tablets PO QD or BID, nicotine patches QD, and nicotine&#xD;
      lozenges PO QD beginning on day 9 and continue for 6 weeks. Patients that are abstinent at&#xD;
      week 6 may continue treatment for an additional 6 weeks. Patients also receive behavioral&#xD;
      smoking cessation counseling consisting of 4 in-person visits, 4 phone visits, and 4 brief&#xD;
      supportive phone calls lasting 10-15 minutes each over the 12 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who fail to achieve abstinence at week 6 are re-randomized to receive 6 additional&#xD;
      weeks of therapy consisting of either a continuation of the same treatment; switching to the&#xD;
      untried intervention (either NPL or varenicline); or receive NPL treatment with an additional&#xD;
      patch (high-dose NPL) or high-dose varenicline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;

             prescriptions for opiates, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, amphetamines or methadone&#xD;
             will not be excluded; b. participants failing the toxicology screen will be allowed to&#xD;

             physician may clear participant to continue on if there is a reasonable possibility&#xD;
             the positive drug screen is the result of cross-reactivity with the participant's&#xD;
