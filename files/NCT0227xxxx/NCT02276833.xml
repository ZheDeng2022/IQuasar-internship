    <textblock>
      Autologous adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) was used to treat 10&#xD;
      osteoarthritic knees of grade II or III (K-L scale) under IRB-approved protocol in a&#xD;
      feasibility and safety study. The adipose-derived SVF was obtained through disaggregation of&#xD;
      lipoaspirate and resuspension of the SVF in 3 ml of Lactated Ringer's Solution, with a mean&#xD;
      of 48 million nucleated SVF cells and a mean viability of 78%, injected per knee. Cell&#xD;
      suspension was injected into the intra-articular space using ultrasound guidance. At 12 weeks&#xD;
      post-op all 10 knees showed decreased pain and increased mobility, both statistically&#xD;
      significant (α = .01). Nine of ten knees reported either maximum possible or very significant&#xD;
      decrease in pain. No infections, acute pain flares, or other adverse events were reported.&#xD;
      Patient ages ranged from 52 - 69 years with a mean of 59 years.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adipose Harvest. Using no oral or parenteral sedation, standard wetting solution (1 liter&#xD;
      Lactated Ringer's, 50 milligrams of 1% lidocaine, and 1 cc of 1:1000 epinephrine) was infused&#xD;
      through small incisions created with the tip of a #11 scalpel blade in the abdomen or flank&#xD;
      using a standard multi-hole infusion cannula. A super-wet plus technique (2 volumes of&#xD;
      wetting solution to 1 volume of proposed fat aspirate) was used to infuse the solution into&#xD;
      the deep and superficial fat compartments. Twenty minutes was allowed for maximum&#xD;
      vasoconstrictive effect of the epinephrine. Fat was harvested using standard&#xD;
      Suctioned-Assisted Liposuction (SAL) method with a 3mm cannula at approximately .5 - .7&#xD;
      atmosphere of vacuum, aspirating approximately 200-300 cc of lipoaspirate into a sterile&#xD;
      tissue processing container (GID SVF-1, Lousiville, CO) for each knee to be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adipose processing method. Lipoaspirate was harvested and processed all the way to the&#xD;
      generation of the SVF within a single GID SVF-1 sterile disposable device. The GID SVF-1 unit&#xD;
      contains the washing mechanism, the mesh filter, and the centrifuge capability in the same&#xD;
      device. After harvest the lipoaspirate was washed three times with 37C Lactated Ringer's&#xD;
      Solution with 20 mg Cipro and 5,000 units heparin per liter and the fluid portion removed&#xD;
      using the mesh filter system, leaving dry adipose inside the canister. The canister was&#xD;
      weighed to determine the amount of dry adipose available for further processing. The washed&#xD;
      adipose was disaggregated using Type I collagenase (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) at a&#xD;
      concentration of 200 CDU/ml of total catalytic volume where total catalytic volume is the&#xD;
      volume of the adipose tissue plus an equal volume of 37C Lactated Ringer's Solution. The&#xD;
      collagenase was injected into the canister through a sterile .22 micron filter (Millex-MP,&#xD;
      Millipore, Cork, Ireland). The device with adipose, buffer, and collagenase was then placed&#xD;
      into an incubated shaker for 40 minutes at 38C at 150 RPM, see Figure 1. After disaggregation&#xD;
      human albumin solution was added to achieve a concentration of 2.5% and stop any further&#xD;
      collagenase activity. The device was then centrifuged at 800 g for 10 minutes. The&#xD;
      supernatant, including all floating cells and debris and the aqueous phase, was removed using&#xD;
      a port on the top of the device and discarded. The SVF pellet at the bottom was resuspended&#xD;
      in 10 ml of sterile LR accessed via the central port on the device using a 14G 5.5 inch&#xD;
      spinal needle (Abbocath-T, Hospira, Sligo, Ireland). A sample of 0.5 ml of the resuspension&#xD;
      was collected in a 1.5 cc Eppendorf tube to be used for cell counting and assay. The&#xD;
      resuspended SVF cells were concentrated into a 3 ml dose using a sterile 15 ml Falcon tube at&#xD;
      400 g for 4 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SVF counting method. The SVF cell count and viability was assessed using an ADAM MC image&#xD;
      cytometry system (Bulldog Bio, Portsmouth, NH). The ADAM MC uses propidium iodide staining to&#xD;
      count viable and non-viable nucleated cells. A 100 µL aliquot of the assay sample was diluted&#xD;
      with a 1:5 ratio (1 part sample to 5 parts sterile LR) to adjust the sample within the&#xD;
      operating limits of the ADAM MC. The differential stains were applied and aliquots loaded&#xD;
      into the disposable cassette that is utilized with the ADAM device. The results from the ADAM&#xD;
      counting device provide the concentration of SVF cells in the resuspension syringe and the&#xD;
      percentage viability. The total volume of the resuspension in the syringe was multiplied by&#xD;
      the concentration to give the total number of resuspended mononucleated cells (no adipose&#xD;
      cells, no RBCs, and no fragments included in the counting process).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injection and image guidance method. The patient was placed in the supine position and the&#xD;
      area over the lateral suprapatellar region of the knee was prepared in the usual sterile&#xD;
      fashion using an iodine prep solution (1% Iodophor) followed by a 70% Isopropyl Alcohol&#xD;
      solution. This location was used due to ease of access into the intra-articular space and to&#xD;
      avoid injecting into the fat pad of the knee. No sedation or pain medication was administered&#xD;
      to the patient. An ethylchloride topical anesthetic was sprayed on the lateral knee until the&#xD;
      skin color changed to white. Lidocaine local anesthetic was injected using a 25 gauge needle&#xD;
      to numb the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Using an M-Turbo Sonosite ultrasound system, the&#xD;
      joint space was identified and under live ultrasound guidance the knee was aspirated using an&#xD;
      18 gauge/1.5 inch needle, if fluids were available for aspiration. Then all of the 3 cc of&#xD;
      buffered solution of SVF was slowly injected into the intra-articular space through the same&#xD;
      18 gauge/1.5 inch needle. The needle was then be removed and direct pressure over the&#xD;
      injection site will placed for approximately ten (10) seconds. Hemostasis after injection was&#xD;
      confirmed, and then the injection site was cleaned with an alcohol wipe and covered with a&#xD;
      sterile band-aid. The patient was given crutches and asked to be non-weight bearing on the&#xD;
      injected knee for two (2) days. The patient was allowed to bend and flex the knee as long as&#xD;
      non-weight bearing condition is maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain and mobility assessment methods. Assessment of knee pain was done using the PROMIS pain&#xD;
      instruments, a validated pain scale system developed under funding by the NIH. PROMIS&#xD;
      (Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) is a system for measures of&#xD;
      patient reported health status for physical, mental, and social well-being, including three&#xD;
      measurements of pain (www.nihpromis.org). The PROMIS Pain Intensity instrument (3a) assesses&#xD;
      how much a person hurts. The PROMIS Pain Behavior instrument (Bank 1.0) measures behaviors&#xD;
      that indicate to others that an individual is experiencing pain. The PROMIS Pain Interference&#xD;
      instrument (Bank 1.0) measures the consequences of pain on relevant aspects of one's life.&#xD;
      Patient responses are converted to numeric values in a validated scale. Responses to each&#xD;
      question in a pain instrument range from 1 to 5 (1=not at all, 2=a little bit, 3=somewhat,&#xD;
      4=quite a bit, 5=very much), and are summed over the number of questions in the bank to&#xD;
      create a raw score. The raw score is converted to a standardized score using an iterative&#xD;
      response method with a mean of 50 and SD of 10, based on a large sample of the general&#xD;
      population of the United States. The validated PROMIS pain scales provide interval data and&#xD;
      allows calculation of the mean and SD, and use of t-tests of significance. Data was recorded&#xD;
      pre-operatively (time 0), and at follow-up points at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally patients were asked to respond to a pain and mobility questionnaire with one&#xD;
      question on pain and one question on mobility. The questionnaire asked the patient to compare&#xD;
      their increase/decrease in pain and mobility relative to before surgery, using a ± 1-5 scale,&#xD;
      see Figure 2. On this scale negative numbers correspond to decreasing pain/mobility, and&#xD;
      positive numbers correspond to increasing pain/mobility. This questionnaire provides ordinal&#xD;
      data and allows calculation of the median and significance using Wilcoxon Ranked Sums&#xD;
      nonparametric testing.&#xD;
