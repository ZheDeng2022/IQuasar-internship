  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of simeprevir in combination with&#xD;
      sofosbuvir for 8 or 12 weeks versus a historical control, with respect to the percentage of&#xD;
      participants with sustained virologic response at 12 weeks after end of treatment (SVR12) in&#xD;
      the overall population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a partly randomized, open-label (identity of study drug will be known to volunteer&#xD;
      and study staff), multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a&#xD;
      medical research study) study. The study will consist of a screening period of up to 4 weeks,&#xD;
      an open-label treatment period of 8 weeks or 12 weeks, and a post-treatment follow-up period&#xD;
      until 24 weeks after end of treatment (EOT). Participants without cirrhosis will be assigned&#xD;
      to Group A wherein half of the participants will receive 8 week treatment in Group A1 and&#xD;
      remaining participants will receive 12 week treatment in Group A2. Participants with&#xD;
      cirrhosis, will be assigned to Group B to receive simeprevir in combination with sofosbuvir&#xD;
      for 12 weeks. The duration of participation for each participant, including the screening&#xD;
      period, will be approximately 36 or 40 weeks for 8 or 12 week treatment, respectively.&#xD;
      Efficacy will be primarily assessed by percentage of participants with SVR12. Participants'&#xD;
      safety will be evaluated throughout the study.&#xD;
