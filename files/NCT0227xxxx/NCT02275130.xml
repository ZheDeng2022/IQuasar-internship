  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The voice is an indispensable source of human communication. Current time puts high demands&#xD;
      on the quality of voice in most professions. Organic or functional changes of vocal cords&#xD;
      associated with their insufficiency lead to a deterioration of voice quality, voice fatigue,&#xD;
      hoarseness or breathing difficulties. This has adverse psychological, social and economic&#xD;
      consequences for the patient, the employer and its surroundings. The injection techniques can&#xD;
      be performed under general and local anaesthesia. The defined injectable substance is&#xD;
      inserted directly in the vocal cords, which increases its volume and results in an almost&#xD;
      immediate improvement of the voice quality. For injection can be used various materials, e.g.&#xD;
      autologous fat, calcium hydroxyapatite, silicone, and others. Injection techniques are less&#xD;
      invasive, associated with less perioperative morbidity. Operation can be also performed under&#xD;
      local anaesthesia in selected patients, therefore is preferred for patients with multiple&#xD;
      comorbidities and risk of general anaesthesia.&#xD;

      The causes of glottic insufficiency (vocal fold insufficiency) may be paresis (immobility) of&#xD;
      one or both vocal folds (of iatrogenic aetiology after thyroid surgery, neck operations or&#xD;
      ingrowth of malignant tumours of the chest or mediastinum, idiopathic after viral infections&#xD;
      or central neuropathy) and atrophy (loss of mass) of the vocal cords, which particularly&#xD;
      affect older patients. Surgical treatment of insufficiency is indicated for patients in whom&#xD;
      conservative treatment is ineffective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical treatment of vocal fold insufficiency is carried out in two ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  By thyroplasty type I, operations performed mostly under general anaesthesia, by the&#xD;
           external access to the neck with the insertion of a silicone block through the thyroid&#xD;
           cartilage into the space next to the vocal cords, which moves it medially.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Augmentation of the vocal cords, at which an insertion of an own (fat, cartilage, etc.)&#xD;
           or a foreign (Gore-Tex, silicone, etc.) material laterally from the vocal cords can&#xD;
           facilitate a change in the position of the vocal cords. In recent years, more and more&#xD;
           so-called augmentation injection techniques are preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While thyroplasty has been carried out in the Czech Republic for 10-15 years, the clinicians&#xD;
      have had only limited experience with the injection techniques, which has been used for&#xD;
      several years only and information about the functional results are still insufficient to&#xD;
      date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The working hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Augmentation of vocal folds with hydroxyapatite leads to significant improvements in&#xD;
           subjective and objective parameters of voice&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Augmentation of vocal folds with hydroxyapatite is a method comparable with other&#xD;
           methods of treatment of glottic insufficiency (thyroplasty type 1, vocal folds&#xD;
           augmentation with autologous fat)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Augmentation of vocal folds with hydroxyapatite can be performed under local anaesthesia&#xD;
           The objective of the study is to determine the functional effect of augmented vocal&#xD;
           folds with calcium hydroxyapatite (&quot;Radiesse Voice&quot;) by comparing selected defined&#xD;
           parameters preoperatively and postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other anticipated benefits of the study treatment include improving the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients (improved voice quality, breathing, improve of mental state, preventing of social&#xD;
      isolation and economic consequences). It will also lead to the introduction of new processes,&#xD;
      materials and methods. It is also possible to expect shortening of the hospital stay,&#xD;
      decrease in postoperative morbidity, and the possibility to perform the procedure on an&#xD;
      outpatient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been designed as a prospective study, which is in conformity with the&#xD;
      principles and guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration, good clinical practice and has been&#xD;
      approved by the Ethical Committee of the University Hospital Ostrava.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients enrolled in the study will be followed for the period of twelve months.&#xD;
