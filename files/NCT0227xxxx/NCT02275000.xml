  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to develop and assess the feasibility of a physiotherapy&#xD;
      intervention for people with functional motor symptoms (also known as psychogenic&#xD;
      neurological symptoms and conversion disorder). Participants will be randomised to receive&#xD;
      the intervention or a &quot;treatment as usual&quot; control.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited from outpatient neurology clinics at Queen Square. Those who&#xD;
      consent to take part will complete baseline outcome measures (Time 1) before being randomised&#xD;
      to either a Treatment as Usual control group or the Intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment as Usual group -&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants will be directed to online patient information resources&#xD;
           (www.neurosymptoms.org)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants will be placed on the waiting list to be assessed for the inpatient&#xD;
           treatment programme for functional symptoms at The National Hospital for Neurology and&#xD;
           Neurosurgery. The waitlist is currently greater than 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A referral is made to local community therapy services (which may include physiotherapy,&#xD;
           occupational therapy and psychological therapy). If the participant has had contact from&#xD;
           their community therapy services in the previous 12 months, a letter summarising the&#xD;
           participant's diagnosis and physiotherapy needs will be sent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Participants will be asked to return at 4 weeks to complete outcome measures for a&#xD;
           second time (Time 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A referral to community therapy for such patients is usual practice in the UK, although the&#xD;
      form in which the community therapy is provided tends to be inconsistent across the UK. In&#xD;
      most cases it will entail between 1 and 8 outpatient or domiciliary physiotherapy&#xD;
      appointments. Some communities will have access to Occupational Therapy, which may entail&#xD;
      supported practice and advice to increase independence with functional tasks and the&#xD;
      provision of equipment. The provision of community therapy to participants will be monitored&#xD;
      through the CSRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Group -&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants allocated to the intervention group, a 5 day admission on the Day Hospital&#xD;
      at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery is arranged. The physiotherapy&#xD;
      intervention will take place in the physiotherapy department. Participants will be admitted&#xD;
      individually (and not in groups). Outside of physiotherapy times participants are encouraged&#xD;
      to rest in the day hospital and complete a workbook. A single independent physiotherapist&#xD;
      will be trained to deliver the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant (+/- family member) will attend an initial meeting with the consultant&#xD;
      neurologist and the treating physiotherapist. The neurologist will perform a brief&#xD;
      neurological assessment and confirm the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The diagnosis will be explained again to the patient, using the word &quot;functional&quot; to&#xD;
           describe the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Physical signs of FMS will be demonstrated to the patient. This includes&#xD;
           distractibility, Hoover's sign and entrainment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The treatment programme will be explained to the patient, linking resolution of symptoms&#xD;
           with treatment rationale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The participant will attend 8-9 physiotherapy sessions over the 5 days. The intervention&#xD;
           is a combination of education on functional motor symptoms, movement retraining and&#xD;
           development of a self management plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. After the final physiotherapy session, the participant will complete the outcome&#xD;
           measures (Time 2) and a feedback form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will be followed up at 6 months after recruitment to the study (Time 3). An&#xD;
      independent assessor will administer the outcome measures.&#xD;
