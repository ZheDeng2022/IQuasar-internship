      Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and multifocal motor neuropathy&#xD;
      (MMN) are characterized by progressive deterioration in muscle strength, loss of sensibility,&#xD;
      diminished or absent reflexes and impaired fine motor control. Often it is caused by&#xD;
      demyelination which is suitable for treatment but damage to the axons may also occur&#xD;
      especially in case of insufficient treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CIDP and MMN are immune mediated neuropathies in which first choice of treatment is&#xD;
      intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), although the mechanisms underlying the effect of the IVIG&#xD;
      is not yet clarified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are diagnosed by electrophysiological examination and elevated level of protein&#xD;
      in the cerebrospinal fluid. The diagnosis may be difficult to make due to great clinical&#xD;
      variation and insensitive examinations methods including lack of biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to define if patients treated with SCIG and IVIG for CIDP and&#xD;
      MMN have higher concentrations of sCD163 and CD19 in their cerebrospinal fluid and serum&#xD;
      compared with symptomatic control subjects and is related to disease severity. Furthermore it&#xD;
      is to define if patients newly diagnosed with CIDP or MMN have higher levels of sCD163 and&#xD;
      CD19, than patients treated regularly with SCIG and IVIG.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic inflammatory peripheral neuropathies are characterized by progressive deterioration&#xD;
      in muscle strength, loss of sensibility, diminished or absent reflexes and impaired fine&#xD;
      motor control. Often it is caused by demyelination which is suitable for treatment but damage&#xD;
      to the axons may also occur especially in case of insufficient treatment. Chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and multifocal motor neuropathy&#xD;
      (MMN) are diagnosed by electrophysiological examination, which shows signs of demyelination&#xD;
      and conduction blocks. Moreover, in CIDP an elevated level of protein in the cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid and in MMN detection of anti-GM1 antibodies in the blood support the diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients suffer from a disabling diffuse weakness of the muscles. The diagnosis primarily&#xD;
      relies on the neurophysiological examination and, however, the diagnosis may be difficult to&#xD;
      make due to great clinical variation and insensitive examinations methods including lack of&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of CIDP and MMN CIDP and MMN are immune mediated neuropathies in which first choice&#xD;
      of treatment is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), although the mechanisms underlying the&#xD;
      effect of the IVIG is not yet clarified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous study implies that Fc receptors on natural killer cells is the target for IVIG,&#xD;
      because the cytotoxic activity of NK cells was suppressed, partly caused by a dose-dependent&#xD;
      decline in the number of circulating NK cells. Furthermore, a dose-dependent blockage of CD16&#xD;
      was present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subcutaneous administration of immunoglobulins (SCIG) has been studied as an alternative&#xD;
      route to IVIG in CIDP and MMN. The conclusion was that SCIG is feasible, safe and effective.&#xD;
      Thus SCIG improved muscle strength, walking performance and disability score compared to&#xD;
      placebo and IVIG. SCIG has only local side effects compared to IVIG and furthermore the&#xD;
      majority of patients preferred SCIG to IVIG, because of autonomy and maintenance of stable&#xD;
      levels of muscle performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that around 30% of CIDP patients over year no longer need treatment to&#xD;
      maintain muscle strength. Immunoglobulin treatment is costly and may, when administrated&#xD;
      intravenously, induce severe side effects (e.g. thromboembolism, hemolytic anemia and&#xD;
      exfoliative dermatitis). Therefore only patients that clearly respond should be treated. On&#xD;
      the other hand, it is important to treat in time to reduce morbidity and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Present examination methods Patients suspected for CIDP or MMN will be diagnosed based on the&#xD;
      medical history, clinical examinations and neurophysiological findings. However, the&#xD;
      diagnosis includes a plethora of criteria, which illustrates the difficulty of developing&#xD;
      exact standards for CIDP and MMN that may have variable clinical presentations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, as described earlier electrophysiological examination is recommended for all&#xD;
      patients suspected for CIDP or MMN. The electrophysiological criteria consist of partial&#xD;
      conduction block, conduction velocity slowing, dispersion and distance dependent reduction of&#xD;
      compound motor action potential amplitude. As for the medical history and clinical&#xD;
      examinations, the electrophysiological examination is not always conclusive. The Koski&#xD;
      criteria and the criteria from EFNS /PNS are two different sets of criteria, which are&#xD;
      frequently used. Even so it is important to keep in mind that the Koski criteria have a&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of 63 and 99 percent, whereas the EFNS had a sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of 81 and 97 percent. In addition to this, early treatment for CIDP has made the&#xD;
      progression more difficult to characterize as a temporal component has been changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is still controversial whether CIDP and MMN are specific disease entities or rather&#xD;
      syndromes. MMN is in many ways similar to CIDP but as opposed to CIDP MMN is characterized by&#xD;
      no sensory disturbance, slower progression and with asymmetric presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific causes of the diseases are still unknown but it is generally accepted that the&#xD;
      pathologies of CIDP and MMN are immunologically based with multiple triggers. According to&#xD;
      this theory both the cellular and the humoral part of the immune system is involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several inflammatory biomarkers have been studied in relation to CIDP Including cytokines in&#xD;
      CSF. The study measured Interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-15 (the major growth and differentiation&#xD;
      factors for Th-1 cells) and IL-17 (a marker of Th-17 cell expansion and activation).&#xD;
      Especially IL-12 was found to be involved as potential marker of immune activation in CIDP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nerve biopsy has also been used in search of in situ biomarkers. The conclusion was that even&#xD;
      though the total numbers of inflammatory cells did not distinguish well between CIDP and&#xD;
      non-inflammatory neuropathies, the pattern of macrophage clusters around endoneurial vessels&#xD;
      could be a simple marker of inflammation with good sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, another study has found that CIDP is associated with a high level of haptoglobin&#xD;
      in the CSF. The underlying mechanisms behind this has not yet been clarified. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      this opens for haptoglobin as a possible useful biomarker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cluster of differentiation 19 (CD-19)- a promising B cell target! A study on spontaneous&#xD;
      autoimmune polyneuropathy (SAP) in B7-2 knock- out non-obese diabetes mice, which is an&#xD;
      animal model and mimics the chronic progressive form of human CIDP, has showed that treatment&#xD;
      with anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody (mAb) results in depletion of B-cells and plasmablasts&#xD;
      accompanied by decreased serum IgG and IgM levels and depletion of P0-specific plasmablasts&#xD;
      and B-cells. CD-19 is a protein found on the surface of normal and neoplastic B-cells, from&#xD;
      the early pre-B cell stage of development through to the early stages of plasma cell&#xD;
      differentiation. The majority of B-cell lineage malignancies express CD19 at high levels.&#xD;
      Therefore, CD19 is a broad marker of the B-cell lineage and represents a potentially&#xD;
      important target for unconjugated mAb immunoteraphy. In another study by stimulating the CD19&#xD;
      B cell isolated from blood samples of CIDP patients, the B-cell immunoreactivity was enhanced&#xD;
      but within 3 days of IVIG infusions, the B-cell level in CIDP was downregulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cluster of differentiation 163 (CD-163) - a new way to measure CIDP and MMN? CD-163 is a&#xD;
      scavenger receptor (recognizes and uptakes macromolecules) which marks the&#xD;
      monocyte-macrophage activation. CD163 works for macrophages as a receptor for&#xD;
      hemoglobin-haptoglobin complexes. The soluble form of the receptor is called sCD163 and is&#xD;
      found in plasma, where it is found to be up regulated in a large range of inflammatory&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Values which is Increased strongly (&gt;20mg/l) is seen in diseases like macrophage activating&#xD;
      syndrome, haemophagocytic syndrome and acute hepatic failure. Furthermore, the level of&#xD;
      sCD163 reflects the activity of the disease. Patients with increasing and high values are&#xD;
      found to have unfavorable prognosis. Increased values (5-20 mg/l) are seen in hepatic&#xD;
      disease, sepsis and Gaucher's disease. Septic patients with values greater than 10 mg/l have&#xD;
      a 10 times greater risk of fatal outcome. Values which is slightly increased (3-5 mg/l) is&#xD;
      often seen in inflammatory of infectious conditions and in cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Patients treated with SCIG for CIDP and MMN have higher concentrations of sCD163&#xD;
      and CD19 in their cerebrospinal fluid and serum compared with healthy control subjects and is&#xD;
      related to disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients newly diagnosed with CIDP or MMN have higher levels of sCD163 and CD19, than&#xD;
      patients treated regularly with SCIG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose To define the concentration of sCD163 and CD19 in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum&#xD;
      in patients with CIDP or MMN compared with controls (patients with unspecified neurological&#xD;
      symptoms or disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Data Sources Data used in this study will originate from several sources, such as the&#xD;
      Danish Civil Registration Registry, the Danish National Patient Registry and the Danish&#xD;
      national prescription registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information from the medical record will be included and used in this project including past&#xD;
      medical history, actual use of drugs, results of biochemical analyses and brain imaging,&#xD;
      abnormalities at the clinical examinations and the conclusions from the doctors diagnostic&#xD;
      workup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of four subgroups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment All participants will receive information about the project and will be asked to&#xD;
      give their content to participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive written and oral information about the study. The oral information&#xD;
      will take place at Department of Neurology, Aarhus Universitetshospital. Moreover, the&#xD;
      pamphlet &quot; Før du deltager i et sundhedsvidenskabeligt forsøg&quot;(about participating in a&#xD;
      clinical trial) will be handed out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information will be given by consultant Henning Andersen, MD Lars Makrvardsen or stud.&#xD;
      med Malalai Musleh . It is possible for the participants to bring a companion and they are&#xD;
      offered one week to consider the participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to patient records will be requested, which will be provided in the written&#xD;
      information material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If new knowledge about disadvantages of participating in the study appears the participants&#xD;
      will be informed immediately. Moreover, the participant will be informed if evaluations&#xD;
      during the study bring knowledge about the general health status of the patient, unless this&#xD;
      has been clearly rejected by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By the end of the study it is possible for participants to contact the study coordinator to&#xD;
      get information about study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will not receive any form of payment, but can receive compensation for&#xD;
      transportation The participation implies extraction 3-5 ml of spinal fluid and a blood sample&#xD;
      about 10 ml, which will be used for analysis of certain biomarkers, such as sCD163, CD19 and&#xD;
      myelin proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other examination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CIDP and treatment with SCIG or IVIG plus drug-naïve CIDP patients will undergo&#xD;
      a clinical examination with the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall Disability Sum Score (ODSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropathy Symptom Score (NSS) Disorders or treatments that contraindicate a lumbar&#xD;
           puncture. In case an included patient turn out to meet the exclusion criteria after&#xD;
           analyses of the spinal fluid, the patient will be replaced by a new patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all times during the diagnostic work-up and consequently in the research project the&#xD;
      investigators will do this with respect for the patients mental and physical condition. The&#xD;
      research project will be carried out according to the Act on Processing of Personal Data and,&#xD;
      furthermore, the project will be submitted to the common regional information system for&#xD;
      Region Midtjylland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses The spinal fluid and the serum will be analysed at the Department of Clinical&#xD;
      Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital. The spinal fluid and blood samples will be deposited in&#xD;
      a research biobank at Aarhus University Hospital. The plan is to carry out all the&#xD;
      biochemical analyses at the same time when all samples are collected. In the end of the&#xD;
      project, the samples will be pseudo anonymised. Any excess biological material will be&#xD;
      transferred to a biobank for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concentrations of sCD163 in spinal fluid and serum will be analyzed by already&#xD;
      established techniques at the Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concentrations of CD19 in spinal fluid and serum will be analyzed by established&#xD;
      techniques at the Department of Immunology, Aarhus University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power and Statistical analyses Because of the rareness of both CIDP and MMN and the few&#xD;
      number of patients it is not relevant to make Power calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program STATA will be used for statistical analyses. Parametric or non-parametric tests&#xD;
      will be used depending of the normal distribution of data. In all statistical analysis a 5%&#xD;
      level of significance will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives Due to the many clinical variants of inflammatory polyneuropathies and due to&#xD;
      the lack of biomarkers, it remains difficult to diagnose CIDP. It is very important to&#xD;
      identify new methods for diagnosis and monitoring of patients with CIDP. This may also enable&#xD;
      better prediction of the prognosis and the level of treatment needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathology of CIDP is still unknown but it is known to be immune mediated. In several&#xD;
      studies sCD163 has been shown to up regulated in a larger range of inflammatory diseases&#xD;
      suggesting sCD163 to be a relevant biomarker for CIDP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has also been proved that CD19 is a promising B-cell target for the development of&#xD;
      disease-modifying agents in autoimmune neuropathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings can be used as diagnostic markers in patients with CIDP and MMN. Ethical&#xD;
      considerations All the participants will be informed orally and in writing about the study&#xD;
      and will receive consideration with a view to whether they want to participate. Signed&#xD;
      consent will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tests performed on the patients involved in this research project are lumbar puncture,&#xD;
      blood sampling and clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A lumbar puncture is a procedure used to collect cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) for analysis.&#xD;
      CSF is a promising source of biomarkers in CIDP since the proximal nerve roots, which are&#xD;
      affected early in the disease, are in close anatomical contact with the CSF space. During the&#xD;
      procedure a hollow needle is used to penetrate the spinal canal at the level of the third-&#xD;
      to-fourth or fourth-to-fifth lumbar vertebra in the low back. CSF then drips out through the&#xD;
      needle and is collected. It involves some risk to perform a lumbar puncture, which include&#xD;
      post lumbar puncture headache with an incidence of 12%, most common in younger patients. Most&#xD;
      frequently, the headache has a short duration and it may be cured with application of a blood&#xD;
      -patch. Moreover, lumbar puncture can cause temporary lumbar pain and an accumulation of&#xD;
      blood underneath the skin. There is a very low risk of bleeding in the epidural space with&#xD;
      compression of spinal nerves and an even lower risk of infections (meningitis or&#xD;
      meningoencephalitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it is important to highlight that lumbar puncture is part of routine diagnostic&#xD;
      workout for neuropathy. However, CIDP patients treated with SCIG or IVIG will have a lumbar&#xD;
      puncture for research purposes only. There are no further risks associated with collection of&#xD;
      an extra sample of spinal fluid or blood. In consideration of the low risk involved in this&#xD;
      project, the seriousness and costs of the disease and the potential to identify a relevant&#xD;
      biomarker in CIDP, we consider this project to be ethically acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication Positive, negative as well as inconclusive results from this study will be&#xD;
      published. The results will be written in an article for publication in an English written&#xD;
      peer reviewed journal.&#xD;
