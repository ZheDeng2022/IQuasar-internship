      This phase I trial studies the side effects and recommended dose of the combination of p53MVA&#xD;
      vaccine (modified vaccinia virus ankara vaccine expressing tumor protein p53 [p53]) and&#xD;
      gemcitabine hydrochloride in treating patients with ovarian epithelial cancer that has come&#xD;
      back. Vaccines made from inserting a laboratory-treated gene into a person's tumor cells may&#xD;
      help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells that express p53. Drugs&#xD;
      used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Giving modified vaccinia virus ankara vaccine expressing p53&#xD;
      together with gemcitabine hydrochloride may work better in treating patients with ovarian&#xD;
      epithelial cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine a recommended dose for the combination of a p53MVA vaccine and gemcitabine&#xD;
      (gemcitabine hydrochloride) and if it is well-tolerated in patients with platinum resistant,&#xD;
      p53 over expressing ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate T cell immunity changes and clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive modified vaccinia virus ankara vaccine expressing p53 subcutaneously (SC) on&#xD;
      day 15 and gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients then continue to receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30&#xD;
      minutes on days 1 and 8 every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months.&#xD;

             using CLIA approved mutational analysis or immunohistochemistry techniques on&#xD;
             formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue; in the case of equivocal IHC results, p53&#xD;
             involvement may be confirmed by detection of p53 molecular analysis on tumor&#xD;
             deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA); patients on whom molecular analysis of p53 mutations is&#xD;
             already available, will not require IHC analysis; molecular analysis may be performed&#xD;
             as an additional research procedure at the end of the study (distinct from eligibility&#xD;
             determination) if the principal investigator (PI) deems it of scientific value and&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Taxol will not be counted as a &quot;prior chemotherapy regimen&quot; for the purpose of this&#xD;
             study; treatment with targeted agents or hormones would not be considered as a&#xD;
             systemic chemotherapy regimen; previous treatment with gemcitabine is not allowable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible patients are those with documented disease recurrence/progression within 0-12&#xD;
