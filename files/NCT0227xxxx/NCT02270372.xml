      This is a two-part Phase 1b, open-label study of ONT 10 administered in combination with&#xD;
      varlilumab. Two different doses of varlilumab will be studied in combination with the single&#xD;
      agent recommended dose of ONT 10. Intermediate and/or lower doses of varlilumab or ONT-10 may&#xD;
      also be studied at the recommendation of the safety monitoring committee (SMC).&#xD;

      This is a two-part Phase 1b, open-label study of ONT 10 administered in combination with&#xD;
      varlilumab. Two different doses of varlilumab will be studied in combination with the single&#xD;
      agent recommended dose of ONT 10. Intermediate and/or lower doses of varlilumab or ONT-10 may&#xD;
      also be studied at the recommendation of the safety monitoring committee (SMC). Treatment&#xD;
      will be administered in cycles of 12 weeks each. All patients will receive a single dose of&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide on Day -3. During Cycle 1, patients will receive ONT-10 administered SC once&#xD;
      per week for 8 weeks followed by ONT-10 once every 6 weeks starting with Cycle 2, in&#xD;
      combination with varlilumab administered IV once every 3 weeks x 3 doses, and then once every&#xD;
      6 weeks for cycles 2 through 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cohort will enroll an initial group of 6 evaluable patients with either breast or&#xD;
      ovarian carcinoma. Initial enrollment into a cohort will be staggered, with the first patient&#xD;
      treated in any new cohort to be followed for a minimum of two weeks for the occurrence of&#xD;
      Unacceptable Toxicity prior to enrollment of the remaining 5 patients. Subsequent enrollment&#xD;
      into a cohort may then continue without a staggered schedule until 6 patients treated are&#xD;
      considered evaluable. Up to 24 additional evaluable patients may be enrolled and treated in&#xD;
      Part 2 at the RD of varlilumab and ONT-10 identified in Part 1, including approximately equal&#xD;
      numbers of patients with breast carcinoma (n~12) and ovarian carcinoma (n~12). Treatment in&#xD;
      Part 2 will follow the same schedule as in Part 1.&#xD;
