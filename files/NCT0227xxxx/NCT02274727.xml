  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The three-year cumulative risk of a recurrent stroke, dependent on aetiology, is up to 25 per&#xD;
      cent. At present, preventing recurrence relies on a broad approach to reduce risk factors&#xD;
      associated with atherosclerosis, heart disease and metabolic disorders. However, more&#xD;
      specific interventions, such as anticoagulation and surgery or stenting, need aetiologic&#xD;
      information. BIOSIGNAL aims to determine where the most promising candidate biomarkers can&#xD;
      help identify stroke aetiology and also predict overall MACE, including specifically&#xD;
      recurrent stroke. In addition, the insights gained into the processes underlying different&#xD;
      stroke subtypes may lead to more targeted diagnostic tools.&#xD;

      Objectives and specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to prospectively evaluate the predictive value of the most&#xD;
      promising blood bio-markers to identify treatable stroke etiologies on admission and risk of&#xD;
      MACE and its components in consecutive ischemic stroke patients enrolled by several centers&#xD;
      in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical endpoints of the study are 1) recurrent cerebrovascular events (ischemic stroke&#xD;
      and / or transient ischemic attack (TIA)) and major cardiac events (MACE) within one year&#xD;
      after the index stroke and after 3-5 years of follow up (2021) 2) all types of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation (AF) detected on admission or by prolonged ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitors&#xD;
      during the follow up period 3) presence of cerebrovascular atherosclerosis detected by&#xD;
      ultrasound investigations and 4) overall mortality, functional outcome, cognitive impairment,&#xD;
      occurrence of epilepsy, and newly diagnosed cancer, according to data collected in telephonic&#xD;
      interviews in 2021 (only in Zurich and Basel) with the patients enrolled between 2014-2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine whether the proposed and novel biomarkers independently predict recurrent&#xD;
      stroke and a composite outcome consisting of recurrent cerebrovascular event (ischemic stroke&#xD;
      (AIS), intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) or transient ischemic attack (TIA), as well as&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (MI), cardiovascular death (CVD)). i.e. major adverse cardiac events&#xD;
      (MACE) among all patients. Hypothesis 1: Elevated levels of one or more of the proposed and&#xD;
      novel biomarkers will independently predict MACE and its components during trial follow-up,&#xD;
      assessed by structured interviews, as well as chart reviews 90 days, 1 year after the index&#xD;
      stroke as well as in 2021 (only in Zurich and Basel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine whether CE biomarkers are associated with atrial fibrillation among all&#xD;
      patients. Hypothesis 2: Baseline values of one or more of the CE biomarkers will be&#xD;
      independently associated with AF, including history of AF, AF detection at baseline, or AF&#xD;
      detected during the follow up period by prolonged (at least 7-day) ambulatory cardiac rhythm&#xD;
      monitors and structured interviews as well as chart reviews 90 days, 1 year after the index&#xD;
      stroke as well as in 2021 (only in Zurich and Basel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To determine whether LAA biomarkers are associated with a) the presence of&#xD;
      cerebrovascular atherosclerosis among all patients. Hypothesis 3: Baseline values of one or&#xD;
      more of LAA biomarkers will be independently associated with the presence of extra and&#xD;
      intracranial atherosclerosis among patients with ischemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim 4: To determine whether the proposed and novel biomarkers will predict a)&#xD;
      occurrence of epileptic seizures and diagnosis of epilepsy b) newly diagnosed cancer, c)&#xD;
      functional outcome and cognitive impairment. Hypothesis 4: Baseline values of one or more of&#xD;
      the proposed and potentially novel biomarkers will independently predict a) occurrence of&#xD;
      epileptic seizures and the diagnosis of epilepsy b)occurrence of newly diagnosed cancer c)&#xD;
      functional outcome and cognitive impairment assessed by a follow up structured telephone&#xD;
      interview performed in 2021 with the patients enrolled between 2014-2017 (only in Zurich and&#xD;
      Basel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the current version of the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki, and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines as well as all national&#xD;
      legal and regulatory requirements.&#xD;

        The BIOSIGNAL study will be a prospective observational multicenter cohort study to&#xD;
        evaluate selected CE and LAA blood biomarkers in patients with incident ischemic stroke. We&#xD;
        will consecutively recruit patients over a planned time period of two years. All&#xD;
        participants will be followed for 1 year.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All consecutive patients (above the age of 18) who are admitted with a suspected ischemic&#xD;
        stroke within 24 hours of symptom onset are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ischemic stroke is defined as an acute localized ischemic lesion in the brain not&#xD;
        attributable to central nervous system infection, tumor, demyelinating, or degenerative&#xD;
        neurologic diseases due to an occlusive vascular disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Detailed Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Rapid onset of a focal neurologic deficit, with signs or symptoms persisting beyond 24&#xD;
             hours &amp; NOT associated with:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  infection&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  trauma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  tumor of the brain&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  severe metabolic disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  chronic degenerative neurologic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The development of an acute focal neurologic deficit persisting &gt;24 hours in&#xD;
             conjunction with brain imaging consistent with acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The CT or MRI may either show a new infarct or no change from the study performed at entry,&#xD;
        i.e. the diagnosis is clinical and does not require CT/MRI confirmation. Secondary&#xD;
        hemorrhagic infarction is permissible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Hemorrhagic stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. All patients discharged from the hospital with a diagnosis different from ischemic&#xD;
             stroke (i.e. stroke mimics)&#xD;
