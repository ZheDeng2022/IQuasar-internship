      Group based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment of depression,&#xD;
      however, one third of patients do not respond satisfactorily (McDermut, Miller, &amp; Brown,&#xD;
      2001), and relapse rates around 30% have been reported from several studies (Butler, Chapman,&#xD;
      Forman, &amp; Beck, 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study compares group based CBT with rumination focused CBT for depression with&#xD;
      respect to outcome and relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rumination has been evidenced as a crucial vulnerability to depression (Smith &amp; Alloy, 2009),&#xD;
      predicting the onset, severity and duration of future depression (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2000).&#xD;
      Depressed individuals show a negative bias in the perception of facial emotion, in the acute&#xD;
      phase as well as in remission (Bouhuys, Geerts, &amp; Gordijn, 1999), and display difficulties in&#xD;
      disengaging from negative stimuli (Koster, De Raedt, Goeleven, Franck, &amp; Crombez, 2005). In&#xD;
      addition the present study investigate rumination and perceptual attention bias as potential&#xD;
      key mechanisms underlying depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      128 depressed patients will be recruited and randomised for group based CBT or group based&#xD;
      rumination focused CBT. Patients are assessed subsequently during treatment and at 6 month&#xD;
      follow-up regarding depression, rumination, worry, negative perceptual bias, attention&#xD;
      control. Results are expected at spring 2016.&#xD;

      Background and rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to compare the effectiveness of rumination-focused cognitive&#xD;
      behavior therapy vs. cognitive behavior therapy for treatment of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the mechanisms involved in effective cognitive behavioural therapy is a key&#xD;
      focus of clinical research (Watkins, 2009). The study will investigate possible underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms of rumination and thereby provide insights about the information processing and&#xD;
      symptoms of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rumination, a process of recurrent negative thinking and dwelling on negative affect, is a&#xD;
      common residual symptom (Kim, Yu, Lee, &amp; Kim, 2012; Riso et al., 2003). Rumination has been&#xD;
      evidenced as a crucial vulnerability to depression (Smith &amp; Alloy, 2009), predicting the&#xD;
      onset, severity and duration of future depression (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such knowledge indicates that rumination is a key factor involved in the initiation and&#xD;
      maintenance of depressive symptoms. Individuals that display high levels of rumination even&#xD;
      if not currently presenting depressive symptoms may therefore have an increased risk for&#xD;
      developing future depression. Consequently, if involved in the pathogenesis of depression,&#xD;
      rumination may constitute an active ingredient of psychological intervention. Hence,&#xD;
      interventions explicitly targeting rumination may improve the efficiency of CBT for recurrent&#xD;
      and chronic depression (Watkins, 2009). However, few studies have tested interventions&#xD;
      targeting rumination, with the exception of Watkins (2007; 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive theories argue that information processing bias influences the aetiology and&#xD;
      maintenance of depression. On tests of cognitive performance, particularly attention and&#xD;
      memory has been repeatedly reported affected in depression (Goeleven, De Raedt, Baert, &amp;&#xD;
      Koster, 2006). Depressed individuals show a negative bias in the perception of facial&#xD;
      emotion, in the acute phase as well as in remission (Bouhuys, Geerts, &amp; Gordijn, 1999), and&#xD;
      display difficulties in disengaging from negative stimuli (Koster, De Raedt, Goeleven,&#xD;
      Franck, &amp; Crombez, 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is suggested in the literature that depressed people are not able to gain control over the&#xD;
      emotional influence of negative stimuli due to dysfunctional inhibition of negative stimuli&#xD;
      (Donaldson, Lam, &amp; Mathews, 2007). This idea is substantiated by the strong relationship&#xD;
      between rumination and depression suggesting that impaired inhibitory function may be an&#xD;
      underlying mechanism of rumination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, experimental paradigms used to study attention has, apart from Donaldson and&#xD;
      colleagues (2007), not been applied to rumination or other self-report measures assessing&#xD;
      attention and attentional control in clinical samples. The present study investigates the&#xD;
      relationship between clinical features of depression such as the self-reported tendency to&#xD;
      ruminate in response to negative affect, as well as the experience of attentional control and&#xD;
      actual performance on cognitive tests assessing attentional control. Furthermore by combining&#xD;
      clinical self-report with test performance, the study addresses potentially underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms of rumination. Understanding the mechanisms involved in effective cognitive&#xD;
      behavioural therapy is thus a key focus of clinical research (Watkins, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RFCBT will be compared to CBT for depression. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is&#xD;
      recommended for the treatment of depression by the National Institute for Health and Clinical&#xD;
      Excellence (NICE) in UK. Group CBT is an effective treatment of depression, however, one&#xD;
      third of patients do not respond satisfactorily (McDermut, Miller, &amp; Brown, 2001), and&#xD;
      relapse rates around 30% have been reported from several studies (Butler, Chapman, Forman, &amp;&#xD;
      Beck, 2006). Residual symptoms following treatment is a common problem, as 30-50% of remitted&#xD;
      patients present residual symptoms by the end of treatment (Kennedy &amp; Paykel, 2004). These&#xD;
      patients display more depressive symptoms, have a lower level of social functioning and&#xD;
      utilize more health care services (Cornwall &amp; Scott, 1997) compared to fully remitted&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study to compare the effectiveness of rumination-focused CBT vs. CBT&#xD;
      for treatment of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design is a pragmatic block randomized controlled blinded trial comparing two types of&#xD;
      group based cognitive behavioural therapy for depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study takes place in a community psychiatric outpatient service in Hillerød, Denmark,&#xD;
      which receives 200-250 patients with depression per year. Patients that are referred for&#xD;
      treatment at the Psychiatric Outpatient Centre in Hillerød with a primary diagnosis of&#xD;
      depression, recurrent or chronic, are recruited to the study. We plan to recruit a total of&#xD;
      128 patients, 64 in each treatment type. Intake will take place from July 2013 until Marts&#xD;
      2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapists conducting the group therapies are trained and experienced cognitive behavioural&#xD;
      therapist with at least 4 years of experience with CBT. The therapist conduction the groups&#xD;
      with RFCBT are trained and supervised by professor Ed Watkins (affiliation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both interventions runs for 11 week with a 3 hours session once a week and will be delivered&#xD;
      by trained clinicians with at least two years of experience in CBT. Preceding the first group&#xD;
      session the participants will be given an individual session with a group therapist to&#xD;
      prepare for the groupbased treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The psychiatrist conducting the initial evaluation of the patients invites the patients to&#xD;
      participate if the inclusion criteria are met. The patients will receive verbal and written&#xD;
      information about the project from the psychiatrist. If interested in participation the&#xD;
      patients will be contacted by the Ph.D. student to sign the informed consent and invited to&#xD;
      first assessment. After the assessment the patients are finally randomised by computer method&#xD;
      to receive one of the two treatment types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is the post-treatment assessment of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression&#xD;
      (HRSD) Bech P, Kastrup M, Rafaelsen OJ. (1986).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-treatment measures of HAM-D-6 (Bech et al., 1975), Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ;&#xD;
      Meyer, Miller, Metzger, &amp; Borkovec, 1990), Ruminative Response Scale of the Response Style&#xD;
      Questionnaire (RRS;(Nolen-Hoeksema &amp; Morrow, 1991), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7;&#xD;
      Spitzer, et al. 2006). Trail-making A and B (Strauss et al. 2006), Dot-probe task&#xD;
      -computerized test of cognitive control and emotional processing (Donaldson et al., 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming similar mean changes in HRSD scores from pre-to-post intervention as found by&#xD;
      Watkins and colleagues [18] for RFCBT (M = 7.81) and by Paykel and colleagues [11] for CBT (M&#xD;
      = 3.52), and a conservative estimate of pooled standard deviation for change in HRSD of 6&#xD;
      (when SD= 3.60 for change in HRSD in RFCBT), we estimate a between-treatment effect size of&#xD;
      Cohen's d = 0.7. To detect a difference in effect size of 0.7 between RFCBT and CBT at a&#xD;
      two-tailed significance level of 5%, each treatment arm requires 44 patients each to obtain&#xD;
      90% statistical power [40]. Assuming a dropout rate of 20%, we will recruit 55 patients into&#xD;
      each treatment arm. With an average size of the therapy group of m = 8 in both treatment&#xD;
      arms, and an intraclass correlation of about ρ = 0.05, a design effect of 1 + (m - 1)ρ = 1.35&#xD;
      follows, so that we plan to recruit 8 groups in each treatment arm (128 patients in total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the post-treatment score on the HRSD, which is treated as a&#xD;
      continuous, normally distributed variable. The primary efficacy hypothesis will be tested&#xD;
      using a multilevel two-group comparison (RFCBT vs. CBT), with Group as a main effect, Therapy&#xD;
      Group as a random intercept, and the HRSD baseline score as a continuous covariate. The test&#xD;
      will be performed at the 5% two-tailed significance level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary test for efficacy will be based on the intention-to-treat population, with all&#xD;
      randomized patients entering the analysis set, and multiple imputation of missing values in&#xD;
      the primary endpoint [42]. For the secondary outcomes, similar analyses will be used, taking&#xD;
      into consideration the scale of the variable (e.g., logistic regression for binary outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be informed about the research project and purpose of the project prior to&#xD;
      participation and asked for informed consent. There are no side effect due to the rumination&#xD;
      focused cognitive behavioral therapy. It is not possible to pay the patients for the&#xD;
      participating in the research project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant can leave the treatment on request. If anyone involved in the trial get knowledge&#xD;
      of increased risk of suicide among participants relevant prevention will be initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be given treatment as usual, clinical management and medical treatment&#xD;
      if needed assessed by highly trained psychiatrist at PCN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is approved by the Danish national ethical scientific committee and is registered&#xD;
      at The Danish Data Protection Agency by Region Hovedstaden Psychiatry (casenumber&#xD;
      H-1-2013-049).&#xD;

    <description>The RFCBT is a group trans-diagnostic manual based psychotherapy for depression and anxiety. RFCBT focuses on increasing effective behaviour - i.e., not stopping rumination but making it functional. It's grounded within the core principles and techniques of CBT for depression with two adaptations: (1) a functional-analytical perspective using Behavioural Activation (BA) approaches, (2) an explicit focus on shifting processing style via imagery and experiential approaches.</description>
