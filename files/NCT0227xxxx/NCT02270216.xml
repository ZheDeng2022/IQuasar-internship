      Aim to study the exercise responses to both static and dynamic exercise in elderly people&#xD;
      with and without essential isolated systolic hypertension, seeking to identify potentially&#xD;
      dangerously high responses&#xD;

      1. Design The proposed study is of a experimental study design. The study will be subject&#xD;
           to approval by the Ethical committee of Khon Kaen University and subjects will be asked&#xD;
           to give their written agreement to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects Elderly subjects with isolated systolic hypertension will be recruited from&#xD;
           primary care units in the community and outpatient department of Srinakarind hospital in&#xD;
           Khon Kaen province. Healthy normotensive subjects living independently with normal&#xD;
           physical activity will be recruited from the same community.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion criteria: Subjects should be over 60 years of age with essential isolated&#xD;
           systolic hypertension (stage I-II base on recommendation of JNC-VII) for the&#xD;
           hypertension group and normal blood pressure in the healthy group. Good communication,&#xD;
           independent physical activity. The healthy subject should be non-smokers, non-obese,&#xD;
           free of any signs or symptoms of disease as revealed by medical history Exclusion&#xD;
           criteria: Essential hypertension stage III or secondary hypertension, any history of&#xD;
           respiratory disease, heart disease, renal disease, blindness, cerebrovascular disease,&#xD;
           exercise limited by pain Subjects who have passed the inclusion criteria and exclusion&#xD;
           criteria will undertake a dynamic exercise test and a static hand-grip exercise pressor&#xD;
           test in the cardiopulmonary research room , Khon Kaen University&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Outcome measurements The main outcome measures will be changes in blood pressure and&#xD;
           heart rate during the two forms of exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood pressure: Blood pressure will be measured with a digital bedside monitor (Figure&#xD;
           1). An inflatable cuff placed around the subject's arm one inch above the patient's&#xD;
           elbow over the brachial artery. Resting blood pressure will be measured in a sitting&#xD;
           position after having rested for 15 minutes Heart rate: Heart rate will be measured at&#xD;
           rest and during exercise. ECG electrode will be attached in lead II configuration and&#xD;
           connected to the BIOPAC system. The heart rate will be determined from the R-R interval&#xD;
           with the data analyzed by the BIOPAC system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Procedures and protocol After an interview where they will be informed about the various&#xD;
           tests and asked to provide their informed consent, the subjects will undertake two&#xD;
           different exercise tests, the order of which will be in a randomized and balanced&#xD;
           design. The subjects will be asked not to smoke, take alcohol or caffeinated drinks&#xD;
           within 2 hours before testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cycling exercise: The dynamic exercise will be with the subject sitting on a cycle&#xD;
           ergometer (Monark 828 E). Resting heart rate will be measured for 2 minutes before the&#xD;
           start of exercise. The exercise level will be limited to 50% of the estimated maximum&#xD;
           heart rate reserve. Maximum heart rate will be estimated as 207-0.7*age (Gellish et al.,&#xD;
           2007) and heart rate reserve (HRR) as maximum minus resting heart rate. Subjects will&#xD;
           pedal at 50 rpm for 1 min with no load and then 3 minutes against a load of 0.5 Kp (25W)&#xD;
           increasing to a load of 1 Kp for the next 3 minutes and to 1.5 Kp, if necessary, for a&#xD;
           further 3 minutes until the target heart rate of 50% HRR is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will be asked about their level of perception of dyspnea using a visual analog&#xD;
           scale every 3 minutes at the end of each load.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Static exercise pressor response: The static exercise pressor response will be tested&#xD;
           using isometric handgrip of the left hand. The forearm will be supported on an arm rest&#xD;
           with elbow flexed. The maximum voluntary contraction force will be measured as the best&#xD;
           of three attempts. After 2 minute rest, subjects will perform 2 minute of isometric hand&#xD;
           grip contraction at 30% MVC. Circulatory occlusion(50 mmHg supra-systolic pressure) will&#xD;
           start at 1.30 min and continued for 2 minute after the end of the isometric handgrip&#xD;
           exercise. Following release of the cuff there will be a further 2 minutes recovery. The&#xD;
           blood pressure and heart rate will be measured at the end of each minute during rest,&#xD;
           isometric handgrip, circulatory occlusion and recovery. Subjects will be instructed to&#xD;
           breathe normally during the test and avoid any Valsalva maneuver; breathing frequency&#xD;
           will be monitored during the handgrip pressor test using capnography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Data and statistical analysis Data will be expressed as mean Â± SD. Changes of data&#xD;
           during and post test from baseline. Will be tested by paired t-test. Significance were&#xD;
           set at P&lt;0.05.&#xD;
