  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) is a rare, severely disabling disease&#xD;
      characterized by heterotopic ossification (HO), i.e., abnormal bone formation, often&#xD;
      associated with painful, recurrent episodes of soft tissue swelling (flare-ups). Lesions&#xD;
      begin in early childhood and lead to progressive ankyloses of major joints with resultant&#xD;
      loss of movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the ability of different palovarotene dosing regimens to prevent the formation&#xD;
      of new HO will be evaluated in adult and pediatric participants with FOP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this Phase 2, multicenter, open-label study is to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of different palovarotene dosing regimens in participants with FOP. Efficacy&#xD;
      will be assessed based on the ability of palovarotene to prevent the formation of new&#xD;
      heterotopic ossification (HO) as assessed by low-dose whole body computed tomography (WBCT)&#xD;
      scan, excluding head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was divided into four parts: Part A (completed on July 2017), Part B (completed on&#xD;
      October 2018), Part C (ongoing) and Part D (ongoing). Each part was associated with revised&#xD;
      palovarotene treatment regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part A, all pediatric and adult participants who successfully completed Study PVO-1A-201&#xD;
      were enrolled and followed for up to 36 months. Participants who had an eligible flare-up&#xD;
      received 10 mg palovarotene daily for 14 days, followed by 5 mg palovarotene daily for 28&#xD;
      days (or weight-based equivalent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part B, participants who successfully completed Study PVO-1A-201 (including any&#xD;
      participant who participated in Part A of Study PVO-1A-202) as well as up to 20 new adult&#xD;
      participants were followed for up to 24 months. The Adult Cohort included all participants&#xD;
      with at least 90% skeletal maturity, regardless of age. The Pediatric Cohort included all&#xD;
      participants with less than 90% skeletal maturity. Any Pediatric Cohort participant who&#xD;
      achieved ≥90% skeletal maturity during Part B was considered for enrollment into the Adult&#xD;
      Cohort at the discretion of the Investigator. Part B added a 5 mg palovarotene daily chronic&#xD;
      treatment regimen administered between flare-ups for participants in the Adult Cohort for up&#xD;
      to 24 months. Part B also increased the flare-up dosing to 20 mg palovarotene daily for 28&#xD;
      days, followed by 10 mg palovarotene daily for 56 days (or weight-adjusted equivalents in the&#xD;
      Pediatric Cohort). Treatment could be extended if the flare-up was still ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part C, participants from Part B are being followed for up to an additional 48 months.&#xD;
      There will be no new participants in Part C. All eligible participants, including skeletally&#xD;
      immature participants, are receiving 5 mg palovarotene daily chronic treatment regimen&#xD;
      (weight-adjusted doses for skeletally immature participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part D, annual post last dose of study treatment assessments for up to 2 years will be&#xD;
      obtained in participants who were skeletally immature at the time of study treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation in order to obtain longer-term safety data. No new participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled into Part D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C plus Part D duration will not exceed 48 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo all study procedures as specified in the respective schedule of&#xD;
      assessments and for as long as they are not 100% skeletally mature.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             the participant and/or family to comply with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Amylase or lipase &gt;2x above the upper limit of normal or with a history of&#xD;
             pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Elevated aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase &gt;2.5x the upper limit&#xD;
             of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fasting triglycerides &gt;400 mg/dL with or without therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently using vitamin A or beta carotene, multivitamins containing vitamin A or beta&#xD;
             carotene, herbal preparations containing vitamin A or beta carotene, or fish oil, and&#xD;
             unable or unwilling to discontinue use of these products during palovarotene&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants experiencing suicidal ideation (type 4 or 5) or any suicidal behavior&#xD;
             within the past month as defined by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale&#xD;
             (C-SSRS).&#xD;
