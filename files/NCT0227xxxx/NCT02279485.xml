  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, 2-arm, single-dose, randomized crossover study. The study will enroll&#xD;
      a total of 100 subjects (2 arms with 50 subjects in each arm). In Arm 1, bioequivalence&#xD;
      between the oral suspension and tablet formulations of perampanel will be evaluated under&#xD;
      fasted conditions; in Arm 2, bioequivalence between the oral suspension and tablet&#xD;
      formulations will be evaluated under fed conditions. In both study arms, subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized on Study Day 1 for Treatment Period 1 to receive a single 12-mg dose for&#xD;
      perampanel as either oral suspension or a tablet, and will then receive the alternative&#xD;
      treatment on Study Day 43 of Treatment Period 2. Drug administration will be separated by a&#xD;
      washout of at least 6 weeks between the two treatment periods.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Healthy males or females, ages 18 to 55 years, inclusive, at the time of informed&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;

          2. Body mass index (BMI) of 18 to 32 kg/m2, inclusive at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Females must not be lactating or pregnant at Screening or Baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Females of childbearing potential must not have had unprotected sexual intercourse&#xD;
             within 30 days before study entry and must agree to use a highly effective method of&#xD;
             contraception (eg, total abstinence, a doublebarrier method [such as condom plus&#xD;
             diaphragm with spermicide], have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia, or&#xD;
             an intrauterine device, contraceptive implant, or oral contraceptive that does not&#xD;
             contain levogesterol) throughout the entire study period and for 30 days after study&#xD;
             drug discontinuation. Females using hormonal contraceptives containing levogesterol&#xD;
             must be on another form of contraception (such as double barrier method.) as well. If&#xD;
             currently abstinent, the subject must agree to use a doublebarrier method as described&#xD;
             above if she becomes sexually active during the study period or for 30 days after&#xD;
             study drug discontinuation. Females who are using hormonal contraceptives must have&#xD;
             been on a stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks&#xD;
             before dosing and must continue to use the same contraceptive during the study and for&#xD;
             30 days after study drug discontinuation. All females will be considered to be of&#xD;
             childbearing potential unless they are postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12&#xD;
             consecutive months, in the appropriate age group, and without other known or suspected&#xD;
             cause) or have been sterilized surgically (i.e. bilateral tubal ligation, total&#xD;
             hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy, all with surgery at least 1 month before&#xD;
             dosing).&#xD;

             gastrointestinal procedure for the purpose of weight loss (including Lapband), which&#xD;
             would slow gastric emptying.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any clinically abnormal symptom or organ impairment found by medical history at&#xD;
