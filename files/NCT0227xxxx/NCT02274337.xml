      AC0010 Maleate Capsules is a new, irreversible, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)&#xD;
      mutation selective Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor.Aim at local advanced or metastatic non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer patients with EGFR mutation or T790M drug-resistant mutation. The molecular&#xD;
      mechanism: by irreversible combining the EGFR-RTKs ATP binding site of cell, selectively&#xD;
      suppress the activities of EGFR tyrosine kinase phosphorylation, block the sigal signal&#xD;
      transduction system of EGFR, and close the function of ras/raf/MAPK downstream. at last block&#xD;
      the tumor cell growth by EGFR induction, and promotes apoptosis. AC0010 Maleate Capsules has&#xD;
      three characters: 1. Irreversible combination with EGFR; 2.Efficient suppress the EGFR mutant&#xD;
      tumor cell and has no suppression to EGFR wild-type cell; 3. Efficient suppress the EGFR&#xD;
      T790M drug-resistant mutation tumor cell.&#xD;

      This study will treat patients with advanced NSCLC who have already received at least one&#xD;
      course of specific anti-cancer treatment but the tumor has started to re-grow following that&#xD;
      treatment. This is the first time that this drug is used or tested in patients, and so it&#xD;
      will help to understand what type of side effects may occur with the drug treatment, it will&#xD;
      measure the levels of drug in the body, it will also measure the anti-cancer activity. By&#xD;
      using these pieces of information together the best dose of this drug to use in further&#xD;
      clinical trials will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a multicenter, open-label, two-stage phase I clinical trial. Trial including&#xD;
      single-dose and successive-dose tolerance research, single-dose and successive-dose&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic research, food bioavailability study, exploration of different dosing methods&#xD;
      and tentative evaluation for clinical efficacy. Stage one is a dose escalation study, using&#xD;
      the modified Fibonacci methods. 7 dose level are set, respectively are 50mg/d 100mg/d 200mg/d&#xD;
      350mg/d 550mg/d 850mg/d and 1100mg/d. Three patients are enrolled in each dose level, the&#xD;
      observed indicator is dose-limited toxicity. No DLT occurred of all 3 patients, the dose&#xD;
      escalate to next level. 1/3 DLT observed, 3 more patients are enrolled in the level, if no&#xD;
      DLT is observed, the dose escalated to next level, if DLT occurs again, escalation stops. 2/3&#xD;
      DLT are observed, escalation stops. A recommend phase II dose level will acquire by this&#xD;
      method. Stage two is a multicenter, open label, one arm successive dose clinical trial, based&#xD;
      on the dosing level and method acquired in stage one, for further safety evaluation and&#xD;
      tentative evaluation of clinical efficacy.&#xD;
