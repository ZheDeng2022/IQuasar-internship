      The purpose of this exploratory study is to compare the combination of a wrist orthosis with&#xD;
      either ultrasound therapy or paraffin bath therapy in the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome&#xD;
      patients. We hypothesized that ultrasound therapy might be more effective than paraffin&#xD;
      therapy because it provides both thermal and nonthermal effects.&#xD;

    <measure>Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The pain VAS is a continuous scale comprised 10 centimeters (100 mm) in length. 0 indicate no pain, 100 indicate maximum pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference of Monofilament Sensory Test (Before and After Treatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Semmes-Weinstein monofilament sensory test was measured by applying force-calibrated nylon filament to the fingertips with the wrist in a neutral supine position A weighted score from 1 to 5 was acquired according to each filament's calculated force . We recorded the scores from seven sample areas in each hand and summed the scores to analyze as a continuous variable.Higher score indicate decreased finger tip sensation with increased disesase severity.Total score range:7 -35.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in Palmar Pinch Power Test (Before and After Treatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Palmar pinch strength was measured by pressing the thumb and the index finger tip against a standard dynamometer. This procedure was repeated 3 times measuring in kilograms, and a mean score was obtained. Higher score indicate better pinching strength, which indicate less disease severity. Score range: minimum :0 kilogram</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in the Distal Sensory Latencies of the Median Nerve (Before and After Treatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A standard distance (14 centimeter) was maintained between the stimulator and recording electrodes for the sensory nerve conduction studies. Increased distal latency indicate delay of nerve conduction, which imply poor disease progress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in the Distal Motor Latencies of the Median Nerve (Before and After Treatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Median motor nerve conduction and distal motor latency were measured by placing a stimulating electrode at the wrist and a recording electrode on the abductor pollicis brevis muscle 8 centimeter from the stimulus electrode. Increased distal latency indicate delay of nerve conduction, which imply poor disease progress.</description>

        <description>The Semmes-Weinstein monofilament sensory test was measured by applying force-calibrated nylon filament to the fingertips with the wrist in a neutral supine position A weighted score from 1 to 5 was acquired according to each filament's calculated force . We recorded the scores from seven sample areas in each hand and summed the scores to analyze as a continuous variable.Higher score indicate decreased finger tip sensation with increased disesase severity.Total score range:7 -35.</description>
