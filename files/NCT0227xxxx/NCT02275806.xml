    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single institution phase II study, whose primary objective is to&#xD;
      estimate the median and three year survival rate of non-small lung cancer patients with Stage&#xD;
      IIIA and IIIB intra-thoracic disease which is referred to as &quot;locally advanced&quot; non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with histological documented non-small cell lung cancer, that are considered to be&#xD;
      inoperable, meet all the eligibility criteria, and sign informed consent will be treated with&#xD;
      one cycle of irinotecan and cisplatin, followed by three additional cycles of chemotherapy&#xD;
      with 60 - 70 Gy of concurrent radiation therapy.&#xD;
