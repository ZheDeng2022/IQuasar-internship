  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Familial dysautonomia (FD) is a devastating hereditary disease in which the development of&#xD;
      selective neuronal populations is impaired because of a deficiency of the protein IKAP&#xD;
      (Slaugenhaupt, 2002). There is no known cure. Treatments are supportive, often ineffective&#xD;
      and around half of all patients die before reaching age 40 (Axelrod et al., 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phosphatidylserine is an FDA approved food supplement that was shown recently to correct the&#xD;
      genetic abnormality and restore IKAP protein levels in cell lines derived from patients with&#xD;
      FD (Keren et al., 2011) and a humanized mouse model of the disease (Bochner et al., 2013).&#xD;
      Despite its safety and efficacy in this fragile population being unknown, many patients with&#xD;
      FD are currently taking phosphatidylserine&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to conduct a safety, tolerability and early proof of concept&#xD;
      efficacy study of phosphatidylserine in patients with FD. The study will be divided into two&#xD;
      independent arms. The first phase of the study will be an open-label dose titration study to&#xD;
      determine the safety and optimal dose of phosphatidylserine and its effect of normal IKBKAP&#xD;
      mRNA levels in 40 patients with FD. The second phase will be a longitudinal observational&#xD;
      study in which we will follow, on a yearly basis, patients with FD of all ages who opt to&#xD;
      take phosphatidylserine. In this study, we will evaluate the long-term safety of&#xD;
      phosphatidylserine in patients with FD and hope to determine whether phosphatidylserine has&#xD;
      any impact on the clinical evolution of the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our long-term goal is to find an effective therapy that will improve the quality of life for&#xD;
      patients with FD and alter disease prognosis. We believe that the promise of&#xD;
      phosphatidylserine and its availability in health food shops warrants a controlled safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and efficacy study to determine whether it should be taken by patients with FD.&#xD;
      This study is not intended to determine whether phosphatidylserine has a new indication to&#xD;
      treat FD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Familial dysautonomia (FD) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the I-B&#xD;
      kinase complex associated protein (IKBKAP) gene sequence (Anderson et al., 2001; Slaugenhaupt&#xD;
      et al., 2001). The disorder affects the development of sensory nerves, resulting in impaired&#xD;
      pain and temperature perception (Riley et al., 1949), lack of visceral sensations&#xD;
      (Norcliffe-Kaufmann et al., 2010), dysphagia and proprioceptive gait ataxia (Macefield et&#xD;
      al., 2011). Childhood mortality is increased, with aspiration pneumonia a leading cause of&#xD;
      death. In early adulthood, renal failure is common (Pearson et al., 1980) and eyesight&#xD;
      deteriorates due to optic atrophy and gait ataxia worsens making walking impossible without&#xD;
      assistance. The incidence of seizures, scoliosis, respiratory insufficiency, sleep apnea and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal bleeds are all increased. Sudden unexpected cardiac deaths are common and&#xD;
      there is an increased incidence of cancer. Current treatments are supportive and frequently&#xD;
      ineffective. FD has no known cure and 50% of patients die before age 40.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A decade ago, we discovered that the disease was caused by point mutations in IKBKAP gene,&#xD;
      leading to a deficiency of I-B kinase complex associated protein (IKAP) mainly in neuronal&#xD;
      tissue (Slaugenhaupt et al., 2001; Mezey et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2009). Phosphatidylserine,&#xD;
      an FDA-approved food supplement, was shown to increase protein levels in FD-derived cell&#xD;
      lines (Keren et al., 2011) as well as in a mouse model of FD (Bochner et al., 2013). Because&#xD;
      of the severity of FD, the availability of phosphatidylserine in health food stores and its&#xD;
      promise as a treatment, many patients with FD are already taking it, although its safety and&#xD;
      efficacy in this population is unknown. Thus, we propose a controlled study of&#xD;
      phosphatidylserine to determine its safety profile and whether it has any impact on the&#xD;
      natural history of FD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 1: It is not known if phosphatidylserine increases the levels of IKBKAP mRNA in&#xD;
      patients with FD. To determine the optimal dose of phosphatidylserine in patients with FD,&#xD;
      (i.e., the lowest dosage at which there is maximal improvement in IKBKAP mRNA production&#xD;
      without significant side effects) we will monitor the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      phosphatidylserine in an open-label dose escalation study. Safety parameters and IKBKAP mRNA&#xD;
      levels in blood will be measured in 40 patients with FD at baseline and repeated at&#xD;
      increasing doses of phosphatidylserine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 2: In an independent long-term observational study, we will follow patients with&#xD;
      FD of all ages who opt to take phosphatidylserine as a food supplement in their diet. Safety&#xD;
      parameters will be measured as part of routine evaluations on an annual basis. The long-term&#xD;
      efficacy of phosphatidylserine will be determined by evaluating the evolution of standard&#xD;
      parameters of neurological function overtime in patients who received phosphatidylserine and&#xD;
      comparing their progression with historical controls from the database archives.&#xD;
