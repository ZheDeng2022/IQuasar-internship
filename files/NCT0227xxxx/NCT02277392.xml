      This is a phase-I, dose escalation study to assess the safety and biological activity of&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide/fludarabine lymphodepletion followed by adoptive transfer of vaccine-primed,&#xD;
      ex vivo CD3/CD28-costimulated peripheral blood autologous T-cells, and recombinant human&#xD;
      interleukin-18 (SB-485232, IL-18) treatment in adult patients with recurrent, Stage III or IV&#xD;
      ovarian cancer, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who previously underwent&#xD;
      induction vaccination with whole tumor vaccine&#xD;

             measurable disease for enrollment consideration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have received at least one vaccine under protocol UPCC-19809 or&#xD;
             UPCC-29810&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Predicted life expectancy of greater than or equal to 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be at least 4 weeks post-operative&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, or biological therapy for cancer,&#xD;
             radiotherapy, or surgical procedures (except for minor surgical procedures) within&#xD;
             four weeks before beginning treatment with SB-485232 (six weeks for nitrosoureas and&#xD;
             mitomycin C). Subjects must have recovered from toxicities (incurred as a result of&#xD;
             previous therapy) sufficiently to be entered into a Phase I study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood coagulation parameters: PT such that international normalized ratio (INR) is&#xD;
             less than or equal to 1.5 (or an in-range INR, usually between 2 and 3, if a subject&#xD;
             is on a stable dose of therapeutic warfarin or anticoagulants for management of venous&#xD;
             thrombosis including pulmonary thrombo-embolus) and a PTT less than 1.5 times the&#xD;
             upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A signed and dated written informed consent form is obtained from the subject. - The&#xD;
             subject is able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, timetables,&#xD;
             instructions and protocol-stated restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal organ and bone marrow function as defined by: - Absolute neutrophil count&#xD;
             greater than 1,000/ul - Platelets greater than 100,000/ul - Hematocrit greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 30 percent - AST (SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than 2.5 X institutional upper limit&#xD;
             of normal - Bilirubin less than 2.0 mg/dL unless secondary to bile duct blockage by&#xD;
             tumor - Creatinine less than1.8 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant cardiac, pulmonary, metabolic, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal or&#xD;
             autoimmune conditions that in the opinion of the investigator places the subject at an&#xD;
             unacceptable risk as participant in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with any severe concurrent disease or condition, including significant active&#xD;
             autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, which in the judgment of the&#xD;
             principal investigator would make the subject inappropriate for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who require or are likely to require more than a two-week course of&#xD;
             corticosteroids for intercurrent illness. Subjects must complete therapy prior to&#xD;
             enrollment. Topical corticosteroids should be stopped at least 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
             enrollment and systemic corticosteroids should be stopped at least 4 weeks prior to&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects with any acute infection or severe or uncontrolled that requires systematic&#xD;
             antibiotic therapy. Acute therapy must have been completed at least seven days prior&#xD;
             to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with any underlying conditions, which would contraindicate therapy with,&#xD;
             study treatment (or allergies to reagents used in this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or are breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has positive test result at the screening visit for one or more of the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects receiving medications that might affect immune function. Additionally, H2&#xD;
             blockers are excluded, as are all antihistamines five days before and five days after&#xD;
             each injection of study drug. NOTE: The following are exceptions: Proton pump&#xD;
             Inhibitors (PPIs), NSAIDS including COX-2 inhibitors, acetaminophen or Enteric Coated&#xD;
             Aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are positive for serum anti-Yo (cdr2) antibodies are not eligible (Yo&#xD;
             antibody does not need to be repeated if performed in the past).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects receiving class III antiarrythmic medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with any serious medical or psychiatric disorder that would interfere with&#xD;
             subject safety or informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychological,familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit&#xD;
             compliance with the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known leptomeningeal disease or evidence of prior or current metastatic brain disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any investigational drug within 30 days or five half-lives (whichever is longer)&#xD;
             preceding the first dose of SB-485232.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject does not have measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has no tissue from UPCC19809 EOS biopsy and unwilling to undergo screening&#xD;
