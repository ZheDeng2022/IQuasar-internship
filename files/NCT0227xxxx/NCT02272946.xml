    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of IL-1β inhibition on safety, measures&#xD;
      of systemic and vascular inflammation and endothelial function (all indicators of&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk) in treated and suppressed HIV infected individuals This study will&#xD;
      assess the safety and effects of canakinumab on endothelial function (assessed by&#xD;
      flow-mediated vasodilation [FMD] of the brachial artery), vascular inflammation (assessed by&#xD;
      FDG-PET/CT scanning), key inflammatory markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk&#xD;
      (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP]), interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble CD163 (sCD163),&#xD;
      D-dimer, T-cell and monocyte activation in the blood, and size of the HIV reservoir. 20&#xD;
      individuals will receive a single dose of 150mg canakinumab with follow-up for 18 weeks.&#xD;
