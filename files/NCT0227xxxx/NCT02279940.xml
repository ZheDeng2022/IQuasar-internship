      Atrial fibrillation is a common cardiac arrhythmia and a major risk for ischemic stroke.&#xD;
      Furthermore the risk of stroke is higher in the first month after transient ischemic attack&#xD;
      (TIA)/stroke. Rivaroxaban has been approved by Health Canada over period of last two years&#xD;
      for prevention of stroke and have been found equally effective as oral Vitamin K antagonist.&#xD;
      The foremost benefits of NOAC are reduced intracranial bleeding risk and does not require&#xD;
      coagulation monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimal timing of anticoagulation after TIA/stroke in patients with known non-valvular atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation is not known. The practice is variable and opinion based. The bias for many&#xD;
      stroke physicians and neurologists is to start later (after 1-2weeks) to prevent hemorrhagic&#xD;
      transformation thus possibly exposing the patients to an increased risk of recurrence. The&#xD;
      product monograph for the drug suggest to wait for variable of 3 to 14 days before starting&#xD;
      the NOAC (Waiting period:14 days for dabigatran and rivaroxaban, 7 days for Apixaban after&#xD;
      ischemic stroke and three days after TIA for rivaroxaban). The times have been chosen&#xD;
      arbitrary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to study incidence of symptomatic hemorrhage in patients with&#xD;
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation who are initiated with new oral anticoagulants early after&#xD;
      TIA and stroke.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is clearly established that patients with atrial fibrillation who have suffered a&#xD;
      stroke/TIA are at high risk for recurrence and require long-term anticoagulation. What is&#xD;
      unknown is the optimal timing of anticoagulation after an ischemic stroke has occurred.&#xD;
      Following cardioembolic stroke, atrial fibrillation patients are at risk for early recurrent&#xD;
      thrombo-embolism. Estimates of the rate of recurrent stroke in this setting vary widely.&#xD;
      Previous studies have indicated new ischemic strokes occur at rates anywhere from 3% to 20%&#xD;
      within two weeks of the index event. This is the primary rationale for early anticoagulation&#xD;
      after cardioembolic stroke. There is some evidence that early anticoagulation is associated&#xD;
      with improved outcomes after ischemic stroke. Indeed, it has been shown that early heparin&#xD;
      use does reduce recurrent ischemic stroke risk by 2.1%, but this is offset by a 1.7% increase&#xD;
      in the rate of HT. Studies of low molecular weight and unfractionated heparin use in acute&#xD;
      stroke have generally indicated these agents are associated with moderately increased risk of&#xD;
      HT. There are currently no data indicating the frequency of HT associated with early warfarin&#xD;
      treatment, without heparin bridging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above evidence, current best practice guidelines recommend against urgent&#xD;
      anticoagulation in patients with moderate to severe ischemic stroke, however, due to the&#xD;
      elevated risk of hemorrhagic transformation (HT) immediately after stroke. A specific time&#xD;
      point at which to begin anticoagulation is not recommended in guideline statements. This&#xD;
      clinical equipoise has resulted in significant variation in practice patterns. Currently,&#xD;
      most CSC physicians base the timing of anticoagulation on clinical severity and infarct size,&#xD;
      as seen on CT scan. Most physicians will defer anticoagulation anywhere from 5 to 14 days&#xD;
      after ischemic stroke when infarct volume is extensive. In patients with small infarct&#xD;
      volumes, assessed with CT or MRI, however, anticoagulation is often begun within 24-72 hours&#xD;
      of stroke onset, and in some cases immediately after clinical assessment and CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, Bayer has no data related to early use of rivaroxaban after TIA or ischemic&#xD;
      stroke. Although a randomized study of delayed versus early anticoagulation with rivaroxaban&#xD;
      will ideally answer this question, at the moment, there is no feasibility or safety data.&#xD;
      There is also insufficient data in the present literature to indicate what the true event&#xD;
      rates for both symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation and recurrent cerebral ischemia are.&#xD;
      These data can be obtained by prospectively collecting clinical and imaging data from&#xD;
      patients who are treated, as per standard clinical practice in most Canadian stroke centres,&#xD;
      within this 14-day period of clinical uncertainty. The results of this registry will be used&#xD;
      to assess the safety and feasibility of a larger randomized controlled trial of early versus&#xD;
      delayed rivaroxaban use after stroke/TIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Rivaroxaban Acute Stroke Safety Study (RASS) is an investigator initiated multi-center,&#xD;
      prospective, open label, single arm phase IV study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the Rivaroxaban Acute Stroke Study registry is to demonstrate the safety&#xD;
      of early anticoagulation with rivaroxaban following cardioembolic stroke and TIA. Safety will&#xD;
      be established by demonstrating low rates of hemorrhage in this setting. The secondary study&#xD;
      objective is to document the rate of recurrent cerebrovascular ischemic events. It is fully&#xD;
      recognized that this uncontrolled registry study is not properly designed and under-powered&#xD;
      to demonstrate a reduction in cerebrovascular ischemic events. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that early initiation of rivaroxaban within the first 14 days of stroke or TIA is not&#xD;
      associated with increased symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Data (within 14 days of TIA/minor stroke):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard clinical assessments and data will be collected. This will include baseline National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health Stroke Scale NIHSS, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Montreal Cognitive Score&#xD;
      (MoCA) and vital signs, which will be recorded in a case report form. Stroke risk factors,&#xD;
      past medical history and medications, baseline complete blood count, coagulation profile and&#xD;
      renal function tests will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with rivaroxaban within 14 days of symptom onset according to the&#xD;
      practice pattern of the attending stroke physician. The study participation would be&#xD;
      considered after patient has been initiated on Rivaroxaban. The dose of rivaroxaban will be&#xD;
      determined by age and renal function. Patients &gt;80 years old and/or with GFR 30-50 ml/min&#xD;
      will receive 15 mg qd, and all other patients will receive 20 mg qd. The study team members&#xD;
      would then approach the patients for possible recruitment in the study after obtaining&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute baseline CT scans will be collected (standard of care). All patients will have MRI&#xD;
      including susceptibility weighted imaging after recruitment within the first 24 hours and a&#xD;
      follow-up MRI scan 7±2 days after enrolment, in order to assess for early asymptomatic&#xD;
      hemorrhagic transformation. In the event of any clinical deterioration, a repeat CT scan will&#xD;
      be performed immediately. The investigators hypothesize micro-hemorrhages may predict&#xD;
      symptomatic bleeding. In addition, any supplemental brain imaging completed within the first&#xD;
      30 days after enrolment will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Follow-up Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed for 90 days. This is the standard post-stroke assessment period&#xD;
      (the majority of neurological and functional recovery occurs within this time frame).&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed clinically at Day 1, Day 7, and Day 90. At each visit, patients&#xD;
      will again be examined by a stroke Fellow and/or Neurologist. On each visit, vital signs will&#xD;
      be noted, a comprehensive neurologic examination will be performed and mRS and NIHSS will be&#xD;
      recorded. Patients will be interviewed in detail to identify and ascertain any recurrent&#xD;
      vascular event suggestive of a stroke or TIA. Work-up to determine the underlying etiology of&#xD;
      stroke will be reviewed and any change in management plan will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan and Power Calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be tested with a single sample t-test. The null hypothesis is that&#xD;
      the frequency of symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation is &lt;2%. A convenience sample of 50&#xD;
      patients is planned initially. This will provide initial safety and feasibility data that can&#xD;
      be used to plan future definitive studies as required. The primary efficacy analysis will be&#xD;
      on an intention-to-treat basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring and Adverse Event Reporting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will report serious adverse events (SAE), using standardized event, resolution&#xD;
      and association codes. The SAE reporting period includes the entire treatment duration and an&#xD;
      additional week. All SAEs will be reported. Non-serious Adverse Events (AEs) unrelated to&#xD;
      rivaroxaban treatment will not be reported.&#xD;
