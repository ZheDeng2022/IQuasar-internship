  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apixaban is an anticoagulant (also known as blood thinner) approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) for reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with&#xD;
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation. It has no reliable method of reversal. Kcentra is an FDA&#xD;
      approved drug derived from blood that is used as an antidote to treat people with bleeding&#xD;
      associated with taking the well-known anticoagulant warfarin. This is a Phase I,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, single site, open-label, crossover trial to evaluate the reversibility&#xD;
      apixaban anticoagulation with Kcentra.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral anticoagulants are effective in the treatment and prevention of venous and arterial&#xD;
      thrombotic events. For more than 50 years the only class of anticoagulant available had been&#xD;
      the vitamin K antagonist (VKA), warfarin, which requires frequent blood work for monitoring.&#xD;
      Apixaban is a new approved anticoagulant that is used to treat patients who have blood clots&#xD;
      or are at risk for developing blood clots. Unlike warfarin, the use of apixaban does not&#xD;
      require frequent blood work for monitoring and is associated with lower bleeding risk. All&#xD;
      anticoagulation therapies are associated with spontaneous or provoked bleeding risk and&#xD;
      reversal of their blood thinning effects might be needed. Reversal of anticoagulation may&#xD;
      also be needed in cases where emergent or urgent surgery is indicated. There is currently no&#xD;
      available reversal agent for apixaban. Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) contain clotting&#xD;
      factors and can replace factors inhibited by anticoagulants. In a recent study in the&#xD;
      Netherlands a four factor prothrombin complex concentrate, Cofact (not available in the USA)&#xD;
      was shown to be able to reverse the anticoagulation effects of another factor Xa inhibitor,&#xD;
      rivaroxaban. Kcentra is a four factor prothrombin complex concentrate that was FDA approved&#xD;
      in 2013 and is used as an antidote to treat people with bleeding associated with taking&#xD;
      warfarin. It contains clotting factors II, VII, IX and X derived from donated blood and could&#xD;
      be effective in reversing the anticoagulation effects of the factor Xa inhibitor, apixaban.&#xD;
      No effective reversal agent for apixaban exists. Physicians struggle with bleeding in&#xD;
      patients who are on apixaban. Indeed, this is not an uncommon problem for patients who suffer&#xD;
      brain bleeds or trauma. This study could potentially identify Kcentra as reversal agent for&#xD;
      patients taking apixaban. This study will test the hypothesis that Kcentra has the potential&#xD;
      to significantly reduce the anticoagulation effect of apixaban as measured by thrombin&#xD;
      generation assay at 30 minutes post infusion of Kcentra as compared to placebo infusion in&#xD;
      subjects dosed to steady state with apixaban.&#xD;
