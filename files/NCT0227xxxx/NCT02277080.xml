      The primary aim is to investigate the dose and time dependent effects of different opioids on&#xD;
      the immune and endocrine systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to investigate whether associations between the function of the immune&#xD;
      and endocrine systems and opioid use influence cognitive function, pain and quality of life.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiological data from the US and Denmark have shown that 3-5% of the population use&#xD;
      opioids for treatment of chronic pain conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term use of opioids may cause &quot;classic&quot; opioid-induced adverse effects, but also serious&#xD;
      consequences such as hyperalgesia, cognitive disorders, and suppression of the immune and&#xD;
      endocrine systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relatively few studies suggest that these substances affect hormone function in humans. The&#xD;
      best studied is the circumstances regarding sex hormones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single systematic study and several clinical observations suggest that both&#xD;
      pituitary-adrenal function and formation of growth hormone is also reduced by opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other studies have shown that not only are hormones changing during treatment with opioids,&#xD;
      but the immunological function is also affected. There have been shown a link between the&#xD;
      immunological and hormonal function so that parts of the immune system also affect the&#xD;
      pituitary-adrenal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opioid use and misuse per se has long been suspected to be associated with infections because&#xD;
      both the innate and the adaptive immune system are getting affected through a number of&#xD;
      mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigates the possibility of hormonal disorders being contributing factor to&#xD;
      the development of cognitive impairment in patients who are in opioid treatment. The same&#xD;
      applies to patients' well-being, mood and pain perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross-sectional study will be carried out at Multidisciplinary Pain Centre, Rigshospitalet,&#xD;
      investigating opioid treated chronic non-cancer patients. These patients should have been&#xD;
      treated only with one opioid for more than one month and will be compared to an age,&#xD;
      educational and sex matched control group of chronic non-cancer patients not treated with&#xD;
      analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY SAMPLE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an explorative study of 25 opioid treated patients and 25 controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be included or excluded for either group on the basis of specific&#xD;
      criterions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the hypotheses of the study seem to be confirmed more patients will be included in order&#xD;
      to investigate the effects of different opioid substances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected by a trained medical student, who will administer the instruments and&#xD;
      retrieve information from the patients' files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hormone assay&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adrenocortical function will be tested with the 30 min ACTH test. Leydig-cell function,&#xD;
      IGF, TSH, thyroxine and prolactine will be measured as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunology Fresh whole blood will be used for flow cytometry, where the amount of the&#xD;
      different cells in the immune system will be measured. Furthermore, plasma samples (snap&#xD;
      frozen) will be collected (biobank).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following cell types will be analyzed by using flow cytometry: NK cells, B cells and T&#xD;
      cells. To study the immune response fresh whole blood will be stimulated with pathogens.&#xD;
      Production of cytokines will be examined by analyzes of culture supernatants. Possible&#xD;
      alteration in inflammation will be determined by analysing the plasma samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Establishment of research biobank&#xD;
&#xD;
      All material is collected as part of the study. A biobank will be established and blood&#xD;
      samples will be safely stored at Rigshospitalet as long as the study is going on. The purpose&#xD;
      of the research biobank is to use the samples in follow-up studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of cognitive function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding neuropsychological assessment, two instruments were selected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CRT measures sustained attention or vigilance. It is a computer test, in which through&#xD;
           headphones, 100 auditory signals are delivered to the patient at random intervals. The&#xD;
           patient is instructed to press a button as soon as the sound is heard.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. DST assesses attention/concentration, recent and working memory. Patients are asked to&#xD;
           repeat the series of numbers of increasing lengths, in both forward (direct) and&#xD;
           backward (reverse) order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' pain intensity will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) measuring pain&#xD;
      at its worst, least and average during the last 24 hours and the current pain intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mood&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression and anxiety will be evaluated using the Hospitality Anxiety and Depression Scale&#xD;
      (HADS). Scores above 8 indicates that a depressive or anxiety disorder is likely to be&#xD;
      present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health-related quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Short Form 36 (SF-36) will also be included in the self-administered questionnaire. The&#xD;
      SF-36 is a 36-item survey that measures eight dimensions of health. Higher scores on the&#xD;
      SF-36 (range 0 to 100) indicate better health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESULTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be analysed by using specific statistic tools as descriptive variables,&#xD;
      primary outcome, secondary outcome, significance levels, and clinical significance.&#xD;
