  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for toothpastes that more effectively remove oral biofilm, inhibit biofilm&#xD;
      re-formation and support periodontal health. This is particularly important for patients with&#xD;
      long-term orthodontic fixtures or prosthodontic appliances, and also for debilitated,&#xD;
      diabetic and immunocompromised patients. The objective of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of toothpastes on plaque presence and removal, gingival and periodontal health,&#xD;
      dental hard tissue mineralization, erosion, abrasion, and microstructure as well as dry/sore&#xD;
      mouth. In addition to clinical scoring and photographs, tooth and gum sensitivity, saliva&#xD;
      volume, pH and buffering and enamel health may be evaluated using tooth samples worn on&#xD;
      removable dental retainers. These samples will be examined outside of the mouth using&#xD;
      advanced optical techniques such as Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), Fluorescence, various&#xD;
      forms of microscopy and spectroscopy.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the in vivo effects of toothpastes and dental gels&#xD;
      on gingival and periodontal health, enamel demineralization, remineralization and&#xD;
      microstructure . The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of over-the-counter&#xD;
      toothpastes and dental gels including Colgate Total, Crest Cavity Protection, Zendium Classic&#xD;
      toothpaste, and Livionex LivFree and LivFresh using established clinical evaluation&#xD;
      parameters as well as innovative imaging approaches (Optical Coherence Tomography and&#xD;
      Multiphoton Microscopy) to measure the status of the oral tissues&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging devices:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optical Coherence Tomography can be used to identify and measure inflammation of the&#xD;
           gums and gum pockets.The results can be used to evaluate the health of the gums, and&#xD;
           changes caused by using specific toothpastes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiphoton Microscopy can be used to identify and measure bacterial plaque or biofilm&#xD;
           in the mouth. The results can determine effects of specific toothpastes on the&#xD;
           development and breakup of bacterial biofilm or plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first part of this study, subjects with moderate gingival inflammation (Löe and&#xD;
      Silness Gingival Index ≥2) and pocket depths &lt;4 will be randomly assigned to brush twice&#xD;
      daily for 21 days with the test or the control dental gel. On Days 0, 7, 14, and 21, plaque&#xD;
      levels (Quigley-Hein, Turesky Modification Plaque Index), gingival inflammation (Löe and&#xD;
      Silness Gingival Index), and gingival bleeding (modified Sulcus Bleeding Index) will be&#xD;
      determined by one blinded, investigator (Dr. Wilder-Smith) using standard probing techniques.&#xD;
      In vivo Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Multiphoton Microscopy (MPM) will be used for&#xD;
      in situ imaging. The results from this study will help evaluate the effects of the test&#xD;
      dentifrice formulation on plaque removal and maintaining gingival health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second part of this study, plaque formation and removal will be quantified in subjects&#xD;
      using ex vivo Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Multiphoton Microscopy (MPM) imaging of&#xD;
      small enamel chips mounted on a simple intra-oral retainer. In this cross-over design study,&#xD;
      the subjects will attend the test site on 11 occasions over an 11-week period. Subjects will&#xD;
      have an intra-oral retainer manufactured, which will be worn for a minimum of 22 hours per&#xD;
      day and will have up to 8 sterile human enamel inserts fitted.This study will be conducted in&#xD;
      three arms with a maximum of 44h of retainer wear during each arm, and each study arm will&#xD;
      follow the same procedure. 2 different over-the-counter toothpastes and a water control will&#xD;
      be used for each arm of the study, respectively. There will be a minimum of two weeks between&#xD;
      each study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third part of this study will involve subjects with no specific oral health issues. The&#xD;
      protocol will involve subjects wearing simple retainers for 3 periods of 2 weeks each with 5&#xD;
      sterilized enamel chips attached in the palate area. The study will have 3 arms using a&#xD;
      control and 2 active toothpastes. There will be washout of 1-2 weeks between each study arm.&#xD;
      Samples will be analyzed outside of the mouth using OCT and MPM techniques, as well as micro&#xD;
      computer tomography (microCT), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and X-Ray Photoelectron&#xD;
      Spectroscopy (XPS). (Section 3 has been completed as of July 11, 2016)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fourth part of this study will involve subjects with xerostomia. Subjects will wear&#xD;
      simple removable retainers for 2 periods of 1 week each, with 5 sterilized demineralized&#xD;
      enamel chips attached in the palate area of the retainer. Fresh enamel chips will be used for&#xD;
      each arm of the study. After study completion, chips will be used for Scanning Electron&#xD;
      microscopy (SEM) and microhardness measurement. We will provide custom retainers made from&#xD;
      impressions of each subject. Upon conclusion of the study, we will analyze the effects of&#xD;
      each toothpaste on surface enamel using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and microhardness&#xD;
      as well as microCT, EDS and XPS data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the fifth part of this study, plaque formation and removal in subjects will be quantified&#xD;
      using the standard clinical index for plaque levels (Quigley-Hein, Turesky Modification&#xD;
      Plaque Index). This will be determined by one blinded investigator using a periodontal probe.&#xD;
      In addition, ex vivo Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Multiphoton Microscopy (MPM)&#xD;
      imaging of biofilm samples will be performed on plaque specimens collected using standardized&#xD;
      technique and a 2mm curette. In this 3-arm cross-over double-blinded study, the subjects will&#xD;
      attend the test site for up to 7 occasions over up to a 22-day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sixth part of this study will involve (a) subjects with previously diagnosed gingivitis,&#xD;
      including moderate gingival inflammation (Löe and Silness Gingival Index ≥2) and pocket&#xD;
      depths &lt;4, and (b) subjects with previously diagnosed gingivitis (moderate gingival&#xD;
      inflammation (Löe and Silness Gingival Index ≥2)) AND periodontitis including gingival&#xD;
      bleeding, gingival inflammation, and at least four sites with probing pocket depths &gt;4mm.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to brush twice daily for up to 6 months with the test or&#xD;
      the control dental gel. On Days 0, 30, 90, and 180, plaque levels (Quigley-Hein, Turesky&#xD;
      Modification Plaque Index), gingival inflammation (Löe and Silness Gingival Index), gingival&#xD;
      bleeding (modified Sulcus Bleeding Index) and periodontal pocket depths will be determined by&#xD;
      one blinded, investigator (Dr. Wilder-Smith) using a periodontal probe. In vivo Optical&#xD;
      Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Multiphoton Microscopy (MPM) may be used for in situ imaging&#xD;
      if gingival/periodontitis sites are accessible to the imaging probes. The results from this&#xD;
      study will help evaluate the effects of the test dentifrice formulation on plaque removal and&#xD;
      maintaining/recovering gingival/periodontal health.&#xD;
