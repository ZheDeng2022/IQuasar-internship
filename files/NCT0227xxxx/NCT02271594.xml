    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to assess the impact of optimized injection technique on the&#xD;
      evolution of clinical parameters in insulin-treated patients with diabetes (DM) who have&#xD;
      clinical lipohypertrophy (LH) in a controlled, prospective study with a follow-up of 6&#xD;
      months, conducted at Ealing Hospital, West London, UK. DM patients who have LH and inject&#xD;
      into it will be randomized to either switch to normal tissue sites with intensive education&#xD;
      as to why and how and use of a 4mm pen needle, or to continue with standard care. The&#xD;
      endpoints measured will include the impact on glucose control parameters, consumption of&#xD;
      insulin, hypoglycaemia rates, use of health services resources and health care costs&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional clinical trial at Ealing Hospital (UK) in patients with DM1 and DM2&#xD;
      treated with insulin for at least 1 year, aged from 18 to 75 years inclusive, with a goal of&#xD;
      95 patients randomized to the 'LH+ Intervention' arm and 95 patients randomized to the 'LH+&#xD;
      Standard Care' arm. LH+ refers to the presence of clinically-confirmed LH about which there&#xD;
      is little or no doubt as to its presence. The study takes place over 4 clinic visits, which&#xD;
      form part of their usual clinical visits (spaced at 3-month intervals in Ealing). Each visit&#xD;
      is described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION The intervention consists of instructing patients in whom LH is detected and who&#xD;
      are currently injecting into it to move injections to non-LH areas; reducing insulin doses&#xD;
      initially by 10-20% to avoid hypoglycaemia and then titrating to target control; instructing&#xD;
      these patients to correctly rotate sites (leaving 1 cm between injection punctures and&#xD;
      allowing used sites to heal for 2-4 weeks before injecting in them again); instructing these&#xD;
      patients to forego needle reuse; and instructing these patients to switch to 4 mmx32G&#xD;
      needles. A battery of tools (described below) will be used to deliver and reinforce this&#xD;
      training, including frequent contact by phone or other electronic means after the initial&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTROL Standard care means affording the patients randomized to the control arm the&#xD;
      customary education and follow-up usually given at the centre. This would include appraising&#xD;
      them of the presence of LH (if they were not previously aware) and stating that injections&#xD;
      should not be given into that area. The training approach, tools and intensive follow-up&#xD;
      given the Intervention arm patients will not be given to the Controls. Additionally, at their&#xD;
      return visit (3 and 6 months), Control patients will be asked if they did indeed change their&#xD;
      injection habits (e.g. stopped injecting into LH) since entering the study. Those who did and&#xD;
      those who did not will be analysed separately to see if there is a difference in outcomes and&#xD;
      both groups will be compared to the Intervention arm patients.&#xD;

Intensive Training on Best Insulin Injection Technique: The intervention consists of instructing patients in whom LH is detected and who are currently injecting into it to move injections to non-LH areas; reducing insulin doses initially by 10-20% to avoid hypoglycaemia and then titrating to target control; instructing these patients to correctly rotate sites (leaving 1 cm between injection punctures and allowing used sites to heal for 2-4 weeks before injecting in them again); instructing these patients to forego needle reuse; and instructing these patients to switch to 4 mmx32G needles. A battery of tools (described below) will be used to deliver and reinforce this training, including frequent contact by phone or other electronic means after the initial training.</description>

This would include appraising them of the presence of LH (if they were not previously aware) and stating that injections should not be given into that area. The training approach, tools and intensive follow-up given the Intervention arm patients will not be given to the Controls. Additionally, at their return visit (3 and 6 months), Control patients will be asked if they did indeed change their injection habits (e.g. stopped injecting into LH) since entering the study. Those who did and those who did not will be analysed separately to see if there is a difference in outcomes and both groups will be compared to the Intervention arm patients.</description>
