  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Late-life depression is a major public health burden due to its high prevalence and&#xD;
      associated morbidity, suicide risk, functional decline, and mortality. Unfortunately, current&#xD;
      antidepressant therapies have limited effectiveness; hence, biologically plausible models for&#xD;
      new treatments are being pursued. Systemic inflammation is hypothesized to play an important&#xD;
      role on the onset and perpetuation of depression, especially in older women. Aging processes&#xD;
      involve a heightened inflammatory state, and both inflammatory disorders and depression are&#xD;
      more prevalent in women than men. However, increased systemic inflammation does not&#xD;
      necessarily lead to depression in all women. Even when robust systemic inflammation is&#xD;
      experimentally induced (e.g. endotoxin administration), largely variable increases in&#xD;
      depressive symptoms are found. Defining the factors that account for this variability may&#xD;
      identify individuals at risk of developing depression when exposed to heightened inflammatory&#xD;
      states such as aging, obesity, and chronic disease, and informs future translational studies&#xD;
      of depression prevention. In particular, the role of sleep disturbance in explaining this&#xD;
      variability requires further attention because it is an independent risk factor for&#xD;
      depression and heightens systemic inflammation by increasing the production of&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokines. The investigators have also discovered that women, but not men,&#xD;
      who report sleep disturbance including short sleep duration experience significantly more&#xD;
      depressive symptoms in response to an inflammatory challenge than women without sleep&#xD;
      disturbance. Thus, it is hypothesized that sleep loss is a vulnerability factor for&#xD;
      inflammation-induced depressive symptoms in women. However, to date, no experimental approach&#xD;
      has been used to evaluate the role of sleep loss on inflammation-induced depressive symptoms.&#xD;
      This proposal aims to examine this hypothesis by partial sleep deprivation (PSD) followed by&#xD;
      endotoxin challenge in older women. It also aims to explore genomic and socio- emotional&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying the association between sleep loss and depressive symptoms. In a&#xD;
      randomized controlled factorial design, 80 healthy female volunteers aged 60 to 80 will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of 4 arms: 1) uninterrupted sleep followed by placebo; 2)&#xD;
      uninterrupted sleep followed by endotoxin; 3) PSD followed by placebo; or 4) PSD followed by&#xD;
      endotoxin. Subjects will be administered placebo or endotoxin in the morning after PSD or&#xD;
      uninterrupted sleep. Depressive symptoms will be repeatedly assessed over 6 hours after&#xD;
      placebo or endotoxin administration.&#xD;
