      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the European Association of Urology guidelines radical prostatectomy (RP) and&#xD;
      external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) are considered equal treatments with curative intends,&#xD;
      for localized prostate cancer [1]. Another type of radiation therapy used to treat localized&#xD;
      prostate cancer is brachytherapy (BT). After both RP and EBRT some patients suffer a degree&#xD;
      of erectile dysfunction (ED) and urinary incontinence (UI) [2-5]. However, current evidence&#xD;
      shows that rates are lower with EBRT [4,5]. Unfortunately, EBRT hold the potential for&#xD;
      late-onset toxicity and can, in a small percentage of the patients, lead to secondary&#xD;
      genitourinary or gastrointestinal cancers [5]. In a recent study of RP patients at Herlev&#xD;
      hospital, the investigators found that many patients, in addition to ED and UI, also suffered&#xD;
      from UI during sexual activity, Orgasmic dysfunction, and penile morphological and sensory&#xD;
      changes [6]. Only few studies have investigated these side effects in EBRT and BT patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim for this study is therefore:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate which sexual side effects occur after EBRT and BT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate how many patients are affected&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate if there is a time dependency for the severity of the sexual side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate if there is a dose dependency for the severity of the sexual side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To find predicting and associated factors for the discovered sexual side effects to help&#xD;
           identifying patients at risk&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As mentioned above, very few studies have investigated sexual side effects aside from ED in&#xD;
      EBRT patients. O'Neil et al found that out of 110 EBRT patients 5.2% reported to have orgasm&#xD;
      associated UI; while, 28.3% of the 279 RP patients queried reported the problem [7]. Penile&#xD;
      shortening have has consistently been found after RP [8]. However, after both brachytherapy&#xD;
      and ERBT in conjunction with androgen deprivation therapy penile shortening have has also&#xD;
      been described [9] . Sullivan et al. investigated ejaculatory profiles en men undergoing&#xD;
      radiation therapy (RT), either EBRT, brachytherapy, or a combination of both [10]. They found&#xD;
      that 5 years after RT 89% of the patients reported anejaculation. During the 5 years of&#xD;
      follow up patients reported increasingly bad scores, as measured by the orgasm domain of the&#xD;
      international index of erectile function (IIEF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research plan, participants, and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the apparent shortage of studies with the main aim of investigating sexual side&#xD;
      effects other than ED after EBRT and BT, the investigators want conduct a single center&#xD;
      cross-sectional questionnaire based study which will be comparable to our study on RP side&#xD;
      effects [6]. The investigators hope to document how many patients are affected by UI during&#xD;
      sexual stimulation, altered perception of orgasm, anejaculation, orgasm-associated pain,&#xD;
      penile shortening, altered penile curvature, and penile sensory changes. Furthermore we want&#xD;
      to identify predicting and associated factors to better understand why and when these side&#xD;
      effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will start in September 2014 and the investigators anticipate to have completed&#xD;
      data collection in December 2014. Initially the investigators plan to invite 20 patients to&#xD;
      participate in interview sessions where they will be given the opportunity to contribute to&#xD;
      the design of the questionnaire. When the final questionnaire is ready all suited patients&#xD;
      will receive the questionnaire by mail. Initial non-responders will receive another&#xD;
      questionnaire 4-6 weeks later in order to get as many answers as possible. In order to grant&#xD;
      us permission to search the patients´ journals for background information all patients will&#xD;
      receive an informed consent formula to sign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruiting of patient and informed consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified through hospital records. Initially 10 EBRT patients and 10 BT&#xD;
      patients will be contacted by telephone in order to arrange the interview sessions. The&#xD;
      remaining patients will only be contacted by mail as described above. Patients will be&#xD;
      informed of the purpose of the study and that the final publication of study result will be&#xD;
      kept anonymous. Patients will be asked to state that they accept the publication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial questionnaires will be accompanied by a letter explaining the importance of&#xD;
      participating. One month after the questionnaires are expected to have been received by the&#xD;
      patients a reminder will be send to non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication of results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final results will be published in a peer reviewed international journal as soon as&#xD;
      possible. Should that not be possible the results will be made public on our hospitals&#xD;
      internet homepage. Prevalence rates will be the main outcomes; while Univariate and&#xD;
      multivariate logistic regression analyses will be used for the purpose of identifying&#xD;
      associated and predicting factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out according to the rules stated in the declaration of Helsinki&#xD;
      and Danish law concerning health care research. The study is approved by the Danish data&#xD;
      protection agency and registered at clinicaltrials.org.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hopefully this study can help adding valuable knowledge to an area that is largely&#xD;
      undiscovered. In addition, the investigators expect these results to help draw a clearer&#xD;
      picture of the pros and cons of RP, BT, and EBRT as treatments for localized prostate cancer.&#xD;
      Finally, this study should help patients suffering sexual side effects after EBRT by making&#xD;
      practitioners aware of their existence and providing them with knowledge to better inform&#xD;
      future patients.&#xD;
