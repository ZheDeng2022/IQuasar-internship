      Randomised clinical trial with a 6-month follow-up in Mexican adult men and women (20-65&#xD;
      years) with Metabolic Syndrome (MS). The sample size was calculated using a formula that&#xD;
      compares two means, an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 95%. Based on these calculations, we&#xD;
      established a baseline sample of 118 adults. For the diagnosis of MS, we used the&#xD;
      classification from the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). 150 patients were screened;&#xD;
      however, 32 were excluded because they did not meet the criteria. Doctors wrote down medical&#xD;
      history; nutritionists conducted anthropometry (weight, height, and waist circumference); and&#xD;
      nurses measured blood pressure and withdrew venous blood for determination of glucose,&#xD;
      triglycerides, and HDL-cholesterol. After being randomly assigned to one of two groups, the&#xD;
      control group received a diet with a lower protein content (0.8gr/kg body weight), and the&#xD;
      intervention group received a diet with higher protein content (1.34gr/kg body weight). Both&#xD;
      diets had equal amount of calories, were equivalent in the type of carbohydrate, and had a&#xD;
      caloric restriction of 500 calories less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the intervention group, meal replacements were made with soy protein, and individualized&#xD;
      menus, controlling the content of calories, protein, carbohydrates, and fat, had more control&#xD;
      over the total amount of protein consumed daily. Used as a substitute for food, the&#xD;
      protein-enriched drinks were prepared with 250ml of either milk with 1.5% fat or just water.&#xD;
      For both groups, the calorie density of the diet was adjusted for the baseline metabolic rate&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our study was a randomised clinical trial with a 6-month follow-up in Mexican adult men and&#xD;
      women (20-65 years) with Metabolic Syndrome (MS). The individuals were invited to participate&#xD;
      from posters and social network advertising. The study was conducted in two Mexican clinics&#xD;
      (Mexico City and Cuernavaca) for obesity and metabolic disorders, used by the Mexican&#xD;
      National Institute of Public Health (INSP) as recruitment centers. The sample size was&#xD;
      calculated using a formula that compares two means, an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 95%.&#xD;
      Based on these calculations, we established a baseline sample of 118 adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the diagnosis of MS, we used the classification from the International Diabetes&#xD;
      Federation (IDF), and therefore participants were required to have three or more of the&#xD;
      following criteria: a) waist circumference ≥90 cm in men and ≥80 cm in women, b)&#xD;
      triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL, c) high density lipoprotein (HDL-cholesterol) &lt;40 mg/dL in men and&#xD;
      &lt;50 mg/dL in women, d) blood pressure ≥130/85 mmHg; and e) fasting glucose ≥100 mg/dL.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria included bariatric surgery for weight loss, smoking, use of alcohol or&#xD;
      drugs, psychiatric disorders, anti-obesity medication, soy protein intolerance, women not&#xD;
      using birth control methods, and not pregnant or lactating, and body weight gain or loss&#xD;
      greater than two percent three months prior to the start of the study. To achieve the&#xD;
      baseline sample of 118 adults, 150 patients were screened; however, 32 were excluded because&#xD;
      they did not meet the criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During screening, individuals interested in participating received an explanation of the&#xD;
      study design and were given sufficient time to consider inclusion in the clinical trial and&#xD;
      complete the form for informed consent. On the same day as consent, doctors wrote down&#xD;
      medical history; nutritionists conducted anthropometry (weight, height, and waist&#xD;
      circumference); and nurses measured blood pressure and withdrew venous blood for&#xD;
      determination of glucose, triglycerides, and HDL-cholesterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the medical evaluation and nutritional status, we provided meal replacements enriched&#xD;
      with soy protein that were consumed during the following two days, testing soy protein&#xD;
      tolerance. Each clinic supervisor enrolled participants, and the study coordinator conducted&#xD;
      the randomization sequencing and assigned participants to interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being randomly assigned to one of two groups, the control group received a diet with a&#xD;
      lower protein content (0.8gr/kg body weight), and the intervention group received a diet with&#xD;
      higher protein content (1.34gr/kg body weight). Both diets had equal amount of calories, were&#xD;
      equivalent in the type of carbohydrate, and had a caloric restriction of 500 calories less&#xD;
      than the resting metabolic rate (RMR) based on the Harris-Benedict´s formula. The overall&#xD;
      study design is shown in Figure 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the intervention group, meal replacements (drinks and bars) were made with soy protein,&#xD;
      and indivi-dualized menus, controlling the content of calories, protein, carbohydrates, and&#xD;
      fat, had more control over the total amount of protein consumed daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization (week 0), participants received specific diet instructions. Each month,&#xD;
      diets contained 15 different options and were sufficient to meet the needs of micronutrients&#xD;
      recommended by the US Institute of Medicine (recommended dietary intake) according to age and&#xD;
      sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention group, participants consumed two, protein-enriched drinks, contributing&#xD;
      to the daily protein intake (1.34g protein/kg body weight) along with conventional foods and&#xD;
      two low-fat bars. Used as a substitute for food, the protein-enriched drinks were prepared&#xD;
      with 250ml of either milk with 1.5% fat or just water. The nutritional contents of the&#xD;
      protein-enriched drink with milk contained 145 calories, 9g protein, 3g fat, and 20.5g&#xD;
      carbohydrates. For water, the nutritional contents of the protein-enriched drink contained 22&#xD;
      calories, 5g protein, 0.2g fat, and 0g carbohydrates. In the control group, participants ate&#xD;
      three meals and two snacks to have a daily intake of 0.8g protein/kg body weight. For both&#xD;
      groups, the calorie density of the diet was adjusted for the baseline metabolic rate of each&#xD;
      participant with a restriction of 500kcal/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements Previously trained on standards for procedure, nutritionists completed monthly&#xD;
      documentation of food frequency questionnaires for participants´ total caloric intake and&#xD;
      grams of protein consumed per day. To minimize errors, the nutritionists and participants&#xD;
      scrutinized and discussed the food diaries. The nutritionists also conducted anthropometry&#xD;
      (weight and waist circumference) at baseline and at three and six months, using&#xD;
      internationally recognized techniques.[14] The weight and body composition was measured by an&#xD;
      Analyzer Avis 333, and the waist circumference was measured with a tape measure, using the&#xD;
      line between the lower costal border and the iliac crest as reference points. At baseline,&#xD;
      height was measured with a wall stadiometer (SECA Model 222) with an accuracy of 0.1cm. Body&#xD;
      mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight/height 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurses measured blood pressure after 10 minutes of rest with a digital sphygmomanometer&#xD;
      (OMRON HEM-907), following the recommendations of the American Heart Association. Blood&#xD;
      samples were drawn after a 9- to 12-hour fasting and processed without delay. Laboratory&#xD;
      testing included results for metabolic syndrome and HDL-cholesterol, insulin, hemoglobin A1c&#xD;
      (HbA1c), C-reactive protein (CRP), direct bilirubin and indirect bilirubin. All measurements&#xD;
      were performed at the Mexican National Institute of Public Health (INSP). A previously&#xD;
      validated questionnaire was used to evaluate adherence to study recommendations for diet and&#xD;
      exercise (e.g., walking, biking or jogging at least 30 minutes/day, 5 days per week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The results were shown for the baseline as mean ± standard deviation;&#xD;
      and for the comparison between baseline to 6 months as absolute changes or percentage of&#xD;
      weight loss. We used the analysis of variance (ANOVA) for means and X2 test for percentages&#xD;
      to compare the two groups overtime. Two strategies were used to analyze the data: 1) all&#xD;
      participants who completed the study after six months, and 2) those participants who dropped&#xD;
      out of the study between baseline and six months, using the last recorded measure-ment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of percentage of weight loss between baseline and 6 months we adjusted for&#xD;
      adherence to study recommendations. For this analysis, only the participants who adhered to a&#xD;
      minimum of 75% of the study design recommendations were considered. Statistical calculations&#xD;
      were performed using the STATA program version 13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical and biosecurity This study was approved by the ethics, research, and biosafety&#xD;
      committees from the INSP. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. All&#xD;
      researchers participated in an ethics certification course, &quot;Human Participants Protection&#xD;
      Education for Research Teams&quot;, given by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH).&#xD;
