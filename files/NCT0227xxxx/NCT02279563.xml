    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the equivalence of generic Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone&#xD;
      Propionate Nasal Spray with that of the marketed drug, Dymista™ Nasal Spray, in the treatment&#xD;
      of seasonal allergic rhinitis, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of generic&#xD;
      Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate nasal spray compared with Dymista™ nasal&#xD;
      spray.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who met all of the following criteria were eligible for inclusion in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who provided written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects who were able to read and understand English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Males or females, 18 to 65 years old, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. If the subject was a female of childbearing potential, she was not pregnant (confirmed&#xD;
             by negative urine pregnancy test) or lactating. Females of childbearing potential&#xD;
             agreed to use reliable birth control measures throughout the study, defined as&#xD;
             abstinence or use of an effective method of birth control (double barrier [female&#xD;
             subject's partner using condom and female subject using diaphragm, contraceptive&#xD;
             sponge, spermicide, or intrauterine device], or the use of a hormonal contraceptive&#xD;
             [oral, patch, or inserted under the skin or injected into the muscle]). Female&#xD;
             subjects who used oral contraceptives or levonorgestrel implants were required to have&#xD;
             started the method at least 90 days prior to the screening visit. A female of&#xD;
             childbearing potential was defined as a female who had experienced menarche, and who&#xD;
             had not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy or ovariectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or salpingectomy) or was not&#xD;
             post-menopausal for at least 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. At least a 2-year reliable medical history consistent with SAR, defined as symptoms&#xD;
             present during the previous two grass and/or pollen seasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Positive skin test within 12 months of screening to at least one currently present&#xD;
             seasonal allergen in the geographical area that had a predictable allergen season (eg,&#xD;
             birch pollen, ragweed, Mountain Cedar, etc) with a minimum skin test response of 3 mm&#xD;
             or greater than a negative control, and a positive test to histamine, also defined as&#xD;
             a response of 3 mm or greater than the negative control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Was capable of tolerating intranasal application of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. No clinically significant results from the screening physical examination, nasal&#xD;
             examination, and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Was willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol and was available&#xD;
             for the full duration of the study, with no planned travel outside of the pollen area&#xD;
             for a substantial portion (&gt;48 hours) of the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Was, in the Investigator's judgment (through exposure to allergen), expected to&#xD;
             require treatment throughout the entire study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who met any of the following criteria were excluded from the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Signs or symptoms of nasal polyps, deviated septum, or any other condition (including&#xD;
             nasal piercing within the previous 3 months) which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, may have resulted in erroneous study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Underwent nasal surgery or had nasal trauma within 3 months of Visit 1 (screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Had active respiratory conditions that included, but were not limited to, acute or&#xD;
             exacerbated chronic sinusitis, an abnormal sinus radiograph, an upper or lower&#xD;
             respiratory tract infection, or rhinitis medicamentosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Had PAR that required or was expected to require active PAR treatment during the study&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Had a respiratory tract infection (including otitis media and streptococcus) that&#xD;
             required antibiotic treatment within 2 weeks of Visit 1 (screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Used any of the prohibited medications prior to the start of the single-blind, placebo&#xD;
             lead-in visit (Visit 2) within the time period specified in the protocol&#xD;
