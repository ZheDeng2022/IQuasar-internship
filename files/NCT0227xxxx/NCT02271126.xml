      The best anticoagulation strategy during Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is&#xD;
      unknown. Actual recommendations suggest to use unfractionated heparin infusion and monitor&#xD;
      the effect with either activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) or Activated Clotting&#xD;
      Time (ACT). Since hemorrhage is still the major adverse effect of ECMO with impact on&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity, the investigators raised a question whether an alternative&#xD;
      monitoring technique namely Thromboelastography (TEG) could allow a more accurate management&#xD;
      of anticoagulation in this setting. To test this hypothesis the investigators designed a&#xD;
      pilot study to test safety and feasibility of an anticoagulation monitoring algorithm based&#xD;
      on TEG versus aPTT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is frequently used as a supportive tool in the&#xD;
      settings of acute severe respiratory and/or circulatory failure. The presence of the&#xD;
      extracorporeal circuit and oxygenator bring along the need to anticoagulate the patients in&#xD;
      order to prevent activation of the coagulation cascade that can lead to thrombosis of the&#xD;
      artificial surfaces and losses of coagulation factors, fibrinogen and platelets. Despite&#xD;
      tight monitoring with different anticoagulation essays bleeding remain the main threat for&#xD;
      the patients on ECMO, leaving thrombosis as an anecdotic event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our institution, anticoagulation during ECMO is monitored mainly with aPTT ratio in a&#xD;
      range of 1.5 to 2 (patient to normal). Recently, the investigators started to match&#xD;
      Thromboelastography (TEG) assays to activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) and&#xD;
      Activated Clotting Time (ACT) routine measurements during ECMO. Data from a preliminary&#xD;
      analysis of thirty-two patients show that in nearly half of TEG assays, the R (reaction time)&#xD;
      parameter which is sensitive to inhibition of fibrin formation by heparin, was consistently&#xD;
      prolonged despite aPTT and ACT were in the normal range. In the same patients the&#xD;
      investigators registered high rate of bleeding (nearly 40% of patients suffered from&#xD;
      clinically significant bleeding, i.e. bleeding that required heparin dose reduction, blood&#xD;
      transfusions or interruption of the extracorporeal support). These findings suggests the&#xD;
      possibility that the actual target of aPTT ratio might be overrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test safety and feasibility of standardized protocol based on&#xD;
      TEG versus current practice (aPTT) to manage anticoagulation during ECMO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 consecutive adults patients undergoing ECMO will be randomized in either the TEG-driven&#xD;
      anticoagulation group or the aPTT-driven group. Written informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
      according to national legislation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, when the patient is connected to ECMO, an heparin bolus of 50-70 UI/kg&#xD;
      (depending on baseline aPTT value) will be administered followed by a continuous infusion of&#xD;
      18 UI/kg/h started; for the first 12 hours thereafter proper anticoagulation level will be&#xD;
      monitored with Activated Clotting Time (ACT, therapeutic range 180-210 seconds, performed&#xD;
      every 1 or 2 hours according to the standardized protocol). From the thirteenth hour onwards&#xD;
      each group will follow either aPTT monitoring or TEG according to randomization. Every&#xD;
      morning in both groups aPTT, TEG, Antithrombin and anti-Factor Xa activity will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  aPTT-driven group: aPTT ratio target is 1.5 - 2.0 as for actual clinical practice;&#xD;
           frequency of aPTT measurements may vary from a minimum of 3 times per day to a maximum&#xD;
           of 6 depending on the standardized protocol. When aPTT value falls well below the&#xD;
           desired range an heparin bolus will be administered. When too high, infusion will be&#xD;
           stopped for either 30 or 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TEG-driven group: target range of R parameter at Kaolin activated-TEG (R K-TEG) is 16 -&#xD;
           24 minutes; frequency of TEG assays may vary from a minimum of 3 times per day to a&#xD;
           maximum of 6 depending on the standardized protocol. When TEG value falls well below the&#xD;
           desired range an heparin bolus will be administered, when is too high infusion will be&#xD;
           stopped for either 30 or 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily management requires haemoglobin, platelets, PT ratio, D-dimer and fibrinogen to be&#xD;
      checked 2 to 3 times daily, and maintained at specific values (Hb &gt; 10 g/dl; PLT &gt;&#xD;
      45.000/mm3; Fibrinogen &gt; 150 mg/dl; Antithrombin activity &gt; 70%; PT ratio &gt; 1.5) with&#xD;
      haemocomponents transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from each patient will be collected on a daily basis: laboratory exams, hemodynamic&#xD;
      status, transfusions, surgery or invasive interventions, extracorporeal lung performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of the study will be at ECMO discontinuation, after that deep vein thrombosis on&#xD;
      patients' cannulation sites will be assessed with doppler ultrasound.&#xD;
