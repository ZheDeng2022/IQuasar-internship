      Introduction To get through the egg vestment and fertilize the oocyte, the spermatozoon uses&#xD;
      its acrosomal enzymes. When Intracytoplasmic sperm microinjection (ICSI) is performed, the&#xD;
      acrosomal enzymes are introduced with the spermatozoa inside the ooplasme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fate of these enzymes, that normally never enter the oocyte, is not known. But they&#xD;
      impair the embryo development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, although the ICSI outcome is satisfactory in humans, a series of studies in many&#xD;
      species (mouse, hamster, cattle, and horse) demonstrate the deleterious effects of the&#xD;
      introduction of acrosomal material in the oocyte cytoplasm, on embryo and fetal development.&#xD;
      These studies have also shown two things:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The bigger the acrosome, the more deleterious are the effects of their introduction into&#xD;
           the egg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  And that the induction of the acrosome reaction (AR) prior to ICSI significantly&#xD;
           improves embryonic development and the number of babies born after embryo transfer as it&#xD;
           is the case in the mouse. The microinjection of acrosome reacted sperm increases from 40&#xD;
           to 70 % the percentage of pups born per embryo transferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible to improve ICSI outcome, in terms of babies born in human, by induction of the&#xD;
      AR prior to microinjection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After studying several techniques, we choose a physiologic technique for acrosome induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The induction of acrosome reaction prior to ICSI should improve in utero fetal development&#xD;
      and decrease the rate of miscarriage and pregnancy arrest.&#xD;

      1. Introduction Intracytoplasmic sperm microinjection (ICSI) produces 70% of fertilized&#xD;
           oocytes and zygotes which mostly develop normally. To perform ICSI, a spermatozoon is&#xD;
           taken from a sperm suspension after gradient migration. It is then immobilized by&#xD;
           breaking its flagellum using a micropipette, and introduced into the oocyte cytoplasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The rate of spontaneous acrosome reaction in humans is less than 20 %. Two studies on&#xD;
           the percentage of acrosome reacted and immobilized sperm showed that 95% of them have a&#xD;
           destabilization of the membrane but only 17.8% of them had made a full RA. In other&#xD;
           words, when we microinjected 10 spermatozoa, only 2 of them are completely rid of their&#xD;
           acrosome material. All others are introduced into the oocyte with acrosomal material.&#xD;
           But this material does not normally enter the oocyte since the acrosome reaction is a&#xD;
           prerequisite to the passage of the zona pellucida that surrounds the egg .&#xD;
&#xD;
           The importance of using an acrosome-reacted spermatozoon for the success of ICSI has&#xD;
           been previously highlighted in several animal species. It has been demonstrated that the&#xD;
           induction of the acrosome reaction in mice lead to higher fertilization rates (from 30%&#xD;
           to about 60 % ) . It is similar, in the rabbit and horses . Kimura et al. also reported&#xD;
           that mouse oocytes injected with acrosome-intact rabbit and hamster sperm exhibited a&#xD;
           nuclear activation and cessation of embryonic development without reaching the two-cell&#xD;
           stage. This &quot;cytotoxicity&quot; of the same sperm disappears when they are released from&#xD;
           their acrosomes before injection. In another study, the detrimental effect on oocyte&#xD;
           survival of the presence of the acrosome during the injection of sperm heads was&#xD;
           demonstrated in the golden hamster. All oocytes microinjected with acrosome-intact sperm&#xD;
           were dead, while only those injected with acrosome reacted sperm have not only survived,&#xD;
           but have also developed to the stage of two pronucleus in 79 % of cases and helped to&#xD;
           get live births ( 19%).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The team of Yanagimachi reported a study on the potentially dangerous effect of the&#xD;
           incorporation of the sperm acrosome of different species within mouse oocytes. According&#xD;
           to these authors, harmful components would probably be the enzymes such as trypsin-like&#xD;
           acrosine and hyaluronidase, since their injection mimicked the effects of ICSI with&#xD;
           acrosome-intact sperm. In the same study, it was confirmed that the toxic effects were&#xD;
           correlated with the size of the acrosome and therefore the contents of protease enzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The toxic effects of the acrosome and its contents have been described explicitly by&#xD;
           Morozumi and Yanagimachi. It induces deformation of the oocyte with an irregular&#xD;
           appearance, edema or cytolysis with a pseudo-vacuolated cytoplasm appearance.&#xD;
           Furthermore, it has been established that the damage caused by exogenous or acrosomales&#xD;
           enzymes were correlated with oocyte cytoskeleton disruption through an aberrant&#xD;
           accumulation of microtubules in the cortex of the oocyte.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition to the morphological and ultrastructural alterations in the oocyte, the&#xD;
           incorporation of the acrosome may result in a lack of nuclear activation of the oocyte.&#xD;
           Kasai et al. reported that the completion of oocyte meiosis occur faster if the sperm&#xD;
           was released from the acrosome. Similarly, an increase in fertilization rate after ICSI&#xD;
           with acrosome reacted sperm was observed in pigs. The study by Morozumi et al. also&#xD;
           demonstrated that the induction of the acrosome reaction of sperm from several species&#xD;
           prior to ICSI resulted in an acceleration of oocyte activation, which was manifest in&#xD;
           human spermatozoa. This was evidenced by the significant differences between the&#xD;
           profiles of calcium oscillations after ICSI with acrosome-intact or acrosome-reacted&#xD;
           sperm. Calcium waves recorded in oocytes injected with acrosome-reacted spermatozoa were&#xD;
           characterized by an early onset and amplitude and a higher frequency. In contrast, the&#xD;
           calcium response was abnormally delayed in oocytes injected with acrosome-intact sperm.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thus, altered calcium oscillations, the &quot;key&quot; oocyte activation signals during ICSI, is&#xD;
           the cause of abnormal pre-implantation embryo development to the blastocyst stage.&#xD;
           Indeed, the proportion of live healthy mice births is increased from 40% to 71%, when&#xD;
           intact or acrosome-reacted sperm are microinjected, respectively .&#xD;
&#xD;
           These same studies have also shown two things:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The introduction of acrosomal material is more harmful when the quantity is large&#xD;
                compared to the oocyte volume. There is therefore interest in systematically&#xD;
                reducing the amount of material introduced into the oocyte cytoplasm to improve&#xD;
                embryonic development.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The second thing is that the induction of the acrosome reaction before ICSI greatly&#xD;
                improves embryonic development and therefore the number of babies born from embryo&#xD;
                transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although ICSI in human gives very satisfactory results, the rate of infants obtained by&#xD;
           embryo is lower than after IVF embryos transfer. Hence, there is a possibility of&#xD;
           improving the results of ICSI by induction of the acrosome reaction prior to&#xD;
           microinjection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After several studies we used incubation of spermatozoa with the follicular fluid (FF)&#xD;
           of the partner to induce the spermatozoa acrosome reaction (Karim Rahal, 2011 Master&#xD;
           Thesis 2). FF is indeed a potent inducer of the AR. There is no problem of traceability&#xD;
           since the FF of the patient is used only for the sperm of her husband. This technic can&#xD;
           be applied to the poorest semen. Finally, the technique is used in a very easy routine,&#xD;
           since the follicular fluid is always recovered during oocyte retrieval and thus&#xD;
           available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis A preliminary study was run in human on microinjection of spermatozoa that&#xD;
           were selected for their acrosomal status by birefringence microscopy. It showed that it&#xD;
           improves the implantation rate from 24,4 % to 39 % . We therefore hypothesize that the&#xD;
           improvement in the implantation rate of embryos obtained by ICSI after acrosomal&#xD;
           induction as well as the reduction of miscarriage rate may result in improved clinical&#xD;
           pregnancy outcome and birth rates of about 10 %.&#xD;
