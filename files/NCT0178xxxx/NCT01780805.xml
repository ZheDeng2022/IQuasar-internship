      This study involves completion of questionnaires, computer-based cognitive tasks and an&#xD;
      alcohol drinking session. Participation in this study consists of an initial, in-person&#xD;
      screening appointment, 4 brief daily appointments at the research office, an alcohol drinking&#xD;
      session at a local bar and a follow-up appointment 1-3 days after the alcohol drinking&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are found to be eligible in the screening phase will then complete a daily&#xD;
      appointment for 4 days out of a 5-day period (i.e., there will be 1 day out of the 5 on which&#xD;
      they will not attend an appointment). Each appointment will last 20 minutes, on average and&#xD;
      consist of a questionnaire and computer-based cognitive task. On the day of the fourth&#xD;
      appointment, participants will complete an alcohol drinking session. The alcohol drinking&#xD;
      session begins at 4pm and lasts until at least midnight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be young adults between the ages of 21-25, who regularly&#xD;
      drink alcohol and are not currently seeking treatment for alcohol use. Seventy-two&#xD;
      participants will complete this study.&#xD;
