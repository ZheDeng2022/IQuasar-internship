      The primary objective of this study is to assess and compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      Tiotropium delivered via Breath Actuated Inhaler (BAI) (4.5 mcg/day or 9.0 mcg/day),&#xD;
      SPIRIVA®, HandiHaler®, (18 mcg/day) and Respimat® Soft Mist™ Inhaler (SMI) (5.0 mcg/day)&#xD;
      following repeat dosing for 7 days in subjects with COPD.&#xD;

      This multicenter study consists of a Screening Visit (3 to 14 days prior to randomization); 4&#xD;
      multiple-dose (7-day) Treatment Periods, each consisting of a 2-night/3-day inpatient stay&#xD;
      (Day 6 to Day 8); and a Final Visit. A washout period of at least 21 days will occur between&#xD;
      each Treatment Period. The Final/ Early Termination Visit will occur 6-8 days following the&#xD;
      last Treatment Period or upon early discharge from the study.&#xD;
