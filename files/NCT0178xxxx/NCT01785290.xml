  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effects of a low dosage of prophylactic haloperidol&#xD;
      in patients with a high risk to develop delirium, defined by an expected ICU length of stay&#xD;
      of &gt;1 day. The investigators hypothesized that haloperidol prophylaxis in patients with a&#xD;
      high risk for delirium reduces 28-day mortality, delirium and delirium related outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two different dosages of haloperidol are used in this study to compare with placebo. A dosage&#xD;
      of 1mg, or 2mg or placebo three times a day in a double-blinded fashion resulting in a&#xD;
      three-armed multicentre randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial. To relate the&#xD;
      potential beneficial effects of haloperidol to the a priori risk to develop delirium, the&#xD;
      PREDELIRIC-model (delirium prediction model for ICU patients) will be used. This will enable&#xD;
      the investigators to determine the preventive efficacy of haloperidol in patient groups based&#xD;
      on their risk to develop delirium.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study high risk patients will be included. Based on historical data the investigators&#xD;
      know that the median predicted delirium risk is 35% in patients with an expected stay on the&#xD;
      ICU of over one day. This is considered a high risk to develop delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess patients for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)-ICU is part of&#xD;
      daily clinical practice in all participating centres. In this study, high risk patients will&#xD;
      receive three times a day a study drug of which two groups receive a low dose of haloperidol&#xD;
      (1mg or 2mg) and a third arm will receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This drug is worldwide the first choice of drug to treat delirious patients. When delirium is&#xD;
      diagnosed, patients are treated according to delirium protocol, using a higher dosage than in&#xD;
      the prophylactic treatment period as described in the study protocol. It is recognized that&#xD;
      early treatment of delirium has beneficial effects compared with delayed treatment, and there&#xD;
      is also some evidence that delirium prevention in ICU patients has beneficial effects, but&#xD;
      the design of these previous studies was not optimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential side-effects of haloperidol include, extrapyramidal symptoms, drowsiness,&#xD;
      agitation, and ventricular arrhythmias. The latter are extremely rare (only case-reports are&#xD;
      published) and related to a higher dosage of haloperidol. With the dosage that will be used&#xD;
      in the present study no relevant side-effects are anticipated. Nevertheless, and given the&#xD;
      preventive nature of this study, extra attention is being paid on recognition of possible&#xD;
      side-effects of haloperidol in the protocol. Importantly, in three recent prophylactic&#xD;
      haloperidol studies no relevant side-effects, and in particular no ventricular arrhythmias,&#xD;
      were reported using a similar low dosage of haloperidol as described in the present protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study several inter-rater reliability checks (delirium experts versus ICU nurses)&#xD;
      concerning the CAM_ICU assessments will be performed. Also medical and nursing files will be&#xD;
      checked to secure the quality of the delirium diagnose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be monitored (all sites), randomly included patient data will be checked on&#xD;
      delirium diagnose and endpoints of the study. All data will be collected by Electronic CRF. A&#xD;
      check of completeness on all data is build-in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All variables are defined using a data dictionary (using the NICE data dictionary)&#xD;
      supplemented with definitions of PREDELIRIC-model predictors, delirium diagnosis (at least&#xD;
      one positive CAM-ICU assessment), and delirium duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation is based on the effect on number of days of survival in 28-days&#xD;
      mortality derived from the evaluation study using low dosage of prophylactic haloperidol. If&#xD;
      the true hazard ratio of control patients relative to intervention patients is 0.85, taken&#xD;
      into account an accrual time of 90 days with 28 days of follow-up, the investigators will&#xD;
      need to study 647 patients per intervention group and 647 control patients to be able to&#xD;
      reject the null hypothesis that the experimental and control survival curves are equal with&#xD;
      probability (power) 0.80. The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null&#xD;
      hypothesis is 0.05. Taken into account a drop out of 10% the investigators will include 715&#xD;
      patients per group; in total 2145 patients. The investigators assume that the effect on&#xD;
      number of days of survival in 28-days mortality will be comparable between the two&#xD;
      intervention groups. The Cox-regression analysis group will have three levels (placebo, 1 mg&#xD;
      and 2 mg haloperidol three times daily).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)will monitor the safety of the study including interim&#xD;
      analyses on safety/futility after 175-350 and 500 patients and safety and superiority after&#xD;
      1000 patients. Followed by a final analysis after 2145 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only for the interim analysis after 500 and 1000 patients adjusting for covariates (age,&#xD;
      gender, delirium prediction score and sepsis) will be performed to determine the effect on&#xD;
      28-day survival&#xD;

      After the 4th interim analysis the DSMB advised to drop on study arm due to effectivity and&#xD;
      efficiency reasons. Since July 2015 the study has been continued with two study arms and the&#xD;
      included numbers of patients is adjusted to 1800 patients.&#xD;
