      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the comfort of two type of speculums used during&#xD;
      routine gynecologic exam. Your treatment and medical care will not change because you are&#xD;
      participating in this study. Your doctor will continue to make all decisions regarding your&#xD;
      proper treatment and care.&#xD;

      Speculum examination is a common procedure in the gynecology clinic used for evaluation of&#xD;
      numerous conditions such as vaginitis, and during cervical cytology screening (PAP smears).&#xD;
      The speculum is inserted into the woman's vagina and used to keep the vaginal walls apart&#xD;
      during exam and procedures. Each step of the examination with a speculum including insertion,&#xD;
      manipulation during examination, and removal can cause discomfort for the patient. Fear of&#xD;
      examination pain is considered one barrier to examination compliance. Any method to decrease&#xD;
      discomfort during the exam would be considered beneficial to patient screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typically two types of speculums are used in clinical practice, metal and plastic. There are&#xD;
      advantages to both, and usage is usually predicated by physician preference. Previous studies&#xD;
      have demonstrated a clear difference in patient comfort between metal speculums and newer&#xD;
      dilating speculums such as the Vera scope (1). Clinical trials have also shown the benefit of&#xD;
      using lubrication on metal speculums during routine exams (2). To date there are no clinical&#xD;
      trails to examine the difference in patient comfort between metal and plastic bi-valve&#xD;
      speculums.&#xD;
