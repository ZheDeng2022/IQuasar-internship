  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a sequential combination&#xD;
      therapy of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to evaluate the potential synergistic activity of nivolumab and ipilimumab and also&#xD;
      because there may be differences in biology between tumors which are stable or responding to&#xD;
      therapy and those that are clinically progressing, this study, CA209064, looked at two&#xD;
      sequential combination regimens in which the second agent is administered immediately after a&#xD;
      pre-specified duration of therapy with the first agent and not delayed until the time of&#xD;
      progression after the first agent. This sequential study design looked at pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      changes during treatment with one agent which may predict clinical activity to subsequent&#xD;
      treatment with the alternate agent. This was done because it has not been scientifically&#xD;
      proven whether or not the order in which nivolumab and ipilimumab are given is clinically&#xD;
      important.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Related Grade 3-5 Adverse Events (AEs) During the Induction Period (Period 1 and 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 to up to Week 25</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with treatment-related grade 3-5 adverse events (AEs) is defined as the number of participants who experienced at least 1 treatment related grade 3 - 5 adverse event (AE) per national cancer institute common terminology criteria for adverse events (NCI CTCAE v4.0, any preferred term) with an onset date after or on first day of Induction Period #1 and not later than discontinuation date from Induction Period #2, divided by the total number of treated participants.&#xD;
Adverse Event (AE) = any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a preexisting condition that may or may not have a causal relationship with treatment.&#xD;
Treatment-related = having certain, probable, possible, or missing relationship to study drug.&#xD;
Grade (Gr) 3=Severe Gr 4=Potentially Life-threatening or disabling Gr 5=Death</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator-Assessed Response Rate at Week 25</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 25</time_frame>
    <description>Response rate is defined as the number of participants who have a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at Week 25 per modified RECIST 1.1 criteria, with confirmation on the scheduled scan at Week 33 (or any subsequent scan performed at least 4 weeks after the Week 25 scan), divided by the total number of treated participants. Results of the tumor assessment at Week 13 or any unscheduled tumor assessment obtained prior to Week 25, except for baseline/screening tumor assessment, were not considered in the assessment of response rate at Week 25.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator-Assessed Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From week 25 to up to date of disease progression or death (Up to 6 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response (DOR) is defined as the time between the Week 25 date of response and the date of objectively documented disease progression as defined by modified RECIST 1.1 criteria or death, whichever occurs first. Median computed using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator-Assessed Rate of Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 13 and Week 25</time_frame>
    <description>Progression rate at a specific timepoint is defined as the number of participants who have Progressive Disease (PD) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 at that specific timepoint divided by the total number of treated participants. As specified by modified RECIST 1.1, the evaluation of PD at Week 13 and Week 25 used the baseline tumor assessment as reference. A participant who died without a reported prior progression was considered to have progressed on the date of death. Deaths before or at Week 13 are counted as progression outcome. Confidence interval is based on the Clopper and Pearson method.</description>

        <title>Investigator-Assessed Rate of Progression</title>
        <description>Progression rate at a specific timepoint is defined as the number of participants who have Progressive Disease (PD) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 at that specific timepoint divided by the total number of treated participants. As specified by modified RECIST 1.1, the evaluation of PD at Week 13 and Week 25 used the baseline tumor assessment as reference. A participant who died without a reported prior progression was considered to have progressed on the date of death. Deaths before or at Week 13 are counted as progression outcome. Confidence interval is based on the Clopper and Pearson method.</description>

          <title>Investigator-Assessed Rate of Progression</title>
          <description>Progression rate at a specific timepoint is defined as the number of participants who have Progressive Disease (PD) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 at that specific timepoint divided by the total number of treated participants. As specified by modified RECIST 1.1, the evaluation of PD at Week 13 and Week 25 used the baseline tumor assessment as reference. A participant who died without a reported prior progression was considered to have progressed on the date of death. Deaths before or at Week 13 are counted as progression outcome. Confidence interval is based on the Clopper and Pearson method.</description>
