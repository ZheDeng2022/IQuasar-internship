  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess, in patients scheduled for femoropopliteal bypass, the&#xD;
      benefit of a double peripheral nerve block (femoral + sciatic) with levobupivacaine and&#xD;
      clonidine in a single dose, performed before induction of general anaesthesia, on analgesia&#xD;
      postoperatively assessed by morphine consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applied to the patient at the beginning of general anesthesia, this technique could allow one&#xD;
      hand, to reduce the need for opiates, on the other hand - due to anesthetized limb&#xD;
      vasodilation - to improve tissue perfusion downstream.&#xD;

      Course of the study Visit 1 (J-15 J-1): Pre-inclusion During a follow-up visit usual&#xD;
      pathology, the doctor will propose to the patient to participate in the protocol. Information&#xD;
      Form will be given to the patient to be read at home to maintain a sufficient time for&#xD;
      reflection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (J-1): Pre-anesthetic, the eve of the intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the pre-anesthetic consultation routine, the doctor will check the informed consent&#xD;
      and then note the following information on the case report form: age, height, weight, sex of&#xD;
      the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 (J0): Surgery One hour before surgery the patient will receive premedication with&#xD;
      Hydroxyzine (Atarax Â®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then the anesthetic team install patient in monitoring room so that the test products are&#xD;
      administered according to the double-blind randomization schedule prepared in advance. When&#xD;
      the block is made, the patient is brought into the operating room for general anesthesia and&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By the end of surgery, the following data will be collected in the case report form :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, PetCO2, SpO2) every 10 minutes and&#xD;
           incidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of injection tested products and time of induction of general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major Surgical times : incision, venous sampling when indicated, heparin bolus, clamping&#xD;
           the superficial femoral artery, arterial unclamping, skin closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of operation (in minutes from the incision to skin closure).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intraoperative sufentanil consumption (micrograms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and medical care in Post Anaesthesia Carry Unit (PACU):&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, the patient will be conducted in PACU. He will benefit from routine monitoring&#xD;
      of vital parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and SpO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then patient extubation, according to usual criteria, will be performed: extubation of the&#xD;
      patient is the H0, when all the time measurement start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - H0: Extubation Morphine consumption will be measured continuously during the 72 first&#xD;
      postoperative hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      rSO2 be measured by NIRS during the first 12 first postoperative hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H0 +30 min: rating of pain (simple numerical scale) + sedation score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H0 +60 min: rating of pain + sedation score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H0 +90 min: rating of pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H0 +120 min: rating of pain + sedation score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H0+4h: rating of pain + sedation score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H0+8h: rating of pain + sedation score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H0+12h: rating of pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H0+16h: rating of pain + sedation score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H0+20h: rating of pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H0+24h: rating of pain + sedation score + morphine consumption with PCA and number of&#xD;
           requests over the last 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H0+32h: rating of pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H0+40h: rating of pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H0+48h: rating of pain + morphine consumption with PCA and number of requests over the&#xD;
           last 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H0+56h: rating of pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H0+64h: rating of pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H0+72h: rating of pain + morphine consumption with PCA and number of requests over the&#xD;
           last 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of PACU: rating of pain + sedation score&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter, recovery time of ambulation will be registered and duration of hospital stay,&#xD;
      rate of reoperation within 30 post-operative days and 30-day survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be collected to have information about hemodynamic tolerance of the&#xD;
      products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is then monitored in the usual care of the disease.&#xD;
