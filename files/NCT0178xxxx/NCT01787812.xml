  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The California Joint Replacement Registry (CJRR) was created to meet the need for&#xD;
      comprehensive, scientific assessment of devices, treatment protocols, surgical approaches,&#xD;
      and patient factors influencing the results of hip and knee replacement surgeries.&#xD;
      Importantly, it is a Level 3 registry, meaning it collects and incorporates clinical&#xD;
      information and direct feedback from patients about the outcomes of hip and knee replacement&#xD;
      surgeries. It is one of only a small number of registries in the United States to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CJRR's goals are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect and report scientifically valid data on the results of hip and knee replacements&#xD;
           performed in California, including device safety and effectiveness, post-operative&#xD;
           complication and revision rates, and patient-reported outcomes; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Promote the use of performance information regarding hip and knee replacements to guide&#xD;
           physician and patient decisions and to support programs for provider recognition and&#xD;
           reward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically the CJRR is designed to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Minimize burden on participants by using electronic data sources, rather than manual&#xD;
           data entry or chart review.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compile reports assessing the outcomes associated with different devices and surgical&#xD;
           techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Create benchmarking reports for physicians and hospitals that detail performance data&#xD;
           and compare it to statewide averages.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transmit safety alerts on devices with short-term results that provoke concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shape a measurement and reporting system for total hip and total knee replacement&#xD;
           surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CJRR was developed by the California HealthCare Foundation (CHCF), the Pacific Business&#xD;
      Group on Health (PBGH), and the California Orthopaedic Association (COA). PBGH manages the&#xD;
      day-to-day operations of the CJRR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CJRR's data elements are aligned with other major orthopedic registries. The CJRR is a member&#xD;
      of the International Consortium of Orthopedic Registries (ICOR) and the International Society&#xD;
      of Arthroscopic Registries (ISAR).&#xD;
