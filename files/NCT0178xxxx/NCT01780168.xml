    <textblock>
      The Metabolism, Infection and Immunity (MINI) Study is a longitudinal natural history study&#xD;
      at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that aims to define the relationship between&#xD;
      infection, immunity and clinical decline in individuals with mitochondrial disease.&#xD;
      Mitochondrial diseases are a group of disorders caused by problems with the cell s ability to&#xD;
      produce energy. Infection in individuals with mitochondrial disease can lead to worsening&#xD;
      clinical symptoms, particularly neurologic symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of our study is to understand the relationship between infection and clinical&#xD;
      decline in patients with mitochondrial disease. Mitochondrial diseases can affect many&#xD;
      different parts of the body, including the immune system and its ability to respond to&#xD;
      infection. Therefore, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of participants including a&#xD;
      detailed immunologic assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are not testing any new medicine or procedure to treat or cure IEM or mitochondrial&#xD;
      diseases. However, by understanding the relationship between infection and mitochondrial&#xD;
      disease, we hope to develop treatments in the future. At the NIH, we are interested in&#xD;
      research. Although we do provide advice and care for people enrolled in our study, we are not&#xD;
      able to take over the long-term care of participants. To enroll in our study, you (your&#xD;
      child) must already have a confirmed diagnosis of a mitochondrial disease. We are not able to&#xD;
      provide a &quot;first time&quot; diagnosis or regular metabolic care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is involved?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you contact our team members, you will be asked to provide medical records to determine&#xD;
      eligibility. Our team will review the records and notify you if you (your child is) eligible&#xD;
      to join the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Onsite participation: You (your child) will be invited to visit the National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health in Bethesda, Maryland. This first visit will typically last 3-5 days. Depending on the&#xD;
      level of participation, additional visits may be requested. Our team members will work with&#xD;
      you and your child to coordinate the supports needed during your stay at NIH. Study&#xD;
      participants may be seen in the clinic, day hospital or inpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When you (your child) arrive at the NIH we will have an informed consent discussion to&#xD;
      confirm willingness to participate, answer questions and review the risks and benefits of the&#xD;
      study. You (your child) will meet with a physician who will ask about medical and family&#xD;
      history and do a physical exam (like in any doctor's office). We will ask all study&#xD;
      participants to allow us to collect urine, draw blood, swab your (your child s) nose, and&#xD;
      perform a detailed assessment. We may suggest additional evaluations or specialty consults&#xD;
      for some participants based on clinical manifestations, age and level of independence. We&#xD;
      will explain these studies to you (your child). They may include items such as- imaging&#xD;
      studies, DEXA or MRI scan, energy expenditure or metabolic testing, developmental&#xD;
      neuropsychological logical testing, physiatry, ophthalmology, or other consults. In some&#xD;
      cases, we may request a skin biopsy (if one has not been done). You will receive the results&#xD;
      of your (your child's) clinical testing and notes from any clinical consultations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Remote participation: If you (your child) are unable to travel, you (your child) may be&#xD;
      enrolled remotely for records review, questionnaires, and telethealth exams. Blood or other&#xD;
      samples collection may be requested in coordination with local providers or lab testing&#xD;
      companies&#xD;

      The biochemical perturbations in children with inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) may affect&#xD;
      their immune response. As a result, this will not only increase risk for infection but also&#xD;
      hamper their ability to develop protective immunity after vaccination. Characterizing&#xD;
      perturbations in immunity and the ability of vaccines to provide protective immunity in IEM&#xD;
      is critical. Immune deficiencies and the immunogenicity of vaccines have not been well&#xD;
      characterized in IEM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viral infections play a significant role in precipitating life-threatening acute&#xD;
      decompensations in various IEM. Seasonal variation of respiratory and gastrointestinal&#xD;
      viruses places this vulnerable population at significant risk. The standard of care for these&#xD;
      patients is routine childhood vaccination as well as vaccination for seasonal influenza&#xD;
      viruses. However, nutritional deficiencies and their underlying IEM enzymopathies may affect&#xD;
      the efficacy of vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol, we will clinically evaluate the immunologic states of patients with IEM.&#xD;
      Routine inpatient and outpatient admissions will last 2-3 days and may involve blood drawing,&#xD;
      radiological procedures, nutrition assessment and biometrics. Immune challenge may be&#xD;
      performed using vaccinations for seasonal influenza and pneumococcus (PPV23). Follow-up&#xD;
      appointments will be scheduled at the end of the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objectives will be to describe the immune deficiencies seen, in this patient&#xD;
      population, describe vaccine seroconversion in this patient population, and search for new&#xD;
      genes in rare families that have evidence for an unknown class of IEM. The population will&#xD;
      consist of patients previously evaluated at NIH, physician referrals, and families directed&#xD;
      to the study from clinicaltrials.gov as well as the patient advocacy groups. All patients&#xD;
      will be evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION and EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients of any gender and ethnicity age 2 years and older with a diagnosis of MD or a&#xD;
        related disorder are eligible to enroll in this protocol. Patients will be diagnosed based&#xD;
        on a determination of several parameters that may include DNA mutation or enzyme analysis&#xD;
        known or pending. Participants need to be medically managed by a local provider. We will&#xD;
        obtain written consent from the patient to review medical records from their home physician&#xD;
        to confirm eligibility. In certain situations we may elect to enroll unaffected first&#xD;
        degree family members of patients with MD for the delineation of a patient s phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy volunteers of any gender and ethnicity 2 years and older may also be eligible to&#xD;
        enroll in the protocol. Healthy volunteers may be from the local community, or family&#xD;
        members of patients with MD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient and healthy volunteer exclusion criteria include: less than 2 years of age. The&#xD;
        Principal Investigator may decline to enroll a patient for other reasons based on clinical&#xD;
        judgment. Other criteria that may lead to exclusion include, for example, residing in a&#xD;
        hospital. Furthermore for MD patients, any patient who does not have a regular/local&#xD;
        physician with expertise in mitochondrial disease and/or a family physician, pediatrician,&#xD;
        or internist will also be excluded. For MD patients, a study team member will obtain&#xD;
        pertinent medical history and may contact each potential patient s local&#xD;
        metabolic/specialty physician to discuss the details of their last visit, and their current&#xD;
        clinical status to determine whether the patient is an appropriate candidate for this&#xD;
        protocol. Closer to a scheduled visit, the study team will confirm the details of the&#xD;
        patient s medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Lastly, each family will be contacted by a member of the study staff prior to a pending&#xD;
        inpatient admission to confirm that the patient is metabolically stable and ready to visit&#xD;
        the NIH in a state of relative health, with an adequate supply of special formulas,&#xD;
        medications and&#xD;
&#xD;
        supplements.&#xD;
