  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2010, more than 35,000 people died in the United Kingdom from lung cancer, the majority&#xD;
      from non-small cell cancer (NSCLC). Chemotherapy is one of the main treatments for patients&#xD;
      with NSCLC but those treated will still only live for an average of 9 or 10 months after&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to find out whether or not giving a drug called&#xD;
      Olaparib following chemotherapy will benefit patients with NSCLC who have responded to&#xD;
      initial chemotherapy treatment by prolonging the time before the tumour regrows. Olaparib is&#xD;
      a new, oral drug developed by AstraZeneca which may help to slow down cancer growth. The&#xD;
      rationale for this clinical trial is that chemotherapy damages tumour cell DNA and NSCLC&#xD;
      tumours that respond to chemotherapy are less able to repair this damage. This can be&#xD;
      exploited by using Olaparib as it blocks an enzyme called Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)&#xD;
      which is essential for DNA repair. This will prevent DNA repair and cause cancer cell death&#xD;
      by a mechanism known as synthetic lethality. Synthetic lethality arises when a combination of&#xD;
      mutation in two or more genes leads to cell death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 300 patients who are to receive standard chemotherapy treatment will be initially&#xD;
      registered into the trial. Of these patients, 114 patients who have responded to chemotherapy&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated to receive either Olaparib or an inactive dummy pill or placebo by&#xD;
      mouth. The trial will assess whether Olaparib delays disease progression following standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment in patients. It will also show whether the side effects of adding&#xD;
      Olaparib following standard treatment are acceptable.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre randomised phase II trial. Patients are initially registered either&#xD;
      before or during induction chemotherapy, their response to which will be used to determine&#xD;
      whether they are eligible for randomisation. All patients will be asked to consent to&#xD;
      archival tissue collection for translational analysis and to provide a translational blood&#xD;
      sample. The second consent will precede randomisation to one of two groups of maintenance&#xD;
      therapy (olaparib or placebo) with 1:1 randomisation if they have had an objectively measured&#xD;
      complete or partial response following standard chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomised patients will receive olaparib or placebo until disease progression. They will be&#xD;
      monitored by CT scan every two cycles until disease progression, where they will be managed&#xD;
      according to local practice. Follow up will be for a maximum of 12 months from the point of&#xD;
      randomisation or until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All randomised patients for whom we have a baseline translational blood sample will be asked&#xD;
      to provide a follow up blood sample upon randomisation and again at radiological progression.&#xD;
      Registered patients with progressive disease after the initial induction chemotherapy will be&#xD;
      asked to provide a follow-up blood sample at the end of induction chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <description>Olaparib is a potent inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase enzyme (PARP), (molecular weight 434) that is being developed as a monotherapy as well as for combination with chemotherapy and other anti-cancer agents. Olaparib can lead to tumour regression in patients with DNA repair deficient NSCLC. Olaparib may also enhance the DNA damaging effects of chemotherapy.</description>
