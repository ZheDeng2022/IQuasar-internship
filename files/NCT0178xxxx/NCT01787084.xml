      Investigational study of Edwards Lifesciences, LLC's &quot;Edwards SAPIEN Transcatheter Heart&#xD;
      Valve&quot; for non-femoral delivery, (or alternative access deliver) in patients with severe&#xD;
      symptomatic native aortic valve stenosis who have been determined by a cardiac surgeon to be&#xD;
      inoperable for open aortic valve replacement and in whom existing co-morbidities would not&#xD;
      preclude the expected benefit from correction of the aortic stenosis. Will outcomes observed&#xD;
      in a high-risk operable transapical native valve TAVR cohort receiving an Edwards SAPIEN&#xD;
      device compare to inoperable patients undergoing alternative access TAVR with the Edwards&#xD;
      SAPIEN device experience a reasonably similar incidence of 30 day adverse events?&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using the Edwards SAPIEN valve and Retroflex 3&#xD;
      delivery system provides both a mortality and quality of life benefit for inoperable&#xD;
      patients. Only the transfemoral (TF) access has been approved in the US. A substantial number&#xD;
      of patients cannot have a TF approach due to inadequate vessel size, vessel disease, or other&#xD;
      anatomical considerations. The pivotal study did not include an assessment of safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of alternative access approaches in this inoperable patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early approaches to TAVR included a femoral transvenous approach with transseptal access to&#xD;
      the left side for delivery of the valve. This approach avoided large bore arterial&#xD;
      catheterization, but it had unacceptable rates of complications and lacked reproducibility.&#xD;
      Alternative access approaches have been developed because of the risks associated with&#xD;
      inserting large caliber catheters into small, diseased femoral arteries often associated with&#xD;
      diffuse vasculopathy. To avoid the vascular complications from femoral access, other&#xD;
      transcatheter approaches have been developed to include open surgical access to the left&#xD;
      ventricular apex (TA), ascending aorta, (TAO), subclavian and axillary arteries (TS), and&#xD;
      retroperitoneal access to the iliac artery (TI) as well as distal aorta. In addition to&#xD;
      providing TAVR to patients who cannot have TF access, additional advantages include better&#xD;
      catheter control and safer closure of the access site. Commonly cited disadvantages include&#xD;
      the need for surgical expertise and additional equipment, along with the potential for longer&#xD;
      recovery, more incisional pain, greater radiation exposure for operators, unsuitable delivery&#xD;
      catheters for alternative access sites, and a host of unique alternative access site&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to collectively analyze 30-day safety endpoints as a lumped data group for these&#xD;
      alternative access approaches. These data are gathered from clinical practice in real-world&#xD;
      settings and submitted to the TVT Registry. It is expected that centers will choose among the&#xD;
      various choices for alternative access based the causative factors underlying the need for&#xD;
      alternative access, as well as local skill sets and experience. For this lumped data group of&#xD;
      alternative access approaches we will compare 30-day safety results to the TA outcomes&#xD;
      reported from Cohort A of the PARTNERS 1 trial. We recognize that these TA patients were high&#xD;
      risk operable patients rather than inoperable patients, but no other direct comparator group&#xD;
      is available. We reason that the TA data from this published clinical trial are high quality,&#xD;
      represent an alternative access approach rather than TF, and will provide a frequency of&#xD;
      safety endpoints that have been found to be acceptable both clinically and from a regulatory&#xD;
      perspective.&#xD;
