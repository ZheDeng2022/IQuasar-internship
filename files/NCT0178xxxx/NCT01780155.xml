      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Some premature babies develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and retinopathy of&#xD;
      prematurity (ROP). BPD and ROP are long-term chronic diseases of the lungs and eyes,&#xD;
      respectively. BPD is associated with receiving mechanical ventilation to treat respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome, and causes lung inflammation and scarring. ROP is caused by poor&#xD;
      development of blood vessels in the eyes, and may lead to blindness. Because not all&#xD;
      premature babies develop BPD or ROP, researchers want to study the genes that could be&#xD;
      associated with these diseases. They will look at both premature infants and their parents to&#xD;
      see if there is a genetic component to BPD and ROP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study genes that may be associated with BPD and ROP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Premature babies born with a weight less than or equal to 1,250 grams.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents of the premature babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents will answer questions about the mother s health and pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Delivery and medical information will be collected during the baby s hospitalization for&#xD;
           the first month after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents will provide a saliva sample from the inside of the cheek.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A saliva sample will also be collected from the baby within 28 days of birth. If the&#xD;
           baby needs tracheal aspiration (removal of fluid from the throat), tracheal fluid&#xD;
           samples will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parents will have followup interviews about their child s health 6 months, 12 months,&#xD;
           and yearly for up to 6 years after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a genetic study only. Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

      Understanding the role of susceptibility genes for risk of BPD and ROP may lead to immediate&#xD;
      identification of populations who require personalized medical care, and to the assessment of&#xD;
      innovative prophylactic and therapeutic interventions in the future. Our purpose is to&#xD;
      establish in our hospital network a prospective cohort of triads composed of premature&#xD;
      newborns with a birth weight less than or equal to 1250 g and their parents, to examine the&#xD;
      role of candidate susceptibility genes in the development of BPD and ROP. Our hypothesis is&#xD;
      that the presence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in candidate genes is associated with&#xD;
      differential susceptibility to BPD and ROP. As an initial model, a loss-of-function&#xD;
      substitution at position -617 of the NRF2 promoter region is hypothesized to be associated&#xD;
      with a greater risk of severe BPD and prethreshold ROP in premature infants with a birth&#xD;
      weight less than or equal to 1250 g.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Premature newborns with a birth weight less than or equal to 1250 g and their parents from&#xD;
        the participating institutions that comprise the Fundacion Infant hospital network will be&#xD;
        enrolled in this study after signing the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Premature newborns with a birth weight less than or equal to 1250 g with cyanotic&#xD;
        congenital heart disease, congenital anomalies of the respiratory tract (for example,&#xD;
        tracheoesophageal fistula, pulmonary hypoplasia, diaphragmatic hernia), eye malformations,&#xD;
        or congenital immunodeficiencies. Newborns from parents (mother and/or father) who used in&#xD;
        vitro fertilization products from donor banks will also be excluded from participating in&#xD;
