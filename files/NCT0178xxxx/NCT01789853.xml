      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of intensive locomotor interventions&#xD;
      early post stroke. An intensive locomotor training (LT) program will be compared to an active&#xD;
      control, conventional physical therapy. It is proposed that an early and intensive stepping&#xD;
      paradigm that is not typically employed early in physical therapy will lead to superior&#xD;
      outcomes and improved community mobility. A randomized, blinded, controlled trial will test&#xD;
      subjects with moderate to severe locomotor dysfunction in individuals post-stroke to compare&#xD;
      walking-related outcomes after intensive gait training (including treadmill, overground,&#xD;
      stair training, and skilled walking training) to outcomes after conventional physical&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

      In Aim 2, intensive gait training overground and on the treadmill using the device as&#xD;
      appropriate will be provided using a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) design. Determination&#xD;
      of optimal swing phase and propulsive assistance provided to subjects to maximize treadmill&#xD;
      walking velocity (in Aim 1) will be necessary to assess the efficacy of this technique to&#xD;
      improve walking function over prolonged LT sessions. Consistent with work from the previous&#xD;
      grant cycle12, we will compare the relative improvements in impairments, activity and&#xD;
      participation following 1 of 2, 8 -week interventions to improve walking ability post-stroke.&#xD;
      Fifty-six (56) subjects will be recruited, stratified based on walking 10 meters [requiring&#xD;
      moderate assistance (subject performing 50-74%), minimal assistance (subject performing&#xD;
      greater than 75% of gait but still needing assist), with a gait speed &lt;0.5m/s without assist,&#xD;
      or with gait speed of &gt;0.5-0.9m/s without assist. Subjects will be randomized to experimental&#xD;
      (intensive gait training using aforementioned gait training principles) or control conditions&#xD;
      (conventional physical therapy). The test group will receive 40, 40-minute LT sessions during&#xD;
      a 60 minute time period over 8 weeks with subjects ambulating on the treadmill, overground,&#xD;
      and on stairs. During the first 5 training sessions, LT will take place solely on the&#xD;
      treadmill. After that time, half of the sessions will be walking overground and stairs and&#xD;
      half on the treadmill. Training will be performed with a target heart rate of 70-80% of heart&#xD;
      rate reserve (HRR) and subjective ratings of perceived exertion of 14-17 when patients are on&#xD;
      medications to limit heart rate kinetics. Kinematics during LT will be monitored visually to&#xD;
      ensure proper foot placement necessary for continuous stepping while maintaining the&#xD;
      appropriate intensity, using the device as necessary. The control group will receive&#xD;
      conventional physical therapy (receiving at least 3 sessions of physical therapy per week) at&#xD;
      the subject's and medical teams' discretion (day rehabilitation, outpatient, or home health).&#xD;
      If the subject is not receiving at least 3 sessions of physical therapy per week, control&#xD;
      therapy treatments will be provided consistent with recent data detailing the amount of&#xD;
      specific physical therapy activities provided during single-session outpatient visits19and&#xD;
      published data21 as well as unpublished data from Moore that delineates the number of steps&#xD;
      taken per conventional therapy session based on the gait speed of individual (number of steps&#xD;
      during training=1500*gait speed+200). The additional 200 steps were added to this algorithm&#xD;
      to allow for individuals who require assist to receive gait training during the sessions.&#xD;
      Clinical and quantitative assessment of neuromuscular and cardiopulmonary impairments,&#xD;
      limitations in activity and participation, assessment of corticospinal tract (CST)&#xD;
      excitability and integrity will be performed prior to training, mid-training, end of 8 week&#xD;
      training, and with a 2-6 month follow-up examination. Control group participants will have&#xD;
      the option of participating in 4 weeks of intensive gait training (experimental protocol) at&#xD;
      the end of the follow up testing and complete one more testing session at the end of those 4&#xD;
      weeks. Primary outcome measures include laboratory and community measures of ambulatory&#xD;
      function, including gait speed over short distances, distance walked and gait efficiency&#xD;
      during the 6 min walk, and the amount of daily community stepping (using Step Activity&#xD;
      Monitors [SAM]20), CST excitability measures using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)&#xD;
      (optional) and assessment of white matter tract integrity using MRI (optional).&#xD;
