  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep-disordered breathing is characterized primarily by partial or total upper airway&#xD;
      obstruction during sleep. The most common form of sleep-disordered breathing is obstructive&#xD;
      sleep apnea (OSA) due to recurrent collapse of the upper airway with the onset of sleep&#xD;
      state. The major risk factors associated with the development of sleep apnea are obesity and&#xD;
      male sex. The investigators have also found a high prevalence of OSA in HIV infected men and&#xD;
      women, particularly among those with central lipohypertrophy, which is a common finding in&#xD;
      HIV-infected persons receiving antiretroviral therapy. Currently, our overall hypothesis is&#xD;
      that visceral adiposity, as seen in HIV-infected persons with central lipohypertrophy, alters&#xD;
      both mechanical properties and compensatory neuromuscular responses leading to upper airway&#xD;
      obstruction. Based on our most recent findings in the non-HIV population, the investigators&#xD;
      demonstrate that obesity is associated with elevations in the upper airway load (passive&#xD;
      Pcrit) that are counterbalanced by compensatory upper airway neural responses. Moreover, the&#xD;
      investigators have found that female sex, peripheral adiposity, and younger age are&#xD;
      associated with increased compensatory neuromuscular responses, while male sex, central&#xD;
      adiposity, and older age are associated with blunted compensatory responses. The loss of the&#xD;
      compensatory neuromuscular responses leads to obstructive sleep apnea. Among HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients with central lipohypertrophy, tesamorelin (Egrifta), a growth hormone releasing&#xD;
      hormone (GHRH) analogue, is approved for the reduction of visceral adipose tissue. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that tesamorelin therapy will reverse both the mechanical and&#xD;
      neurocompensatory alterations associated with increased central obesity. In this project the&#xD;
      investigators will determine whether tesamorelin affects sleep apnea severity and&#xD;
      compensatory neuromuscular responses of the upper airway on sleep and breathing in men and&#xD;
      women with HIV infection. The proposed studies are designed to elucidate the pathophysiologic&#xD;
      basis for the development of obstructive sleep apnea in this population. The studies also&#xD;
      provide insights into the neurohumoral regulation of upper airway function, and potentially&#xD;
      new approaches to the treatment for sleep-disordered breathing.&#xD;

        Men and women with HIV infection and central lipohypertrophy about to start tesamorelin&#xD;
        therapy will be recruited from the Endocrinology Clinic at the Johns Hopkins Outpatient&#xD;
        Center. Physicians and members of the clinical staff will identify eligible men and briefly&#xD;
        introduce the study to them. Patients will be offered a phone number for the Johns Hopkins&#xD;
        Sleep Disorders Center to call if they are interested in learning more about the research&#xD;
