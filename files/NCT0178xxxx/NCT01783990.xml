  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The BABY HUG Treatment Study was designed to see if treatment with the drug hydroxyurea (also&#xD;
      called HU) in children with sickle cell disease could prevent organ damage, especially in the&#xD;
      spleen and kidneys. There was also a chance that treatment could prevent painful crises, lung&#xD;
      disease, stroke, and blood infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current observational trial, Follow-Up Study ((FUS) II includes enhanced&#xD;
      neuropsychological, brain, cardiac, and pulmonary evaluations for this very well&#xD;
      characterized cohort of subjects. Measures of spleen and renal function and markers of DNA&#xD;
      damage will continue to be collected. Assessment of other target organs in sickle cell&#xD;
      disease including pulmonary and cardiac function will be performed in addition to evaluation&#xD;
      of developmental aspects of sickle cell disease (SCD) and potential HU toxicity.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Qualitative Spleen Function From Randomized Control Trial Baseline Measurement - Compared Between Children Randomized to Hydroxyurea vs Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and when child turned 10 years old</time_frame>
    <description>The change in splenic function from the randomized control trial baseline measurement was one of the primary outcomes. The change in splenic function (worse vs not-worse) was compared between the randomized treatment groups (hydroxyurea vs placebo). The change in splenic function from baseline (before treatment initiation) to age 10 years (a visit when child turned 10 years old) was defined as worse if it changed from normal to decreased or absent, or decreased to absent; and not worse if it changed from decreased to decreased, normal to normal, decreased to normal, absent to absent, or absent to decreased.</description>

    <measure>Change in Qualitative Spleen Function From Randomized Control Trial Baseline Measurement - Compared Between Children on Hydroxyurea vs Off Hydroxyurea at Study Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and when child turned 10 years old</time_frame>
    <description>The change in splenic function from the randomized control trial baseline measurement was one of the primary outcomes. The change in splenic function (worse vs not-worse) was compared between children who were known to be on hydroxyurea vs. off hydroxyurea at the time of the visit. The change in splenic function from baseline (before treatment initiation) to age 10 years (a visit when child turned 10 years old) was defined as worse if it changed from normal to decreased or absent, or decreased to absent; and not worse if it changed from decreased to decreased, normal to normal, decreased to normal, absent to absent, or absent to decreased.</description>

        <title>Change in Qualitative Spleen Function From Randomized Control Trial Baseline Measurement - Compared Between Children Randomized to Hydroxyurea vs Placebo</title>
        <description>The change in splenic function from the randomized control trial baseline measurement was one of the primary outcomes. The change in splenic function (worse vs not-worse) was compared between the randomized treatment groups (hydroxyurea vs placebo). The change in splenic function from baseline (before treatment initiation) to age 10 years (a visit when child turned 10 years old) was defined as worse if it changed from normal to decreased or absent, or decreased to absent; and not worse if it changed from decreased to decreased, normal to normal, decreased to normal, absent to absent, or absent to decreased.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Most children used hydroxyurea (HU) for at least part of the FUS-II observation period. This may dilute any effect of randomized group.&#xD;
Most children were on HU at the specified time points, which reduces power to compare on/off HU.</limitations_and_caveats>
