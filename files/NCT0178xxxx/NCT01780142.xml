      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Asthma is a lung condition that causes difficulty breathing and decreased lung function.&#xD;
      Some people with asthma have more severe disease symptoms. They may be less responsive to&#xD;
      standard treatments such as steroids. Researchers want to compare severe asthmatics with mild&#xD;
      or moderate asthmatics or people without asthma over a long period. This information may help&#xD;
      identify new treatments for people whose asthma is not well controlled by standard&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To compare severe asthmatics with mild or moderate asthmatics, and healthy volunteers, to&#xD;
      study the progression and outcomes of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with asthma for at least 1&#xD;
           year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will involve an initial visit to the NIH Clinical Center for all&#xD;
           participants. Selected participants may be asked to return for repeat visits over a&#xD;
           number of years. The test results from participants with asthma will be compared with&#xD;
           those from the healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may (but will not necessarily) have the following tests at each visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete medical history and physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, urine, sputum, and nasal cell samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breath tests and heart and lung function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Six-minute walk test to measure ability to exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging studies such as chest x-rays, bone density scans, and sinus scans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allergy skin testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vocal cord exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overnight sleep study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may remain on the study for as long as they are willing to participate and&#xD;
           do not develop health problems that will interfere with the study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a common disease and a significant public health problem, affecting one in every 10&#xD;
      individuals, nearly 30 million people in the US alone. About 5-10% of asthmatics have severe&#xD;
      disease that is difficult to control with standard therapies. Severe asthmatics are&#xD;
      considered to be relatively resistant to corticosteroids, a mainstay of therapy in asthma.&#xD;
      Furthermore, chronic corticosteroid therapy often results in side effects that adversely&#xD;
      affect outcomes. Thus, more effective treatment options, which are safe, cost-effective and&#xD;
      easy to administer, are needed for severe asthmatics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As our understanding of asthma evolves, it is becoming clearer that there are distinct&#xD;
      phenotypes that differ regarding demographic factors such as age, sex and race, but also,&#xD;
      perhaps more importantly, with regards to clinical, physiologic and biologic characteristics.&#xD;
      This heterogeneity may reflect distinct pathogenic mechanisms that result in airflow&#xD;
      obstruction and the clinical presentation of asthma. In turn, a better understanding of the&#xD;
      different factors that contribute to disease severity and pathogenesis will be necessary to&#xD;
      identify new, personalized treatment and management approaches for severe asthmatics. Our&#xD;
      goal is to gain a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms that differentiate severe&#xD;
      asthma from mild to moderate asthma, including the role of the above-mentioned factors on&#xD;
      disease control. In so doing, we hope to discover novel pathways that can be manipulated to&#xD;
      achieve our primary aim of developing new therapies for severe asthmatics.&#xD;

        Recruitment of subjects will be aimed at selecting our study population of interest, severe&#xD;
        asthmatics of both genders and all races over the age of 18 years. Mild and moderately&#xD;
        severe asthmatics, as well as age (+/- 10 years) and gender matched healthy volunteers&#xD;
        (non-asthmatics), will be enrolled for comparison to severe asthmatics. Asthmatics with&#xD;
        other concomitant conditions, e.g. other lung diseases such as COPD, which may confound the&#xD;
        data collected, may be excluded from the study.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  All volunteer subjects must be at least 18 years of age and must be able to provide&#xD;
             informed, written consent for participation in this study. Subjects will be recruited&#xD;
             irrespective of age, sex, race or ethnicity. Eligibility in the study is determined on&#xD;
             the basis of the following inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA - ASTHMATICS:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be over 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have had a diagnosis of asthma, as defined by the American Thoracic&#xD;
             Society, for at least one year to enter this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a history of reversible airflow obstruction, as defined by a&#xD;
             positive response to inhaled bronchodilators or a positive methacholine&#xD;
             bronchoprovocation challenge by ATS criteria. Severe, refractory asthma will be&#xD;
             defined by the 2000 ATS workshop consensus criteria. Refractory asthmatics will meet&#xD;
             one or both of the major criteria and at least two minor criteria as outlined in the&#xD;
             Protocol. This definition is applicable only to patients in whom (1) other conditions&#xD;
             have been excluded, (2) exacerbating factors have been optimally treated, and (3) poor&#xD;
             adherence does not appear to be a confounding issue. Compliance or medication&#xD;
             adherence will be assessed at the initial and subsequent visits by questioning the&#xD;
             subjects about their medication use (self-report).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If asthmatic subjects do not fulfill the criteria for severe asthma, they will be&#xD;
             classified as mild to moderate asthmatics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have the ability to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA - NON-ASTHMATICS:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be at least 18 years of age without a clinical diagnosis of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have no evidence of obstructive airway disease, as defined by ATS&#xD;
             criteria on spirometry, and a negative methacholine bronchoprovocation challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have the ability to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will be matched to asthmatics by gender and age (+/- 10 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any concurrent condition (medical, social or behavioral) that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             research team, would preclude or confound acquisition or interpretation of data or&#xD;
             delivery of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not be pregnant&#xD;
