  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to generate data on immunogenicity and safety of Purified Vero&#xD;
      Rabies Vaccine - Serum Free (VRVg) in comparison with Imovax® Rabies in order to support the&#xD;
      registration of VRVg in the USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate that VRVg is non inferior to Imovax® Rabies in terms of proportion of&#xD;
           subjects achieving an rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) titer ≥ 0.5 IU/mL at Day&#xD;
           42.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate that the observed proportion of subjects achieving an RVNA titer ≥ 0.5&#xD;
           IU/mL at Day 42 is at least 99%, with a 95% lower confidence limit of at least 97%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the clinical safety of VRVg each vaccine after each vaccine injection when&#xD;
           administered in a pre-exposure schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the immune response induced by each vaccine 21 days after two vaccinations&#xD;
           (Day 28) in a randomized subset of subjects and 14 days after the last vaccination of&#xD;
           the primary vaccination series.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe antibody persistence at 6 and 12 months after the first vaccination in all&#xD;
           subjects, and at 18 and 24 months in a subset of subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vaccination will be given in three injections, at Day 0, Day 7, and Day 28, respectively,&#xD;
      based on the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) and the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) recommendations for pre-exposure regimen. A booster dose will be&#xD;
      administered 1 year after the first vaccine injection in a randomized subset of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed in all participants up to 28 days after vaccination, as applicable,&#xD;
      in terms of occurrence of adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse&#xD;
      events of special interest (AESIs) up to Month 12.&#xD;
