  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL; NCT 01169259) is a randomized clinical trial in&#xD;
      20,000 U.S. men and women investigating whether taking daily dietary supplements of vitamin&#xD;
      D3 (2000 IU) or omega-3 fatty acids (1 gram of omega-3 fatty acids) reduces the risk of&#xD;
      developing cancer, heart disease, and stroke in people who do not have a prior history of&#xD;
      these illnesses. This ancillary study (VITAL Adiposity) is being conducted among participants&#xD;
      in VITAL and will examine the effect of vitamin D or fish oil on changes in body composition&#xD;
      and adiposity (baseline compared to 2 year, as measured by anthropometric indices, total and&#xD;
      regional body fat and adipokines) and assess whether changes in cardiovascular risk factors&#xD;
      (lipids, glucose tolerance, blood pressure) are mediated by these parameters. How achieved&#xD;
      25(OH)D levels are affected by body composition and body mass will also be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Observational studies suggest that low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels are associated&#xD;
      with high BMI and fat mass (FM), but it is unknown whether vitamin D supplementation can&#xD;
      alter body composition or adiposity. Despite enthusiasm for the use of vitamin D supplements&#xD;
      to reduce FM, the hypothesis that vitamin D can modify adiposity remains unproven. Finding&#xD;
      strategies to prevent obesity is of critical public health importance due to the high&#xD;
      prevalence of overweight/obesity and its role in causing diabetes, hypertension,&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease (CVD), among others. Observational studies also link low&#xD;
      25(OH)D levels to CVD risk factors related to obesity, but sequestration of vitamin D in fat&#xD;
      tissue may be a confounding factor. The effects of vitamin D supplementation on body&#xD;
      composition, adiposity and CVD risk factors are best tested in a randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      (RCT), and according to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) 2011 report, more data from&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials on these outcomes are needed. Previous trials of vitamin D have&#xD;
      been limited by the inability to separate effects of supplemental calcium from vitamin D,&#xD;
      small sample size, insufficient vitamin D dose, failure to monitor 25(OH)D levels or&#xD;
      inadequate ascertainment of body composition. The NIH-funded VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL&#xD;
      (VITAL) (1 U01 CA138962) affords a unique and cost-effective opportunity to investigate the&#xD;
      effect of vitamin D on changes in body composition and to assess whether changes in CVD risk&#xD;
      factors are mediated, at least in part, by these parameters. VITAL is a large-scale,&#xD;
      randomized, primary prevention trial testing 2000 IU/d vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and 1&#xD;
      g/day omega-3 fatty acids (840 mg EPA+DHA in 1.3:1 ratio) in a 2x2 factorial design among&#xD;
      20,000 men and women (≥50 and ≥55 years, respectively), with mean participant follow-up of 5&#xD;
      years for CVD and cancer. This ancillary study will address understudied areas and two&#xD;
      overarching hypotheses that vitamin D supplementation (1) lowers total and regional (trunkal&#xD;
      and abdominal/androidal) body fat as measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans,&#xD;
      improving biomarkers of adiposity (leptin, adiponectin) and (2) impacts CVD risk factors, at&#xD;
      least in part through adiposity. The investigators also seek to define how circulating&#xD;
      achieved 25(OH)D levels, due to supplementation, may be affected by body composition and BMI,&#xD;
      thus elucidating how adiposity, BMI, and body composition (total and regional) may influence&#xD;
      vitamin D intake needs in the population. To critically evaluate these hypotheses, the&#xD;
      investigators will examine a representative, randomized subcohort of 1000 racially diverse&#xD;
      VITAL participants (25% African American) over two years.&#xD;
