    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. HIV-1 infection, as documented by a rapid HIV test or any FDA-approved HIV-1 enzyme or&#xD;
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit and confirmed by Western blot at any&#xD;
             time prior to study entry. Alternatively, if a rapid HIV test or any FDA-approved&#xD;
             HIV-1 enzyme or chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit is not available, two&#xD;
             HIV-1 RNA values &gt;2000 copies/mL at least 24 hours apart performed by any laboratory&#xD;
             that has CLIA certification, or its equivalent, may be used to document infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Antiretroviral medication&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cohort 1: Subjects on HAART (no changes to treatment within 4 weeks of study&#xD;
                  entry) for at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects on HAART (no changes to treatment within 4 weeks of study entry) for at&#xD;
                  least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Plasma HIV viremia&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cohort 1: HIV-1-positive men and women &gt;18 years of age with HIV-1-RNA levels&#xD;
                  undetectable by ultrasensitive HIV PCR Abbott assay at screening. Also eligible&#xD;
                  are subjects with HIV-1 RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL; however, the HIV-1 RNA must be &lt; 50&#xD;
                  copies/mL within 60 days prior to study entry based on the Abbott assay. Subjects&#xD;
                  with intermittent isolated episodes of detectable low level viremia (&gt; 50 but&#xD;
                  &lt;1,000 copies RNA/mL; blips) will be eligible. There should be at least 2&#xD;
                  documented HIV-1 RNA assays, one drawn &gt;3 months before study entry, one drawn &lt;3&#xD;
                  months before study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cohort 2: HIV-1-positive men and women &gt;18 years of age with HIV-1-RNA levels&#xD;
                  undetectable by ultrasensitive HIV PCR assay at screening. Note: Due to&#xD;
                  sensitivity issues using the Roche Assay and the fact that we cannot control the&#xD;
                  HIV testing technique prior to enrollment, we decided to consider subjects with&#xD;
                  HIV-1 RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL; however, the HIV-1 RNA must be undetectable within 60&#xD;
                  days prior to study entry based on the ultrasensitive HIV PCR assay. Subjects&#xD;
                  with intermittent isolated episodes of detectable low level viremia (&gt; 50 but&#xD;
                  &lt;1,000 copies RNA/mL; blips) will be eligible. There should be at least 2&#xD;
                  documented HIV-1 RNA assays: one drawn &gt;3 months before study entry, one drawn &lt;3&#xD;
                  months before study entry.&#xD;

             both HCV tests (antibody and RNA) are positive, the subjects will be excluded from&#xD;
             study. If HCV antibody test is positive, but HCV RNA test is negative, subject can&#xD;
             enroll. Results should be obtained no more than 30 days prior to screening.&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Use of aspirin, dipyrdamole, warfarin or any other medication that is likely to affect&#xD;
             platelet function or other aspects of blood coagulation during the 2-week period prior&#xD;
             to leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site&#xD;
             investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization within 30 days&#xD;

             serum chemistry elevations in total or indirect bilirubin in subjects receiving&#xD;
             atazanavir or indinavir is not exclusionary. Asymptomatic baseline serum chemistry&#xD;
             elevations in LFTs, lipase and creatinine due to HAART medication are not&#xD;
             exclusionary, when in the opinion of the investigator, the abnormalities are not&#xD;
             attributable to intrinsic hepatorenal disease. Such elevations must be due to HAART.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Receipt of a vaccination within 30 days prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Have an allergy or hypersensitivity to study product excipients (human serum albumin,&#xD;
             DMSO and Dextran 40).&#xD;
