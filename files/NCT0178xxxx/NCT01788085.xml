      Study Hypothesis: This study is designed as an integral part of the development of new or&#xD;
      improved features or components of the Bravo® pH Monitoring System and may serve verification&#xD;
      and validation purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include symptomatic patients with known or suspected&#xD;
      gastroesophageal reflux disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptomatic patients will undergo invasive procedure, including Bravo capsule delivery,&#xD;
      positioning and attachment. Confirmation of capsule attachment may be done endoscopically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These procedures will serve to evaluate overall system performance in actual clinical setup,&#xD;
      for instance: ergonomics and performance of delivery device, capsule transmission etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physician may be asked to provide feedback on the procedure and/or document their activities&#xD;
      during the procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population consists of symptomatic patients with known or suspected gastro&#xD;
      esophageal reflux disease. The aim of this clinical study is to evaluate Bravo® pH Monitoring&#xD;
      System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate usability and functionality of the Bravo® pH Monitoring System and procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate modifications to the Bravo delivery device Primary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Evaluate physician subjective assessment questionnaire (appendix 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Percentage of successful capsule attachments Patients will undergo standard-of-care&#xD;
                Bravo pH procedure. Prior to the pH study, the patient should not eat or drink for&#xD;
                a minimum of 6 hours, according to the standard system instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bravo procedure may take 48-96 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will have a follow-up visit or call, one to two weeks after the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A fluoroscopy procedure may be ordered at physician's discretion to verify capsule&#xD;
           attachment \ detachment from the patient's esophagus&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over all expected duration for subject's participation in the study will be a maximum of 1&#xD;
      month&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physician may be asked to provide feedback on the procedure usability and functionality and&#xD;
      to document their activities during the procedure.&#xD;
