  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The inhaled route of delivery has always been associated with the considerable challenge of&#xD;
      getting the drug to its target. The lungs are a highly complex organ designed to filter&#xD;
      inspired air, with many different cell types contributing to their function. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      lungs may change dramatically when afflicted by disease resulting in an internal environment&#xD;
      that works against the drug reaching and interacting successfully with the target. For&#xD;
      targets in the upper airways this will have lesser significance, but drug delivery to the&#xD;
      deep lung may be impeded by changes such as mucus hyper-secretion or thickening or airway&#xD;
      narrowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to interpret toxicology findings it is necessary to reconcile test sensitivity,&#xD;
      background biological variation, normal responses to inhaled materials and drug or&#xD;
      medicine-specific adverse effects. Identification of adverse end-points is an area where&#xD;
      better control data sets might help discern true adverse effects from a normal physiological&#xD;
      lung response. The lung responds acutely to inhalation of irritant materials by&#xD;
      hyper-secretion of mucus, chemokine release, inflammatory cell recruitment and cough and&#xD;
      collectively these may be characterized as non-specific irritancy.&#xD;

      Four formulations of antituberculosis drug (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and&#xD;
      levofloxacin) will be administered to each patient by randomization. Each formulation will be&#xD;
      assigned the code, such as A, B, C, or D, and the treatment sequences will be generated as&#xD;
      ABCD (sequence 1), BCDA (sequence 2), CDAB (sequence 3) and DABC (sequence 4). On the first&#xD;
      day of drug dosing in period I, volunteers will be randomly assigned to a sequence of&#xD;
      treatments as indicated in a pre-printed randomization scheme, which was generated using&#xD;
      block randomization with block sizes of 4 and 6, and the allocation ratio of 1:1. Subjects&#xD;
      will be stratified by sex. Subjects in sequence 1 will receive treatment A during the first&#xD;
      study period and will then cross over to receive treatment B, C, and D at the second, third&#xD;
      and fourth periods, respectively (each after a 7-day washout period).&#xD;
