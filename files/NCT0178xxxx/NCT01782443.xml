    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer.&#xD;
      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug, Ziv-aflibercept, is being studied. It also means that&#xD;
      the FDA has not yet approved Ziv-aflibercept for use in patients with your type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every person has molecules in their bloodstream called vascular endothelial growth factors&#xD;
      (VEGFs). These molecules help grow and sustain new blood vessels needed by the human body.&#xD;
      Cancer tumors hijack this mechanism because they need new blod vessels and oxygen to grow.&#xD;
      Ziv-aflibercept is an antibody. Antibodies are proteins that are produced naturally in our&#xD;
      bodies and help to recognize foreign substances in our body. Ziv-aflibercept is a &quot;targeted&#xD;
      therapy&quot; called a &quot;VEGF Trap&quot;, that &quot;traps&quot; (binds) these VEGFs and prevents the cancer from&#xD;
      using them to grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though Ziv-aflibercept has not yet been FDA approved for the treatment of carcinoid tumors,&#xD;
      it has recently been approved for patients with treatment-resistant colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, we will use Ziv-aflibercept in combination with standard octreotide&#xD;
      therapy to see if it slows the growth or spread of your carcinoid tumor. Standard octreotide&#xD;
      (sandostatin) therapy is currently approved for treating symptoms of carcinoid tumors, such&#xD;
      as those caused by carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid syndrome is caused by hormones and other&#xD;
      substances released by carcinoid tumors into the bloodstream. One of these secreted&#xD;
      substances is serotonin, one of the body's natural chemical messengers. When excess serotonin&#xD;
      secreted by the carcinoid tumors reaches the body's tissues, it is thought to cause diarrhea&#xD;
      and redness (flushing) of the face, chest or back. Excess serotonin may also cause changes in&#xD;
      the structure of the heart valves, which can impair the heart's function. Octreotide works by&#xD;
      binding to receptors found on carcinoid tumors and prevents the release of hormones from the&#xD;
      tumor.&#xD;

      If you are willing to participate in this study you will be asked to undergo some screening&#xD;
      tests and procedures to confirm that you are eligible. Many of these tests and procedures are&#xD;
      likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not&#xD;
      take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently,&#xD;
      they may or may not have to be repeated. These tests and procedures include: a medical&#xD;
      history, physical examination, CT or MRI, blood tests, serum chromogranin A, urine tests,&#xD;
      24-hour urine collection, pregnancy test and an electrocardiogram. If these tests show that&#xD;
      you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the study treatment. If&#xD;
      you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to participate in this&#xD;
      research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you meet the requirements for this study and you agree to continue your participation, you&#xD;
      will receive Ziv-aflibercept every two weeks. Each dose of Ziv-aflibercept consists of an&#xD;
      approximately 60 minutes infusion (through a needle into a vein). You will also receive an&#xD;
      injection of Octreotide LAR (long acting release) monthly as part of your treatment for&#xD;
      carcinoid tumor. This injection will be given to you by a nurse in your buttock. You may&#xD;
      already be on Octreotide LAR. In that case, you will continue taking it at the same dose and&#xD;
      schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will need to come to the clinic every two weeks while participating in this study. Each&#xD;
      cycle is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tests and procedures will be performed on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle:&#xD;
      questions about your health, physical exam (Day 1 of each cycle only), vital signs, blood&#xD;
      tests, pregnancy test (Day 1 of each cycle only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine tests will be performed every other cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following tests and procedures will be done at the end of every third cycle: CT scan or&#xD;
      MRI, Serum Chromogranin A, 24-hour urine collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the final dose of the study drug the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
      questions about your general health, physical exam, vital signs, blood tests, pregnancy test,&#xD;
      EKG, Serum Chromogranin A, 24-hour urine collection.&#xD;
