      Fluids are one of most common therapies used in critically ill patients. Fluids are the&#xD;
      cornerstone of hemodynamic management. In overt bleeding, fluids are often given without&#xD;
      guidance with specific haemodynamic monitoring. In other conditions when hypovolemia may be&#xD;
      more subtle or when the response to fluids is more variable, fluids are often given in a more&#xD;
      titrable way, monitoring their haemodynamic impact. This practice, called the fluid challenge&#xD;
      technique has been proposed by Max Harry Weil more than 30 years ago [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fluid challenge has been used in several papers and studies assessing the response of&#xD;
      patients to fluids. The way this practice is performed varies in terms of type of fluid,&#xD;
      volume of fluid, rate of fluid administration, and clinical endpoints used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no data that describe how fluid challenges are administered in ICU's across the&#xD;
      world. Understanding this will provide valuable information regarding current practice and&#xD;
      would be a basis for improving current practice and future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The way fluids are administered vary widely. Indications for fluids and monitoring of the&#xD;
      effects are not standardized and may thus lead to heterogeneity in practice. In addition,&#xD;
      several patients may fail to respond to fluids. The purpose of this observational study is to&#xD;
      evaluate how fluids are administered and to identify the factors associated with a positive&#xD;
      response to fluids. Better characterizing these practices and the patients who benefit from&#xD;
      fluids would set the basis of further interventional trials trying to optimize fluid&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What does this study involve?&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All patients enrolled in the study will receive standard clinical care&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data will be collected in order to study how fluid challenges are performed in ICU's&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid Administration in Critically Ill Patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluids are one of most common therapies used in critically ill patients. Fluids are the&#xD;
      cornerstone of hemodynamic management. In overt bleeding, fluids are often given without&#xD;
      guidance with specific haemodynamic monitoring. In other conditions when hypovolemia may be&#xD;
      more subtle or when the response to fluids is more variable, fluids are often given in a more&#xD;
      titrable way, monitoring their haemodynamic impact. This practice, called the fluid challenge&#xD;
      technique has been proposed by Max Harry Weil more than 30 years ago [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluids have beneficial impact on outcome, especially in the context of hemodynamic&#xD;
      optimization. Haemodynamic optimization has been shown to improve patient outcome when&#xD;
      applied in the perioperative period and in the early phases of septic shock [2,3]. On the&#xD;
      other hand, a positive fluid balance is associated with a poor outcome [4,5], but this may&#xD;
      just reflect patient severity. In patients with respiratory failure, once hemodynamically&#xD;
      stable, fluid restriction is associated with earlier separation from mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      [4]. Altogether, it seems reasonable to give just the amount of fluids needed when the&#xD;
      patients is hemodynamically unstable and to restrict fluids when the patient is stabilized.&#xD;
      Such an approach seems associated with better outcomes [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fluid challenge has been used in several papers and studies assessing the response of&#xD;
      patients to fluids. The way this practice is performed varies in terms of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  type of fluid&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  volume of fluid&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rate of fluid administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical endpoints used&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no data that describe how fluid challenges are administered in ICU's across the&#xD;
      world. Understanding this will provide valuable information regarding current practice and&#xD;
      would be a basis for improving current practice and future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluids in guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current guidelines on fluid administration that cover how to give fluids in all critically&#xD;
      ill patients do not exist. In the surviving sepsis guidelines fluids are recommended in the&#xD;
      very early phase of hemodynamic resuscitation of patients with severe sepsis[7]. At this&#xD;
      stage it is recommended to administer these according to CVP [7]. In france, the use of&#xD;
      functional hemodynamic tests (see below) is recommended in this setting [8]. After the&#xD;
      initial phase, these guidelines are evasive on the way fluids should be guided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the UK there guidelines covering the administration of fluids in the perioperative&#xD;
      setting. In the periopoerative setting in high risk surgical patients, guidelines recommend&#xD;
      the use of fluids for stroke volume optimization {9} Apart from these specific settings,&#xD;
      fluids administration is not covered in current guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prediction of fluid responsiveness using Functional haemodynamic tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart and Lung Interaction in fully mechanically ventilated patients During mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, increases in the intra-thoracic pressures induced by the inspiration, decrease&#xD;
      the venous return to the right ventricle. If the right ventricle is 'volume' responsive, this&#xD;
      results in a reduction in right ventricular stroke volume, which is subsequently translated&#xD;
      through to a decreased left ventricular stroke volume, several beats later. This change in&#xD;
      stroke volume (or stroke volume variation) can be detected by monitors that track real-time&#xD;
      changes in stroke volume as a stroke volume variation.' When the two ventricles are working&#xD;
      on the ascending part of the stroke volume/ventricular preload curve, then mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation will induce changes in stroke volume which will be reflected, depending on the&#xD;
      monitor used, in changes in stroke volume (Stroke Volume Variation, SVV), pulse pressure&#xD;
      (Pulse Pressure Variation PPV), and systolic pressure (Systolic Pressure Variation, SPV).&#xD;
      These are also called dynamic indices of preload because, by detecting these changes, they&#xD;
      provide information on the preload reserve of the ventricles (fluid responsiveness).&#xD;
      Therefore they can predict which patients may benefit from fluid administration prior to give&#xD;
      fluids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This has been widely studied with several monitors and proved to be effective in predicting&#xD;
      fluid responsiveness with high sensitivity and specificity [10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      These techniques do have some limitations. In order to be reliable the patients need to be&#xD;
      fully sedated and mechanically ventilated, with no spontaneous breathing activity and no&#xD;
      arrhythmias. Also, as reported by De Backer et al. these indices lose power to predict fluid&#xD;
      responsiveness in patients ventilated at volumes lower than 8 ml/kg [11].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart and Lung Interaction in spontaneously breathing patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Passive leg raising is a maneuvre that produces an autologous fluid challenge by shifting&#xD;
      venous blood from the legs to the intra-thoracic compartment. The response measured by a flow&#xD;
      monitor is able to predict the response to a fluid challenge [12]. This has been studied with&#xD;
      different monitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the setting of spontaneously breathing patients Monge Garcia et al. have demonstrated that&#xD;
      changes in pressure during a Valsalva manoeuvre predict fluid responsiveness (The Valsalva&#xD;
      maneuvre is a forced expiration against a closed glottis) [13].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of evidence&#xD;
&#xD;
      A summary of the evidence relating to use of fluids in the context of haemodynamic&#xD;
      resuscitation suggests that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. During the perioperative period and in the early phases of septic shock, the&#xD;
           administration of targeted fluids to optimize pre-load provides an improvement in&#xD;
           patient outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There is no evidence that protocols aimed at optimizing cardiac output are beneficial&#xD;
           for the patient if not applied &quot;early&quot; or when oxygen debt has established.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Observational studies have shown that a positive fluid balance is associated with an&#xD;
           increased 60 day mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Despite this, patients who remain unstable after initial fluid resuscitation often&#xD;
           receive fluids in an attempt to reverse their shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Functional Haemodynamic tests have been developed to help the clinician in predicting&#xD;
           the response to fluid administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. How the decisions of giving or not giving these fluids are made in different diseases,&#xD;
           in different ICU's and in different countries is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. How often functional haemodynamic tests are used is not known either.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. How the effects of fluids are monitored is not known either.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study should give answers to points 6, 7 and 8. The way fluids are administered vary&#xD;
      widely. Indications for fluids and monitoring of the effects are not standardized and may&#xD;
      thus lead to heterogeneity in practice. The purpose of this study is to evaluate how fluids&#xD;
      are administered&#xD;
&#xD;
      What does this study involve?&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All patients enrolled in the study will receive standard clinical care&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data will be collected in order to study how fluid challenges are performed in ICU's&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. No extra tests will be performed for this study&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Only measurements and data available as part of clinical practice will be collected&#xD;
