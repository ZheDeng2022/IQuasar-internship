      This is a phase-1, single center, open-label, randomized, single-dose, 2-way crossover study.&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to compare the pharmacokinetic properties after&#xD;
      co-administration of Repaglinide 2mg and Metformin hydrochloride 500mg with administration of&#xD;
      combination preparation of Repaglinide 2mg and Metformin hydrochloride 500mg in 50 healthy&#xD;
      male volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All the subjects should be admitted one day prior to scheduled study date until 4pm to&#xD;
           Chonbuk National University Hospital Clinical Trial Center and they will be served with&#xD;
           the same dinner. After dinner, they should keep fast, they are just allowed to drink&#xD;
           water until 8am of the study date.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  According to the randomly designated order, all subjects will be administrated with&#xD;
                the study or reference products with 240mL of water at 9am(±2hours) on the first&#xD;
                date of the study. The study or the reference products should be swallowed&#xD;
                completely, and not to be chewed before swallowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Study product : Repanorm M 2/500mg (Dalim BioTech Co., Ltd.)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Reference products : Metformin HCl 500mg tablet, Repaglinide 2mg tablet&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Subjects have to fast for 4 hours post administration of the study or&#xD;
                          reference drugs(water intake is not allowed for 1 hour before and after&#xD;
                          the administration), and should follow standardized lunch after four&#xD;
                          hours and dinner 9 hours later from the time of administration&#xD;
&#xD;
                            -  Assessment and laboratory test will be performed in accordance with&#xD;
                               schedule written on the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
                                 -  After having 7 days of withdrawal period, the 2nd study period&#xD;
                                    will be done at 9am(±2hours). In contrast of the 1st period,&#xD;
                                    Sequence B which received the study product in 1st period will&#xD;
                                    take the reference drugs for the 2nd period, while the group&#xD;
                                    Sequence A which received reference drugs will take the study&#xD;
                                    drug. The steps of administration of drugs and process of tests&#xD;
                                    are the same with the 1st period&#xD;
