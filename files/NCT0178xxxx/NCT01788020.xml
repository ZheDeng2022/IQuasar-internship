  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) conventional chemotherapy induces only low CR rates and&#xD;
      responses of short duration compared to other indolent lymphomas. Thus innovative approaches&#xD;
      are needed which combine excellent activity and tolerability in patients with WM, who are&#xD;
      mostly of advanced age. The immunochemotherapy DRC (dexamethasone, rituximab,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide) was shown to be highly effective in patients with WM without inducing major&#xD;
      hematological toxicities. On the other hand the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib showed&#xD;
      substantial activity as a single agent in WM with only very few side effects when given in a&#xD;
      weekly schedule. Based on these observations it is the aim of this study to test whether the&#xD;
      efficacy of the well tolerated DRC regime can be further improved by adding Bortezomib.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM) is defined by a bone marrow infiltration by&#xD;
      lymphoplasmacytic cells and the presence of a monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) M gammopathy in&#xD;
      the peripheral blood. The clinical understanding of the disease has been greatly improved by&#xD;
      the identification of internationally recognized criteria for initiating therapy, the&#xD;
      description of an international prognostic index for patients requiring a first-line therapy&#xD;
      and the definition of response criteria. These criteria are mainly based on the evolution of&#xD;
      serum IgM concentration. However, delayed IgM monoclonal protein responses may cause&#xD;
      important difficulties in response assessment. In addition, discrepancies between the&#xD;
      kinetics of serum M protein reduction and the clearance of monoclonal B-cells from the bone&#xD;
      marrow have been reported. Despite continuing advances in the therapy of WM, the disease&#xD;
      remains incurable with a median survival of 5 to 8 years from the time of diagnosis thereby&#xD;
      necessitating the development and evaluation of novel treatment approaches.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Clinicopathological diagnosis of WM as defined by consensus panel one of the Second&#xD;
        International Workshop on WM. Pathological diagnosis has to occur before study inclusion&#xD;
        and randomization. In addition, pathological specimens have to be sent to the national&#xD;
        pathological reference center at study inclusion and randomization. The positivity for CD20&#xD;
        can be assumed from any previous bone marrow immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry&#xD;
        analysis performed up to 6 months prior to enrollment. Inclusion in the study will be based&#xD;
        on morphological and immunological criteria. Immunophenotyping will be performed in each&#xD;
        center and saved locally. Flow cytometry of bone marrow and blood cells will include at&#xD;
        least one double staining and assess the expression of the following antigens: surface&#xD;
        immunoglobulin, CD19, CD20, CD5, CD10 and CD23. Patients are eligible if tumor cells&#xD;
        express the following antigens: CD19, CD20, and if they are negative for CD5, CD10 and CD23&#xD;
        expression. Patients with tumor cells positive for CD5 and/or CD23 and morphologically&#xD;
