  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as eczema, is the most common inflammatory skin disorder&#xD;
      of children, affecting 10-20% of children and 1-2% of adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This skin disorder can be associated with unbearable itchiness and an increased&#xD;
      susceptibility to skin infections. The cause of AD is currently poorly understood; therefore,&#xD;
      there are no targeted treatment options at present. There have been recent studies in adults&#xD;
      with AD that explain the cause and give us new routes to investigate treatment options,&#xD;
      however no major studies in this arena have been done in children. We hope to evaluate the&#xD;
      skin and blood biomarkers that are found in pediatric AD and compare them to adult AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The immune system worsens the skin barrier issues that are common in atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis. We believe there are similar immune and skin abnormalities in adult versus&#xD;
      pediatric atopic dermatitis. Finally, blood levels of the activated molecules in atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis can serve as surrogates for skin immune activation and will correlate with disease&#xD;
      severity.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To define the cellular and molecular biomarkers of atopic dermatitis in skin biopsies&#xD;
           and blood samples from a pre-adolescent pediatric population and correlate it with&#xD;
           disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To measure the skin barrier in atopic dermatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine quality of life in atopic dermatitis through various questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives for the non-invasive biomarkers sub-study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Develop a panel of non-invasive biomarkers in tape strips and serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Correlate mRNA expression from tape-striped skin with individual markers of severity&#xD;
           (EASI, SCORAD, pruritus and TEWL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Correlate mRNA markers in blood with severity scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Correlate serum protein markers with severity scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Compare biomarkers based on patient age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Correlate the biomarker candidates from tape strips and blood with the &quot;gold standard&quot;&#xD;
           set of biomarkers derived from age-matched skin biopsy samples&#xD;
