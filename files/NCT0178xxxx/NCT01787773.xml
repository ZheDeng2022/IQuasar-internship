    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter single arm, nonrandomized study that will include 150&#xD;
      patients at a maximum of 20 investigational sites. It is estimated that it may take 13 months&#xD;
      to complete enrollment. Follow-up will continue through 24 months post-implant or one month&#xD;
      post-retrieval, whichever occurs first. It is required that filters be retrieved from at&#xD;
      least 50 patients and the filter is permanent in at least 50 patients.&#xD;

      Verify the effectiveness and safety of the Veniti IVC Filter in accordance with the clinical&#xD;
      guidelines published by the Society for Interventional Radiology (SIR) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endpoint is clinical success (versus failure) at 6 months after implant or 1 month post&#xD;
      retrieval, whichever occurs first, based on the definition provided by the SIR guidelines, as&#xD;
      the absence of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Procedure failure (assessed at the end of the implant procedure)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subsequent pulmonary embolus&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. IVC occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Filter embolization&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  â‰¥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Investigator judges caval filtration clinically indicated for prevention of pulmonary&#xD;
             embolism in patient with venous thromboembolic disease or at high risk for venous&#xD;
             thromboembolic disease. Patient must meet at least one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated, has failed, cannot be achieved or&#xD;
             maintained, must be interrupted, resulted in complication, or places the patient at&#xD;
             high risk of complication and the patient has:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pulmonary embolus&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Iliocaval deep vein thrombosis (DVT)&#xD;
&#xD;

             and any retrieval procedures.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has filter in place or underwent filter retrieval in previous 60 days&#xD;
&#xD;
