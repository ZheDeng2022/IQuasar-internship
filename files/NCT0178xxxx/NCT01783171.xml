      This randomized phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of dinaciclib and Akt&#xD;
      inhibitor MK2206 in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed by&#xD;
      surgery. Dinaciclib and Akt inhibitor MK2206 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, and toxicity of the combination of&#xD;
      MK-2206 (Akt inhibitor MK2206) and dinaciclib in patients with advanced pancreatic&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma (Level 2.5, determined August 2015: Dinaciclib 9 mg/m2 intravenously [IV];&#xD;
      MK-2206 135 mg orally [PO]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the preliminary efficacy of the combination of MK-2206 and dinaciclib in metastatic&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer patients as determined by disease control rate in an expansion cohort of&#xD;
      patients at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the combination of MK-2206 and&#xD;
      dinaciclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Analyze pre-treatment tumor specimens for activation of retrovirus-associated&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence (RAS) downstream pathway signaling as potential&#xD;
      predictors of treatment benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Correlate post-treatment pharmacodynamic (PD) changes in phosphorylated extracellular&#xD;
      signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), phosphorylated-v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1&#xD;
      (p-AKT), p-ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6), phosphorylated DNA-directed ribonucleic acid&#xD;
      (RNA) polymerase II subunit RPB1 (pPOLR2), phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRB),&#xD;
      proliferation-related Ki-67 antigen (Ki-67), and cleaved caspase-3 in tumor biopsies and&#xD;
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells with MK-2206 and dinaciclib exposure and treatment&#xD;
      response to demonstrate proof-of-concept and assess for post-treatment predictive biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess the effect of polymorphic variations in candidate genes (cytochrome P450 3A4/5&#xD;
      [CYP3A4/5], ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B [MDR/TAP], member 1 [ABCB1]) and other genetic&#xD;
      alterations that may be discovered during the conduct of the study, on MK-2206 and dinaciclib&#xD;
      disposition, toxicity, and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive dinaciclib IV over 2 hours on day 1 of course 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 PO on day 1 of course 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After day 1, all patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 PO on days 1, 8, and 15 and dinaciclib&#xD;
      IV over 2 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;

    <description>Inhibition of the CDK/Ral pathway with dinaciclib will be assessed by pRb and pPOLR2, while inhibition of the downstream PI3K/pAkt pathway with MK-2206 will be evaluated with pAkt and pS6. A summary score will be obtained for each pathway by summing the HistoScores of the markers in that pathway. The percent inhibition of each pathway will be calculated as the percentage decrease in the summary score, relative to the pre treatment score. The concordance of the inhibition of both pathways, as measured in the serum samples, and as measured in the tissue, will be assessed with Kappa statistic.</description>

    <description>Will summarize and analyze the data via two-by-two tables, separately for each drug.

             P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) or permeability glycoprotein&#xD;

             of the international normalized ratio (INR) (weekly during the first cycle, then at&#xD;
             least each cycle thereafter) is recommended; as part of the enrollment/informed&#xD;
             consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with&#xD;
             other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the&#xD;
             patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with diabetes or in risk for hyperglycemia should not be excluded from trials&#xD;

             lacking substantial evidence for causing QTc prolongation and torsades de pointes will&#xD;
             be allowed, although if an alternative medication can be substituted, that would be&#xD;
             preferable; for this study, a baseline electrocardiogram (EKG) will be performed and&#xD;
             will be repeated during cycle 1 and then every 3 cycles while on treatment&#xD;

             past 6 months), unstable angina, unstable arrhythmia or a need for anti-arrhythmic&#xD;
             therapy (use of medications for rate control for atrial fibrillation is allowed such&#xD;
             as calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers, if stable medication for at least last&#xD;

             torsades de pointes), or evidence of acute ischemia on electrocardiogram (ECG); marked&#xD;
             baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval, e.g., repeated demonstration of a QTc&#xD;
             interval &gt; 450 msec*; long QT syndrome; the required use of concomitant medication&#xD;
             that may cause torsades de pointes or may cause a significant prolongation of the QTc&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Due to difficulties assessing QTc in patients with heart block, they may be&#xD;
                  eligible if deemed safe by a cardiologist&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if&#xD;
             the mother is treated with MK-2206 and/or dinaciclib&#xD;
