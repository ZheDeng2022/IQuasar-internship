  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomised-controlled multi-centre trial based in Hong Kong to&#xD;
      determine whether temporary subdural drain placement after burr hole evacuation of a chronic&#xD;
      subdural haematoma can reduce the risk of recurrence. Consecutive patients, 60 years old or&#xD;
      above, diagnosed to have symptomatic chronic subdural haematoma and indicated for burr hole&#xD;
      operative drainage will be randomly allocated into one of two groups: (1) for intra-operative&#xD;
      subdural drain placement (intervention group) or (2) not for drain placement (control group).&#xD;
      Using web-based software block randomisation with an allocation ratio of 1:1 will be&#xD;
      conducted. Instructions to use or not to use a drain will be contained in a sealed envelopes&#xD;
      labelled with sequential study numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operatively, if the surgeon-in-charge judges that after burr hole evacuation of the&#xD;
      haematoma the patient's condition is unsafe for drain placement, the subject will be excluded&#xD;
      from the study. Otherwise, randomisation will be performed at this juncture by the opening of&#xD;
      the sealed envelop. The procedure involves placing a prefabricated silicon drain into the&#xD;
      subdural space according to a standard protocol and will be removed on the second&#xD;
      post-operative day at the bedside. Subjects in whom the operating surgeon judges that drain&#xD;
      placement is unsafe will be excluded from the study. Drainage is undertaken passively by&#xD;
      hanging the collection bag at the bedside in a dependent position. In addition to general&#xD;
      demographic, clinical and radiological presentation data, potential risk factors for&#xD;
      recurrence will be documented. Serial computed tomography brain scans will be arranged&#xD;
      (before discharge, at four weeks and six months) and the occurence of significant subdural&#xD;
      haematoma recurrence requiring repeat operative drainage at six months will be recorded.&#xD;
      Other outcome measures to be determined at regular time intervals for a total follow-up&#xD;
      period of six months (upon discharge, at four weeks and six months) include: functional&#xD;
      performance in terms of the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale and modified Rankin Scale, added&#xD;
      neurological deficit, death and other surgery-related complications. All outcomes will be&#xD;
      documented by the trial investigators or by the responsible clinician. The data obtained will&#xD;
      be analysed according to the principle of intention to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: compared to burr-hole evacuation of chronic subdural haematoma alone (control),&#xD;
      the additional placement of a subdural drain after evacuation (intervention) will reduce the&#xD;
      risk of recurrence requiring repeat surgery.&#xD;
