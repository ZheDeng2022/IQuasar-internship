  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators evaluate if changing eating habits and introducing a correct lifestyle in&#xD;
      women with BMI &gt;25 Kg/m2 would improve unfavorable maternal-fetal outcomes associated with&#xD;
      excessive weight gain (EWG) during pregnancy. To pursue these goals, eligible women are&#xD;
      randomly assigned to no intervention (Control group) that receive only a simple nutritional&#xD;
      booklet about lifestyle and healthy diet during pregnancy without explicit caloric&#xD;
      restriction or the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes Program (TLC group) that receive a caloric&#xD;
      restriction (1500 Kcal/day divided in3 main meals and 3 snacks + 300 kcal/die for overweight&#xD;
      or 200 kcal/die for obese women submitted to energy expenditure program) associated to a mild&#xD;
      physical activity (30 minutes at least 3 days/week) The investigators use a tool that could&#xD;
      easily and practically evaluate not only total GWG at term, but also changes in maternal body&#xD;
      composition: the bioimpedance analyzer.&#xD;

      Pregnant women, recruited from antenatal clinics, with pre-pregnancy BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2, age &gt;18&#xD;
      years and single pregnancy are enrolled within 12th week at the Obstetric Unit of Policlinico&#xD;
      Hospital of Modena.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are as follows: twin pregnancies, chronic diseases (i.e., diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, chronic hypertension, untreated thyroid diseases), gestational diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (GDM) in previous pregnancies, smoking during pregnancy, dietary supplements or herbal&#xD;
      products known to affect body weight, other medical conditions that might affect body weight,&#xD;
      and plans to deliver outside of the Birth Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, an accurate obstetric history, family history, and personal history is&#xD;
      collected for the assessment of exclusion criteria. The blood pressure, height and weight are&#xD;
      measured, and the BMI is calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible women are randomly assigned to no intervention (Control group) or the Therapeutic&#xD;
      Lifestyle Changes Program (TLC group). Randomization is performed using sealed&#xD;
      envelopes(using a computer-generated random allocation). Study randomization is numbered and&#xD;
      sealed in white envelops. Randomization occurs in consecutive order at time of the first&#xD;
      visit. Due to study design, both gynecologist and dietitian know the allocation of the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every subject receives care in another institution (Antenatal Clinics of Modena Health&#xD;
      program). Hence, women in both groups receive the same antenatal evaluation including two&#xD;
      ultrasound examinations and at least 4 obstetric evaluations until term. However, referral&#xD;
      gynecologists possibly know the allocated arm of their women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized subjects receive a 75-g 2-h Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) at 16-18 and/or&#xD;
      24-28 weeks. The diagnosis of GDM is made for any glucose value exceeding the normal cut-off,&#xD;
      as reported by the HAPO study. If OGTT is pathological, women are referred to other health&#xD;
      care specialists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women randomized to both group are scheduled to have a specific follow-up for adherence to&#xD;
      the program at 16, 20, 28, 36 weeks and 3 months after delivery also evaluating the fat mass,&#xD;
      fat-free mass and total body water through the use of the bioimpedance analyzer. At baseline&#xD;
      and 36 weeks each subject have to complete a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) to identify&#xD;
      any change in eating habits. The FFQ includes questions about specific food items, such as&#xD;
      the frequency of sauce consumption, the fat content of several food items, and seasonal&#xD;
      consumption of fruit and vegetables. While the Control group receives only a simple&#xD;
      nutritional booklet about a lifestyle (in accordance with Italian Guidelines for a healthy&#xD;
      diet during pregnancy), the TLC Program includes a specific caloric restriction associated to&#xD;
      a mild physical activity program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TLC diet comprises 1500 kcal/day and consists of 3 main meals and 3 snacks (breakfast,&#xD;
      snack, lunch, snack, dinner, and evening snack) that corresponds to the baseline metabolism&#xD;
      of a pregnant woman. The dietitian adds an amount of 200 kcal/day for obese or 300 kcal/day&#xD;
      for overweight pregnant women submitted to physical activity program.The TLC diet has a&#xD;
      target macronutrient composition of 55% carbohydrate, 20% protein, and 25% fat with&#xD;
      moderately low saturated fat levels. The exercise intervention is focused on increasing&#xD;
      walking and developing a more active lifestyle (i.e., walking rather than driving for short&#xD;
      distances). The recommended exercise prescription for pregnant women is generally consistent&#xD;
      with recommendations for the general adult population. However, it is important to monitor&#xD;
      and adjust exercise prescriptions according to the woman's symptoms, discomforts, and&#xD;
      abilities during pregnancy and be aware of contraindications for exercising during pregnancy.&#xD;
      All participants are advised to participate in 30 min of moderate intensity activity at least&#xD;
      3 days a week. Subjects wear a pedometer (Omron Walking Style III HJ-203-EK) on a belt at the&#xD;
      back of their waist during walking session for the assessment of the adherence to the&#xD;
      physical activity program.&#xD;
