  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weight loss commonly occurs in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), negatively influencing their quality of life,&#xD;
      treatment response and survival. Loss of muscle protein is generally a central component of&#xD;
      weight loss in CHF and COPD patients but patients also have reductions in fat mass and bone&#xD;
      density, independent of the severity of the disease state. The purpose of this&#xD;
      cross-sectional study is to provide detailed insight in disease related gut function by&#xD;
      obtaining information on gut permeability, digestion and absorption of glucose, fat and&#xD;
      protein in CHF and COPD patients compared to matched healthy controls. This will provide&#xD;
      required information that is necessary to implement new strategies to develop optimal&#xD;
      nutritional regimen in CHF and COPD. The hypothesis is that CHF and COPD are related to&#xD;
      decreased gut function and absorption, leading to decreased anabolic response. Second, this&#xD;
      decreased nutritional status is linked to reduced muscle functioning and possibly decreased&#xD;
      cognition. In addition, we will examine the effect of aging on by comparing gut function&#xD;
      digestion and absorption of the CHF and COPD aged matched healthy controls to a group of&#xD;
      young healthy subjects.&#xD;

      This study involves one test day of approximately 7-8 hours. On this test day subjects will&#xD;
      ingest a sugar drink to assess gut permeability and gut function, and a protein meal to&#xD;
      measure digestion/absorption and the anabolic response to food intake. Subjects will also&#xD;
      receive a mixture of amino acids that are made a little heavier than normal, called stable&#xD;
      isotopes. This stable isotopes is used to investigate protein behavior in the body (protein&#xD;
      kinetics). Blood (100-120 ml in total) and urine samples will be collected over 7 hours.&#xD;
