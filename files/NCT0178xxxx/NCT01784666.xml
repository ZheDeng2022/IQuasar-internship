    <textblock>
      This study investigates the medication isradipine, which is currently approved by the FDA to&#xD;
      treat high blood pressure, in the treatment of depression in bipolar disorder. Isradipine or&#xD;
      placebo (contains no active medication) will be used as an &quot;add-on&quot; to lithium, valproate,&#xD;
      and/or atypical antipsychotics for individuals currently experiencing a major depressive&#xD;
      episode. Our hypothesis is that isradipine will be superior to placebo in improving&#xD;
      depressive symptoms.&#xD;

      Primary Aim: To estimate the antidepressant efficacy of isradipine versus placebo as an&#xD;
      adjunct to lithium, valproate, and/or other atypical antipsychotics among individuals with&#xD;
      bipolar I disorder in a nonpsychotic major depressive episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Isradipine will be superior to placebo in improvement of depressive symptoms&#xD;
      assessed by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).&#xD;

    <description>The study uses the Sequential Parallel Comparison design (SPCD), with two 4-week phases: n=30 subjects are randomized 1:1 to isradipine versus placebo add-on for 4 weeks, with the placebo nonresponders re-randomized 1:1 for a further 4 weeks. The SPCD will allow us to pool data from both phases to estimate the isradipine treatment effect. Subjects who respond in phase 1, and all subjects who receive isradipine in phase 1, continue blinded treatment in phase 2 to preserve the blind, but only phase 1 results are analyzed.</description>

             disorder, current episode depressed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS) score of at least 20 (i.e., moderate&#xD;
             depression) and no greater than 34 (i.e., severe depression) at screen and baseline&#xD;

             branch block&#xD;

        drug known to interact with isradipine. Benzodiazepines or other sedative-hypnotic agents&#xD;
        (e.g., zolpidem) may not be initiated after study entry; subjects requiring these agents&#xD;
        will be removed from the study. Allowed: Sedative-hypnotic agents if dosage has been stable&#xD;
        for 4 weeks prior to study entry; thyroid or estrogen replacement provided dosage has been&#xD;
        stable for 3 months. Acceptable anticonvulsants include lamotrigine, valproate, gabapentin,&#xD;

Isradipine: The study uses the Sequential Parallel Comparison design (SPCD), with two 4-week phases: n=30 subjects are randomized 1:1 to isradipine versus placebo add-on for 4 weeks, with the placebo nonresponders re-randomized 1:1 for a further 4 weeks. The SPCD will allow us to pool data from both phases to estimate the isradipine treatment effect. Subjects who respond in phase 1, and all subjects who receive isradipine in phase 1, continue blinded treatment in phase 2 to preserve the blind, but only phase 1 results are analyzed.</description>
