  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will look at conducting a medium-intense walking program called Walk With Ease with&#xD;
      cancer patients age 60 and above who are starting chemotherapy treatment. We will measure how&#xD;
      many of these patients complete their participation in this program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a&#xD;
      moderate-intensity walking program (Walk With Ease/WWE) among cancer patients, age ≥60 years,&#xD;
      as they undergo cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment. Feasibility will be determined based on the&#xD;
      rate of participation in the WWE program. As secondary objectives, we will also establish the&#xD;
      rate of completion of a number of instruments, including a Geriatric Assessment tool, and&#xD;
      other instruments that measure self-reported quality of life (e.g., fatigue, depression, and&#xD;
      pain), and self-reported physical activity (PA). Data from these instruments, as well as from&#xD;
      serial measurements of a biomarker of aging (p16INK4a) will be explored and used to inform&#xD;
      future studies designed to evaluate any relationship between these variables and&#xD;
      participation in the WWE program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a sample (n=30) of cancer patients ≥60 years of age with potentially curable&#xD;
      cancer and a diagnosis of Stage I-III breast cancer, Stage I-III lung cancer, or Stage II-III&#xD;
      colon cancer, who are about to begin chemotherapy. Participation will be defined as&#xD;
      completing the 6-week WWE program. Results from this study will be used in an RO1 application&#xD;
      to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) pertaining to PA interventions among cancer patients&#xD;
      and the effects of biomarkers on prognosis and survival.&#xD;

    <description>The primary activity required of study subjects is a 6-week self-directed (non-group) WWE walking program that study participants do at a place and time that is convenient for them. To start the intervention/program, we schedule a brief baseline meeting with study participants to discuss the program, provide the WWE workbook, secure printed informed consent, and complete various questionnaires. Study participants are also asked to maintain a daily walking diary that is provided to them.&#xD;
The WWE program includes a workbook with strengthening and stretching exercises, basic facts about arthritis and PA, and information on how to individualize the program.</description>
