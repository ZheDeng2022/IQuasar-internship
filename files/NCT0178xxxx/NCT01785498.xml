  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy Lifestyles for Children with Complex Heart Problems is a planning and resource&#xD;
      development project. The goal of the project is to develop an implementation plan that would&#xD;
      enable children with complex heart problems to lead healthy, active lives within their own&#xD;
      community. The primary goal of the project is to promote physical activity, because the&#xD;
      physical and mental health benefits of activity are very important for these children.&#xD;
      Children with complex heart problems have a higher risk for obesity, diabetes, acquired heart&#xD;
      disease and mental health problems than their healthy peers. The physical health benefits of&#xD;
      physical activity are well known, but physical activity is also key for children's mental&#xD;
      health. Physical activity enables children to socialize with peers and create bonds and&#xD;
      friendships. Physical activity participation also directly elevates mood through the release&#xD;
      of brain chemicals. Children with complex heart problems are also known to experience fear&#xD;
      and anxiety related to physical activity. This project will also develop strategies to&#xD;
      promote healthy eating and the prevention of physical activity-related injuries to these&#xD;
      children and their families. Children with complex heart problems are at higher risk of&#xD;
      overweight and obesity and face unique injury risks related to pacemakers or their&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extensive consultations with families and caregivers have identified needed supports for&#xD;
      physical activity lifestyles, mental health, healthy eating and injury prevention for these&#xD;
      children. The goal of the interviews was to understand the positive and negative influences&#xD;
      on physical activity and healthy lifestyles for these children. Analyses of the interview&#xD;
      content was used to develop a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan to provide the&#xD;
      supports necessary for children with complex heart problems to lead active, healthy lives in&#xD;
      their own community, with their family and friends. The implementation plan specifies changes&#xD;
      to family education and counselling resources, clinical care routines, and communication&#xD;
      among professionals and families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trial will evaluate the impact of implementing the family supports and changes&#xD;
      to practice previously developed. Surveys will be completed by families attending the cardiac&#xD;
      clinic before and after the changes to practice and additional resources are made available.&#xD;
      Interviews will be utilized to gather additional feedback from professionals and families&#xD;
      that receive counselling utilizing the supplementary materials.&#xD;
