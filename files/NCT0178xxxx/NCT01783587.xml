  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial. Phase I clinical trials test the safety of&#xD;
      an investigational drug. Phase I studies also try to define the appropriate dose of the&#xD;
      investigational drug to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is&#xD;
      still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it-such as&#xD;
      the safest dose to use and the side effects it may cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afatinib has been studied in other clinical trials of participants with head and neck cancer,&#xD;
      lung cancer, and breast cancer. This dose of Afatinib has also been studied in other research&#xD;
      studies. This is the first clinical trial to study Afatinib in combination with Radiation&#xD;
      Therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safest dose of Afatinib when given in&#xD;
      combination with Radiation Therapy or in combination with Radiation Therapy and chemotherapy&#xD;
      for head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afatinib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing abnormally. This drug works by&#xD;
      blocking multiple proteins known to play a role in the growth of cancer cells. Information&#xD;
      from laboratory research studies suggests that this drug may help to make head and neck&#xD;
      cancer cells more sensitive to Radiation Therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other therapy in this research study is Radiation Therapy or Radiation Therapy plus a&#xD;
      chemotherapy drug called Docetaxel. After surgery, Radiation Therapy and chemotherapy is the&#xD;
      standard treatment if you have high risk disease. &quot;High risk disease&quot; means that without&#xD;
      additional therapy, there is a high risk that the disease may return. In this study,&#xD;
      participants with high-risk disease will receive Radiation Therapy and Docetaxel and&#xD;
      Afatinib. &quot;Intermediate risk&quot; means that there is an intermediate risk that the disease may&#xD;
      return. Radiation Therapy alone is the standard treatment approach for intermediate risk&#xD;
      cancer. In this study, participants with intermediate risk disease will receive Radiation&#xD;
      Therapy and Afatinib.&#xD;

      If you are willing to take part in this study you will be asked to undergo some screening&#xD;
      tests and procedures to confirm your eligibility. Many of these tests and procedures are&#xD;
      likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if you do not take part in the&#xD;
      research study. If you already had some of these tests and procedures recently, they may or&#xD;
      may not have to be repeated. The tests and procedures include: a review of your medical&#xD;
      history, physical exam, blood samples, urine sample, serum pregnancy test, electrocardiogram,&#xD;
      echocardiogram and an assessment of your disease to find out the extent of your cancer. If&#xD;
      these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you may begin&#xD;
      the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to&#xD;
      participate in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will collect an archive tumor specimen (leftover tissue from your prior surgery or&#xD;
      biopsies) to confirm your cancer diagnosis. Additional tests on the tumor specimen may be&#xD;
      performed as a part of future studies to gain new knowledge about head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive Afatinib as a pill that you take by mouth for 7 weeks. During the first&#xD;
      week, you will receive Afatinib alone. During the second through seventh weeks, you will&#xD;
      receive Afatinib together with Radiation Therapy OR with Docetaxel and Radiation Therapy.&#xD;
      Docetaxel is given intravenously, once a week during Week 2 through Week 7. Not everyone who&#xD;
      participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose&#xD;
      you get will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study before&#xD;
      you and how well they tolerated their doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afatinib needs to be taken on an empty stomach. Specific instructions about this will be&#xD;
      included in the drug diary you will need to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you take part in this research study, you will receive the same radiation that you would&#xD;
      receive if you were not on the study. The radiation is typically done daily Monday through&#xD;
      Friday for about 6-7 weeks. You will sign a separate consent form with your radiation&#xD;
      oncologist that will outline what to expect with this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given a physical exam every week during your treatment. You will have a physical&#xD;
      exam and be asked questions about your general health and specific questions about any&#xD;
      problems that you might be having and any medications you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have blood tests every week during your treatment including chemistry and hematology&#xD;
      tests and a pregnancy test if you are a woman capable of becoming pregnant before you receive&#xD;
      your first infusion of docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also be asked to return to the clinic one week, four weeks and eight weeks after&#xD;
      finishing your treatment. Most of these visits are part of routine visits after finishing&#xD;
      treatment. If you stop the study early for any reason, you will also have a clinic visit. In&#xD;
      either instance, the following exams and procedures will be performed: physical exam, blood&#xD;
      tests, other tests including an electrocardiogram, MUGA scan or echocardiogram, CT scan and a&#xD;
      PET/CT scan.&#xD;

    <description>All participants who receive any amount of study drug will be evaluable for toxicity. The primary outcome measure is the incidence of a physician-assessed dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) at a given dose-level of afatinib. Participants will be assessed for a DLT at least once per week during the course of therapy, including the one-week afatinib lead-in period and the 6-7 weeks of radiation therapy. DLT's are defined as the incidence of a severe or life-threatening toxicity (grade 3-4) as defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Versions 4 (CTCAEv.4) or any afatinib-related toxicity requiring a dose reduction occurring during treatment with afatinib and radiation therapy +/- docetaxel. Participants will continue to be assessed for adverse events for 12 weeks after the completion of therapy.</description>
