  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and effects on the immune system of&#xD;
      treatment with GSK2245035 in subjects who suffer from nasal symptoms caused by an allergy to&#xD;
      pollen or perennial allergen, with or without mild asthma. In addition, the effect of&#xD;
      treatment with GSK2245035 on the body's allergic response in test situations will be&#xD;
      explored. Approximately 28 subjects will receive GSK2245035 (up to 14 subjects each receiving&#xD;
      80 nanograms [ng] GSK2245035 and up to 14 subjects each receiving 20 ng GSK2245035) and 14&#xD;
      subjects will receive the dummy drug (placebo) during the study. Assignment of a subject to&#xD;
      GSK2245035 or placebo will be done by chance, like flipping a coin. Neither the subjects nor&#xD;
      the clinic staff will know whether a subject is being dosed with GSK2245035 or placebo during&#xD;
      the course of the study. The study will include (a) Screening phase where the eligibility of&#xD;
      subjects for enrolment will be assessed (b) Treatment phase during which subjects will&#xD;
      receive either 8 nasal sprays of GSK2245035 80 ng or a matching placebo once weekly for 8&#xD;
      weeks (each dose will be split between the two nostrils). Subjects participating in this&#xD;
      study in 2014 will receive a reduced dose of 20 ng i.n. of GSK2245035 once weekly for eight&#xD;
      administrations (c) Follow-up period where any GSK2245035 induced changes to the immune&#xD;
      system and the effect of treatment on the body's allergic response in test situations will be&#xD;
      monitored. The maximum planned study duration for all subjects, including the screening,&#xD;
      treatment and follow-up periods, is approximately 180 days.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Good general health, as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based&#xD;
             on a medical evaluation, including medical history, physical examination, laboratory&#xD;
             tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory&#xD;
             parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be&#xD;
             included only if the investigator agrees that the finding is unlikely to introduce&#xD;
             additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight &gt;=45 kilograms (kg)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of symptomatic pollen- or perennial allergen- driven allergic rhinitis with or&#xD;
             without mild asthma (with a clear link between exposure to allergen and development of&#xD;
             symptoms) for more than 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive skin allergy test (wheal &gt;=3 mm[millimeters]) or serum allergen-specific&#xD;
             Immunoglobulin E (IgE) (&gt;=class 2) for perennial allergens and/or pollen allergens,&#xD;
             relevant to the area of the research unit, within a year from the study start&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive screening nasal allergen challenge, defined by a Total nasal symptoms score&#xD;
             (TNSS) response of &gt;=5 (on a 12 point scale) and a decrease in Peak Nasal Inspiratory&#xD;
             Flow (PNIF) of &gt;30%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and non-pregnant or non-lactating females between 18 and 65 years of age&#xD;
             inclusive at the time of signing the consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential,&#xD;
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy, or&#xD;
             postmenopausal, defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases&#xD;
             a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;40 million&#xD;
             international units (MIU)/mL and estradiol &lt;40 picogram (pg)/mL (&lt;147 picomoles&#xD;
             (pmol)/liter (L) is confirmatory). Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and&#xD;
             whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception&#xD;
             methods with a failure rate of &lt;1% if they wish to continue their HRT during the&#xD;
             study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal&#xD;
             status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks should&#xD;
             elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on&#xD;
             the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status,&#xD;
             they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of child-bearing potential and&#xD;
             has a negative early pregnancy test at screening, confirmed menses and/or a negative&#xD;
             early pregnancy test within 10 days prior to the first dosing visit, a negative early&#xD;
             pregnancy test before each dosing and agrees: to use one of the required contraception&#xD;
             methods with a failure rate of &lt;1% starting at least 2 weeks prior to the start of&#xD;
             dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. The subject must&#xD;
             agree to use contraception until four days after the last dosing; or has only same-sex&#xD;
             partners, when this is her preferred and usual lifestyle&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of&#xD;
             the contraception methods: Condom plus partner use of a required highly effective&#xD;
             contraceptive (with a failure rate of &lt;1%); or Abstinence, defined as sexual&#xD;
             inactivity consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic&#xD;
             abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and&#xD;
             withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. This criterion must be&#xD;
             followed from the time of the first dose of study medication until four days after the&#xD;
             last dosing&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Nasal conditions that according to the opinion of the investigator may affect the&#xD;
             outcome of the study, i.e. nasal septal perforation, nasal polyps, other nasal&#xD;

             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days prior to first dosing and&#xD;

             positive drug screen that according to the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical&#xD;
             Monitor will not pose any safety risks to the subject and will not compromise the&#xD;
             study (b) Subjects with a positive marijuana (THC) screen may be entered into the&#xD;
             study at the investigator's discretion but all pre-dose drug screens must be negative&#xD;
             (c) Subjects with a positive alcohol screen may have this test repeated at a&#xD;
