  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The AtheroRemo-IVUS study aims to investigate the relation of coronary plaque phenotype and&#xD;
      vulnerability as determined by intravascular ultrasound and near infrared spectroscopy with&#xD;
      genetic profile and novel circulating biomarkers. AtheroRemo-IVUS is a prospective,&#xD;
      observational, cohort study of patients who underwent coronary catheterization for acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome or stable angina pectoris. Prior to the catheterization procedure, blood&#xD;
      samples were drawn for biomarker measurements and genetic analyses. Subsequent to the&#xD;
      catheterization procedure, intravascular ultrasound is performed in a non-culprit coronary&#xD;
      artery. In patients who are also participating in the AtheroRemo-NIRS substudy, near-infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy is additionally performed in the same non-culprit vessel. Primary endpoint is&#xD;
      the presence of vulnerable plaque as determined by intravascular ultrasound. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoint is long-term incidence of major adverse cardiac events. Results from AtheroRemo-IVUS&#xD;
      are expected to improve our knowledge on the role of genetic profile and inflammation in the&#xD;
      development of atherosclerosis and vulnerable plaques. Furthermore, novel biomarkers and&#xD;
      intracoronary imaging techniques will be validated in this study.&#xD;
