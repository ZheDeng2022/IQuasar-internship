      The weight of malaria falls most heavily on young children and pregnant women but studies of&#xD;
      the safety of antimalarials in pregnancy and lactation are few. The only recommended&#xD;
      medication used for radical treatment of P.vivax is primaquine. The 2010 WHO malaria&#xD;
      guidelines recommend its use in all patients with P.vivax infection in areas of low&#xD;
      transmission, in the absence of contraindications. Primaquine is contraindicated in&#xD;
      pregnancy. The postpartum period presents a key opportunity to definitively treat women who&#xD;
      suffer multiple malaria relapses during pregnancy. The 2010 WHO malaria treatment guidelines&#xD;
      allow for primaquine use during lactation but there are no studies to date quantifying&#xD;
      primaquine excretion in breast milk and the dose that breastfed infants would be exposed to&#xD;
      is unknown. The investigators propose to study the pharmacokinetics of primaquine in maternal&#xD;
      and infant plasma and in breast milk during a 14 day radical treatment of P.vivax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some inferences about the expected behavior of primaquine in lactation can be drawn from its&#xD;
      known pharmacologic properties. Primaquine pharmacokinetics have been well characterized in&#xD;
      healthy subjects and malaria patients after single and multiple oral dosing. Peak&#xD;
      concentrations are reached within 2-3 hours after dosing and the plasma elimination half-life&#xD;
      is ~7 hours. It is extensively distributed in the tissue and largely metabolized to inert&#xD;
      carboxyprimaquine, the major plasma metabolite, which undergoes further biotransformation to&#xD;
      unknown metabolites that are probably more toxic than the parent compound. The identification&#xD;
      of other metabolites in humans has been difficult to pursue because the expected aminophenol&#xD;
      metabolites are unstable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No pharmacokinetic studies have been done to measure primaquine excretion in breast milk. A&#xD;
      few studies have been done of other antimalarials during lactation and have shown low levels&#xD;
      of drug in breast milk during treatment.&#xD;

      Background The weight of malaria falls most heavily on young children and pregnant women but&#xD;
      studies of the safety of antimalarials in pregnancy and lactation are few. The only&#xD;
      recommended medication used for radical treatment of P.vivax is primaquine. The 2010 WHO&#xD;
      malaria guidelines recommend its use in all patients with P.vivax infection in areas of low&#xD;
      transmission, in the absence of contraindications. Primaquine is contraindicated in&#xD;
      pregnancy. The postpartum period presents a key opportunity to definitively treat women who&#xD;
      suffer multiple malaria relapses during pregnancy. The 2010 WHO malaria treatment guidelines&#xD;
      allow for primaquine use during lactation but there are no studies to date quantifying&#xD;
      primaquine excretion in breast milk and the dose that breastfed infants would be exposed to&#xD;
      is unknown. The investigators propose to study the pharmacokinetics of primaquine in maternal&#xD;
      and infant plasma and in breast milk during a 14 day radical treatment of P.vivax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      The global burden of malaria is great, with approximately 1-2 million deaths each year and&#xD;
      many times that number of productive days lost to illness. Plasmodium vivax is the most&#xD;
      prevalent malarial species, resulting in 132-391 million clinical infections each year and&#xD;
      80-90% of malaria in Asia, the Middle East, and the Western Pacific. Despite its prevalence,&#xD;
      P.vivax has not been a focus of research until recently, and its effects and optimal&#xD;
      treatments are still not fully understood. Though infrequently a fatal infection, P.vivax&#xD;
      causes high levels of morbidity due to the chronic nature of the infection. Because of&#xD;
      dormant liver stages (hypnozoites), illness can continue to recur for years, even after&#xD;
      effective treatment has eliminated the parasites from the blood. In settings where there are&#xD;
      hopes for malarial eradication, this means infected persons continue to be hosts even if&#xD;
      vector-borne transmission is temporarily interrupted, and could potentially start a new cycle&#xD;
      of transmission with each relapse. Each of these relapses causes a significant amount of&#xD;
      morbidity and a small mortality risk for those infected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These burdens are magnified during pregnancy when women experience relative immune&#xD;
      suppression and can experience relapses every 4-8 weeks. P.vivax malaria in pregnancy is&#xD;
      associated with low birth weight and anaemia; thrombocytopaenia; increased risk of fetal&#xD;
      loss, premature delivery, neonatal and infant mortality; and, in some areas, risk for&#xD;
      congenital malaria (a severe, sepsis-like illness). In Southeast Asia, where the&#xD;
      investigators propose to conduct our study, the majority of cases of congenital malaria are&#xD;
      from vivax infection. These women may have some respite during the postpartum period, with&#xD;
      relapses spaced further apart, but frequently relapse again in subsequent pregnancies. New&#xD;
      pregnancies during the end of lactation are common in many malaria endemic areas, including&#xD;
      our setting, making definitive treatment of vivax infections in these women very challenging&#xD;
      in the absence of data about the safety of primaquine for the breastfeeding infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though the anti-malarial pharmacopeia has expanded over the past decade, primaquine remains&#xD;
      the only definitive treatment for the hypnozoite forms of Plasmodium vivax and ovale. First&#xD;
      synthesized in 1946, a 14 day treatment eradicates the parasites from the liver. However,&#xD;
      this medication has been associated with a risk for methemoglobinemia, and acute&#xD;
      intravascular haemolysis in glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient hosts (common&#xD;
      in malaria-endemic areas). The elevations in methemoglobin are generally modest and&#xD;
      asymptomatic, but occasionally significant methemoglobinemia can cause cyanosis and shortness&#xD;
      of breath requiring discontinuation of the medication. Primaquine is not considered safe in&#xD;
      pregnancy because of the possible risk of haemolysis and methaemoglobin in the fetus. The&#xD;
      most recent WHO malaria guidelines (2010) have conflicting information about the its use&#xD;
      during lactation. They cite breastfeeding as a contraindication for primaquine administration&#xD;
      for P. falciparum malaria, but permit the use of primaquine for P. vivax during lactation if&#xD;
      the breast fed infant is not G6PD deficient. No studies have ever been done in lactating&#xD;
      women to determine the safety of primaquine in breastfeeding or the optimal time of&#xD;
      administration, however, the relaxation of guidelines in infancy suggest potential for its&#xD;
      safe use in lactation. Some authors note that primaquine's once daily dosing might allow for&#xD;
      safe breastfeeding if the mother pumps the milk at the time when peak milk concentrations are&#xD;
      expected and discards that milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some inferences about the expected behavior of primaquine in lactation can be drawn from its&#xD;
      known pharmacologic properties. Primaquine pharmacokinetics have been well characterized in&#xD;
      healthy subjects and malaria patients after single and multiple oral dosing. Peak&#xD;
      concentrations are reached within 2-3 hours after dosing and the plasma elimination half-life&#xD;
      is ~7 hours. It is extensively distributed in the tissue and largely metabolized to inert&#xD;
      carboxyprimaquine, the major plasma metabolite, which undergoes further biotransformation to&#xD;
      unknown metabolites that are probably more toxic than the parent compound. The identification&#xD;
      of other metabolites in humans has been difficult to pursue because the expected aminophenol&#xD;
      metabolites are unstable. Until recently, techniques to separate positive and negative&#xD;
      enantiomers for primaquine and carboxyprimaquine have not been possible, again obscuring the&#xD;
      toxic and therapeutic mechanisms of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primaquine has limited oral bioavailability and adult plasma concentrations are generally&#xD;
      low, making dangerously high concentrations in maternal milk unlikely from a theoretical&#xD;
      standpoint. However, recent data suggests that a previously unrecognized sex difference&#xD;
      exists in the pharmacokinetics of the medication in men and women, with women accumulating&#xD;
      higher drug concentrations than men. Since side effects of primaquine appear to be&#xD;
      dose-related, this finding could be significant. The time to maximum concentration is about&#xD;
      2-3 hrs (longer for women than for men) and the investigators would expect to see a short lag&#xD;
      in reaching peak breast milk concentrations. Primaquine has a low molecular weight (259) and&#xD;
      slightly basic pH making it more likely to transfer into the breast milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature on medication pharmacokinetics in breast milk is sparse but has begun to capture&#xD;
      the interest of researchers and human rights activists who note that women are often&#xD;
      systematically excluded from medical research by virtue of pregnant or lactating status. As a&#xD;
      result, during these two states the pharmacokinetic properties of drugs remain poorly&#xD;
      understood, and much of our clinical therapeutic approaches are based on consensus and&#xD;
      conjecture. No pharmacokinetic studies have been done to measure primaquine excretion in&#xD;
      breast milk. A few studies have been done of other antimalarials during lactation and have&#xD;
      shown low levels of drug in breast milk during treatment. The frequent venous sampling&#xD;
      necessary for pharmacokinetic research is not ideal for participants, especially in pediatric&#xD;
      populations. Recent efforts have been made to evaluate the usefulness of capillary or saliva&#xD;
      samples as alternative sampling measures.&#xD;
