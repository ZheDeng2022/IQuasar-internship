      The objective of this study is to explore the effects of weight loss on body composition,&#xD;
      metabolic status, reproductive hormones, and ovarian follicle development in obese women with&#xD;
      regular menstrual cycles versus obese women with irregular menstrual cycles and/or polycystic&#xD;
      ovary syndrome (PCOS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine condition that impacts one in ten&#xD;
      women of reproductive age worldwide. It is characterized by a collection of signs and&#xD;
      symptoms, including: (1) oligo- or anovulation, (2) hyperandrogenism, and (3) polycystic&#xD;
      ovarian morphology. Because obesity worsens the reproductive and metabolic features of the&#xD;
      condition, lifestyle intervention aimed at weight loss is recommended as the first-line&#xD;
      therapy in overweight / obese patients. Many studies have shown that modest weight loss&#xD;
      (5-10%) can improve symptomology in women with PCOS. Yet, the mechanism whereby weight loss&#xD;
      might stimulate ovulation or restore menstrual cyclicity remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the goal of this study is to explore the effects of weight loss on body composition,&#xD;
      metabolic status, reproductive hormones, and ovarian follicle development in obese women with&#xD;
      regular menstrual cycles versus obese women with irregular menstrual cycles and/or PCOS. The&#xD;
      researchers believe that a hypocaloric and low-glycemic index eating pattern, based on the&#xD;
      nutrition recommendations of the USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans and American Diabetes&#xD;
      Association, will reduce endocrine and metabolic disturbances and consequently improve&#xD;
      ovulatory and menstrual cyclicity in PCOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To accomplish this objective, the researchers plan to recruit up to 50 obese (i.e. body mass&#xD;
      index &gt;30 kg/m*m) women with regular menstrual cycles and up to 50 obese women with irregular&#xD;
      menstrual cycles and/or PCOS. Exclusion criteria will include ages &lt;18 or &gt;35 y and the use&#xD;
      of hormonal contraception, fertility therapy, or insulin-sensitizing medication in the three&#xD;
      months prior to enrollment. This study entails one month of data collection during a baseline&#xD;
      interval (Month 1) and six months of data collection during a commercial weight loss program&#xD;
      (Nutrisystem® D; Month 2 thru Month 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be evaluated every other day (in Months 1 and 7) or twice per week (in&#xD;
      Months 2 thru 6) by transvaginal ultrasonography and venipuncture. Ultrasound images of the&#xD;
      ovaries will be assessed for the total number and diameter of individual follicles. Serum&#xD;
      samples will be assessed for follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol,&#xD;
      and progesterone. Participants will also be evaluated at up to four time points using&#xD;
      multiple metabolic and behavioral tests. Time points of interest will include: (1) Month 1&#xD;
      (i.e. pre-intervention), (2) after 5% weight loss, (3) after 10% weight loss, and (4) Month 7&#xD;
      (i.e. post-intervention). Assessments and endpoints of interest will include: (1) fasting&#xD;
      blood tests (to detect serum androgens and markers of metabolic syndrome); (2) an oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance test (to characterize glucose and insulin dynamics at 0, 30, 60, 90, and&#xD;
      120-minutes post-glucose ingestion); (3) a physical examination (to measure height, weight,&#xD;
      waist and hips circumference, blood pressure, heart rate, and hirsutism score); (4) a dual&#xD;
      x-ray absorptiometry scan (to quantify total and regional fat and lean mass); and (5) a&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaire (to evaluate health-related quality of life).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate further changes in ovarian morphology, reproductive hormones, metabolic status,&#xD;
      and body composition after the intervention, participants will be invited to return to the&#xD;
      research unit six months after the study ends. The aforementioned procedures (transvaginal&#xD;
      ultrasound scan; fasting blood tests; oral glucose tolerance test; physical examination; dual&#xD;
      x-ray absorptiometry scan; and quality of life questionnaire) will be repeated.&#xD;

    <description>Regardless of reproductive history, each participant will be provided with six months of the commercial weight loss program, Nutrisystem® D. Nutrisystem® D is a portion-controlled, low calorie, and low glycemic index meal delivery system that provides 1250-1500 kcal/day. It has been proven to help overweight adults achieve real and sustainable weight loss results. When meals and snacks are consumed as instructed, average weight loss is 1-2 lbs per week or 15-20% body weight by the end of six months. Nutrisystem® D offers a balanced meal plan that is consistent with the nutrition recommendations of the USDA for Americans and American Diabetes Association. Each participant will be encouraged to take a daily multivitamin to help meet her micronutrient needs on the program.</description>
