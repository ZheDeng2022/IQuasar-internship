  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary data following a pilot study from our institution confirms the ability of&#xD;
      99mTc-glucosamine (99mTc-ECDG) to differentiate between active, subclinical and quiescent&#xD;
      disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma lung, and vasculitis. We propose&#xD;
      to extend these findings and further evaluate this imaging modality for its clinical utility,&#xD;
      limitations, and application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An unacceptably high level of morbidity exists amongst patients suffering from rheumatic&#xD;
      disease. This is often the result of mild disease being missed or misdiagnosed, and therapy&#xD;
      inordinately delayed or inappropriate. The currently used therapeutic agents themselves have&#xD;
      associated side-effects adding to unfavourable clinical outcomes. There is therefore a need&#xD;
      for a superior, less expensive and more easily accessible imaging modality to assess the&#xD;
      degree of inflammation to guide the clinician. Glucosamine is absorbed and metabolised in a&#xD;
      manner not too dissimilar to that of glucose, and it can be readily labelled to form&#xD;
      99mTc-ECDG. Scans can be acquired within 3 hours of intravenous administration of this agent,&#xD;
      accurately depicting sites of active inflammation/disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS Glucose is a vital cellular substrate that accumulates at inflamed tissues because&#xD;
      of the greater metabolic needs of the cells during active disease. Glucosamine, being an&#xD;
      analogue of glucose, is metabolised more quickly in inflamed than non-inflamed tissue and&#xD;
      thus 99mTc-ECDG scintigraphy like 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG-PET) scintigraphy allows for&#xD;
      detection of active inflammation. Unlike current bone scans this agent has the sensitivity to&#xD;
      detect subclinical inflammatory disease that would in turn provide essential information to&#xD;
      ensure accurate diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Aim 1. To evaluate the role of 99mTc-ECDG in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Both as a monitoring&#xD;
      and diagnostic tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach. Three separate cohorts of patients suffering from RA will be recruited;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with newly diagnosed RA;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with active and long-standing RA before and after treatment with anti-TNF;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with RA in remission with or without anti-TNF treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5-10 patients will be recruited into each cohort. In order to provide written consent all&#xD;
      patients will be older than 18 years old. Exclusion criteria will include any patient with an&#xD;
      allergy to glucosamine or seafood, any patient with end-stage renal or hepatic disease,&#xD;
      pregnancy or lactation. No restrictions will be imposed on the treatment patients are able to&#xD;
      receive for their underlying rheumatic condition, nor for any other medical condition while&#xD;
      in this study. Patients will be required to cease any glucosamine therapy for three days&#xD;
      prior to the injection of the radiotracer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An evaluation of patient's history and physical examination will be conducted prior to tracer&#xD;
      administration. All relevant disease will be documented as well as concurrent illnesses and&#xD;
      treatment regimes. A rheumatologist will assess disease severity and documented as per&#xD;
      recommendations outlined under the PBS guidelines for subsidised treatment (HIC - Medicare&#xD;
      Australia). Biological markers of disease will be acquired from each patient at the time of&#xD;
      clinical assessment, including ESR, CRP levels, rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated&#xD;
      peptide antibodies. Similar assessments will be undertaken at six monthly intervals for three&#xD;
      years. These results will be used to correlate with the scan findings. Patients from cohort A&#xD;
      &amp; B will have their initial scans acquired prior to the commencement of therapy. Scans will&#xD;
      be repeated six months later in all patients. Results will be analysed on both a per patient&#xD;
      basis and a per joint basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1a. To correlate 99mTc-ECDG joint uptake with clinical parameters of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scan findings of each group will be graded by a nuclear medicine physician (SA) noting&#xD;
      the pattern of tracer uptake and the intensity of tracer uptake. Relative tracer activity in&#xD;
      joints will be correlated with the activity in the brain / skull (where essentially no uptake&#xD;
      is evident). In addition, the neighbouring muscle tissue, the liver and the cardiac blood&#xD;
      pool activity at the two scanning time points (15 and 120 minutes) will be evaluated. A four&#xD;
      point (0-3) grading system will be utilised to semi-quantify the scan findings, and is as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      0 - Nil uptake - defined as no increased / minimally increased tracer activity in region of&#xD;
      interest (ROI; activity approximates uptake in the brain);&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Mild - tracer uptake in ROI approximates that of the neighbouring muscle tissue;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Moderate - tracer uptake in ROI is greater than that in the vicinity of the heart;&#xD;
           and,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - Severe - tracer uptake in ROI approximates that of the liver. The scan findings will&#xD;
           then be compared to clinical parameters as documented at the time of the study and on&#xD;
           follow-up assessment (as outlined under aim 1). This will enable the investigators to&#xD;
           assess disease progression or remission over time. It will thus be possible to evaluate&#xD;
           the predictive nature of the scan findings in this respect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1b. To evaluate 99mTc-ECDG joint uptake differences before and after treatment. That is,&#xD;
      to predict response to therapy. One of the purposes of follow-up is to identify changes in&#xD;
      disease activity over time. The clinical and scan findings at the time of recruitment will be&#xD;
      compared to the corresponding findings from the follow-up assessments (as outlined in Aim 1 &amp;&#xD;
      1a). Patients from cohorts A &amp; B will permit assessment of clinical response to therapy.&#xD;
      Thus, any regression of disease activity or otherwise, can be correlated with the differences&#xD;
      as depicted on the scans acquired at baseline and at six months later. In cohort B, the&#xD;
      99mTc-ECDG scans acquired at baseline and 6 months later from inadequate responders to&#xD;
      conventional therapy will be compared to those with a favourable clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up studies in patients from cohort C (disease in remission) will provide information&#xD;
      regarding:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the reproducibility of the scan findings in patients who remain clinically stable,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the significance of probable subclinical disease (increased tracer uptake in joints of&#xD;
           patients who are otherwise asymptomatic on the baseline study and the changes observed&#xD;
           on the follow-up scans),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  and the sensitivity in detecting recurrent disease (changes in tracer distribution in&#xD;
           joints that become inflamed in the intervening period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1c. To correlate between findings on 99mTc-ECDG with other imaging modalities, including&#xD;
      bone scintigraphy and 18FDG-PET scintigraphy. In at least 3 RA patients with a wide range of&#xD;
      disease activity, a bone scan will be performed within 72h of the 99mTc-ECDG. At least 3&#xD;
      patients will also undergo 18FDG-PET scintigraphy. These scans will be evaluated by an&#xD;
      experienced nuclear medicine physician (SA), and correlated to the patient profile and the&#xD;
      99mTc-ECDG scan findings. These cohorts will enable the value of the different clinical&#xD;
      information provided by each imaging technique and their complementary nature to be&#xD;
      evaluated. It is anticipated that this study will take 30 months to complete. All patients&#xD;
      will be recruited with the aim to recruit all patients in the first 12 months and followed up&#xD;
      for at least 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2. To investigate the role of 99mTc-ECDG in detecting seronegative spondyloarthritis.&#xD;
      Distinguishing back-pain related to disease flare-up/progression and alternative causes&#xD;
      (osteoarthritis, disc pathology) in patients with early AS is difficult. Therapy is&#xD;
      cause-specific. Inappropriate application of therapeutic regimes can delay recovery often&#xD;
      leading to unforeseen complications with poor outcomes (eg. steroid-related osteoporotic&#xD;
      vertebral crush fractures). Plain X-rays, CT scans and MRI will effectively highlight the&#xD;
      irreversible chronic changes of this disease. However, these techniques seldom detect the&#xD;
      earliest pathogenic changes, being the most amendable to therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
      99mTc-ECDG, by virtue of its ability to accumulate at sites of inflammation, appears&#xD;
      successful in identifying early and mild disease. Furthermore, the pattern of tracer&#xD;
      distribution will assist in differentiating between the competing diagnoses. A control group&#xD;
      of 10-15 patients with mechanical back pain will be used as controls 10-15 AS patients with&#xD;
      varying degrees of disease activity will be recruited. TNF-alpha inhibitor therapy will be&#xD;
      administered to patients meeting the necessary guidelines and scans performed pre and post&#xD;
      treatment. Repeat studies will be acquired 6 months later in all patients. A comparison of&#xD;
      clinical findings, documented by experienced Rheumatologists with regular six-monthly&#xD;
      follow-up over three years will be conducted. The predictive value of these scans with&#xD;
      respect to treatment response will also be assessed as outlined in Aim 1b. MRI scans, the&#xD;
      gold standard for sacro-ileitis, will be acquired within 72 hours of the 99mTc-ECDG scans,&#xD;
      for comparison of findings in the lumbo-sacral region. A number of these patients will also&#xD;
      undergo bone scintigraphy and / or 18FDG-PET scintigraphy (as outlined in Aim 1c), to&#xD;
      evaluate the comparative value of these alternate imaging modalities.&#xD;
