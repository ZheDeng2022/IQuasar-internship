  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute ischemic stroke affects roughly 1 in 50,000 children every year and is one of the top&#xD;
      ten causes of death in children. Currently, caregivers lay the affected child flat in hopes&#xD;
      of increasing blood flow to the brain and reducing the volume of the brain which is damaged.&#xD;
      However, there are currently no techniques to measure brain blood flow at the child's bedside&#xD;
      and indicate if this treatment is effective. We will probe brain blood volume, oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, and flow with red light to determine the efficacy of this intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) affects about 2 children per 100,000 per year and is one of&#xD;
      the top 10 causes of mortality in children. After stroke, there is a disturbance in cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow (CBF) autoregulation, and changes in head position may change CBF. Currently,&#xD;
      practice at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) is to keep the head of bed (HOB)&#xD;
      of a child with AIS flat for 24 hours; however, there is no evidence that this practice is&#xD;
      efficacious in children. Furthermore, maintaining a child supine for 24 hours is&#xD;
      uncomfortable for the child and is often unenforceable in younger children. This study will&#xD;
      use a noninvasive optical technique to measure CBF as HOB position is changed to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of head of bed position in increasing CBF in children with acute arterial&#xD;
      ischemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives are to determine the difference in CBF at HOB flat (0 degrees) and HOB&#xD;
      at +30 degrees in healthy children and in children with AIS. The secondary objectives are to&#xD;
      examine CBF in healthy children and in children with AIS at other HOB angles (0, +15, and +30&#xD;
      degrees) compared to the CBF at HOB 0 degrees and to determine if the position that maximizes&#xD;
      CBF varies over time from stroke onset.&#xD;

    <description>Microvascular blood flow will be measured at 24, 48, and 72 hours post stroke, with the head of bed at 30, 15, and 0 deg (supine). Current clinical practice is to lower the head of bed to the supine position to increase blood flow.</description>
