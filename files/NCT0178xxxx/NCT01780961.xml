      To create an esophageal cancer biospecimen repository that will collect, annotate, store and&#xD;
      distribute human esophageal cancer biospecimens in a manner that embraces the highest ethical&#xD;
      standards of human subject's research, that conforms to the best practices of biorepository&#xD;
      science and that furthers basic, translational and clinical research in the understanding&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of this disease.&#xD;

      Prospective databases have contributed substantially to the advancement of clinical medicine&#xD;
      and surgery. Examples of contributions from databases include an improved understanding of&#xD;
      the treatment and outcome for rare pathologies, the long term outcomes, and incidence of&#xD;
      uncommon complications from more common disease, and the repercussions of infrequently&#xD;
      performed complex procedures. (1-3) Problems identified by database review have led to&#xD;
      improvements in patient care and have guided the planning of numerous prospective studies.&#xD;
      The value of these databases incrementally increases with the number of patients enrolled and&#xD;
      with the length of time the databases have been maintained. Recently databases have been used&#xD;
      to create and test nomograms, which are increasingly being implemented to further refine&#xD;
      patient prognosis and to stratify patients for clinical trials. (4) We anticipate that a&#xD;
      prospective database will become more valuable as we look to the future. Increasingly,&#xD;
      molecular markers are identified which are thought to be important to patient outcome or&#xD;
      treatment response. When linked to pathologic tissues, clinical databases can be used as the&#xD;
      initial test of these newly identified markers and to determine which warrant an independent&#xD;
      prospective review. An independent prospective analysis performed for each marker is costly&#xD;
      and time consuming. A prospective database is more comprehensive, accurate, and ultimately&#xD;
      less time consuming than retrospective review for testing each set of markers as novel&#xD;
      questions arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will augment a prospective database of patients with esophageal cancer who undergo&#xD;
      investigation and /or surgery at Washington University School of Medicine. This database will&#xD;
      be periodically updated from the patient records and the computerized medical record as&#xD;
      patients continue routine follow-up care. These data will be used to address questions&#xD;
      regarding treatment and/or disease-specific outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we seek to acquire, store and analyze tissue and blood samples on these&#xD;
      patients. Samples will be processed and stored at the Tissue Procurement Facility of&#xD;
      Washington University School of Medicine. We will be using this material to support ongoing&#xD;
      efforts to identify serum markers with applications for early diagnosis, prognosis or&#xD;
      treatment efficacy. Markers identified will be linked to the clinical outcomes data as&#xD;
      captured in the database. Using the database, we will be able to link patient and treatment&#xD;
      outcomes to analyses performed on previously collected pathologic specimens or research&#xD;
      specimens and correlate these results with the patients' treatment response and outcome in a&#xD;
      time efficient and cost effective way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma is on the rise. This has been a trend that has&#xD;
      been noted over the last decade and has gone hand in hand with a decrease in the incidence of&#xD;
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Overall the number of patients with esophageal cancer&#xD;
      being diagnosed annually in the United States is steadily increasing. Esophageal cancer&#xD;
      afflicts approximately 19,000 patients annually in the United States. Broadly speaking,&#xD;
      esophageal cancer can be diagnosed at an early stage where there is no metastatic disease in&#xD;
      distant organs or at a relatively advanced stage when there is evidence of metastatic disease&#xD;
      in distant organs. Unfortunately patients with metastatic disease can receive only palliative&#xD;
      therapy and survival is quite limited. Stage I - III esophageal cancer is often treated&#xD;
      either by primary surgery or by a combination of preoperative or postoperative chemoradiation&#xD;
      therapy along with surgical resection. For stage I esophageal cancer, surgical resection&#xD;
      usually suffices and patients have upwards of 70-80% five year survival. For patients with&#xD;
      stage III esophageal cancer, the patients usually undergo induction chemoradiation therapy&#xD;
      followed by surgical resection. Induction chemoradiation usually involves two cycles of %&#xD;
      Fluorouracil and cisplatin with 5040 Gy of external beam radiation therapy. This aspect of&#xD;
      treatment has been well standardized (5). For stage II esophageal cancer, surgery forms the&#xD;
      backbone of therapy, however, there is no clear consensus among treating physicians about the&#xD;
      efficacy and role of chemoradiation therapy in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients who undergo chemoradiation therapy prior to surgery for esophageal cancer, it is&#xD;
      noted that 15-30% of patients have had a complete pathologic response to therapy. Thus no&#xD;
      tumor is detected in the resected specimen in these patients. Therefore, theoretically, these&#xD;
      patients have undergone an unnecessary resection. There is currently no way to predict which&#xD;
      patients would have had a pathologic response short of resecting the esophagus and thus&#xD;
      exposing the patients to the significant morbidity and mortality associated with this major&#xD;
      operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most significant impact of next-generation sequencing on cancer genomics has been the&#xD;
      ability to re-sequence, analyze and compare the matched tumor and normal genomes of a single&#xD;
      patient. With the significantly reduced cost of sequencing and tremendously enhanced&#xD;
      throughput, it is now within the realm of possibility to sequence multiple patient samples of&#xD;
      a given cancer type. Genomic analyses over the last few years, with significant contributions&#xD;
      from our own Genome Center at the Washington University in St. Louis, (6-7) have led to&#xD;
      significant advances in understanding the behavior of certain tumors including leukemias and&#xD;
      glioblastoma. Specifically, in acute leukemias, our center has shown that certain genotypes&#xD;
      of the tumor predict favorable or unfavorable outcomes in the patients analyzed. These&#xD;
      findings now have been replicated in at least 3 independent studies of separate AML cohorts.&#xD;
      Our goal with this project would be to develop an understanding of the genomic profile of&#xD;
      esophageal carcinomas and changes with treatment. Furthermore with availability of tissue&#xD;
      both before and after chemoradiation therapy, we would be able to identify changes in the&#xD;
      genome of the malignancy with induction therapy. Also with resection specimens we will be&#xD;
      able to identify which patients have had a significant response to therapy (including&#xD;
      complete pathologic response) and others who have not had a significant response to therapy&#xD;
      or have had progressive disease despite therapy. This may help us in identifying genomic&#xD;
      features of the spectrum of esophageal carcinomas that predict response to therapy after&#xD;
      having had the chance to longitudinally study the disease or the clinical course of the&#xD;
      patients. Specifically this would be achieved by obtaining tissue specimens from the&#xD;
      malignancy prior to any therapy at the time of the initial diagnosis or initial endoscopy for&#xD;
      these patients. Subsequently the patients would undergo routine therapy which would be based&#xD;
      upon their clinical stage of disease. Eventually when patients come back for their definitive&#xD;
      resection, we would be able to access the pathologic profile to assess response to induction&#xD;
      therapy and also to study the genomic profile of the tumor tissue after induction therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective database which would be maintained in the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery&#xD;
      would be able to link clinical outcomes to processed tissues (pathologic specimens, research&#xD;
      specimens and plasma) enabling higher level correlation studies to be performed. Proper use&#xD;
      of such a resource will aid considerably in our ability to advance our field and care for our&#xD;
      future patients with esophageal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our eventual aim with the analyses of the genome of esophageal cancer would be to identify a&#xD;
      patient population that has a complete pathologic response to chemoradiation therapy for&#xD;
      carcinomas of the esophagus. We will be able to identify genomic differences, if any, between&#xD;
      such tumors and other tumors where there is only a partial response/no response/progressive&#xD;
      disease with induction chemoradiation therapy. If analyses are sufficiently predictive and&#xD;
      efficiently dichotomize patients into these categories based upon genomic profiles, this can&#xD;
      be the lead groundwork for a clinical trial where patients with certain specific genomic&#xD;
      profiles would be treated only with chemoradiation therapy for carcinomas of the esophagus,&#xD;
      thus precluding unnecessary surgery with its significant attendant morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      As we already know, about 15-30% of patients undergoing induction chemoradiation therapy&#xD;
      clinically fall into such a category. The well known morbidity of an esophagectomy includes&#xD;
      significant pulmonary problems, anastomotic leaks, cardiovascular problems, chyle leak,&#xD;
      venous thromboses, amongst other major problems. The rate of morbidity after an esophagectomy&#xD;
      varies from 20-40%. Also there is 3-14 % risk of mortality from esophagectomy. (8-9)&#xD;
      Therefore, a tool that can effectively predict which patients do not require an esophagectomy&#xD;
      for treatment of carcinomas of the esophagus would be extremely useful clinically.&#xD;
