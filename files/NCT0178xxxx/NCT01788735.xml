      Unexplained infertility is defined as the lack of thec ability to become pregnant during the&#xD;
      first year, although the periods of the woman, the semen from the man and the laparoscopic&#xD;
      findings are normal. In Denmark do roughly every fifth to seven couple in the fertile age&#xD;
      have problems becoming pregnant for a various kind of reasons, of these are 10-15 %&#xD;
      unexplained infertile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many factors are pointed out as imported. In particularly lifestyle factors such as the diet,&#xD;
      smocking, obesity, lack of physic activity and alcohol. The causal connection is yet to be&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unexplained infertility is defined as the lack of thec ability to become pregnant during the&#xD;
      first year, although the periods of the woman, the semen from the man and the laparoscopic&#xD;
      findings are normal. In Denmark do roughly every fifth to seven couple in the fertile age&#xD;
      have problems becoming pregnant for a various kind of reasons, of these are 10-15 %&#xD;
      unexplained infertile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many factors are pointed out as imported. In particularly lifestyle factors such as the diet,&#xD;
      smocking, obesity, lack of physic activity and alcohol. The causal connection is yet to be&#xD;
      found, but it is assumed that there is a link between infertility and endocrine, neurological&#xD;
      and immunological factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma and allergy are some of the most common diseases among young people in western world&#xD;
      .The development of these diseases are caused by both hereditary factors, and factors that&#xD;
      also seem to be important in infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is clinically observed that many unexplained infertile patients simultaneously suffer from&#xD;
      asthma and allergy. Furthermore this group of patients seems harder to treat in terms of&#xD;
      becoming pregnant during fertility treatment then healthy not asthmatic and non allergic&#xD;
      persons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is limited available data about this subject and the data that is already collected&#xD;
      does not show a clear tendency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Atopic asthma is characterized by a systemic inflammation and can therefore be&#xD;
      the reason for infertility among this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to examine whether female asthmatics and allergic are less fertile&#xD;
      then healthy females- whether there is there a link between asthma and infertility.&#xD;
      Furthermore if an optimal asthma treatment during fertility treatment reduces time to&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is divided into 3 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A Study of Population. In the first part of this project the aim is to evaluate the&#xD;
           occurrence of asthmatic and allergic diseases among women with respectively normal&#xD;
           fertility and infertility. This is done through data already collected in The Danish&#xD;
           twin Study from 1998- 2002 concerning questions about asthma, hay fever, atopic eczema&#xD;
           and number of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A Prospective Study In the second part of this project the aim is to examine clinically,&#xD;
           whether female asthmatics in general have more difficulties becoming pregnant then non-&#xD;
           asthmatic females. Furthermore we aim to evaluate whether it is allergic or non allergic&#xD;
           asthma that affects the fertility the most.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Casual study In the third part of this project we only include 40 of the unexplained&#xD;
           infertile females collected earlier- 10 females with asthma, 10 females with allergy, 10&#xD;
           females with both asthma and allergy, 10 without any atopic disease.These women have, in&#xD;
           addition to the initial asthma and allergy diagnosis, made a suction of the mucus in the&#xD;
           uterus, when they are ovulating. This in order to determine whether the environment in&#xD;
           the uterus is different in terms of inflammation in atopics. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
           find an explanation for a possible decreased pregnancy rate and a longer time to&#xD;
           pregnancy in atopics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material :&#xD;
&#xD;
      396 unexplained infertile females are included, when starting treatment at a fertility&#xD;
      clinic. Among these are 197 healthy unexplained infertile females and 197 are females with&#xD;
      the combination asthma and unexplained infertility. They are all included due to specific&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects are by inclusion tested for asthma with bronchial provocation tests. The&#xD;
      pulmonary function is measured and the severity of their possible asthma is examined by NO in&#xD;
      the expired air. Blood samples (RAS test) and prick test are performed to evaluate their&#xD;
      possible allergy status. All subjects are to fill out questionnaires concerning asthma,&#xD;
      allergy and their infertility. Due to the test mentioned above the subjects are divided in to&#xD;
      groups, asthmatic , allergics, atopics and non- atopics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The female asthmatics are treated due to the international guidelines. All groups are&#xD;
      followed till achieved pregnancy; where after time to pregnancy can be compared.Â¨&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the third part of the study a suction of the mucus in the uterus is made at time of&#xD;
      ovulation, to determinate the level of inflammation in atopics versus non atopics at time of&#xD;
      fertilization.The mucus is examined fore inflammatory markers related to atopy such as TNF&#xD;
      alpha, IL4,5,6,8and 33.&#xD;
