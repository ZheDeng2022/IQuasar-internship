  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, our goal is to determine the pharmacokinetics of micafungin in a non-selected&#xD;
      cohort of patients with suspected or proven invasive fungal infections. Patients will receive&#xD;
      micafungin for the period necessary to achieve clinical and / or mycological cure. An attempt&#xD;
      will be made to have 2 PK curves, one full and one limited sampling on days 3 (n=9) and 7&#xD;
      (n=5). Furthermore, we will be able to determine intra-individual variability. On non-PK&#xD;
      days, trough samples will be taken to determine the time to steady state. All samples will be&#xD;
      taken just prior to the morning dose of micafungin. All infusion rates will be according to&#xD;
      the SPC label information. Patients are considered to be evaluable if at least the first PK&#xD;
      curve has been completed. Two moments of PK analysis will enable us to determine whether&#xD;
      there is an increase over time in exposure if steady state has not been reached.&#xD;

      Whilst micafungin (Mycamine®) has much to offer, little is known about its pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      profile in ICU patients with specific co-morbidities such as obesity, hypoalbumenia, and&#xD;
      severe liverfunction disturbances. Also, ICU patients are known to experience changes in&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) due to changes in hemodynamics, extracorporeal elimination techniques,&#xD;
      interacting comedication, etc. Based on criteria outlined below, micafungin may prove to be&#xD;
      the drug of choice in this cohort of patients. Therefore it seems prudent to conduct a trial&#xD;
      in a cohort of patients who receive micafungin but with co-variates that may be of influence&#xD;
      to the pharmacokinetic profile. To build a valid pharmacokinetic model, all patients on&#xD;
      micafungin will be included in the analysis and used for model building. Co-variates that&#xD;
      will be explored are at least: obesitas, liverfunction, albumin, creatinin-clearance.&#xD;
      Simulations will be performed to determine if adequate exposure is reached under different&#xD;
      patho-physiological conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion: this trial is on determining the PK of micafungin in a non-selected cohort of&#xD;
      patients with suspected or proven invasive fungal infections. Most important covariates will&#xD;
      be modelled using advanced mathematical techniques. Micafungin may prove to be beneficial&#xD;
      over the other two echinocandins in terms of limited factors that impact PK. This has to be&#xD;
      proven in a prospective trial.&#xD;

        All patients receiving micafungin for the treatment or suspicion of an invasive fungal&#xD;
        infection will be included. At least 20 patients will be included to obtain 16 evaluable&#xD;
        patients. If recruitment of 20 patients is achieved within one year, more patients can be&#xD;
        included. A formal sample size cannot be performed for several reasons but the sample size&#xD;
        is rather based on the general assumption that 16 patients are sufficient to have a&#xD;
        descriptive PK approach.&#xD;
