    <textblock>
      All eligible patients who will have neurosurgery at Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI)&#xD;
      between March 1, 2013 and February 28, 2014 will be enrolled as part of this study that will&#xD;
      look at the flow of staff people in and out of the operating room during surgeries and the&#xD;
      effect that the number of people may have on the rate of infections in the surgical sites.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infections that occur as a direct result of patients' stays in a hospital are called&#xD;
      &quot;nosocomial infections.&quot; One of the most common types of nosocomial infections occur as a&#xD;
      result of surgical procedures that patient undergo while they are in the hospital. These&#xD;
      nosocomial infections that occur as a result of surgical procedures are referred to as&#xD;
      surgical site infections (SSI), and they are associated with increased patient morbidity as&#xD;
      well as approximately $1.5 billion of added healthcare expenses annually. Under the nascent&#xD;
      Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), SSI rates will be used by the government&#xD;
      to justify the alteration of reimbursement rates to hospitals and physicians for patient&#xD;
      care. As a result, SSIs are of the utmost interest to both surgeons, hospitals and healthcare&#xD;
      providers, in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the suspected causes of SSI's is increased personnel traffic thru operating rooms&#xD;
      during surgeries. The logic involves the fact that bacteria capable of causing SSI's are&#xD;
      present in normal air. The air within operating rooms is constantly filtered, in order to&#xD;
      decrease the bacterial load within the air and hopefully decreasing the likelihood that a&#xD;
      patient will develop a SSI. When personnel open doors connecting the operating rooms to the&#xD;
      outside hallways, the dirty, unfiltered air from the hallways is able to mix with the clean,&#xD;
      filtered air within the operating rooms. This increases the bacterial load within the&#xD;
      operating room, and potentially increases the risk of the patient developing a SSI. However,&#xD;
      no class I data exist demonstrating that the level of personnel traffic thru operating rooms&#xD;
      during surgery has any significant effect on SSI's. Nevertheless, the Joint Commission on&#xD;
      Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) Accreditation Manual for Hospitals, as well&#xD;
      as the United States' Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines for infection control&#xD;
      emphasize the importance of traffic patterns in the surgical suite, as well as limiting the&#xD;
      number of personnel involved in the procedure. Other national organizations such as the&#xD;
      Association of Operating Room Nurses (AORN) have made similar recommendations that personnel&#xD;
      traffic thru the operating room should be limited during surgical procedures. Although these&#xD;
      recommendations appear logical, they create significant performance pressure for the&#xD;
      operating room personnel, because it limits their abilities to do carry out the duties during&#xD;
      surgery by limiting their mobility in-and-out of the operating rooms. These restrictions are&#xD;
      especially difficult to implement for teaching institutions like the Barrow Neurological&#xD;
      Institute (BNI) that attract international observers who travel from other countries, in&#xD;
      order to stand inside of our operating rooms so they can watch and learn from our&#xD;
      neurosurgeons. Therefore, prior to instituting any restrictions on personnel movement thru&#xD;
      the operating rooms, the investigators feel it is imperative that class I data be generated,&#xD;
      in order to either prove or disprove that the level of personnel traffic in the operating&#xD;
      room correlates with infection rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to generate class 1 data, the investigators propose that a prospective, randomized&#xD;
      trial, hereafter referred to as the BRITE Trial, be conducted at the Barrow Neurological&#xD;
      Institute (BNI) at St Joseph's Hospital &amp; Medical Center (SJHMC), Phoenix, Arizona. The BRITE&#xD;
      Trial will enroll all eligible patients undergoing a surgical procedure within the BNI&#xD;
      Operating Rooms for a period of one year, starting on January 1, 2013. The BNI Operating&#xD;
      Rooms contain 11 operating rooms where surgeries are conducted on a daily basis. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to divide the 11 BNI operating rooms into 2 different groups: Group A and&#xD;
      Group B. Group A will be operating rooms #1 thru #5. Group B will be operating rooms #6 thru&#xD;
      #11. Investigators plan to randomize both Group A and Group B to either &quot;Normal O.R. Traffic&quot;&#xD;
      or &quot;Low O.R. Traffic&quot; protocols. The randomization will occur in a dichotomous fashion so&#xD;
      Group A and Group B are never simultaneously randomized to the same O.R. Traffic protocol.&#xD;
      The randomization will occur at 6 a.m. on the Monday morning of each new week, and the&#xD;
      randomization designation will last for 7 consecutive days. Randomization will occur thru a&#xD;
      standard randomization computer program (www.random.org) and weekly designations will be&#xD;
      placed within sealed envelopes. The sealed envelope for each week will be opened at 6 a.m. on&#xD;
      the Monday morning of that week. The group of operating rooms that is designated as being&#xD;
      under the &quot;Low O.R. Traffic&quot; protocol will have signs on the inside and outside of all doors&#xD;
      connected to these operating rooms. The &quot;Low O.R. Traffic&quot; protocol group will also be&#xD;
      required to adhere to a new set of rules and regulations. The group of operating rooms that&#xD;
      is designated as being under &quot;Normal O.R. Traffic&quot; protocol will have no signs on their doors&#xD;
      and they will follow the normal standards for O.R. personnel traffic, per routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data reflecting personnel movement will be collected via a proprietary &quot;personnel counting&#xD;
      system&quot; (Traf-Sys, Pittsburgh, PA). The &quot;personnel counting system&quot; operates via infrared&#xD;
      beams mounted on the outside of every operating room door. When a person walks thru the&#xD;
      operating room door, the infrared beam is broken and the system records the movement of a&#xD;
      single person. These data will be tracked 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for a 365 day period.&#xD;
      An interim analysis will be conducted at 6 months. Primary outcome will be return to the BNI&#xD;
      operating room for wound washout within 12 months. Secondary outcome will be return to BNI&#xD;
      operating room for any reason. Our goal for the BRITE Trial is 2-fold. First, the&#xD;
      investigators want to determine whether or not instituting a Low O.R. Traffic protocol&#xD;
      actually leads to decreased O.R. personnel traffic thru the operating rooms. Second, the&#xD;
      investigators want to determine whether or not increased levels of O.R. personnel traffic&#xD;
      thru the operating rooms leads to increased rates of SSI's.&#xD;
