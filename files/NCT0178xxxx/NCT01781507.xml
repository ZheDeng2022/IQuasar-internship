&#xD;
        -  Known history of reflux, lung disease, or congenital heart disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known history of adverse reaction to cetirizine&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study, is a double-blinded, randomized , placebo- controlled study to assess 1) the&#xD;
      acute bronchodilatory effects of cetirizine 10 mg tablet compared to levalbuterol and 2) the&#xD;
      bronchodilatory effect of cetirizine 10 mg compared to placebo after two weeks of treatment .&#xD;
      There will be minimum of five total study visits. The study drug will be encapsulated with&#xD;
      methylcellulose and the placebo capsules will have methylcellulose alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit Schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Initial Screening Visit On a regularly scheduled clinic day, following completion of a&#xD;
           signed informed consent the study, the first patient evaluation will compose of: '&#xD;
&#xD;
           History and Physical Exam The subject's demographic, medical, family, and history will&#xD;
           be recorded by standardized questionnaire. All previous medications used to treat&#xD;
           allergic rhinitis will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Skin prick testing using the Multi-test method will be used to test for common&#xD;
           environmental allergens. This is a standard procedure done in evaluating patients with a&#xD;
           clinical history suggestive of allergic rhinitis and takes 15 minutes from initial prick&#xD;
           to interpretation of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As part of the standard assessment for skin testing, patients will be asked to not take&#xD;
           any oral or intranasal anti-histamines for one week before the visit. Antihistamines can&#xD;
           mask the histamine effects, and subsequently positive skin test results. If they are&#xD;
           interested in participating in the study, they will be asked to remain off&#xD;
           antihistamines until their enrollment into the study has been determined. Allergens on&#xD;
           the environmental panel to be tested include cat, dust mite, weed mix, tree mix, grass&#xD;
           mix, mold mix, saline, and histamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Second Screening Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
           After withholding beta-agonist treatment for at least 6 hours, testing for baseline&#xD;
           pulmonary function will be performed with impulse oscillometry and spirometry. They will&#xD;
           undergo impulse oscillometry technique under the guidance of a trained technician. If&#xD;
           the subject is.able to, he/she will also perform spirometry after oscillometry is&#xD;
           completed. If airway obstruction is detected by oscillometry, subjects will be given&#xD;
           levalbuterol by hand-held nebulizer and both impulse oscillometry and spirometry will be&#xD;
           repeated 15 minutes after the nebulizer treatment is completed. If there is evidence of&#xD;
           reversibility (i.e. lung function improvement), then the subject will have fulfilled the&#xD;
           inclusion criteria and be asked to continue with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. First Study Visit The first study visit will be a continuation of the second screening&#xD;
           visit after the subject has fulfilled the inclusion criteria as evidenced by reversible&#xD;
           airway obstruction following levalbuterol treatment. The subject will be asked to&#xD;
           continue with the study period and he/she will have repeat lung function testing at 15,&#xD;
           30, 60,90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes after treatment. Lung function testing will be by&#xD;
           impulse oscillometry. If the subject is able to, he/she will perform spirometry at 60&#xD;
           and 240 minutes post-levalbuterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will be instructed to complete a daily diary for allergic rhinitis and asthma&#xD;
           symptom scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Second Study Visit (1 to 7 days after First Study Visit) All beta-agonist treatment&#xD;
           needs to be withheld at least 6 hours prior to the visit. Baseline lung function testing&#xD;
           by impulse oscillometry and spirometry will be done. The subject will be given&#xD;
           Cetirizine 10 mg tablet or placebo. The subject and the coordinator will be blinded to&#xD;
           the study treatment. Lung function testing will be assessed by impulse oscillometry. at&#xD;
           15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes after the cetirizine. Spirometry will also be&#xD;
           performed at 60 and 240 minutes post.-cetirizine .&#xD;
&#xD;
           Daily diary entries will be reviewed with the subject. The subject will be sent home on&#xD;
           the study medication. He/she take 1 tablet of the study medication daily starting the&#xD;
           day after the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Third Study Visit (7 to 10 days after Second Study Visit) The subject will take his/her&#xD;
           usual study medication dose in the office. He/she will perform impulse oscillometry, and&#xD;
           if able to, spirometry to assess lung function. Daily diary entries will be reviewed&#xD;
           with subject. The subject will be instructed to continue taking the study medication at&#xD;
           the same dosing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Fourth Study Visit ,(7 to 10 days after Third Study Visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
           The subject will take his/her usual study medication dose in the office. He/she will&#xD;
           perform impulse oscillometry and spirometry to assess lung function. Daily diary entries&#xD;
           will be reviewed with the subject. The subject will be instructed to stop taking the&#xD;
           study medication and continue putting in diary entries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Fifth Study Visit (7 to 10 days after Fourth Study Visit) The subject will perform&#xD;
           impulse oscillometry and spirometry to assess lung function. Daily diary entries will be&#xD;
           reviewed with the parent or caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no laboratory studies in this project.&#xD;
