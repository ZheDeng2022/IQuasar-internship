    <textblock>
      In this study, up to 21 patients with lung cancer will receive UV1 (a therapeutic synthetic&#xD;
      peptide vaccine) at different dose levels. The safety and tolerability of UV1 as well as&#xD;
      immunological response will be assessed. The purpose of this study is to select a biological&#xD;
      dose of peptides for further clinical trials. Study recruitment completed at 6 patients in&#xD;
      every dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main study treatment phase of this study is completed and will be reported separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up is ongoing&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label dose-escalating phase I/IIa study of UV1 peptide vaccination in&#xD;
      patients with NSCLC after completion of radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. Patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled in this study if they have achieved complete response (CR), partial response (PR)&#xD;
      or stable disease (SD) at least 4 weeks after completion of standard first line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following 2-step design will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conventional dose escalation with at least 3 patients per dose level (3 selected dose&#xD;
           levels).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Expansion of each dose level to a total of 6 patients for assessment of immune response&#xD;
           levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      13 UV1 vaccinations will be given during the first 6 months (week 26) of treatment, unless&#xD;
      clinical deterioration or unacceptable toxicity is encountered. Granulocyte-macrophage&#xD;
      colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Leukine ®) will be used as adjuvant for 11 of the 13&#xD;
      doses of UV1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the main study treatment period at week 26, if the patient agrees,&#xD;
      additional vaccinations may be considered for the following patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immune responders within first 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immune non-responders providing they have at least SD&#xD;
