      The main purpose of this research program is to reduce the burden of end-stage organ disease&#xD;
      on individuals, families, healthcare systems, and society by increasing the availability of&#xD;
      donor organs for transplantation. Consistent with this aim, the project further examines&#xD;
      strategies to increase access to and reduce disparities - racial, economic, gender - in live&#xD;
      donor kidney transplantation (LDKT). Specifically, we expand the research and intensity of an&#xD;
      innovative House Calls intervention developed by the principal investigator by including&#xD;
      other minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients and by adding a novel&#xD;
      Patient-Centered Decision Support component. The main study hypothesis is that participants&#xD;
      receiving the novel intervention (House Calls + Patient-Centered Decision Support) will have&#xD;
      a higher proportion of LDKT's by the 2-year study endpoint.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      For most adults in late Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD Stage 4 or 5), kidney transplantation&#xD;
      yields superior outcomes compared to long-term dialysis. Unfortunately, the demand for kidney&#xD;
      transplantation far exceeds the supply of deceased donor organs. For those patients with&#xD;
      healthy and willing living kidney donors, live donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) produces&#xD;
      superior graft and patient survival rates, lower acute rejection rates, more rapid&#xD;
      improvements in functional status, and lower healthcare costs. However, there are profound&#xD;
      racial and income disparities in access to LDKT. Minorities, especially Blacks and Hispanics,&#xD;
      are substantially less likely to receive LDKT compared to Whites. Also, the overall decline&#xD;
      in LDKTs in the United States in recent years has been more pronounced for Blacks and&#xD;
      patients with less household income. These lower LDKT rates contribute to longer waiting&#xD;
      times for transplantation, more dialysis exposure, higher likelihood of death before&#xD;
      transplantation, declining functional capacity, less optimal graft outcomes after&#xD;
      transplantation, and higher healthcare costs. Therefore, interventions that expand access to&#xD;
      LDKT, especially those targeting minority and low-income populations, are needed given the&#xD;
      current and projected shortage of deceased donor organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several hypothesized barriers to LDKT for minorities and low-income patients,&#xD;
      including perceived discrimination, health care mistrust, social network differences, higher&#xD;
      rates of conditions that preclude living kidney donation, higher indirect costs of living&#xD;
      donation, less knowledge and more concerns about LDKT, and failure to provide culturally&#xD;
      competent education to patients and their support systems. In the last decade, the PI has&#xD;
      developed and evaluated an innovative House Calls intervention designed to remove LDKT&#xD;
      barriers.28-30 Health educators deliver a comprehensive and interactive program on kidney&#xD;
      transplantation and living donation in the patient's home with members of their social&#xD;
      network present. Relative to standard clinic-based educational programs, the House Calls&#xD;
      intervention is superior at improving LDKT knowledge, reducing LDKT concerns, increasing LDKT&#xD;
      willingness, and increasing rates of LDKT, particularly in minority and low-income patients&#xD;
      (see Preliminary Studies section). However, the effectiveness of the House Calls intervention&#xD;
      may be limited by the absence of decision-making aids, exposure to appropriate peer models,&#xD;
      and assistance in developing an LDKT action plan beyond the House Calls intervention. This&#xD;
      limitation and feedback from study participants have informed our strategy to enhance the&#xD;
      House Calls intervention by incorporating a Patient-Centered Decision Support component.&#xD;
      Additionally, there is a pressing need to identify factors that are most critical to the&#xD;
      success of the House Calls intervention and to determine whether it can reduce the gender&#xD;
      disparity in living kidney donation.8 Therefore, in the proposed study, we plan to pursue two&#xD;
      primary aims and one exploratory aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the differential benefit of adding a patient-centered decision support&#xD;
           component to the House Calls intervention. In a randomized controlled trial, we will&#xD;
           compare House Calls (HC) alone to House Calls + Decision Support (HC+DS) in a sample of&#xD;
           minorities and low-income patients. It is hypothesized that, compared to HC alone, the&#xD;
           HC+DS group will have a higher proportion of patients with LDKT by the 2-yr study&#xD;
           endpoint (primary outcome) and higher proportions of patients with ≥1 live donor&#xD;
           inquiry, ≥1 live donor evaluation, and in LDKT Readiness Stages 4/5 by the 12-wk&#xD;
           assessment (secondary outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify mediators of the relationship between the interventions and the occurrence of&#xD;
           LDKT. We will investigate a set of mediators through which House Calls may increase the&#xD;
           occurrence of LDKT, including increased LDKT knowledge, change in LDKT readiness,&#xD;
           reduced LDKT concerns, reduced health care mistrust, the amount of time discussing LDKT&#xD;
           with others and the quality of those interactions, and improvement in self-efficacy&#xD;
           discussing LDKT with others.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exploratory Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine whether the House Calls intervention reduces the gender disparity in rates of&#xD;
           living kidney donation. Women comprise 60% of all living kidney donors in the past&#xD;
           decade. We have shown that the House Calls intervention directly educates significantly&#xD;
           more potential living donors, including men, compared to standard clinic-based&#xD;
           educational approaches. We hypothesize that a higher proportion of patients receiving&#xD;
           the House Calls intervention (either HC alone or HC+DS) will have at least one potential&#xD;
           male donor evaluated and be more likely to receive a LDKT from a male living donor,&#xD;
           relative to a non-intervention control group, controlling for patient race/ethnicity,&#xD;
           gender, age, and household income.&#xD;
