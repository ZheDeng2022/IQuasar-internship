  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is substantial evidence from animal model and healthy control data, that oxytocin is&#xD;
      involved in the modulation of social cognition. In addition, recent genetics and plasma level&#xD;
      studies suggest a possible role for oxytocin in the pathophysiology of Autism Spectrum&#xD;
      Disorders (ASD). As a large number of children with ASD are transitioning into adulthood and&#xD;
      will likely require treatment, the lack of data to make meaningful treatment recommendations&#xD;
      to facilitate adult living is an urgent issue. This study will examine the effect of&#xD;
      intranasal oxytocin (IN-OXT) on social function in adults with ASD. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      IN-OXT will be superior to placebo in improving social function by the end of study&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Male or female outpatients 18-45 years of age, inclusive&#xD;

          2. Meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Diagnostic and Statistical&#xD;
             Manual (DSM-V) criteria will be established by a clinician with expertise with&#xD;
             individuals with ASD. Best estimate Diagnosis will be reached using DSM-V criteria,&#xD;
             the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview&#xD;
             (ADI-R).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have a Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score ≥ 4 (moderately ill) at&#xD;
             Screening.&#xD;

          4. Verbal scale Intelligence Quotient (IQ) ≥ 70&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If already receiving stable concomitant medications affecting behavior, have stable&#xD;
             regimens with no changes during the preceding 1 month prior to Screening (with the&#xD;
             exception of fluoxetine, where a period of 6 weeks is needed), and will not electively&#xD;
