  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common inflammatory disease of the airway&#xD;
      affecting approximately 10% of individuals aged 40 years or more with a smoking history. The&#xD;
      disease is characterized by an increase in numbers of airway white blood cells (neutrophils,&#xD;
      lymphocytes and monocytes). Stimulation of white blood cells results in the release of&#xD;
      different agents of inflammation. Some of these agents give an indication of the presence or&#xD;
      severity of a disease when measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This case control study will be conducted at The Heart Lung Centre, London, UK. The study&#xD;
      aims to determine biomarkers for the differentiation of subjects with COPD (GOLD Stage 1-2&#xD;
      and who are current smokers with a ≥ 10 pack year smoking history) and three matched control&#xD;
      groups: one of non-smoking subjects (never smoked), one of ex-smokers and one of current&#xD;
      smokers. COPD subjects will be matched to the non-COPD subjects by gender, age and ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a range of physiological measurements including lung function,&#xD;
      computerized tomography scans (CT scans), cardio pulmonary exercise test and computerized&#xD;
      multichannel lung sounds analysis (Stethographics). In addition, lung inflammation will be&#xD;
      assessed by cellular and molecular biomarkers using e.g. transcriptomics and proteomics&#xD;
      technologies.&#xD;

      At the screening visit, subject consent will be obtained prior to conducting any study&#xD;
      related procedures. Informed consent may be obtained on registration/review visit at the&#xD;
      Centre where it is conducted and thus prior to visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening visit will involve obtaining demographic data and medical history information&#xD;
      as well as performing safety assessments such as vital sign measurements, electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests. An induced sputum sample will be obtained to ensure&#xD;
      that subjects can produce an adequate sputum sample. Smokers will receive information on&#xD;
      smoking cessation at the screening visit and follow-up telephone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will come back to the center on up to four further occasions if they meet the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria at screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  visit 2: 4 to 21 days after screening,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  visit 3: 3-14 days post visit 2, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  visit 4: 3-14 days post visit 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up telephone call will be conducted 3-10 days post visit 4.&#xD;
