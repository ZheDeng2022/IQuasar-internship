  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional open prospective randomized study, done in two sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of bipolar&#xD;
      radiofrequency potentiated by an infrared light followed by fractional bipolar radiofrequency&#xD;
      for the treatment of striae on the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to have a more complete and accurate study, each technology will also be evaluated&#xD;
      separately. This will allow the comparison of the effect of each treatment, in monotherapy or&#xD;
      combined.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stria is a very common condition that affects psychologically and aesthetically a lot of&#xD;
      patients. It is a linear atrophic scar. So, to be treated, it needs to have both a&#xD;
      superficial and a deep impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several technologies have already been tested for this indication, but none of them have been&#xD;
      proved at the same time effective and without a high risk of side effects for all skin types.&#xD;
      As radiofrequency is an electrical current, it is not absorbed and does not see melanin. So&#xD;
      it can be used on all skin types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When using fractional bipolar radiofrequency, the current goes from small electrodes to&#xD;
      return electrodes. Around the small electrodes appear some epidermal ablation, coagulation&#xD;
      and deeper thermal damage. This means it has a superficial and a deep effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using infrared combined with bipolar radiofrequency allows the infrared to pre-heat the skin&#xD;
      so as to help the radiofrequency to go deeper in the skin more easily. This has a deep effect&#xD;
      in the dermis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, both technologies will be used. At least 20 patients will be treated in two&#xD;
      different sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The abdomen of each patient will be divided in four quadrants around the navel. Each quadrant&#xD;
      will receive a total of three treatments one month apart:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One quadrant will be the control (no treatment will be done)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One quadrant will receive each time only bipolar radiofrequency potentiated by infrared&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One quadrant will receive each time only fractional bipolar radiofrequency&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One quadrant will receive each time first bipolar radiofrequency potentiated by&#xD;
           infrared, followed in the same session by fractional bipolar radiofrequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of the treatment for each area will be randomized at the enrollment of the patient&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two follow-up sessions 3 and 6 months after the last treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation will be done mainly by 3D acquisitions. This will allow measuring the length,&#xD;
      width and depth of the striae and evaluating their evolution after the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients, if they agree, will also have in vivo confocal microscopy before the first&#xD;
      treatment and 6 months after the last one. This will give more information on the collagen&#xD;
      and elastin changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four patients, who accept it, will have biopsies performed before the first treatment and 6&#xD;
      months after the last one to also show the evolution of the skin structure.&#xD;
