  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-center clinical trial investigating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of administrating intravenous Cerebrolysin™ (EVER NEURO Pharma, Austria), a&#xD;
      preparation of low-molecular weight neurotrophic peptides and free amino acids, in improving&#xD;
      the functional outcome of patients suffering from aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage ( SAH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebrolysin™ is a porcine-derived intravenous formulation composed of multiple lipid-soluble&#xD;
      active agents that can cross the blood-brain barrier. It is a registered medication in&#xD;
      several countries indicated for stroke and Alzheimer's disease. It contains several low&#xD;
      molecular weight neuropeptides and free amino acids that possess neuroprotective and&#xD;
      neurotrophic properties. It has been proven to arrest or mitigate several crucial steps along&#xD;
      the ischemic cascade in preclinical studies. Cerebrolysin™ has been extensively investigated&#xD;
      in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, brain trauma and ischemic stroke with&#xD;
      promising clinical results. It's use in SAH patients has never been investigated and it is&#xD;
      believed that it may play a role in improving clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients aged 18 to 70 years-old diagnosed to have spontaneous subarachnoid&#xD;
      hemorrhage secondary to a ruptured intracranial aneurysm will be randomly allocated into one&#xD;
      of two study arms: (1) to receive intravenous Cerebrolysin™ in additional to standard of care&#xD;
      (intervention group) or (2) to receive usual standard of care alone (control group).&#xD;
      Permuted-block randomization will be carried out once the eligibility criteria have been&#xD;
      fulfilled using a computer system with an allocation list of random order. Instructions on&#xD;
      study arm allocation will be contained in sealed envelopes labeled with sequential study&#xD;
      numbers. Patients presenting beyond 96 hours after onset of symptoms or if recruitment and&#xD;
      randomization cannot be performed within this time period will be excluded. The reason being&#xD;
      that post-SAH arterial vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia usually occurs four days after&#xD;
      aneurysm rupture and lasts for two weeks i.e. 14 days. Should this complication arise before&#xD;
      Cerebrolysin™ is administered there would be significant confounding of trial outcome&#xD;
      measures . The timing of intervention is in keeping with several landmark clinical studies&#xD;
      that have dealt with neuroprotective agents in subarachnoid hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the intervention group will receive in a daily total dose of 30ml of intravenous&#xD;
      Cerebrolysin™. The study medication will be administered in three separate 10ml doses (every&#xD;
      eight hours) diluted in 0.9% NaCl saline to a total volume of 100 ml as an intravenous&#xD;
      infusion over a time period of 15 minutes. An identical amount of 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl)&#xD;
      saline (100 ml) will be used as placebo for patients allocated to the control study group.&#xD;
      The total duration of study medication or placebo administration will be 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebrolysin™ is a clear yellow solution. Since it is susceptible to photo-degeneration the&#xD;
      preparation after dilution with 0.9% NaCl saline requires masking with a opaque plastic wrap&#xD;
      as well as special photo-protective infusion sets. The dilution of the Cerebrolysin™ solution&#xD;
      will be performed by ward nursing staff . Subjects in both trial groups will receive&#xD;
      identically wrapped preparations so that both the functional outcomes assessor and patient&#xD;
      are blind to the study arm allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to general demographic data, clinical data including the admission Glasgow Coma&#xD;
      Score, severity grading of SAH, hospital stay as well as the extended Glasgow Outcome Score&#xD;
      and modified Rankin Score upon discharge, at three months and six months will be&#xD;
      prospectively collected. The functional outcomes assessor will be an occupational therapist&#xD;
      unaware of the subject's trial group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: compared to patients receiving standard care for the management of aneurysmal&#xD;
      subarachnoid hemorrhage alone (control), the additional administration of intravenous&#xD;
      Cerebrolysin™ (intervention) within the acute phase of stroke is safe and improves functional&#xD;
      outcome at six months after stroke.&#xD;

    <description>Global functional performance upon discharge, at three and six months after stroke in terms of the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (E-GOS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Binary outcomes are defined as 'good/ moderate' or 'poor' in terms of these scales.&#xD;
For the E-GOS, 'good/ moderate' outcome is defined by a score of 7-8 (i.e. good recovery) and poor outcome is defined as 0-6 (i.e. moderate recovery to death). For the mRS, 'good/ moderate' outcome is defined by a score of 0-2 (i.e. asymptomatic to slight disability) and poor outcome is defined as 3-6 (moderate disability to death).</description>
