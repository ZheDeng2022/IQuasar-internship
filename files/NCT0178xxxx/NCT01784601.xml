    <textblock>
      Primary objective of this study is to find out the incidence of hemi-diaphragmatic palsy&#xD;
      associated with interscalene block done under ultrasound guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • There is an incidence of hemidiaphragmatic palsy ranging fron 33-100 % after an&#xD;
      interscalene block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The incidence of hemidiaphragmatic palsy is much less than 33% when the block is done&#xD;
           using ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The incidence of hemi-diaphragmatic palsy is directly proportional to volume of local&#xD;
           anaesthetic injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The incidence of hemi-diaphragmatic palsy is directly proportional to concentration of&#xD;
           local anaesthetic injected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients of either sex belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologists status 1-3&#xD;
      scheduled for elective shoulder surgery as an outpatient basis, planned for an interscalene&#xD;
      block will be included in this study over a period of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential patients will be identified from the surgeons' list. The PI or one of the&#xD;
      co-investigators will contact them in the surgical day care in the morning of surgery and&#xD;
      will be given information about the study. Documented informed consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, they will be examined for their diaphragm position using an&#xD;
      ultrasound prior to block placement .&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have the block initiated in the block room using standard monitors and&#xD;
      sedation as per the standard practice in this hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will undergo an ultrasound examination for their diaphragm position 5 mins and&#xD;
      10 mins after the completion of the nerve block. Ipsilateral ( same side as the block) and&#xD;
      contralateral ( opposite side of block) hemi-diaphragmatic excursion will be measured with&#xD;
      the patients in supine position during quiet inspiration ,deep inspiration and forceful&#xD;
      sniff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, bedside spirometry using a compact spirometer will be performed and FVC, FEV1&#xD;
      and PEFR measurements will be performed.The oxygen saturation and any evidence of dyspnea or&#xD;
      shortness of breadth will be noted at the above mentioned intervals after the completion of&#xD;
      the block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive general anesthesia in the operating room. The patient will receive&#xD;
      IV opioids during the procedure if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above mentioned data will be collected postoperatively in the recovery room 30 mins,&#xD;
      after arrival.&#xD;
