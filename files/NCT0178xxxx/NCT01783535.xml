  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this protocol is to evaluate the response rate of bilateral disease&#xD;
      participants who have at least one eye with advanced intra-ocular retinoblastoma (stratum B)&#xD;
      using upfront therapy with chemotherapy delivered directly to the eye. The main biology&#xD;
      objective is to improve our understanding of the biology and tumorigenesis (how tumor&#xD;
      develops) of retinoblastoma when biology specimens are available. As clinicians, the primary&#xD;
      goal of the investigators for children with retinoblastoma is to provide optimal therapy&#xD;
      using multiple treatment approaches [chemotherapy (into the vein and directly into membrane&#xD;
      of eyeball), cryotherapy (freeze and destroy tumor), thermotherapy (laser or heat to destroy&#xD;
      tumor), radiation therapy, and surgical removal of eye if needed) in an attempt to preserve&#xD;
      the eye and vision whenever possible, while still curing the disease. Therefore, all children&#xD;
      with non-metastatic retinoblastoma at St. Jude will be offered enrollment on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the response (complete + partial response) rate of bilateral disease&#xD;
           participants who have at least one eye with advanced intraocular retinoblastoma (Stratum&#xD;
           B) to two upfront courses of therapy consisting of subconjunctival carboplatin and&#xD;
           systemic topotecan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the ocular survival of eyes and event-free survival of participants by&#xD;
           strata.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To prospectively analyze intraocular disease tissue for participants with at least one&#xD;
           eye undergoing enucleation in order to identify the mechanism of RB1 bi-allelic&#xD;
           inactivation. Participants may undergo upfront enucleation (due to advanced disease at&#xD;
           diagnosis) or may receive enucleation due to progressive disease during protocol&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be stratified into four main treatment groups, depending on whether&#xD;
      retinoblastoma is present in one or both eyes and disease grouping [early or advanced,&#xD;
      Reese-Ellsworth (R-E) group I-V, and International Classification A-E]. Additionally,&#xD;
      participants will be invited to participate in exploratory research objectives that address&#xD;
      cognitive and functional development of children with retinoblastoma, the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      topotecan in young children, and evaluation of ototoxicity, including genetic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      STRATUM A:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children ≥ or equal to 6 months old at time of enrollment - 8 courses of vincristine and&#xD;
           carboplatin, given at 3-4 week intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infants &lt; 6 months old at time of enrollment - Therapy will consist of six courses of&#xD;
           chemotherapy; three courses of vincristine and carboplatin, given at 3-4 week intervals,&#xD;
           alternating with 3 cycles of vincristine and topotecan, given at 3-4 week intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focal treatments will be administered at the discretion of the treating team. Focal therapies&#xD;
      will include cryotherapy, laser photocoagulation, thermo-therapy and plaque radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STRATUM B:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants without extensive sub-retinal (SR) seeding, treatment will consist of two&#xD;
           up-front courses of vincristine and topotecan, given at 3-4 week intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants without SR seeding: ≥ or equal to partial response after 2 cycles, will&#xD;
           receive three additional courses of vincristine-topotecan (VT) and six courses of&#xD;
           vincristine-carboplatin, given at 3-4 week intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants without SR seeding and &lt; partial response after 2 cycles VT will receive 6&#xD;
           courses of vincristine-carboplatin-etoposide (VCE), given at 3-4 week intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with extensive sub-retinal (SR) seeding will receive two up-front courses&#xD;
           of subconjunctival (also called subtenon or periocular) CARBOplatin and systemic&#xD;
           topotecan, given at 3-4 week intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with SR seeding: &gt; or equal to partial response after 2 cycles will receive&#xD;
           three additional courses of vincristine-topotecan, and six courses of&#xD;
           vincristine-carboplatin, given at 3-4 week intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with SR seeding: &lt; partial response after 2 cycles will receive 6 courses&#xD;
           of VCE, given at 3-4 week intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focal treatments will be administered at the discretion of the treating team. Focal therapies&#xD;
      will include cryotherapy, laser photocoagulation, thermo-therapy and plaque radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STRATUM C:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with unilateral (unifocal or multifocal) advanced (R-E IV-V and IC D-E)&#xD;
      intraocular disease will undergo enucleation. Adjuvant therapy will be based on&#xD;
      histopathology:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  low risk participants: Participants in whom the enucleated eye does not show&#xD;
           extra-retinal disease (see definition of intermediate and high risk below); will not&#xD;
           receive any additional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  intermediate risk participants: Participants in whom the enucleated eye shows presence&#xD;
           of tumor in the anterior chamber, invasion of the ciliary body/iris, massive invasion of&#xD;
           the choroid, and invasion of the optic nerve beyond the lamina cribrosa with concomitant&#xD;
           invasion of the choroid, will receive 4 courses of adjuvant chemotherapy with&#xD;
           vincristine-carboplatin-doxorubicin (VCD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  high risk participants: Participants in whom the enucleated eye shows involvement of the&#xD;
           sclera, or involvement of the optic nerve at the level of the cut-end, will be treated&#xD;
           with 6 courses of chemotherapy, with alternating courses of VCE and VCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High-risk participants with extra-ocular extension (i.e. tumor extending beyond the&#xD;
           sclera/cornea or beyond the cut end of the optic nerve) will be candidates for&#xD;
           external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to the entire orbit, including the optic nerve,&#xD;
           administered after 2 or 3 courses of treatment. Patients with extra-ocular extension may&#xD;
           be considered for enrollment on an alternative therapeutic protocol for metastatic&#xD;
           retinoblastoma (or best clinical management).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STRATUM D:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of participants with bilateral retinoblastoma is often complex; and some&#xD;
      participants will have one eye enucleated upfront due to advanced disease. The decision for&#xD;
      enucleation will be made after thorough consideration by the treating team. The treatment of&#xD;
      the remaining eye will depend on a combination of two factors: a) R-E group of the remaining&#xD;
      eye, and b) Histology of the enucleated eye. Though we have accumulated some information&#xD;
      regarding the use of vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin in the treatment of&#xD;
      intraocular retinoblastoma, it is not considered standard of care. Therefore, participants&#xD;
      with intermediate and high risk features will be treated with 6 courses of vincristine,&#xD;
      carboplatin, and etoposide (VCE). Those participants in whom the enucleated eye shows only&#xD;
      low risk histology will be eligible to proceed with either stratum A or stratum B therapy.&#xD;
      For those receiving stratum B therapy, consideration of periocular carboplatin will be&#xD;
      allowed. External beam or proton beam radiation therapy will be considered for patients with&#xD;
      extra-ocular extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focal treatments will be administered at the discretion of the treating team. Focal therapies&#xD;
      will include cryotherapy, laser photocoagulation, thermo-therapy and plaque radiotherapy.&#xD;
