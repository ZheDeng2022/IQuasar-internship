  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy who present for indwelling right heart catheterization&#xD;
      will be enrolled and randomized to either control or triheptanoin oil for five days.&#xD;
      Hemodynamics will be assess serially.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients with DCM presenting for a right heart catheterization will be enrolled.&#xD;
      All patients will be presenting electively for hemodynamic assessment and will have their PA&#xD;
      catheter left in place after their catheterization as part of their usual care.&#xD;
      Post-procedure, patients will be monitored in the coronary care unit, which is routine for&#xD;
      patients with these catheters. Patients will be approached for potential enrollment in the&#xD;
      study protocol. The goal enrollment for this phase of the protocol is 24 patients (12&#xD;
      participants receiving triheptanoin and 10 receiving placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will randomly be assigned to receive either triheptanoin oil or control treatment&#xD;
      (sugar syrup) four times a day one hour before meals and at night for five days. All patients&#xD;
      will be given a low fat, low simple sugar diet to avoid potential substrate competition from&#xD;
      high serum levels of fats and glucose for the duration of the study procedure. Participants&#xD;
      will be blinded to their treatment assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment arm: The standard dose of triheptanoin oil for adults is 1-2gm/kg/24 hours. For&#xD;
      purposes of this study, we will administer 0.25mg/kg four-times per day. The liquid study&#xD;
      drug will be mixed into sugar-free, low fat yogurt, pudding or nutritional supplement shake,&#xD;
      depending on patient preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control arm: One tablespoon of sugar syrup will be mixed into sugar-free, low fat yogurt,&#xD;
      pudding or nutritional supplement shake four-times per day before meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thermodilution cardiac index and PCWP will be measured from the indwelling PA catheter at&#xD;
      baseline and hourly for the first six hours. During this time, initiation or upward titration&#xD;
      of vasodilator and inotropic mediations will be discouraged although the medications will be&#xD;
      continued in patients previously on these medications. Patients requiring such vasoactive&#xD;
      medications on an urgent basis will have been excluded from study participation (see below).&#xD;
      After the first six hours, measurements will be recorded once a day, 90 minutes following&#xD;
      ingestion of study medication for the four days of treatment, as well as for the following&#xD;
      day off study medication (in order to assess off-treatment hemodynamics). Number and dose of&#xD;
      intravenous vasoactive medications will be recorded daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome of interest is the change in cardiac index over the first 6 hours of the&#xD;
      study period (before initiation of any other vasoactive medications). Pre-and post-cardiac&#xD;
      index will be compared with a paired t-test. With 10 patients per study group, we have 80%&#xD;
      power to detect a clinically significant 20% difference (0.4L/min/m2) in cardiac index&#xD;
      between treatment assignments. Assuming the need for a non-parametric analysis a &quot;standard&quot;&#xD;
      20% increase in sample size will need sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the change in cardiac output and PCWP over the five day study period will be&#xD;
      compared between group assignments (control vs. triheptanoin oil). Either Friedman's test or&#xD;
      ANOVA for repeated measures (depending on satisfaction of the normality assumption) will be&#xD;
      employed to detect serial changes between each treatment. Between-group differences at each&#xD;
      time-point will be assessed by a two-sample t-test or the Wilcoxon signed rank test. We will&#xD;
      also measure off-treatment effects by comparing day 4 (final treatment day) cardiac output&#xD;
      and PCWP with day 6 (one day off treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five (5) cc of blood will be collected into EDTA tubes from the PA catheter at baseline and&#xD;
      hourly for the first six hours of the study. An additional 5cc of blood will be obtained on&#xD;
      day 4 and day 5. Serum will be isolated and stored at -80C until completion of the study. At&#xD;
      that time, the samples will be assayed for metabolic profiles, to include acylcarnitine and&#xD;
      fatty acid metabolites. Prior work has demonstrated significant increases in serum odd-chain&#xD;
      fatty acids, acyl-carnitines and ketones following ingestion.These data will inform on the&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of triheptanoin metabolism in the setting of HF. At baseline and on day 4 a&#xD;
      urine sample will be obtained and assayed for species related to proprionate metabolism.&#xD;
