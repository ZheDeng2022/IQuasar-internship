    <textblock>
      Hispanics are affected by arthritis at a slightly lower age-adjusted rate compared to&#xD;
      non-Hispanic whites and African Americans. However, compared to other groups, Hispanics have&#xD;
      a higher prevalence of arthritis-attributed activity limitations (primarily related to OA),&#xD;
      are less likely to receive hip replacement independent of health care access, and are less&#xD;
      likely to receive knee replacement. The study is conducted to develop and test a telephone&#xD;
      delivered intervention for the management of OA in Hispanic adults. This study is conducted&#xD;
      as a minority supplement to the Patient and Provider Interventions for Managing&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis in Primary Care (PRIMO) NCT01435109 and Pro00022836.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arthritis affects approximately 50 million adults in the United States (US), making it one of&#xD;
      the most common causes of disability in this county. In addition, is associated with&#xD;
      significant physical activity limitations, increased prevalence of obesity, decreased health&#xD;
      related quality of life, and increased health care costs. Hispanics are affected by arthritis&#xD;
      at a slightly lower age-adjusted rate compared to non-Hispanic whites and African Americans.&#xD;
      However, compared to other groups, Hispanics have a higher prevalence of arthritis-attributed&#xD;
      activity limitations (primarily related to OA), are less likely to receive hip replacement&#xD;
      independent of health care access, and are less likely to receive knee replacement. In&#xD;
      addition, there have been very few interventions to improve either medical or behavioral&#xD;
      aspects of OA treatment recommendations among the Hispanic population. The study will&#xD;
      developed and test a culturally appropriate Spanish educational materials and telephone&#xD;
      scripts for the patient- and provider-based interventions and will test the patient and&#xD;
      provider intervention in a group of Adult Hispanics with OA.&#xD;
