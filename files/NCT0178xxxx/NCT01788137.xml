      This is a prospective , open, multicenter, randomized phase III study. The investigators&#xD;
      planed to include 380 untreated high risk T cell lymphoma adults,to random to CHOP and c-ATT&#xD;
      regimen groups after signature the informed consents. The patients will receive safety&#xD;
      assessment every cycles, and efficacy evaluation every 3 cycles. Every-two-months follow up&#xD;

      This is a prospective , open, multicenter, randomized phase III study. We planed to include&#xD;
      380 untreated high risk T cell lymphoma adults,to random to CHOP and c-ATT regimen groups&#xD;
      after signature the informed consents. The patients will receive safety assessment every&#xD;
      cycles, and efficacy evaluation every 3 cycles. Every-two-months follow up will be received&#xD;
      after finishing the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  randomization Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups based on a&#xD;
           computer-generated randomization schedule prepared before the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dosage and administration&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treatment Arm A (CHOP): cyclophosphamide(C), 750mg/m2 for injection on day1;&#xD;
                doxorubicin(H), 50 mg/m 2 for injection on day1; and Vincristine(O), 1.4 mg/ m2 for&#xD;
                injection on day1, prednisone(P) 60 mg/m2 orally on days 1 to 5. The therapy was&#xD;
                repeated every 21 days for a total of 6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treatment Arm B (c-ATT):Alternative 3 regimen to be used&#xD;
                sequentially(CHOPB→IMVP-16→DHAP).The therapy was repeated every 21 days for a total&#xD;
                of 6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      patients with bulky disease or extranodal lesion wil be received radiotherapy after finishing&#xD;
      the chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Criteria for response categories Tumour response will be evaluated according to the&#xD;
                International Workshop to Standardize Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin's&#xD;
                Lymphomas(1998)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Efficacy Criteria Disease-free survival Disease-free survival for patients in CR or&#xD;
                CRu is measured from the first assessment that documents that response to the date&#xD;
                of disease progression or the most recent follow-up visit time. Response rate&#xD;
                Response rate is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve CR/Cru and PR&#xD;
                relative to the total population.Overall survival Overall survival is measured from&#xD;
                entry onto the study until death from any cause, or the most recent follow-up visit&#xD;
                date&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Scheduling of tumour assessments Baseline total tumour burden must be assessed&#xD;
                within a maximum of 21 days before first dose of treatment.Follow-up tumour&#xD;
                evaluations will be performed during the last week of every 3rd cycle. After&#xD;
                finishing the therapies, tumor evaluation will be performed every 3 months in the&#xD;
                first and second years,following every 6 months after 2years. tumour assessments&#xD;
                may be performed by CT/MRI for the internal organs lesion. In case of clinically&#xD;
                measurable superficial lesions, accurate evidence should be performed in the&#xD;
                original records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical Safety Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following, safety, assessments and procedures will be performed according to the schedule&#xD;
      of assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A complete medical history (including demographics, smoking history, cancer/treatment&#xD;
           history) will be performed at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination*&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  heart rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  respiratory rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG Score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infection signs Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) reported according to&#xD;
           NCI-CTC criteria. Patients will be assessed for adverse events at each clinical visit&#xD;
           and as necessary throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Laboratory Safety Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will be completed according to the schedule of assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hæmoglobin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Haematocrit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leucocytes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neutrophils&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Platelets&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum electrolytes ( K+, Ca++)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum chemistries (Total bilirubin, ALT [SGPT], AST [SGOT], total protein, albumin, LDH,&#xD;
           alkaline phosphatase, urea [BUN], serum creatinine, creatinine clearance).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dipstick urinalysis. In case of a significant finding, a microscopic urinalysis should&#xD;
           be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note:Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) reported according to NCI-CTC&#xD;
      criteria(Version 3.0)Patients will be assessed for adverse events at each clinical visit and&#xD;
      as necessary throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up Patients on the study should be reassessed after completion of treatment at a&#xD;
           minimum of every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months until the completion of the&#xD;
           study.assessment content at follow-up visits should include history, physical&#xD;
           examination ,blood picture, Urinalysis,liver and kidney function and tumor assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical analyzes The proposed regimen was to be considered worthy for additional&#xD;
           investigation in this patient population if a disease control rate of 15% or greater.&#xD;
           The total sample size will be about 368 patients (to collect 380 evaluable patients,&#xD;
           considering a drop-out rate of around 10%,each group number: 190). Treatment duration&#xD;
           was defined as days from the first day of drug administration to the last regulated rest&#xD;
           day of the final cycle.,Primary objective is overall survival d. Secondary objectives&#xD;
           are response rate, safety and disease free survival Response rate is estimated using the&#xD;
           binomial probability and exact 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were provided. disease&#xD;
           free survival and overall survival curves are estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events and laboratory tests graded according to the NCI-CTC AE(Version 3).Adverse&#xD;
      events will be assigned preferred terms and categorized into body systems according to the&#xD;
      MEDDRA classification of the WHO terminology&#xD;
