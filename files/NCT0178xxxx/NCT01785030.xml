  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a gas that is normally used to take away pain and anxiety during&#xD;
      painful medical procedures. However, one of its effects is to also make veins appear larger&#xD;
      and more visible. This is useful when there is a patient who needs to have an intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) needle put in their skin to give them medicine or ﬂuids, but may have veins that are&#xD;
      very hard to see or feel. The mechanism of this observed effect is not entirely clear. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to use an ultrasound to directly measure whether there is an actual&#xD;
      change size of veins or change in blood flow in healthy adult volunteers when you give them&#xD;
      50% nitrous oxide, and see whether or not this change in size, or change in flow, is what&#xD;
      causes the changes in visibility or palpability of the vein.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  19 years or older (inclusive)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English speaking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ASA class III or greater;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of, or suspected, difﬁcult airway based on physical exam, facial dysmorphism&#xD;
             or syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition in which air may be trapped in a body cavity. These include, but are not&#xD;
             limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pneumothorax or chest injury, concurrent acute asthma exacerbation, middle ear occlusion,&#xD;
        intestinal obstruction, ileus, or abdominal distension, sinusitis or maxillofacial injuries&#xD;
        with potential for trapped gas, recent intraocular surgery or penetrating globe injury, air&#xD;
        embolus, severe bullous emphysema (consider in patients with cystic ﬁbrosis), history of&#xD;
        craniotomy in previous three weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy (1st and 2nd trimester)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Increased intracranial pressure, impaired level of consciousness, or head injury&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known Vitamin B12 deﬁciency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known MTHFR Deﬁciency (Inborn error of metabolism)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of bleomycin administration (note that the oxygen component of N2O&#xD;
             administration is what interacts with bleomycin to cause pulmonary toxicity)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intoxication with alcohol or other drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition in which patient may be catecholamine-depleted (e.g. septic shock)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent history of altered mental status&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Congestive heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Trainees, including students, residents, and fellows, working in the pediatric&#xD;
             emergency department.&#xD;
