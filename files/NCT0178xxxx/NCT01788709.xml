      Abstract:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colorectal cancer is amongst the leading cancers worldwide. Treatment is greatly dependent on&#xD;
      the stage of illness, with more favorable outcomes associated with early cancers. For this&#xD;
      reason, screening colonoscopies have been increasing, as are efforts to improve the quality&#xD;
      of bowel preparations. The colonoscopy accuracy and safety depend on the quality of colon&#xD;
      cleansing. An inadequately prepped bowel will increase the risk of missing a lesion, prolong&#xD;
      procedure, increase patient discomfort, and eventually increase complication rate. Hence, an&#xD;
      Ideal bowel cleansing solution would quickly and reliably clean the colon while having a good&#xD;
      tolerability and palatability to the patient. Current colonoscopy preparation regimens&#xD;
      require the use of large volume of iso-osmotic PEG-electrolyte solution for adequate&#xD;
      cleansing and are often poorly tolerated by patients. We have shown previously that&#xD;
      mentholyptus drops significantly improved the palatability of PEG-electrolyte (Fortrans®)&#xD;
      solution and the quality of preparation (1). We aim at this study to compare the efficacy of&#xD;
      the above-mentioned prep technique and the reduced volume ascorbic acid-supplemented&#xD;
      PEG-electrolyte (MoviPrep®). This is a randomized controlled trial that will include patients&#xD;
      undergoing elective colonoscopy at the American University of Beirut Medical Center. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomized into one of two study arms using a computer generated randomization list.&#xD;
      100 Patients will be asked to have candy (Halls®) during the whole 2 hours period while&#xD;
      drinking the PEG solution (Fortrans®). Another 100 patients will be asked to take reduced&#xD;
      volume ascorbic acid-supplemented PEG-electrolyte (MoviPrep®). All patients will then be&#xD;
      interviewed by the research coordinator to evaluate the tolerability of the preparation while&#xD;
      taking into account the palatability of the solution as main outcome and the remaining volume&#xD;
      of the PEG solution and side effects as secondary outcomes. Based on the results of a pilot&#xD;
      study, our sample size calculation showed that 100 patients per arm will be enough to attain&#xD;
      significance. As for the statistical analysis, SPSS version 20.0 will be used for data entry&#xD;
      and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I- Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the efficacy of split PEG-electrolyte (Fortrans®) with mentholyptus (Halls®) drops&#xD;
      and the reduced volume ascorbic acid-supplemented PEG-electrolyte (MoviPrep®) in improving&#xD;
      the palatability of solution used in bowel cleansing for colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II- Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The colonoscopy accuracy and safety depend on the quality of colon cleansing. An inadequately&#xD;
      prepped bowel will increase the risk of missing a lesion, prolong procedure, increase patient&#xD;
      discomfort, and eventually increase complication rate. Therefore an excellent colon cleansing&#xD;
      is of extreme importance to the endoscopist and the patient. Hence, An Ideal bowel cleansing&#xD;
      solution would quickly and reliably clean the colon while having a good tolerability and&#xD;
      palatability to the patient. Poor tolerability by the patient would increase the risk of not&#xD;
      finishing the whole solution and hence the risk of having a poor colon cleansing. Many types&#xD;
      of bowel cleansing solutions are currently available in the market. Current colonoscopy&#xD;
      preparation regimens require the use of large volume of iso-osmotic PEG-electrolyte solution&#xD;
      for adequate cleansing and are often poorly tolerated by patients. Therefore, improving the&#xD;
      tolerability of the solution by patients is of critical importance. The main side effects of&#xD;
      bowel cleansing solution are nausea, vomiting, bloating, and cramps. To decrease their&#xD;
      incidence and therefore to improve tolerability, one could either decrease the volume of the&#xD;
      solution or improve its palatability. Many studies have tried to decrease the volume of the&#xD;
      solution below the standard 4 liters. These studies have largely shown that smaller volume&#xD;
      preps are inferior to standard preps. In addition, few studies have shown that improving&#xD;
      palatability by adding a flavor improved patients' acceptance of the solution (2-6).&#xD;
      MoviPrep® is the only liquid PEG bowel cleansing agent that incorporates ascorbic acid in its&#xD;
      formulation, thus contributing to its lemon taste and consequently better patient&#xD;
      tolerability. We have proved earlier this year through a randomized trial a high palatability&#xD;
      of and hence a better quality of preparation (90% Good/Excellent) using the PEG-electrolyte&#xD;
      Fortrans® with sugar-free mentholyptus drops (Halls®) (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim at comparing the colonoscopy preparation quality and the palatability of our technique&#xD;
      and that of the MoviPrep® through a single blinded randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III- Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Split Fortrans® prep with sugar-free mentholyptus drops (Halls®) has a better palatability&#xD;
      and tolerability than the reduced volume ascorbic acid-supplemented PEG-electrolyte&#xD;
      (MoviPrep®) in bowel cleansing for colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV- Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single university based center (American University of Beirut Medical Center)&#xD;
&#xD;
      V- Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective randomized single-blinded study&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI- Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
                ● Elective colonoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Consent to the study&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
                ● Pregnant or lactating women&#xD;
&#xD;
                ● Age less than 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
                ● Significant gastroparesis&#xD;
&#xD;
                ● Gastric outlet obstruction&#xD;
&#xD;
                ● Ileus&#xD;
&#xD;
                ● Known or suspected bowel obstruction or perforation&#xD;
&#xD;
                ● Phenylketonuria&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Severe chronic renal failure (creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/minute)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III&#xD;
                     or IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Dehydration&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Severe acute inflammatory disease&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Compromised swallowing reflex or mental status&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥170 mm Hg, diastolic blood&#xD;
                     pressure ≥100 mm Hg)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Toxic colitis or megacolon&#xD;
&#xD;
                These exclusion criteria are consistent with contraindications of currently&#xD;
                approved bowel preparations; therefore, the results of this study may be&#xD;
                generalized to the entire target population of patients undergoing colonoscopy,&#xD;
                including the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be enrolled by the principal investigator or study coordinator (MD) after&#xD;
           assessing for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients will then be randomized into&#xD;
           one of the two study arms using a pre-set randomization list where patients with an odd&#xD;
           number as the last digit of their medical record will be assigned to the control arm and&#xD;
           patients with an even number will be assigned to the intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
           ● First arm: 4 Liters of PEG solution (FORTRANS®) split into 2 days with sugar-free&#xD;
           mentholyptus drops (2 L at 7-9 pm on the day prior to the colonoscopy with Halls®, and 2&#xD;
           L on the day of the colonoscopy to be completed at least 1.5 hours before the procedure&#xD;
           with Halls®).&#xD;
&#xD;
           ● Second arm: 2 Liters of reduced volume ascorbic acid-supplemented PEG-electrolyte&#xD;
           (MoviPrep®) + 1 Liter of clear fluids of the patients' choice split into 2 days (1 L of&#xD;
           MoviPrep® on the evening of the day prior to the colonoscopy + 500 mL of clear fluids of&#xD;
           the patients choice, and another 1 L of MoviPrep® + 500 mL of clear fluids on the day of&#xD;
           the colonoscopy to be completed at least 1 hour before the procedure.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Instructions to patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients in both arms will be instructed on how they should take the colonoscopy&#xD;
           preparation solution, emphasizing the importance of complete intake of the solution in&#xD;
           order to ensure a safe and effective procedure. In case of noncompliance, the remainder&#xD;
           of the PEG solution shall be brought in by the patient for assessment. They will also be&#xD;
           instructed to have a regular breakfast and lunch meals on the day prior to the&#xD;
           colonoscopy, a full fluid dinner, and to stay NPO except for the colon prep after&#xD;
           midnight till the time of colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assessment of tolerability:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately prior to the colonoscopy, patients from both study arms will be interviewed by&#xD;
      the research coordinator to evaluate tolerability of the preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of preparation: score from 1 to 4&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. 2 3 4 Poor Fair Good Excellent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimated volume remaining of the original PEG solution&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Palatability: score 1 to 5&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. 2 3 4 5 Disgusting Moderately poor taste Slightly poor taste Acceptable Tasty&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the following adverse events:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nausea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bloating&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cramps&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Headache&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General acceptance of the solution&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Willingness to take the preparation again in the future if necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII- Sample size calculation and data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation was conducted based on our previously conducted study that showed a&#xD;
      90% good/excellent prep with Fortrans® + Halls® and the reported results on colonoscopy&#xD;
      preparations using the reduced volume ascorbic acid-supplemented PEG-electrolyte (MoviPrep®)&#xD;
      that range between 65-85% good/excellent (average: 75%) (1)(7-10). Therefore, based on these&#xD;
      results and using an α of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, the sample size required to show&#xD;
      significance was calculated to be 97 patients per arm. Hence, it was decided to recruit 100&#xD;
      patients per arm taking into account possible withdrawals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the statistical analysis, SPSS version 20.0 will be used for data entry and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point is the quality of preparation assessed by the endoscopist (who will be&#xD;
      blind to the preparation technique). Secondary end points will be: palatability, residual&#xD;
      volume, patient assessment of the quality of preparation, willingness to retake the&#xD;
      preparation solution again if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII- Study Interval:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 year starting from the enrollment of the first patient&#xD;
