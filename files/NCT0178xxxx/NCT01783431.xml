  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for subjects with a type of skin cancer called melanoma. The main purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to examine the safety of the study drug (Poly-ICLC) in patients with your&#xD;
      disease. The study team would like to know about any side effects a patient may have when&#xD;
      given the study drug. Another goal of the study is to determine if combining dendritic cells&#xD;
      and the study drug can be possibly used as a vaccine for your disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dendritic cells are cells that are present in your body's immune system that help your body&#xD;
      fight disease. This is a vaccine trial, as your own cells will be extracted (removed),&#xD;
      treated in a lab, then re-administered to your body with the study drug in hopes of creating&#xD;
      an immune response to the disease. It is not guaranteed that your disease burden will be&#xD;
      reduced by participating in this trial.TScreening tests will be conducted to determine&#xD;
      whether or not subjects can participate in this study. If subjects are eligible and choose to&#xD;
      participate, they will have a procedure called leukapheresis. The leukapheresis product that&#xD;
      is collected from you will be taken to a special lab at MUSC where it will undergo a process&#xD;
      that will grow additional dendritic cells under controlled conditions in the lab. These cells&#xD;
      will be given together with Poly-ICLC therapy when you begin study treatment. Some days you&#xD;
      will receive both Poly-ICLC and dendritic cells, but on other days you will receive the&#xD;
      Poly-ICLC by itself. After study treatment, subjects may be asked to return to MUSC&#xD;
      approximately every 3 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months thereafter for follow&#xD;
      up procedures.&#xD;

    <description>Poly-ICLC is considered an investigational drug and has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of your disease. It is currently being tested in clinical trials for brain tumors, lymphoma, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and prostate cancer. It is thought that Poly-ICLC, when used with dendritic cells as a vaccine therapy, may work to help the immune system fight disease.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have any serious uncontrolled acute or chronic medical condition&#xD;
             that would interfere with this treatment. Examples would include active acute or&#xD;
             chronic infection requiring antibiotics, uncontrolled cardiovascular, endocrine, or&#xD;
             infectious disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have significant ongoing cardiac problems, myocardial infarction&#xD;
             within the last six months, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina, uncontrolled&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Surgery less than or equal to 14 days prior to study registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had prior radiation or chemotherapy in which the last treatment&#xD;
