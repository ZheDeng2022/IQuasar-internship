  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent occurrence of significant post-operative liver impairment at Nottingham University&#xD;
      Hospitals NHS Trust has prompted investigation into whether interaction between general&#xD;
      anaesthesia and prone positioning (lying face down) for surgery can influence liver function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historical research has shown that the heart does not function as efficiently when an&#xD;
      anaesthetised patient is placed in the prone position for surgery. The techniques used for&#xD;
      anaesthetising and monitoring these patients have changed remarkably, since these studies&#xD;
      were first performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to know accurately how the heart functions to enable better understanding of&#xD;
      the changes in blood flow to the liver when in the prone position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies looking at blood flow to the liver when lying face down have been done before but are&#xD;
      mainly reporting patients on the intensive care unit. These intensive care patients are&#xD;
      different to those in theatre undergoing routine surgery. The intensive care patients are&#xD;
      usually received in different types of drugs and monitored with several different types of&#xD;
      monitor at the time. Perhaps most importantly is that they are placed face down on a soft air&#xD;
      cushioned mattress and pillows rather than the rigid support used for surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will look at whether the function of the liver changes when a patient is&#xD;
      anaesthetised and is then rolled onto their front. The function of the liver will be measured&#xD;
      by looking how it clears a specific drug from the blood. Also this study will look at how&#xD;
      accurate a particular type of heart monitor is when an anaesthetised patient is placed onto&#xD;
      their front.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Recent occurrence of significant post-operative hepatic dysfunction including two fatalities&#xD;
      at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust has prompted investigation into whether&#xD;
      interaction between general anaesthesia, prone positioning for surgery, cardiac output and&#xD;
      the use of vasoactive drugs can influence hepatic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has shown that cardiac output is decreased when an anaesthetised patient is placed&#xD;
      from the supine to the prone position, and that the magnitude of these changes vary with the&#xD;
      exact method of physical patient support in the prone position.1-3 Anaesthetic technique and&#xD;
      methods of cardiac output monitoring used in these studies are no longer in routine use and&#xD;
      therefore may not accurately reflect current practice of balanced anaesthesia or current&#xD;
      monitoring techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LiDCOplus minimally invasive cardiac output monitor can be used to accurately calculate&#xD;
      cardiac ouput and its associated derived variables (stroke volume and systemic vascular&#xD;
      resistance). The LiDCOplus monitor uses data already available from an arterial cannula which&#xD;
      is routinely used for monitoring patients in these circumstances. It is calibrated by using a&#xD;
      small (0.3mmol) bolus dose of lithium chloride. This technique has been shown to be accurate&#xD;
      and safe even after repeated calibration procedures over a short time period.4-6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much of the evidence with regards to liver blood flow in the anaesthetised patient in prone&#xD;
      position is from the critical care literature. There are several differences between this&#xD;
      group of critically ill patients undergoing prone positioning for rescue therapy from&#xD;
      refractory hypoxia due to acute lung injury and healthy patients undergoing elective surgery&#xD;
      in the prone position. Critically ill patients have multiple cardiovascular and respiratory&#xD;
      co-morbidities, are usually receiving infusions of vasoactive drugs and are generally&#xD;
      positioned on soft air cushioned mattresses and pillows. Prone positioning in these patients&#xD;
      does not seem to significantly alter hepatic function as measured by hepatic Indocyanine&#xD;
      Green (ICG) clearance.7 8&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICG is a fluorescent dye, which can absorb infra-red light with a very rare (1:40 000) side&#xD;
      effect profile. After intravenous injection it is almost exclusively eliminated by hepatic&#xD;
      excretion into bile. The rate of hepatic elimination has been shown to correlate accurately&#xD;
      with plasma disappearance rate as measured by transcutaneous infra-red absorbtion.9 It is a&#xD;
      dynamic marker of hepatic blood flow, hepatocellular function and biliary excretion, with&#xD;
      short term variation thought to be attributable to changes in hepatic blood flow rather than&#xD;
      cellular dysfunction.10&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LiMON monitor uses transcutaneous infra-red light absorption (like a pulse oximeter) to&#xD;
      measure and calculate values for ICG plasma disappearance and its associated values such as&#xD;
      clearance rate and plasma retention rate. The technique involves intravenous injection of a&#xD;
      small (0.25mg/kg) bolus dose of ICG. This can be repeated up to 20 times per 24hr period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is postulated that simultaneously measuring changes in hepatic blood flow and cardiac&#xD;
      output will allow us to gather greater understanding of the haemodynamic changes associated&#xD;
      with the prone position in the anaesthetised patient using current routine monitoring&#xD;
      modalities.&#xD;
