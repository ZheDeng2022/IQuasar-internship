    <textblock>
      This study is prospective randomized trial enrolling at least 50 participants which compares&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of two alternative methods of laparoscopic hiatal repair for giant (i.e.&#xD;
      with hiatal surface area (HSA) exceeding 20 sq.cm) types II and III hiatal hernias: partially&#xD;
      absorbable lightweight mesh repair, and nitinol-framed lightweight polytetrafluoroethylene&#xD;
      (PTFE) mesh repair. In the literature, mean rate of anatomical recurrence of giant hiatal&#xD;
      hernias is 25 %, reaching 42 %. Polypropylene and composite PTFE meshes used most widely,&#xD;
      result in unacceptable rates of long-term dysphagia (10-15 %) and oesophageal strictures. Own&#xD;
      experience of the interventors of more than 400 repairs using partially absorbable&#xD;
      lightweight mesh Ultrapro (Ethicon) and original sub-lay technique of its fixation precluding&#xD;
      contact of the mesh with the oesophagus, showed low recurrence rate for large hernias and a&#xD;
      few cases of long-term dysphagia. For giant hiatal hernias, this technique provides&#xD;
      acceptable results (20 % of recurrence) which correspond to the literature. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      these results may be improved, probably by using of new type of prosthesis. Thus, in&#xD;
      collaboration with Minnesota Medical Development, Inc., USA, the interventors created&#xD;
      fundamentally new method of hiatal repair by using new prosthesis - Rebound HRD-Hiatus&#xD;
      hernia. This prosthesis is heart-shaped lightweight PTFE mesh with peripheral nitinol frame.&#xD;
      It is easily fixated to the crura posteriorly to the oesophagus completely covering hernia&#xD;
      defect, and supports a strong framework of the hiatus, and, therefore, allows to save a&#xD;
      principle a real tension-free repair. Mid-term results (mean follow-up period of 15 months)&#xD;
      of 29 procedures showed no recurrences or oesophageal complications. Naturally, final&#xD;
      conclusions regarding superiority of the new technique could be established by prospective&#xD;
      randomized study. The hypothesis of the current trial is: new method of nitinol-framed&#xD;
      lightweight PTFE mesh repair is more effective in terms of recurrence rate compared to&#xD;
      sub-lay partially absorbable lightweight mesh repair, and is characterized by at least&#xD;
      similar safety in terms of oesophageal complications. The long-term results (24 months post&#xD;
      surgery for every patient) will be studied using symptom questionnaires, quality of life and&#xD;
      satisfaction questionnaires, barium studies, endoscopic examinations, 24-hour pH testing, and&#xD;
      analysis of possible reoperations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Giant hiatal hernias, i.e. hernias with hiatal surface area (HSA), as described by Granderath&#xD;
      et al (2007), exceeding 20 sq.cm, is one of the most challenging problem in minimally&#xD;
      invasive gastrointestinal surgery. On one hand, according to the literature, the rate of&#xD;
      utilization of laparoscopic repair of such hernias does not exceed 80 % [Nguyen et al, 2011].&#xD;
      It means that great proportion of patients is still treated using open approach producing 8 %&#xD;
      of postoperative complications [Nguyen et al, 2011]. Therefore, improvement of laparoscopic&#xD;
      techniques for this disorder is very actual question. On the other hand, the mean rate of&#xD;
      anatomical recurrence following laparoscopic repair of paraoesophageal hernias is 25 % as&#xD;
      reported in a meta-analysis [Rathore et al, 2007]. It reaches 42 % in some centers according&#xD;
      to recent literature reviews [Draaisma et al, 2005; Johnson et al, 2006]. Hence, creation of&#xD;
      new method of hiatal repair diminishing recurrence rate is essential. To interventors'&#xD;
      opinion, this new method must follow at least a principle of tension-free repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the most concerning problem or repair of giant hiatal hernias is anatomical recurrence, a&#xD;
      conception of prosthetic repair was applied for hiatal closure using different types of&#xD;
      meshes. This dramatically decreased recurrence rate as demonstrated by several recent&#xD;
      studies. Namely, Frantzides et al (2002) prospectively compared primary repair with on-lay&#xD;
      PTFE repair and obtained statistically significant decrease of recurrence rate in favor of&#xD;
      mesh arm: 0% versus 22%. Then, Granderath et al (2004) compared primary suturing and on-lay&#xD;
      polypropylene mesh repair in prospective randomized trial; the rate of recurrence was&#xD;
      significantly lower in the mesh arm: 8% versus 26%. Unfortunately, these studies were not&#xD;
      primarily addressed to relation between hernia size and results. Most specialists use mesh&#xD;
      when the diameter of the defect is just greater than 5 cm, based on own experience and&#xD;
      widespread literature data, including studies of Champion et al (1998, 2003). Hiatal surface&#xD;
      area (HSA), first described by Granderath et al (2007), is more sensitive measure than&#xD;
      diameter of hiatal hernia defect, and further trials should focus on it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, SAGES trial reported by Frantzides et al. (2010) showed that polypropylene or PTFE&#xD;
      meshes are characterized by the highest incidence of oesophageal complications although they&#xD;
      demonstrated relatively lower recurrence rates compared to other meshes. According to most of&#xD;
      the literature, mesh-related dysphagia rate is 10-15 % in the long-term follow-up [Granderath&#xD;
      et al, 2005, Targarona et al, 2004]. Interestingly, that composite, i.e. partially absorbable&#xD;
      meshes, occupied middle position in terms of recurrence and complications rates in this study&#xD;
      [Frantzides et al, 2010]. Own experience of the interventors of more than 400 laparoscopic&#xD;
      hiatal repairs using lightweight partially absorbable mesh (Ultrapro, Ethicon) showed minimal&#xD;
      rate of recurrence (4,9 %) and dysphagia (2,1 %) for large (HSA 10-20 sq.cm) hernias [Grubnik&#xD;
      et al, 2011]. The interventors applied this safe technique for giant (HSA &gt; 20 sq.cm) hiatal&#xD;
      hernias, but recurrence rate was 20 % [Grubnik et al, 2011]. This result corresponds to the&#xD;
      literature, but may be improved. The interventors believe, it is possible to minimize&#xD;
      recurrence rate of giant hiatal hernias, but it could be achieved by introduction of&#xD;
      fundamentally new types of prostheses and methods of its fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To remove the risk of mesh-related oesophageal complications of polypropylene or PTFE meshes,&#xD;
      biological prostheses were introduced for hiatal repair. However, prospective randomized&#xD;
      study by Oelschlager et al (2010) demonstrated insignificant difference in recurrence rates&#xD;
      in prosthesis arm compared to primary repair arm (more than 50 %), although no cases of&#xD;
      mesh-related complications were observed in prosthesis arm. Similar data regarding biological&#xD;
      prostheses were retrieved in the study of Frantzides et al (2010). Data from the literature&#xD;
      and international congresses suggest that current biological prostheses cannot be widely used&#xD;
      in the setting of giant hiatal hernias due to high rate of recurrences and their high price.&#xD;
      Thus, based on current literature data, there is insufficient grade 1 evidence for choice of&#xD;
      optimal method of repair of giant hiatal hernias, and the search for the optimal prosthesis&#xD;
      is still ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, a fundamentally new prosthesis for laparoscopic repair of giant hiatal defects was&#xD;
      created. The prototype prosthesis &quot;Rebound HRD-Hiatus hernia&quot; was created by the interventors&#xD;
      in collaboration with U.S. company, Minnesota Medical Development, Inc. This device is made&#xD;
      from high quality lightweight PTFE mesh attached to a heart-shaped nitinol frame with a notch&#xD;
      for oesophagus. Prosthesis may be easily inserted through the trocar using a special tube,&#xD;
      and expanded to its initial form inside the abdomen. The principle and purpose of using of&#xD;
      the device and method of its fixation was patented in Ukraine (patents No. 66397, 66399). The&#xD;
      interventors applied new prosthesis in 29 patients, operated from 2010. All procedures were&#xD;
      successfully completed. Two main principles are used in a new prosthesis. First, mesh is made&#xD;
      of lightweight PTFE minimizing possibility of adhesions and related complications. As a&#xD;
      result, there were no esophageal complications in the cohort. Second, peripheral nitinol&#xD;
      frame of the prosthesis provides real tension-free repair without risk of prolapse between&#xD;
      free, i.e. anterior, margin of the mesh and oesophagus, which other meshes do if fixed to the&#xD;
      borders of the hiatus. As a result, there were no recurrences within mean surveillance of 15&#xD;
      months in this series. Naturally, final conclusions regarding superior efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      the new device could be established by prospective randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the hypothesis of this double-blind prospective randomized trial is: new method of&#xD;
      nitinol-framed lightweight PTFE mesh (Rebound HRD-Hiatus hernia, Minnesota Medical&#xD;
      Development, Inc) repair is more effective in terms of recurrence rate compared to sub-lay&#xD;
      partially absorbable lightweight mesh (Ultrapro, Ethicon, Inc) repair, and is characterized&#xD;
      by at least similar safety in terms of oesophageal complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll at least 50 patients with giant (HSA &gt; 20 sq.cm) types II and III&#xD;
      hiatal hernias. The basic eligibility criteria will be: absence of oesophageal motility&#xD;
      disorders, absence of oesophageal shortening requiring Collis procedure, absence of Barrett's&#xD;
      oesophagus, peptic strictures and other factors that may independently influence the rate of&#xD;
      recurrence and dysphagia/oesophageal strictures. Thus, the only difference between arms will&#xD;
      be method of hiatal closure. To exclude fundoplication-related bias, standard floppy-Nissen&#xD;
      procedure will be performed in every patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient will be operated by single surgical team with an experience of more than 1500&#xD;
      laparoscopic anti-reflux procedures since 1998. The necessary ethic regulations will be saved&#xD;
      including informed consent with the statement that patient is unaware of the method of repair&#xD;
      (double-masked). Every patient will be evaluated preoperatively, 6 months, and 24 months&#xD;
      postoperatively using symptom questionnaires, quality of life and satisfaction&#xD;
      questionnaires, barium studies, endoscopic examinations, 24-hour pH testing, and analysis of&#xD;
      possible reoperations. For issue of efficacy of prosthetic repair, recurrence rate of hernia&#xD;
      and GERD, which are the primary outcome measure, will be studied. For issue of safety of&#xD;
      prosthetic repair, rates of long-term dysphagia/oesophageal strictures/mesh erosions, which&#xD;
      are main secondary outcome measure, will be evaluated.&#xD;
