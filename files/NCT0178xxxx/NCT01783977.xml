      NOTE: This study has stopped enrolling new participants, and all study vaccinations for&#xD;
      currently enrolled participants have been stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are no vaccines approved for the prevention of HIV infection, but there are&#xD;
      many clinical trials taking place that are studying experimental HIV vaccines. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of three different HIV vaccine&#xD;
      schedules in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.&#xD;

      NOTE: This study has stopped enrolling new participants, and all study vaccinations for&#xD;
      currently enrolled participants have been stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the safety and immune response to three different vaccine schedules&#xD;
      of a DNA HIV vaccine (DNA-HIV-PT123) followed by a NYVAC HIV vaccine boost (NYVAC-HIV-PT1 and&#xD;
      NYVAC-HIV-PT4) in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults. Study researchers will also evaluate the&#xD;
      safety of administering the HIV vaccine on a shorter administration schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place in two parts. Participants in Part A of the study will receive the&#xD;
      DNA HIV vaccine on a faster schedule than usual: at Days 0, 14, and 28. At study entry,&#xD;
      participants will undergo a physical examination, HIV risk reduction counseling, and&#xD;
      interviews and questionnaires. Female participants will take a pregnancy test. Study visits&#xD;
      will occur at Days 0, 14, 28, 42, 140, and 224. These study visits will include some of the&#xD;
      same procedures performed at study entry, as well as blood collection, urine collection, and&#xD;
      HIV testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study researchers will evaluate participant data from Part A of the study, and if there are&#xD;
      no safety concerns, they will enroll participants into Part B of the study. Participants in&#xD;
      Part B of the study will be randomly assigned to one of three groups, and within each group,&#xD;
      some participants will be randomly assigned to receive placebo vaccine. Participants will&#xD;
      receive DNA HIV vaccine or placebo on Days 0, 14, and 28 (Group 2); or Days 0 and 28 (Group&#xD;
      3); or Days 0, 28, and 56 (Group 4). The NYVAC HIV vaccine boost will be administered at Day&#xD;
      84 (Groups 2 and 3) or 140 (Group 4). Participants in Part B of the study, in Groups 2 and 3,&#xD;
      will attend study visits at Days 0, 14, 28, 42, 84, 98, 168, and 273. Participants in Part B&#xD;
      in Group 4 will attend study visits at Days 0, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 140, 154, 224, and 334.&#xD;
      Participants in Part B of the study will undergo the same study procedures that occurred in&#xD;
      Part A of the study, with the addition of a cardiac symptoms assessment performed at some&#xD;
      study visits. Participants in Part B who received the NYVAC vaccine or its placebo prior to&#xD;
      study vaccinations being stopped will be contacted by phone or e-mail once a year for 5 years&#xD;
      after they enrolled into the study for follow-up health monitoring.&#xD;

             be less than or equal to 150 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 100 mm Hg&#xD;
             diastolic. For these participants, blood pressure must be less than or equal to 140 mm&#xD;
             Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic at enrollment. If a person&#xD;
             has NOT been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension during screening or&#xD;
             previously, exclude for systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 150 mm Hg at&#xD;

             who, in the investigator's estimation, has a reasonable assurance of sustained cure,&#xD;
