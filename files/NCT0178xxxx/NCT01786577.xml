    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine specific neuroimaging predictors of memory and&#xD;
      executive decline in older adults at various stages after total knee replacement surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment after major cardiac or non-cardiac surgery occurs in a high rate for&#xD;
      older adults. The results of previous studies indicate that certain neuro-imaging markers can&#xD;
      determine which individuals pose a greater risk for memory and thinking changes after&#xD;
      surgery. Based on a pilot study, there is evidence that pre-surgical neuroimaging biomarkers&#xD;
      associate with memory and executive decline after a well controlled surgical procedure (total&#xD;
      knee antroplasty). In this study, researchers will use brain imaging studies to determine&#xD;
      which patients are most likely to be affected by cognitive changes after this type of&#xD;
      surgery. The use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will help investigators identify brain&#xD;
      biomarkers that are associated with cognitive problems, such as white matter abnormalities&#xD;
      and changes to small blood vessels. Patients undergoing total knee replacement surgery, as&#xD;
      well as a group of non-surgery participants of similar age, education and health status,will&#xD;
      receive cognitive testing and MRI brain scans before and after surgery/non-surgery.&#xD;
      Researchers will compare and monitor both groups up to one year after surgery/non-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to enrollment, participants will be asked to review the informed consent and provide&#xD;
      written consent to participate in the study. The enrollment phase will involve in-person&#xD;
      baseline assessment of cognitive functioning within two weeks of the scheduled&#xD;
      surgery/non-surgery in order to rule out exclusion criteria. Testing will be in cooperation&#xD;
      with the University of Florida General Clinical Research Center. Post-baseline MRI will be&#xD;
      conducted on all participants (surgery/control) within 48 hours of the surgery/pseudo-surgery&#xD;
      date to identify acute stroke differences from baseline. Cognitive assessments will be&#xD;
      conducted for each participant at three-weeks, three-months, and one-year after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research is highly significant because it will be the first study to use in-vivo&#xD;
      diffusion imaging methods to examine the contribution of specific presurgical neuroanatomical&#xD;
      vulnerabilities on executive and memory cognitive decline after one of the most common&#xD;
      orthopedic surgeries sought by older adults. Additionally, it will be the first study to&#xD;
      examine how specific neuroimaging biomarkers interact negatively with specific peri-operative&#xD;
      variables including emboli number during surgery, embolic changes to the brain, anesthesia&#xD;
      depth, and cerebral oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings of the study will improve pre-surgery screening procedures for older adults and&#xD;
      assist with the development of peri-operative interventions that will prevent&#xD;
      neurodegenerative disease acceleration.&#xD;
