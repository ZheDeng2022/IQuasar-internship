  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine outcomes (death, myocardial infarction, target&#xD;
      vessel revascularization (TVR), non-target vessel revascularization (non-TVR),&#xD;
      stent-thrombosis) of 120 consecutive patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction and&#xD;
      multivessel coronary artery disease undergoing multivessel stenting or staged percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention with Zotarolimus-eluting stents&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multivessel coronary artery disease has been reported to occur in 40 to 67% of ST elevation&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Multivessel coronary artery disease (MVCD) patients,&#xD;
      who have experienced STEMI, are at a high risk of major cardiovascular events (MACE) within&#xD;
      one year after primary PCI. While MACE incidence in patients with one-vessel coronary artery&#xD;
      disease is about 14.5%, patients with two- and three-vessel lesions experience MACE in 19.5%&#xD;
      and 23.6% of cases, respectively. The risk of death in a 5-year follow-up increases two-fold&#xD;
      in MVCD patients. This risk can be partly explained by slower recovery of left ventricular&#xD;
      function and progression of left ventricular pathological remodeling process after MI. In&#xD;
      addition, the mere presence of MVCD has been shown to be associated with MACE development in&#xD;
      the long-term period. There are several treatment strategies for ST-elevation myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (STEMI) patients with MVCD: infarct related artery (IRA)-only percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention (PCI), multivessel stenting in the primary PCI setting and staged&#xD;
      revascularisation. The current guidelines for STEMI revascularisation give no definite&#xD;
      instructions on the need for concurrent non-IRA intervention in patients with stable&#xD;
      haemodynamics. At present, there are not clinical trials testing the current&#xD;
      Zotarolimus-eluting stents (ZES) in STEMI patients with MVCD undergoing primary PCI for&#xD;
      different strategies of revascularization.&#xD;
