      Objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key objective of this study is to develop new interventions that addresses the diverse&#xD;
      needs and circumstances of Hong Kong adolescents with depressive symptoms in community&#xD;
      settings. Collaboration between medical professionals and social workers may prevent the&#xD;
      occurrence of depression and misguided attempts to self-treat with alcohol and / or drugs in&#xD;
      our adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this intervention gap in the United States, Dr. Van Voorhees, a research&#xD;
      collaborator of Dr. Chim and Dr. Ip, developed and conducted a phase 2 clinical trial of a&#xD;
      primary care internet-based depression prevention intervention (CATCH-IT, Competent Adulthood&#xD;
      Transition with Cognitive Behavioral Humanistic and Interpersonal training). It has been&#xD;
      observed clinically that the strategy could reduce depressed mood, increased social support&#xD;
      and reduced depressive episodes at 12 month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators now propose to study if an adaptation of the CATCH-IT website for Hong Kong&#xD;
      Chinese adolescents may lead to significant reductions in depressed mood. In this pilot&#xD;
      trial, the investigators propose to test the efficacy of the Adapted and Translated version&#xD;
      of CATCH-IT (AT-CATCH) against the placebo approach in preventing the onset of depressive&#xD;
      episodes in a group of adolescents (aged 13-17) who have depressive symptoms, but have not&#xD;
      developed depression yet.The case group will have access to the AT-CATCH website while the&#xD;
      control group will only be allow to use the anti-smoking website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that compared to youth in the control group, youth assigned to&#xD;
      the AT-CATCH group will have a lower hazard ratio of major depressive episodes and decreased&#xD;
      alcohol / drug use frequency over 2 years. Moreover, compared to youth in the control group,&#xD;
      youth in the AT-CATCH program will demonstrate a steeper slope of improved symptoms through&#xD;
      growth curve analysis and fewer depressed days over the study period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although efficacious psychological and pharmacological treatments for adolescent depression&#xD;
      have been demonstrated, any single approach only helps about 50-75% of those treated.&#xD;
      Furthermore, adolescents have low rates of care seeking, and many primary care patients find&#xD;
      group therapy to be the least acceptable treatment for depression. Limited supply of mental&#xD;
      health specialists make face-to-face counseling difficult to implement, hence the internet is&#xD;
      a promising modality for the delivery of preventive interventions. Therefore, prevention of&#xD;
      depression in at-risk adolescents may be more cost-effective and less distressing than&#xD;
      allowing for the depressive symptoms to become more severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key issues - international level:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and National Institute of Mental Health&#xD;
      (NIMH), prevention of mental disorders has become a major health need (9), and a primary care&#xD;
      internet-based depression prevention intervention strategy should be developed. Such care has&#xD;
      already been provided for depression in the U.S. by Dr. Van Voorhees, suggesting the&#xD;
      intervention must:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. have broad reach into at-risk populations;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. work outside of traditional mental health systems;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. use new technologies;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. build on previous clinical trials;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. reduce identified disorders/enhance functional outcomes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. include families; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. be personalized&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key issues - local level Developing new interventions that incorporate the diverse needs and&#xD;
      circumstances of Hong Kong adolescents with depressive symptoms in community settings is our&#xD;
      key strategic objective. While it is ideal to have a series of primary care physician&#xD;
      consultations for at-risk adolescents, this is not available and too expensive for the lower&#xD;
      socioeconomic class. This lack is apparent in both the East and the West. The U.S. has built&#xD;
      up a new cost-effective prevention strategy for depression in primary care system; however,&#xD;
      such a strategy may not be able to be incorporated into the public health sector. Hence, the&#xD;
      collaboration between physicians and social workers will be used for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      138 adolescent participants (ages 13 to 21) who experience a moderately elevated level of&#xD;
      depressive symptoms on the CES-D scale (score 16-34) will be recruited to join the study.&#xD;
      Participants may or may not have had a past history of depression, anxiety and/or substance&#xD;
      abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures to compare between 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) depressive episodes and symptoms Assessment of adolescent depression by the Centre of&#xD;
      Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS)&#xD;
      are a standard diagnostic test for assessment of adolescent's depression. The scores of both&#xD;
      groups would be measured and compared in 3 follow-ups to study the effect and its&#xD;
      sustainability of the website intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii) use of alcohol and drugs Assessment of drinking and drug use behavior of adolescents by&#xD;
      CRAFFT Screening Test, which includes questions regarding alcohol and drug use situations in&#xD;
      the past 12 months, and additional assessment for those who show a significant problem. There&#xD;
      are 6 questions covering road safety, drug-use habits, and influences of using drugs or&#xD;
      alcohol.&#xD;
