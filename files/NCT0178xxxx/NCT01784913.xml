    <textblock>
      In this study, up to 21 patients with metastatic prostate cancer will receive UV1 (a&#xD;
      therapeutic synthetic peptide vaccine) at different dose levels. The safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of UV1 as well as immunological response will be assessed. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      select a biological dose of peptides for further clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main treatment period is completed and reported. Follow-up ongoing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open labeled dose-escalating phase I/IIa study of UV1 peptide vaccination in&#xD;
      patients with androgen-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer. Patients will be prospectively&#xD;
      enrolled in this study if diagnosis of adenocarcinoma only has been histologically confirmed&#xD;
      and they are eligible for (or have already started up to 6 months prior to inclusion)&#xD;
      standard GnRH-agonist first line androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) combined with&#xD;
      anti-androgen to achieve complete androgen blockade (CAB). UV1 vaccinations will be applied&#xD;
      simultaneously with CAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When indicated, patients may receive concomitant radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following 2-step design will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conventional dose escalation with at least 3 patients per dose level (3 selected dose&#xD;
           levels).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Expansion of each dose level to a total of 7 patients for assessment of immune response&#xD;
           levels&#xD;
&#xD;
      13 UV1 vaccinations will be given during the first 6 months (week 26) of treatment, unless&#xD;
      clinical deterioration or unacceptable toxicity is encountered. GM-CSF (Leukine ®) will be&#xD;
      administered locally 10-15 minutes before each UV1 vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hormone naïve patients will receive standard complete androgen blockade by GnRH-agonist (3&#xD;
      months depot formulation sc.) and bicalutamide 50 mg orally per day (CAB). Patients already&#xD;
      on GnRH-agonist therapy will continue with their initial treatment with addition of&#xD;
      bicalutamide 50 mg orally per day.&#xD;
