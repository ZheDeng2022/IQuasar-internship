      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 when&#xD;
      given together with pemetrexed disodium in treating patients with previously treated stage IV&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer. Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      pemetrexed disodium, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cell, either by&#xD;
      killing the cells or stopping them from dividing. Giving Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 together with&#xD;
      pemetrexed disodium may kill more tumor cells&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of AUY922 (Hsp90 inhibitor&#xD;
      AUY922) when given with pemetrexed (pemetrexed disodium) 500 mg/m^2 in participants with&#xD;
      previously-treated stage IV non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the objective tumor response rate as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria in participants with previously treated non-squamous NSCLC&#xD;
      treated with pemetrexed and AUY922.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of pemetrexed and AUY922. III. Evaluate toxicity,&#xD;
      including visual toxicity, in participants treated with AUY922 and pemetrexed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Analyze tumor-tissue biomarkers for potential correlation with response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes weekly and&#xD;
      pemetrexed disodium IV over 15 minutes every 3 weeks. Courses repeat every 21 days for 6&#xD;
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;
