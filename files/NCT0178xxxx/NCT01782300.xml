      Dengue viruses can cause dengue fever and other more severe forms of disease. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and immune response to two doses of a dengue virus vaccine given 12&#xD;
      months apart in healthy adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dengue viruses are a major health concern, particularly in the tropical and subtropical&#xD;
      regions of the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) has made the development of a&#xD;
      dengue vaccine a top priority. There are four types of dengue viruses (DEN1, DEN2, DEN3, and&#xD;
      DEN4), each of which can cause various illnesses, including dengue fever, or the more severe&#xD;
      disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever/shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and immune response to two doses of a dengue virus vaccine (TV003) when administered&#xD;
      12 months apart in healthy adults. The study will also evaluate whether the candidate vaccine&#xD;
      may protect against all four types of dengue viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the TV003 study vaccine or placebo vaccine.&#xD;
      At study entry, participants will undergo a blood collection and physical examination, and&#xD;
      female participants will take a pregnancy test. Participants will then receive an injection&#xD;
      of their assigned vaccine. They will take their temperature three times a day for 16 days&#xD;
      after each vaccination and record the results on a diary card, which research staff will&#xD;
      review during participants' study visits. Additional study visits will occur on Days 3, 10,&#xD;
      14, 21, 28, 56, 90, 180, 270, and 330. All study visits will include blood collection and a&#xD;
      physical examination; select visits will include a pregnancy test for female participants. At&#xD;
      a study visit on Day 360, all participants will receive an injection of the same vaccine they&#xD;
      received at study entry. Additional study visits will occur on Days 363, 370, 374, 381, 388,&#xD;
      416, 450, and 540, and will include the same study procedures as previously performed.&#xD;
