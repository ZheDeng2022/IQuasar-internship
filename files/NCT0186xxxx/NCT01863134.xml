      1. INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
           Through last couple of years the number of patients treated for acute coronary event&#xD;
           without persistent ST segment elevation in ECG has been growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is probably an effect of improving diagnostics of myocardial infraction without&#xD;
           persistent ST segment elevation in ECG, due to routine Troponin serum level evaluation&#xD;
           and better primary prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This fact makes the search for the optimal treatment for patients with acute coronary&#xD;
           event without persistent ST segment elevation in ECG, including both patients intended&#xD;
           for pharmacological and invasive treatment percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or&#xD;
           coronary artery byppass grafting (CABG).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients undergoing invasive treatment for acute coronary event, have higher risk rate,&#xD;
           than those with stabile angina pectoris.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The authors of this study want to evaluate, whether the proportional use of platelet GP&#xD;
           IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist - eptifibatide in patients undergoing CABG results in&#xD;
           improvement of short-, and long time results in those patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Eptifibatide ( Integrilin) a cyclic heptapeptide antagonist of the GP IIb/IIIa integrin&#xD;
           receptor, is an intravenous antagonist with rapid onset and short half-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STUDY RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The notion acute coronary syndrome (ACS) includes several clinical situations, such a&#xD;
      unstable coronary artery disease, non-Q wave myocardial infarction and Q wave myocardial&#xD;
      infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of 12-lead ECG, patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) can be divided into&#xD;
      two groups: with and without ST segment elevation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another stratification factor in patients with ACS, especially these without ST elevation is&#xD;
      evaluation of biochemical markers of myocardial necrosis, such as Troponins (TnI, TnT) and&#xD;
      creatinine kinase isoenzymes (CK-MB). Serum concentrations of these markers allow to&#xD;
      distinguish myocardial infarction (elevation of markers' concentration) from unstable&#xD;
      coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ACS have common etiopathogenesis which is plaque rupture, thrombus formation in the lumen&#xD;
      of coronary artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelets are the key factor in this process. Platelets by means of their collagen and von&#xD;
      Willebrand factor glycoprotein receptors bind to damaged artery wall. Simultaneously many&#xD;
      factors cause platelet activation, which leads to changes in their shape, release of&#xD;
      intraplatelet components and activation of fibrinogen-binding glycoprotein receptors IIb/IIIa&#xD;
      (GP IIb/IIIa). Activated form of GP IIb/IIIa binds to GP IIb/IIIa of another platelet by&#xD;
      means of fibrinogen molecule. Fibrinogen molecules form stable bridges between platelets.&#xD;
      This process is referred to as aggregation, and leads to clot formation, which is further&#xD;
      stabilized by fibrine fibres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this way the intravascular thrombus is formed, which after totally occluding the arterial&#xD;
      lumen causes acute ischemia of the relevant region of myocardium and subsequently its&#xD;
      infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key role of GP IIa/IIIb in the process of platelet clot formation has important&#xD;
      therapeutic consequences. By now several specific (direct) and non-specific (indirect)&#xD;
      antagonists of GP IIb/IIIa have been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are indirect antagonists as acetylsalicylic acid, ticlopidine and clopidogrel and&#xD;
      direct antagonists as abciximab, tirofiban and eptifibatide Additionally also anticoagulants&#xD;
      (heparin, LMWH - low molecular weight heparin) have antiplatelet properties by inhibiting&#xD;
      thrombin production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical studies performed all over the world have proven the efficacy and safety of three&#xD;
      agents from the GP Iia/IIIb group: abciximab, tirofiban and eptifibatide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In several big clinical studies (EPIC, EPILOG, EPISTENT, ESPRIT, CAPTURE, PURSUIT,&#xD;
      PRISM-PLUS, TACTICS-TIMI 18) the high efficacy of these drugs was showed in patients with ACS&#xD;
      without ST segment elevation undergoing mainly percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography&#xD;
      (PTCA) and stenting. The use of GP IIa/IIIb antagonists in this group of patients&#xD;
      significantly reduces the death and myocardial infarction (MI) rate during early as well as&#xD;
      late follow-up period. Moreover, last observations indicate, that the biggest benefit from&#xD;
      such therapeutic strategy is observed in high risk patients; those with diabetes, high&#xD;
      troponin levels and ECG changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During last years, there is an increase in frequency of ACS without ST segment elevation.&#xD;
      This is probably due to improved diagnostics of MI without ST elevation basing on routine&#xD;
      troponin evaluation, but also thanks to better primary prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore determining an optimal therapeutic strategy for patients with ACS without ST&#xD;
      segment elevation remains a crucial issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It concerns patients qualified to medical treatment as well as those qualified to invasive&#xD;
      procedures (PTCA or CABG).&#xD;
