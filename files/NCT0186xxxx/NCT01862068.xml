    <textblock>
      Anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis are rare diseases&#xD;
      characterized by inflammation of blood vessels. Among the numerous cell types that play a&#xD;
      role in vasculitis, one of the key actors is the neutrophil. Neutrophils are equipped with&#xD;
      very powerful molecules that they use to destroy the invading microbes. Therefore, the&#xD;
      mechanisms controlling neutrophil activation should be tightly controlled. If that is not the&#xD;
      case, neutrophils may destroy the tissues of the host. This is what happens during chronic&#xD;
      inflammation in vasculitis. Autoantibodies directed against neutrophils, ANCA, produced thus&#xD;
      demonstrating that neutrophils are also targets of the immune system in these diseases. In&#xD;
      addition, molecular studies provided evidence that genes normally silenced in mature&#xD;
      neutrophils under normal conditions can be re-expressed in neutrophils from patients with&#xD;
      ANCA-associated vasculitis thus strongly suggesting a profound deregulation of neutrophil&#xD;
      functions in these conditions. Notably, the investigators have preliminary data showing that&#xD;
      neutrophils from patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, formerly Wegener's&#xD;
      granulomatosis), an ANCA-associated vasculitis, interfere with the normal phase of resolution&#xD;
      of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the investigators' study is to understand the mechanisms underlying this&#xD;
      increased activation state and determine if neutrophils could be used to define prognostic&#xD;
      markers by clinicians to optimize patients' care. Therefore, the investigators plan to study&#xD;
      the expression of proteins implicated in GPA pathophysiology at the membrane of neutrophils&#xD;
      when they undergo apoptosis. The investigators will also study the deregulation of protein&#xD;
      expression in neutrophils. This point will be the molecular translation of neutrophil&#xD;
      deregulation. This technique is powerful and well adapted to identify by mass spectrometry&#xD;
      the proteins that will be differentially expressed between the control and the disease state.&#xD;
      After identification of proteins differentially expressed in patients with GPA, the&#xD;
      investigators will further investigate whether their expression is modulated during the&#xD;
      disease course and/or modified by the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that understanding these neutrophil perturbations can lead to&#xD;
      better monitoring of disease activity. Ultimately, the investigators may propose more&#xD;
      targeted anti-inflammatory therapies which would be better tolerated by patients. the&#xD;
      investigators also can identify new markers for disease activity which allow clinicians to&#xD;
      define a better therapeutic strategy.&#xD;

      A - Specific Aims General aim: This project is designed to study physiopathological&#xD;
      mechanisms involved in GPA at the cellular and molecular level. the investigators want to&#xD;
      study neutrophils as prognostic factors and determine the implication of PR3, the major&#xD;
      autoantigen in the resolution phase of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators' working hypothesis is that structural and functional analysis of PR3 in&#xD;
      neutrophils will help the investigators to unravel its role in GPA. Hence, our long-term&#xD;
      objective is to better understand the mechanisms involved in the modulation of PR3 expression&#xD;
      at the membrane of neutrophils in order to inhibit their activation and propose novel&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies adapted to GPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Present project: The investigators recently demonstrated that in human neutrophils i) PR3 can&#xD;
      be expressed at the membrane of neutrophils during apoptosis in the absence of degranulation,&#xD;
      ii) PR3 is a member of a molecular scaffold comprising phospholipidscramblase1 (scramblase)&#xD;
      and calreticulin externalized during apoptosis, iii) apoptosis-induced PR3 membrane&#xD;
      expression impairs macrophage reprogramming after phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils The&#xD;
      investigators' hypothesis is that PR3 might have specific molecular partners which can&#xD;
      facilitate its externalization and/or its persistence at the plasma membrane during&#xD;
      neutrophil apoptosis thus potentiating its auto-antigenic capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Characterization of apoptosis in neutrophils from GPA patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analysis of PR3 partners (CD16, CD11b, Calreticulin, Phospholipidscramblase1) or&#xD;
           co-expressed protein of interest in inflammation (AnnexinA1,) expression in neutrophils&#xD;
           from patients with GPA compared to healthy controls&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identification of new partners of PR3 in neutrophils&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Analysis of the proteome of neutrophils from GPA patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Background and Significance 1.1. Introduction GPA is a systemic vasculitis which is mainly&#xD;
      associated with anti-PR3 ANCA. The role of activated neutrophils in vasculitis lesions is&#xD;
      suggested by their presence in perivascular infiltrates, especially in kidney glomeruli and&#xD;
      in the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PR3 is a serine protease first described within azurophilic granules of neutrophils which are&#xD;
      NOT supposed to fuse with the plasma membrane but are released within the phagolysosome after&#xD;
      phagocytosis of the pathogen. We have shown for the first time that the subcellular&#xD;
      localization of PR3 was not restricted to azurophilic granules, as previously thought, but&#xD;
      that PR3 was localized in secretory vesicles, a highly mobilizable compartment, thus&#xD;
      explaining the presence of PR3 at the surface of resting isolated neutrophils. Moreover, a&#xD;
      high percentage of neutrophils expressing PR3 observed in vasculitis patients could be&#xD;
      considered as a risk factor for vasculitis. This high expression of membrane PR3 in patients&#xD;
      with GPA resulted in an increase in ANCA-induced respiratory burst in neutrophils thus&#xD;
      enhancing the inflammatory process. In vitro the binding of ANCA to PR3 trigger the&#xD;
      respiratory burst, degranulation and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because PR3 membrane expression is an important pathophysiological event in GPA since it is a&#xD;
      prerequisite for the subsequent activation of neutrophils by ANCA, we sought to determine&#xD;
      mechanisms involved in PR3 membrane expression. In neutrophils, we demonstrated that&#xD;
      apoptosis triggered a significantly increased membrane PR3 expression without degranulation.&#xD;
      In these experiments, we failed to detect MPO at the membrane of neutrophils. Our results&#xD;
      differ from previously reported data showing that both MPO and PR3 were externalized during&#xD;
      apoptosis because of the translocation of azurophilic granules to the plasma membrane. This&#xD;
      phenomenon seems to occur when neutrophils undergo late apoptosis and secondary necrosis,&#xD;
      leading to expression of all granule proteins on the cell surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apoptosis-induced PR3 externalization could be of great relevance in the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      GPA because PR3, which was supposed to be an intracellular antigen, is thus exposed at the&#xD;
      plasma membrane of apoptotic cells thus amplifying its pro-inflammatory potential, its&#xD;
      immunogenic properties and interfering with macrophage phagocytosis. We have also&#xD;
      demonstrated that during apoptosis PR3 expression is associated with the expression of&#xD;
      calreticulin, a well-known &quot;eat-me signal&quot;. We have finally evidenced that the presence of&#xD;
      PR3 impairs the reprogramming of macrophage to an anti-inflammatory profile after&#xD;
      phagocytosis of apoptotic cells through the CRT/LRP pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It can be hypothesized that the expression of the complex PR3/scramblase/CRT and other&#xD;
      partners (CD11b, CD16) at the surface of apoptotic neutrophils could constitute good&#xD;
      prognosis markers.. Gene array studies have pointed out a deregulation of neutrophils in GPA.&#xD;
      We make the hypothesis that the proteome of neutrophils of GPA patients would be very&#xD;
      informative of its activation state, survival state and that it could be a biological marker&#xD;
      of clinical severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is thus pertinent to study the deregulation of neutrophils during their all life cycle:&#xD;
      their oxidative burst under activation, their physiologic apoptosis, the expression of PR3&#xD;
      partners. This study will be performed in neutrophils from patients with GPA compared to age&#xD;
      and sex adjusted healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Preliminary studies Analysis of apoptosis in neutrophils from GPA patients In the&#xD;
      literature, neutrophils from patients with ANCA associated vasculitis (AAV) were found to&#xD;
      have a disturbed TNFα-induced apoptosis and tends to have a higher rate of apoptosis than&#xD;
      controls. However, published data on physiologic apoptosis which is the spontaneous apoptosis&#xD;
      that neutrophils undergo in the absence of exogenous stimuli is contradictory. When calf&#xD;
      foetal serum is added in medium, neutrophils from GPA patients display a similar apoptosis&#xD;
      rate than controls. When the serum of patients is used, neutrophils from AAV patients in&#xD;
      remission have a higher survival rate in vivo than controls, and this difference disappear&#xD;
      when normal serum is used. These results are in agreement with the discovery that GPA&#xD;
      patients have a high expression of PCNA which is associated with survival. Therefore, we want&#xD;
      to study the apoptosis rate of neutrophils in GPA at diagnosis, during relapse and after&#xD;
      remission on whole blood. These results will be compared to age and sex matched controls.&#xD;
      Apoptosis will be evaluated by the phosphatidylserine externalization measured by flow&#xD;
      cytometry after annexin-V labelling and 7-AAD staining on CD15+ cells. PCNA expression will&#xD;
      be also investigated at the different clinical stage and proteomic profile of apoptotic&#xD;
      neutrophils will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of scramblase/ Calreticulin expression in neutrophils from GPA patients In a&#xD;
      cellular model (RBL cell line), we have demonstrated that scramblase extinction by shRNA was&#xD;
      associated with a decreased expression of phosphatidylserine during apoptosis and that PR3&#xD;
      apoptosis induced expression was also impaired (unpublished data). We were also able to&#xD;
      demonstrate that in vitro scramblase and PR3 physically interact. During apoptosis, PR3 is&#xD;
      also associated with calreticulin at the membrane of neutrophils. These data suggest that the&#xD;
      association PR3/Scramblase/Calreticulin form a molecular scaffold which is a functional&#xD;
      platform which could interfere with recognition pathways (like CRT/LRP) between macrophages&#xD;
      and apoptotic neutrophils. The expression of these partners at the neutrophil membrane during&#xD;
      apoptosis will be investigated in patients at diagnosis and when remission is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Characterization of apoptosis in neutrophils from GPA patients We will determine&#xD;
           apoptosis rate of neutrophils in whole blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Research will be performed both on neutrophils isolated from healthy control donors&#xD;
           obtained in the French Blood Institute (Etablissement Français du Sang) and from&#xD;
           vasculitis patients from the Department of Internal Medicine of Cochin Hospital headed&#xD;
           by Professor Loïc Guillevin.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Apoptosis will be induced &quot;physiologicaly&quot; in whole blood by overnight incubation at&#xD;
           37°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Phosphatidylserine externalization will be measured by flow cytometry after annexin-V&#xD;
           labeling associated with 7-AAD staining for CD15+ cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Western blot analysis using a specific antibody against PCNA will also be used to&#xD;
           visualize its expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analysis of scramblase, PR3, calreticulin, AnnexinA1, expression in apoptotic&#xD;
           neutrophils from GPA patients We will determine the membrane expression of PR3, CRT,&#xD;
           PLSCR, AxA1, in apoptotic neutrophils in the different subsets of neutrophils: non&#xD;
           apoptotic ones (AnnexinV-, 7AAD-), early apoptotic neutrophils (AnnexinV+, 7AAD-) and&#xD;
           late apoptotic neutrophils (AnnexinV+, 7AAD+). This determination will be done for&#xD;
           patients at the time of diagnosis (in active state; BVAS&gt;3) and at remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Neutrophils will be isolated from blood using Dextran gradient and Ficoll.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Investigation of PR3, CRT, PLSCR, AxA1, membrane expression will be measured on&#xD;
                isolated neutrophils by flow cytometry after overnight incubation at 37°C with&#xD;
                assessment of apoptosis by annexin-V labeling and 7AAD staining.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study of the respiratory burst in neutrophils of GPA patients One of the main functions&#xD;
           of neutrophils is the production of reactive oxygen species, we will determine the&#xD;
           oxidative metabolism of neutrophils due to different stimuli (f-MLP, opsonized zymosan&#xD;
           beads by complement, opsonized zymosan beads by IgG, PMA) with or without a previous&#xD;
           priming by TNFα.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exploration of the respiratory burst will be done in whole blood with a chemoluminescent&#xD;
           (luminol) technique. Neutrophils will be primed by TNFα or stimulated without priming.&#xD;
           The burst response will be analysed during 90 minutes after stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Deregulation of neutrophil Cytokinome Neutrophils are capable to synthetize a large&#xD;
           number of cytokines (IL-1, TNFα, IL-6, IL-12), growth factors like GM-CSF and&#xD;
           chimiokines like IL-8. More recently it has been shown that neutrophils are also great&#xD;
           producers of BAFF (B-cell activating factor) and that production is superior to those by&#xD;
           monocytes or dendritic cells when stimulated by INF-γ. In GPA serum BAFF levels have&#xD;
           been shown to be higher than controls and recently targeting B-lymphocytes therapeutics&#xD;
           have confirmed in large controlled trials their importance in AAV.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Serum of patients will be collected at the same time than neutrophils. They will be&#xD;
           analyzed using BD™ Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) with detection of IL-8, IL-1β, IL-6,&#xD;
           IL-10, TNF, and IL-12p70. Neutrophils which will be isolated as in 1) will be stimulated&#xD;
           by INF-γ, LPS and G-CSF to analyze their production and secretion of BAFF/BlyS&#xD;
           determined by ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Deregulation of neutrophil Proteome and functional study of new PR3 partners Gene array&#xD;
           studies have shown a probable deregulation of neutrophils in AAV, in this study we will&#xD;
           study this deregulation at the protein level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the proteome of GPA patient when active and in remission compared to healthy&#xD;
      controls we will use a differential in gel electrophoresis of cytosolic samples of&#xD;
      neutrophils obtained by sonication. Identification of proteins of interest will be done by&#xD;
      mass spectrometry MALDI-TOF-TOF. Functional validation of these proteins by over-expression&#xD;
      or siRNA extinction will be performed.&#xD;
