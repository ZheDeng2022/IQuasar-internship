      Adoption, twin and family studies have reported that obesity has a strong heritable component&#xD;
      and in particular, it has been suggested that BMI in adults is due to genetic influence&#xD;
      rather than shared family environment. Binge eating in obese patients was described.&#xD;
      Therefore, it has been proposed that binge eating disorder (BED) may contribute to obesity in&#xD;
      some individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological studies reported that topiramate plays an important role in the treatment of&#xD;
      binge eating disorder. It has been observed improvement of co-occurring binge eating disorder&#xD;
      in patients receiving topiramate for treatment of mood disorders. In addition, topiramate was&#xD;
      associated with anorexia and weight loss in clinical trials with epilepsy patients. Also,&#xD;
      topiramate has been demonstrated efficacy in pilot and controlled studies for binge eating&#xD;
      disorder (BED) associated with obesity. Genetic studies will be important to elucidate the&#xD;
      mechanism by which putative susceptibility variation in candidate genes influences in&#xD;
      pharmacological improvement of binge eating disorder in obese patients treated with&#xD;
      topiramate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Connecting drug response with relevant functional DNA variants and differences in brain&#xD;
      regions represents the ultimate goal for pharmacogenetic research playing an important role&#xD;
      in advancing this understanding. The use of brain imaging combined with genetics can aid in&#xD;
      understanding the pathophysiological mechanism of the disease. Additionally, brain imaging&#xD;
      has the ability to bridge between preclinical research and human pharmacological studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a naturalistic clinical study designed to analyze the effect of genetic variants&#xD;
      and neurofunctional brain areas associated with food craving in patients with obesity and&#xD;
      binge eating disorder responders to topiramate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The use of topiramate in obese subjects with binge eating disorder is associated&#xD;
      with a differential gene variants and different activation brain areas in subjects that&#xD;
      showed a reduction of food craving and weight lost.&#xD;

      Obesity has been declared the number one illness of the 21st Century in industrialized&#xD;
      countries, and is reaching epidemic proportions. Adoption, twin and family studies have&#xD;
      reported that obesity has a strong heritable component and in particular, it has been&#xD;
      suggested that BMI in adults is due to genetic influence rather than shared family&#xD;
      environment. Binge eating in obese patients was escribed. Therefore, it has been proposed&#xD;
      that binge eating disorder (BED) may contribute to obesity in some individuals. Subjects with&#xD;
      BED are frequently obese. Conversely, BED is often observed in obese populations, especially&#xD;
      the severely obese. Therefore, these findings suggest that BED is a major public health&#xD;
      problem and a contributor to the obesity epidemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence from twin studies suggests a significant contribution of genetic factor in binge&#xD;
      eating. Interestingly, it was reported that relatives of patients with BED displayed a higher&#xD;
      prevalence of obesity, particularly of severe obesity than relatives of probands without BED.&#xD;
      Adoption and twin studies have consistently shown that, regardless of the population studied,&#xD;
      genetic factors play an important role in determining the risk of developing binge eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological studies reported that topiramate plays an important role in the treatment of&#xD;
      binge eating disorder. It has been observed improvement of co-occurring binge eating disorder&#xD;
      in patients receiving topiramate for treatment of mood disorder. In addition, topiramate was&#xD;
      associated with anorexia and weight loss in clinical trials with epilepsy patients. Also,&#xD;
      topiramate has been demonstrated efficacy in pilot and controlled studies for binge eating&#xD;
      disorder (BED) associated with obesity. A paper review showed that topiramate weigtht loss&#xD;
      was reported in 21 of 32 studies analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, it was approved on 4/6/2012 the use of topiramate in combination with phentermine&#xD;
      (QNEXA) in the Meeting of the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee of the&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration, as an adjunct to diet and exercise for weight management in&#xD;
      patients with a body mass index (BMI) equal to or greater than 30 kilograms (kg) per square&#xD;
      meter or a BMI equal to or greater than 27 kg per square meter if accompanied by&#xD;
      weight-related co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, animal studies have shown that stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus by glutamate&#xD;
      and glutamate agonists, including kainite/AMPA agonists, causes an intense, rapid,&#xD;
      dose-dependent increase in food intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topiramate weight loss was reported in 21 of the 32 studies analysed and reached 5% reduction&#xD;
      of the baseline weight prior treatment in 5 studies. Among the studies analyzed, a frequent&#xD;
      finding was that the grater weight loss was associated with higher BMI at baseline. Also,&#xD;
      diabetic patients were related with glycemic control and normalization of blood pressure in&#xD;
      hypertensive subjects. Topiramate was generally well tolerated and serious adverse events&#xD;
      were rare. Also, the use of topiramate was reported effective for weight reduction and&#xD;
      improvement in glycemic control in obese subject with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin&#xD;
      monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topiramate, which is approved for use in epilepsy and migraine prophylaxis, has multiple&#xD;
      sites of action that might contribute to its neurostabilizing effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of action of topiramate in BED is unknown. It may act as an appetite&#xD;
      suppressant or satiety enhancer or somehow influence the reward system acting on appetite,&#xD;
      and thereby reduce binge eating. Topiramate has not been shown to affect serotoninergic&#xD;
      neurotransmission. Indeed, it has been shown to attenuate nicotine-induced increases in&#xD;
      mesolimbic extracellular dopamine and norepinephrine, but not serotonin, release.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, topiramate antagonizes glutamate receptors. Since glutamate and glutamate&#xD;
      agonists rapidly elicit intense eating when injected into the lateral hypothalamus of rats,&#xD;
      topiramate might reduce binge eating through glutamate antagonism. However, the mechanism of&#xD;
      action of topiramate is unknown. Therefore, it is very important pharmacogenetic and&#xD;
      neurofunctional brain studies that could help to elucidate the role of topiramate such as a&#xD;
      new treatment for binge eating disorder associated with obesity in Mexican population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic studies will be important to elucidate the mechanism by which putative susceptibility&#xD;
      variation in candidate genes influences in pharmacological improvement of binge eating&#xD;
      disorder in obese patients treated with topiramate. DNA variants in coding and regulatory&#xD;
      regions of genes will be both useful for systematic genome scans, for identifying genes&#xD;
      associated with drug response, and for examining integrated systems of gene pathways as an&#xD;
      important step on the route to functional genomics. Initiatives focused on identification of&#xD;
      gene variants would greatly facilitate postgenomic research on the links between genes,&#xD;
      brain, behavior, and treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many drug targets (e.g., receptors, transporters, enzymes) that contribute to the&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of drug response are not only key players in the regulation of&#xD;
      neurotransmitter systems but also directly or indirectly modify the development and&#xD;
      plasticity of neural networks involved in drug effects. There is now considerable evidence&#xD;
      that variability of epigenetic profiles of genes critical to neurocircuit development and&#xD;
      function influences drug responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of different kinds of natural genetic variation that result in functional&#xD;
      protein differences and affect drug responsiveness. The type of variation that is most&#xD;
      prevalent in the genome and, arguably, the most relevant to common diseases and complex&#xD;
      traits is represented by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many ways in which genetic variability, the differences in the sequence of specific&#xD;
      genes, can lead to variability in drug responsiveness and it is likely that each of these&#xD;
      mechanisms is involved in determining the effects for example in anticonvulsant drugs. Up to&#xD;
      now, the focus of pharmacogenetic studies has been on &quot;polymorphic drug metabolism&quot;. This&#xD;
      methodology examines variations in the sequence of genes that code for drug-metabolizing&#xD;
      enzymes. SNPs have been found to underlie variability in drug-metabolizing capacity and such&#xD;
      variability is often documented as differences in drug and metabolite profiles between&#xD;
      patients. It is likely that variation in genes coding for proteins involved in other&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic processes, including drug absorption, distribution, and excretion, also help&#xD;
      to determine individual differences in responsiveness although these mechanisms are not as&#xD;
      well studied regarding genetic influences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another way in which genetic variation plays a role in drug responses depends upon&#xD;
      polymorphisms in genes that code for proteins involved in drug targets or that mediate drug&#xD;
      action. These differences in response apply both to therapeutic effects and adverse effects&#xD;
      so that both efficacy and toxicity may be influenced by individual genetic variation. In the&#xD;
      future, pharmacogenetic discoveries related to drugs will make individualization of therapy&#xD;
      even more difficult in the sense that the genetic substrate that mediates efficacy may well&#xD;
      differ from that mediates toxicity. As such, two different sets of genes and genotypes will&#xD;
      need to be examined in order to match patients with the most appropriate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in response apply both to therapeutic effects and adverse effects so that both&#xD;
      efficacy and toxicity may be influenced by individual genetic variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, compounds exist with mechanisms of action that either differ from standard drugs&#xD;
      or are not yet fully characterized. These compounds and their mechanisms will lead eventually&#xD;
      to the investigation of specific, possibly novel, genes in relation to drug responsiveness.&#xD;
      Because behavioral traits are the most complex traits of all, response to&#xD;
      psychopharmacological drugs, which modify behaviour traits, is likely to profit from this&#xD;
      integration. Moreover, behavioural pharmacogenetics will make a major contribution to&#xD;
      functional genomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Connecting drug response with relevant functional DNA variants and differences in brain&#xD;
      regions represents the ultimate goal for pharmacogenetic research playing an important role&#xD;
      in advancing this understanding. Brain imaging can provide valuable links in understanding&#xD;
      the potential importance and clarifying the pathophysiological mechanisms that lie between&#xD;
      associations of genetic variability and clinical response. Analysis of additional&#xD;
      populations, such as Mexican population, is also necessary to achieve these goals. The use of&#xD;
      brain imaging combined with genetics can aid in understanding the pathophysiological&#xD;
      mechanism of the disease. Additionally, brain imaging has the ability to bridge between&#xD;
      preclinical research and human pharmacological studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes the collection of samples which will result from this study will form the&#xD;
      basis with which to identify the genes associated with neurofunctional brain areas involved&#xD;
      in food craving in obese patients with BED treated with topiramate in Mexican population. The&#xD;
      pharmacogenetic analysis in obese patients associated with BED will identify gene variants&#xD;
      associated with the treatment efficacy to topiramate in Mexican population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective The main objective of this study is to analyze the genetic variants and&#xD;
      neurofunctional brain areas associated with food craving in obese patients with binge eating&#xD;
      disorder responders to topiramate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a naturalistic clinical study designed to analyze the effect of genetic variants&#xD;
      and neurofunctional brain areas associated with food craving in patients with obesity and&#xD;
      binge eating disorder responders to topiramate.&#xD;
