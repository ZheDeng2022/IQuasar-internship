  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project was undertaken by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University and other well-known&#xD;
      hospitals in China. In order to report the alteration of Different Immune Parameters in ITP&#xD;
      Patients Receiving Eltrombopag Treatment.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of oral eltrombopag as a&#xD;
      thrombopoietic agent treating previously treated chronic Chinese ITP patients and investigate&#xD;
      the alteration of Different Immune Parameters after eltrombopag therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 30 eligible subjects with primary ITP who have not responded to or have&#xD;
      relapsed after previous treatment for ITP will be selected. The initial dose of eltrombopag&#xD;
      administration is 25 mg orally once daily. During the 6 weeks follow-up, dose of&#xD;
      investigational product will be adjusted according to the weekly subject platelet count, and&#xD;
      a battery of immune parameters will be monitored at the end of each week. Additionally, the&#xD;
      efficacy of oral eltrombopag for ITP will be assessed after 6 weeks administration.&#xD;
