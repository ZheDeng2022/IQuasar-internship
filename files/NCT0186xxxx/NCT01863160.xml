  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a phase I randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating study to assess&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) data of 0.1% and 1.0% ZEP-3 cream,&#xD;
      administered topically up to 5 consecutive treatment days in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center trial. It is anticipated that the study will be conducted at the&#xD;
      Department of Dermatology, at the Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening/enrollment visit includes a PK study for 24h following a single IP topical&#xD;
      application. After a 24h washout time break, the subject will enter the treatment period for&#xD;
      5 consecutive treatment days followed by a follow up visit 1 and 5 days after end of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      The primary endpoints of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety evaluation - To demonstrate ZEP-3 cream safety in terms of skin irritation score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety evaluation - To demonstrate ZEP-3 cream safety in terms of type and severity of&#xD;
           reported adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tolerability evaluation - To demonstrate ZEP-3 cream tolerability in terms of treatment&#xD;
           compliance by the treated volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systemic absorption PK profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dermal absorption PK profile (Optional).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject safety will be assessed following treatment by ZEP-3 cream, using measurements of the&#xD;
      following variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dermal reaction parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital Signs (HR, BP, RR, Body temperature)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12 lead ECG data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory tests (CBC, blood chemistry, coagulation functions, urinalysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events recording&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in concomitant medications&#xD;
