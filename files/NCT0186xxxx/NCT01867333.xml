  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Enzalutamide is a hormone therapy that is used to treat advanced prostate cancer. It is&#xD;
      given after chemotherapy and surgery to help the body destroy the cancer cells. A new&#xD;
      possible way of treating prostate cancer is using a vaccine that may help stimulate the&#xD;
      immune system. It will help white blood cells recognize and kill the cancer cells in and&#xD;
      around the prostate. Researchers want to see whether this vaccine, given with enzalutamide,&#xD;
      is more effective at treating advanced prostate cancer than enzalutamide alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To compare the safety and effectiveness of enzalutamide with and without vaccine therapy&#xD;
      for advanced prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Men at least 18 years of age who have advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected. Imaging studies will be used to monitor the cancer before&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be separated into two groups. One group will have enzalutamide and the&#xD;
           study vaccine. The other group will have enzalutamide alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will take enzalutamide once a day. They will take the drug during&#xD;
           4-week cycles of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies. Participants&#xD;
           will continue to take the study drug for as long as the cancer does not grow and the&#xD;
           side effects are not severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The vaccine group of participants will also have the new study vaccine. They will have a&#xD;
           single injection on the first day of the first study cycle. There will be regular&#xD;
           booster injections afterward. There will be one on day 15 of the first cycle, the first&#xD;
           day of the second cycle. The vaccine will then be given every 4 weeks for the next four&#xD;
           cycles, and then every 12 weeks (every 3 cycles) thereafter. Participants will continue&#xD;
           to have the study vaccine for as long as the cancer does not grow and the side effects&#xD;
           are not severe.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enzalutamide is a well-tolerated, modern androgen receptor antagonist (ARA) with more&#xD;
           enhanced anti-tumor activity compared to previous ARAs. Phase III trial has demonstrated&#xD;
           a 4.8 month improvement in survival and a 37% risk reduction in death in metastatic&#xD;
           castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients who have had previous docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PROSTVAC is a therapeutic cancer vaccine which is designed to induce an anti-tumor&#xD;
           immune response. In a randomized controlled Phase 2 trial, PROSTVAC therapy was&#xD;
           associated with a prolongation of survival by 8.5 months in men with metastatic&#xD;
           castrateresistant prostate cancer. An international Phase 3 trial is on-going.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preclinical data has demonstrated that hormonal therapies such as ARAs can enhance the&#xD;
           immune response through multiple mechanisms. Specifically, our group has shown that&#xD;
           enzalutamide can increase thymic production of na(SqrRoot) ve T-cells, which could be&#xD;
           activated by a cancer vaccine. Together, these data provide an important rationale to&#xD;
           combine enzalutamide with PSA-TRICOM in mCRPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data from the clinical trials with these therapies suggest that they are very well&#xD;
           tolerated and without overlapping toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Determine if PSA-TRICOM combined with enzalutamide will increase time to progression (as&#xD;
      defined by Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 criteria, incorporated in section&#xD;
      5.2) in chemotherapy-naive metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer patients compared&#xD;
      to enzalutamide alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will randomize chemotherapy-naive, mCRPC patients to either enzalutamide alone&#xD;
           or enzalutamide with PSA-TRICOM. Enzalutamide will be given at the standard dose of 160&#xD;
           mg daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PSA-TRICOM will be administered identical to the Phase III dosing with vaccine given&#xD;
           week 1 (vaccinia-PSA-TRICOM, 2x10(8) units subcutaneously) and then week 3, 5 and then&#xD;
           monthly fowlpox-vaccine (1x10(9) units subcutaneously).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After completing 6 months of vaccine, fowlpox-vaccine (1x10(9) units subcutaneously will&#xD;
           be administered every 3 months. Patients will be treated until radiographic progression&#xD;
           on scans using Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mCRPC patients with rising PSA or progressive disease despite castration levels of&#xD;
           testosterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemotherapy-na(SqrRoot) ve with minimal or no symptoms related to prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with history of autoimmune disease, brain/leptomeningeal metastasis, a second&#xD;
           malignancy within 3 years of enrollment, or a severe co-morbid condition will be&#xD;
           excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have received abiraterone will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be stratified based on previous immunotherapy used as cancer treatment.&#xD;
