  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By using functional MRI the investigators have recently shown that TNFi elicit rapid changes&#xD;
      in brain function linked to the perception of RA [5]. Functional MRI represents a method&#xD;
      allowing detecting tiny changes in neuronal activity by measuring alterations of blood flow&#xD;
      in the context of neuronal activation. TNFi rapidly reversed the widespread activation of&#xD;
      brain centers involved in pain such as the thalamus and the somatosensoric cortex, as well as&#xD;
      those involved in the control, of mood and emotions such as the limbic system. Moreover, as&#xD;
      small phase I study with 10 patients with RA showed that high brain activity detected in the&#xD;
      functional MRI predicts clinical response to Certolizumab Pegol after 1 month, suggesting the&#xD;
      central nervous system activity may be used as a tool to predict response to TNFi [8]. The&#xD;
      rationale of this study is to test whether response to TNFi can be predicted by using&#xD;
      functional MRI.&#xD;

      Randomized double-blinded controlled multi-centre, study over 12 weeks, followed by a 12&#xD;
      weeks single blinded multicenter trial in 156 patients with RA with inadequate response to&#xD;
      DMARD therapy. The study is composed of 3 arms with a 1:1:1 randomization at baseline: High&#xD;
      functional MRI/400mg Certolizumab Pegol on week 0,2 and 4 followed by Certolizumab Pegol&#xD;
      200mg every two weeks for a total of 24 weeks; low functional MRI/400mg Certolizumab Pegol on&#xD;
      week 0,2 and 4 followed by Certolizumab Pegol 200mg every two weeks for a total of 24 weeks&#xD;
      with the possibility of early escape at week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who did not respond sufficiently according to EULAR response criteria (DAS28&#xD;
      reduction ≥ 1.2) to Certolizumab-Pegol (Treatment Arm A and Arm B) after 12 weeks will be&#xD;
      off-Study and treated according to local guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the Placebo group with an EULAR response ≥ 1.2 reaching remission (DAS28 ≤ 2.6)&#xD;
      will also be off study and treated according to the local guidelines or will be followed&#xD;
      while they are in clinical remission. Patients with an EULAR response (DAS28 reduction ≥ 1.2)&#xD;
      but not fulfilling the clinical remission criteria (DAS28 ≤ 2.6) will receive Certolizumab&#xD;
      Pegol in week 12,14 and 16 with Certolizumab Pegol 400mg s.c. followed by s.c.injection of&#xD;
      200mg Certolizumab Pegol every two weeks till week 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the situation that in one group sufficient patients will be randomized, fMRI done at&#xD;
      screening, needs to be analyzed first to ensure that no further patient will be randomized&#xD;
      with the randomization to the closed group. A blinded person, not involved either in the&#xD;
      analysation of the fMRI nor in the treatment of the patients or the clinical assessments,&#xD;
      will be responsible for the randomization list. If the next number on the randomization list&#xD;
      represent the number of the closed group, the patient is not eligible for the study and will&#xD;
      be treated according to local guidelines.&#xD;

    <description>Certolizumab Pegol (Cimzia®) is an engineered, humanized antibody-Fab'-fragment with specificity for human TNF-α, that is conjugated to polyethylene glycol (PEG). Certolizumab Pegol (Cimzia®) is a humanized antibody-Fab'-fragment that is produced in Escherichia coli and subsequently PEGylated to prolong its circulating half-time to be similar to that of an intact mAB. Certolizumab Pegol has a high affinity for TNF α with a Kd90pM and is an effective TNF α inhibitor. Certolizumab pegol does not neutralize TNFß (lymphotoxin), a related cytokine, and does not activate complement or kill cells via antibody-dependent cellular toxicity.</description>
