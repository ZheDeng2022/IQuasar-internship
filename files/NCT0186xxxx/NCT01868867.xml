    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to examine the use of new technologies in disseminating and&#xD;
      improving CBT treatment for adolescent depression. An on-line therapist training tutorial&#xD;
      will be followed by 12 weeks of CBT treatment according to the training protocol. CBT&#xD;
      treatment will be augmented with the use of automated text messages for homework reminders&#xD;
      and reinforcement of learning. In session patient education and review of CBT concepts will&#xD;
      be augmented through teaching materials delivered via iPad. 16 therapists will be recruited,&#xD;
      each treating 4 depressed adolescents. Half the therapists will be randomly assigned to TAU,&#xD;
      followed by the training intervention. Automated patient outcomes measures will be examined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Point prevalence estimates for major depressive disorder in adolescents range from 4% to 8%,&#xD;
      and the lifetime prevalence of experiencing a major depressive episode by age 18 is estimated&#xD;
      at 20% to 25%. Depression afflicts the lives of adolescent girls at twice the rate of boys,&#xD;
      and depressive episodes typically last for 7-9 months without treatment. Unfortunately, less&#xD;
      than half of adolescents who report a major depressive episode in the past year also report&#xD;
      having received treatment. Even with treatment, the risk of relapse in the subsequent 2 years&#xD;
      ranges from 20%- 60%. Adolescent depression is associated with suicidal thoughts and&#xD;
      behaviors in teens, the third leading cause of death in youths 15-19 years old. The incidence&#xD;
      and time course of suicidal ideations and behaviors in depressed adolescents has been&#xD;
      examined in the Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study (TADS),Treatment of Selective&#xD;
      Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI)-Resistant Depression in Adolescents (TORDIA) study,and&#xD;
      the Treatment of Adolescent Suicide Attempters (TASA) study. These federally-funded clinical&#xD;
      trials provide considerable evidence about the effectiveness of pharmacological,&#xD;
      psychotherapeutic, and combined treatments for adolescent depression; they also underscore&#xD;
      the critical need to improve training and resources for treatment providers and patients in&#xD;
      the pursuit of better outcomes. Evidence-based practice (EBP) is 'treatment [or intervention]&#xD;
      based on the best available science or research evidence'. In 2005, the American&#xD;
      Psychological Association (APA) Presidential Task Force advocated EBPs &quot;to promote effective&#xD;
      psychological practice and enhance public health by applying empirically supported principles&#xD;
      of psychological assessment, case formulation, therapeutic relationship, and intervention&quot;.&#xD;
      It asks clinicians to adopt EBPs and encourages development of health care policies&#xD;
      reflecting this view. Research supports the efficacy and effectiveness of both CBT and&#xD;
      antidepressant treatments for adolescent depression. The demand for trained CBT providers&#xD;
      exceeds the supply, reflecting a need for more efficient and effecting training platforms. In&#xD;
      April 2007, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) held the &quot;Partnerships to&#xD;
      Integrate Evidence-Based Mental Health Practices into Social Work Education and Research&quot;&#xD;
      meeting. They concluded that important initiatives in EBP existed in academic programs, but&#xD;
      the need for social workers prepared to deliver them is not being met. The Surgeon General's&#xD;
      Report on Mental Health reached a similar conclusion regarding EBP use in community settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New technologies can increase access to specialized training and can improve training&#xD;
      quality. Web-based training can be made available at any time, eliminates costs and&#xD;
      difficulties associated with traveling, and enrollment is not constrained by class size or&#xD;
      trainer availability. Trainees can work a their own pace and training quality is improved by&#xD;
      use of consistent, standardized interactive exercises presented with multi-modal learning&#xD;
      techniques that increase knowledge retention. Online CBT training is effective and&#xD;
      well-received by clinicians; engaging and retaining adolescents in treatment has been&#xD;
      challenging. Telephone contact between sessions can improve both outcomes and satisfaction in&#xD;
      depression treatment. Between-session contact from a clinician via the internet has improved&#xD;
      outcomes, as much as four-fold in one study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depressed adolescents can be treated effectively with antidepressant medications, but&#xD;
      medication noncompliance was over 50% in the TORDIA study. Estimates are that only a third of&#xD;
      patients started on an antidepressant receive treatment of adequate dose and duration.&#xD;
      Patient non-adherence was the most common reason for failure, with side effects being a major&#xD;
      factor for discontinuing treatment in the initial weeks. Monitoring common side effects, such&#xD;
      as altered sleeping patterns, nightmares, restlessness, and changes in appetite is&#xD;
      particularly important in adolescents; 3%-8% of youths treated with antidepressants show&#xD;
      increased &quot;behavioral activation&quot; which may increase the risk for suicidal ideation or&#xD;
      behavior. Such concerns are the basis for the American Academy of Child and Adolescent&#xD;
      Psychiatry's treatment recommendation &quot;During All Treatment Phases, Clinicians Should Arrange&#xD;
      Frequent Follow-up Contacts That Allow Sufficient Time to Monitor the Subject's Clinical&#xD;
      Status, Environmental Conditions, and, If Appropriate, Medication Side Effects.&quot; Use of text&#xD;
      messaging to assess side effects and provide messages of reassurance and support could help&#xD;
      medication compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The popularity of Short Messaging Service (SMS) text messaging among adolescents is apparent&#xD;
      to any parent with a teenage son or daughter. A Pew Research Center study found that text&#xD;
      messaging has become the preferred channel for basic communication among teens. Teens&#xD;
      interact with friends via text messaging more frequently than any other form of interaction;&#xD;
      75% of 12-17 year-olds have their own cell phones, and 72% of all teens (88% of teenage cell&#xD;
      phone users) use text messaging. Two-thirds of texting teens are more likely to use their&#xD;
      cell phones to text with friends than to talk with them. Half of all teens send 50 or more&#xD;
      texts per day. Girls use text messaging to a greater extent than boys, and three-quarters of&#xD;
      teen cell phone users have unlimited texting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The popularity of SMS technology has only recently begun to be leveraged for scientific and&#xD;
      public health applications, but use in research and health promotion is expanding. Cell phone&#xD;
      text messaging has been used to collect daily data regarding asthma and diabetes symptoms.&#xD;
      SMS reminders to use oral contraceptive may reduce unintended pregnancies,and medical test&#xD;
      results provided by text messaging can encourage patients to seek treatment, which may be&#xD;
      particularly useful for school-based health centers. A review of text messaging programs&#xD;
      designed to influence health behavior found positive outcomes in 93% of the published&#xD;
      studies72 including interventions addressing obesity, smoking, and bulimia nervosa. In a&#xD;
      review of studies using cell phone and SMS programs to improve health outcomes and processes&#xD;
      of care, a total of 101 process and outcomes were evaluated across 25 studies. Sixty percent&#xD;
      of the cell phone/text messaging interventions resulted in positive outcomes (p.&lt;.05)&#xD;
      compared to control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits of interactive voice response (IVR) methods to address personally sensitive topics&#xD;
      have been published and extend to SMS applications. Text messaging has some advantages over&#xD;
      IVR technology, which may account for its popularity among teens: Temporally, SMS is less&#xD;
      disruptive since asynchronous interactions allow message receivers to postpone dialog&#xD;
      engagement. Environmentally, text messaging may be more private, since they do not require&#xD;
      verbal responses that might overheard in public. Use of key presses to silently respond to&#xD;
      automated queries is possible via IVR, but additional equipment such as ear buds are needed&#xD;
      and may not always be available. The efficiency and effectiveness of SMS applications in&#xD;
      healthcare setting has been referred to as &quot;the elephant knocking at the door.&quot; One reason&#xD;
      treatments using EBPs are less effective than desired may be a lack of easily accessible&#xD;
      training materials and supportive tools for implementation. CBT training manuals, alone and&#xD;
      in combination with antidepressant management, have been created in academe and are publicly&#xD;
      available. Unfortunately they are not being widely adopted by clinicians in community-based&#xD;
      treatment programs. Manualized CBT developed specifically for depressed adolescents,&#xD;
      including suicide prevention modules that contain safety plans, mood monitoring, goal&#xD;
      setting, reducing negative emotions, and increasing positive reinforcements are publicly&#xD;
      available. Interacting with adolescents on a daily basis to encourage homework compliance,&#xD;
      evaluate treatment progress, monitor side effects, etc., would be prohibitive if clinicians&#xD;
      needed to personally send and receive each tailored message. Fortunately, that is not&#xD;
      necessary. Phase I results demonstrated the feasibility of computer-automated,&#xD;
      dynamically-branching SMS protocols for interacting with depressed adolescents (see Progress&#xD;
      Report below). Feedback from the adolescents in the Phase I study indicated willingness to&#xD;
      embrace the use of this technology into treatment programs. They explicitly expressed&#xD;
      interest in automated interactions permitting more open-ended and personally expressive&#xD;
      content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The product to be developed in Phase II is responsive to this desire and will incorporate&#xD;
      multimedia training materials for clinicians through a secure, password-protected website&#xD;
      that will assist them in selecting, scheduling, and incorporating automated, personalized&#xD;
      interactive SMS interactions into manualized CBT treatment. Automated interactions will&#xD;
      facilitate homework assignments, monitor medication side effects, assess symptom severities,&#xD;
      and encourage patients. Patient responses to the automated interactions will be reviewable by&#xD;
      the clinicians through the same website, and reports of particularly worrisome behaviors,&#xD;
      such as suicidal intent, will trigger immediate notifications to on-call clinical staff for&#xD;
      immediate follow-up and intervention. The system and processes to be developed in Phase II&#xD;
      are designed to improve the efficacy of adolescent depression treatment by improving&#xD;
      clinician training and increasing the depth and breadth of patient engagement in their&#xD;
      treatment regimen. We believe it will also hasten the onset of symptomatic improvement and&#xD;
      will do so in a manner that improves patient satisfaction and increases safety monitoring.&#xD;
