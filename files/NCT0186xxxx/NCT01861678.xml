    <textblock>
      The tying at a radix of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) is recognized as radical cure&#xD;
      technique in a rectal cancer surgery in Japan. In one side, the preserving the left colic&#xD;
      artery (LCA) that is the technique to maintain blood flow of proximal sigmoid colon is&#xD;
      performed in practice. However, there is no evidence that shows effectiveness of this&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We conducted a randomized trial that compared between high tie and low tie of the IMA in&#xD;
      rectal anterior resection to define an appropriate portion of IMA tying.&#xD;

      Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This was a randomized controlled trial conducted at a single institute, which was&#xD;
           Yokohama City University Medical Center (Japan).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  300 patients who underwent anterior resection for rectal cancer were randomly allocated&#xD;
           to receive high tie or low tie of the inferior mesenteric artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All surgical procedures were performed by one specialized colorectal treatment team. The&#xD;
           laparoscopic surgeries were performed by a surgeon who passed the skill accreditation&#xD;
           system for laparoscopic gastroenterological surgery was established by the Japanese&#xD;
           Society for Endoscopic Surgery (JSES), and all open surgeries were performed under the&#xD;
           supervision of these skillful surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All operations were performed according to the standard radical cure procedure described&#xD;
           in the seventh edition of the Japanese General Rules for Clinical and Pathological&#xD;
           Studies on Cancer of the Colon, Rectum and Anus. That is, intestinal excision with lymph&#xD;
           node dissection around the IMA at its origin was performed in all surgical procedures.&#xD;
           Patients who underwent palliative partial excision were not included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the high tie (HT) of the IMA, IMA was separated at its origin from the abdominal&#xD;
           aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the low tie (LT) of the IMA, IMA was separated after branching to the left colic&#xD;
           artery. The lymph node dissection around the IMA at its origin was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization - To balance the operative backgrounds between HT and LT groups, the patients&#xD;
      were stratified by the approach of surgery (open or laparoscopic surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjuvant therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When the pathological stage was diagnosed as stage 3 by histological examination of the&#xD;
           resected specimen, adjuvant chemotherapy was done with oral fluoropyrimidine anti-cancer&#xD;
           drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neither radiation therapy nor preoperative chemotherapy was given to any patient.&#xD;
           Preoperative chemo-radiotherapy even for rectal cancer is not yet standard treatment in&#xD;
           Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The preoperative parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Operative assessment parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative assessment parameters An early postoperative complication was defined as a&#xD;
           complication that occurred between the finish of the operation and postoperative day 30.&#xD;
           A late postoperative complication was defined as a complication that occurred after&#xD;
           postoperative day 30. The terminologies of complications were classified according to&#xD;
           the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, and grading was&#xD;
           done by Classification of Surgical Complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pathological results were recorded according to the 7th edition of the Japanese&#xD;
           General Rules for Clinical and Pathological Studies on Cancer of the Colon, Rectum and&#xD;
           Anus and 7th edition of primary tumor, regional nodes, metastasis (TNM) classification.&#xD;
           Circumferential margin involvement was defined as exposure of a cancer cell at the&#xD;
           vertical dissection surface on histological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The follow-up schedule was as follows according to stage. Patients with stages 0 and 1 were&#xD;
      followed up with outpatient examinations including tumor marker measurements, and chest,&#xD;
      abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) once a year for five years. Patients with stage&#xD;
      2 and 3a were examined by CT and tumor marker measurements every six months for the first two&#xD;
      years. These examinations were done once a year from the third year to the fifth year.&#xD;
      Patients with stage 3b and 3c were examined by CT and tumor marker measurements every four&#xD;
      months for the first two years, and every six months from the third year to the fifth year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary endpoint was anastomotic leakage rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The secondary endpoints were operation time, amount of bleeding and 5-year overall&#xD;
           survival. To evaluate whether a difference in the operative procedure influences&#xD;
           survival including death due to another disease, a comparison of overall survival has&#xD;
           meaning. Operation time and amount of bleeding were added to the secondary endpoints&#xD;
           because these parameters had a possibility of becoming grounds of selection of the&#xD;
           operation method if there were no differences in overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A sample size of 284 patients was assured to achieve a power of 70% to detect a&#xD;
           difference between the groups using a two-sided Chi-squared test with type I error rate&#xD;
           equal to 0.05, when the true complication rates were 4% and 12% for the LT and HT&#xD;
           groups, respectively. A sample size of 300 patients was assured to achieve a power of&#xD;
           73% to detect a difference in a same condition. The dropouts were considered and the&#xD;
           number of accumulation targets was assumed to be 300 patients to keep a power of more&#xD;
           than 70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For continuous variables, data are presented as means Â± standard deviation (SD). For&#xD;
           categorical variables, data are presented as frequencies and percentages (%). Comparison&#xD;
           of the endpoints was based on intention-to-treat principle, that is, the patients who&#xD;
           switched to another group during surgery were treated as members of the allocated group.&#xD;
           The Chi-squared test was applied to evaluate the significance of differences in&#xD;
           proportions, and t-test was used to evaluate the significance of differences in&#xD;
           continuous variables. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically&#xD;
           significant.&#xD;
