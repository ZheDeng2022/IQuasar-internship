      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Malaria is a disease that is spread by mosquitoes. Researchers are looking for a vaccine&#xD;
      that can prevent mosquitoes from transmitting malaria to people. They want to test a vaccine&#xD;
      called Pfs25-EPA/Alhydrogel that may help stop malaria parasites from developing in&#xD;
      mosquitoes. When a mosquito bites a vaccinated person, the vaccine should prevent parasites&#xD;
      from developing in the mosquito. As a result, the mosquito will not spread malaria to the&#xD;
      next person it bites. However, the vaccine will not directly prevent people vaccinated from&#xD;
      getting sick with malaria. Researchers want to test this vaccine in people who live in rural&#xD;
      Mali. To do so, the study will compare the symptoms and the blood tests of the participants&#xD;
      who receive either the study vaccine or a regular hepatitis B/meningococcal vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if Pfs25-EPA/Alhydrogel is a safe and effective malaria vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers between 18 and 45 years of age who live in Bancoumana, Mali.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be separated into two groups. One group will have Pfs25-EPA/Alhydrogel&#xD;
           to test the study vaccine. The other group will have the regular Hepatitis B vaccine&#xD;
           series, meningococcal vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the study vaccine group, participants will have either a lower dose or a higher dose.&#xD;
           For the lower dose, they will have two vaccine shots over 1 year. For the higher dose,&#xD;
           they will have four vaccine shots over about 14 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the other vaccine group, participants will have the Hepatitis B vaccine series,&#xD;
           meningococcal vaccine according to the standard dose schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will provide regular blood samples for testing during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who develop malaria during the study will participate in evaluation of&#xD;
           transmission and parasite development of malaria parasite from the person to mosquito&#xD;
           via transmission assays. They will allow mosquitoes (that have no diseases) to bite them&#xD;
           in a controlled clinic setting. This will let researchers see if the vaccine can stop&#xD;
           the mosquitoes from carrying malaria to other people.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A vaccine to interrupt malaria transmission would be a valuable tool for local elimination or&#xD;
      eradication of this disease. Pfs25, a surface antigen of ookinetes in the mosquito stage of&#xD;
      P. falciparum, is a lead candidate for a malaria transmission blocking vaccine. Recombinant&#xD;
      Pfs25 has been conjugated to Pseudomonas aeruginosa ExoProtein A (EPA), and adjuvanted with&#xD;
      Alhydrogel . This dose escalating, double-blind, randomized controlled trial will determine&#xD;
      safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in malaria exposed adults. One hundred twenty (120)&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled and randomized to receive the low dose (16 g of conjugated Pfs25,&#xD;
      n=10), the high dose (47 g of conjugated Pfs25, n=50), or the comparator vaccine (Euvax B for&#xD;
      first 3 vaccinations, then Menactra vaccine for the fourth vaccination, n=10 for 2&#xD;
      vaccinations, n=50 for 4 vaccinations). Enrollment within the high dose group will be&#xD;
      staggered for additional safety. The low dose and the matching comparator cohort (Group 1)&#xD;
      will receive 2 vaccine doses given at 0 and 2 months. For the rest of the subjects, 3 doses&#xD;
      will be given at a 0, 2, 4 month dosing intervals, and a fourth (booster) dose will be given&#xD;
      12 months following the third dose at the start of the subsequent transmission season.&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed for 12 months following the last vaccination. Safety outcomes will&#xD;
      be local and systemic adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). Immunogenicity&#xD;
      outcomes will be antibody responses as measured by ELISA against recombinant Pfs25 and EPA,&#xD;
      and B cell responses. Functional activity of the induced antibody will be assessed by direct&#xD;
      transmission blocking assays (direct skin feeds, direct membrane feeding assays) conducted at&#xD;
      the Malaria Research and Training Center (MRTC) in Mali and in a standard membrane feeding&#xD;
      assay conducted at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in the&#xD;
      United States.&#xD;
