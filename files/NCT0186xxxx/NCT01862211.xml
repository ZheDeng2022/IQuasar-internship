  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin (DA1AT) is a genetic disorder of variable clinical&#xD;
      expression, initially described in adults with pulmonary emphysema patients. In children, it&#xD;
      is the second cause of neonatal cholestasis after biliary atresia and is a common indication&#xD;
      for liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several genotypes for SERPINA1 gene coding for alpha-1 anti-trypsin were identified. The main&#xD;
      ones are M / M, M / Z, M / S and Z / Z and each genotype is closely correlated with the&#xD;
      concentration of blood A1AT. The estimate for France suggests a prevalence of genotype&#xD;
      deficit Z / Z of the order of 1/6054, (9982 patients), which in 11% of cases, have liver&#xD;
      disease (prolonged neonatal jaundice). Half of them will move towards the development of&#xD;
      cirrhosis with portal hypertension, at worst liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, we do not know what are the clinical and genetic factors that predispose a patient&#xD;
      A1AT deficiency develop liver damage. Recent studies have led us to think that polymorphisms&#xD;
      in the gene SERPINA1, as well as that of the alpha-mannosidase 1 endoplasmic reticulum (Erman&#xD;
      gene) could be a predictive marker of liver complications. Another possible candidate gene is&#xD;
      one of the importin beta (KPNB1), a protein involved in the elimination of misfolded&#xD;
      proteins. These data lead us to propose the study of genetic polymorphisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to compare the allele frequencies of these polymorphisms&#xD;
      between (i) a cohort of A1AT deficient patients and with hepatic symptoms (portal&#xD;
      hypertension and its complications, severe liver failure leading to transplant or not, or an&#xD;
      indication for liver transplantation) and (ii) a cohort of A1AT deficient patients without&#xD;
      signs of hepatic call. To build this last cohort, we will include in the genetic study the&#xD;
      family members of deficient patients, some of whom probably carrying a deficit genotype Z / Z&#xD;
      but without any associated clinical manifestations. This will allow us to facilitate the&#xD;
      establishment of genotype profiles / phenotype clearly identified, which then allow a more&#xD;
      appropriate care for children who may have such a development, we will strive to achieve a&#xD;
      haplotype interpretation of polymorphisms found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in association with the DEFI-ALPHA study to identify clinical&#xD;
      and biological prognostic factors such as age at diagnosis, the diagnostic mode, the results&#xD;
      of liver biopsy (when available), the clinical course, family history, the existence of IUGR&#xD;
      and long-term treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The measurement and interpretation of serum IL-8 in A1AT-deficient patients. Indeed, one&#xD;
           study showed a higher IL-8 in patients with ulcerative colitis compared with healthy&#xD;
           patients' serum. These considerations led us to hypothesize that IL-8 may be a marker of&#xD;
           liver disease in A1AT deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preservation of blood samples for further study of other genes, which may be in the&#xD;
           future suspected to be associated with the occurrence of liver complications. To this&#xD;
           end, a DNA bank will be created. It will involve the children with a deficiency of&#xD;
           alpha-1 antitrypsin and their family of 1st and 2nd degree in civil law (parents and&#xD;
           siblings).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a continuation of the cohort DEFI-ALPHA (descriptive study of a cohort of&#xD;
      children with DA1AT) and sought to identify the clinical and biological factors such as age&#xD;
      at diagnosis, diagnosis mode, the result sets of the liver biopsy (when available), clinical&#xD;
      course, family history, the presence of IUGR and long-term treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only criterion for not-inclusion is, according to the subject, the lack of consent of the&#xD;
      child and his parents, the lack of consent of the adult patient, or the lack of consent of&#xD;
      the witness. Demographic and clinical history data (for parents and brothers/sisters showing&#xD;
      no DA1AT) will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the cohort of patients with DA1AT is being set up in the framework of the &quot;Cohort&#xD;
      DEFI-ALPHA.&quot; This multicenter project is realized with the help of french pediatric&#xD;
      hepatology centers that regularly follow patients DA1AT. Today, over 100 patients DA1AT have&#xD;
      already been identified, and the collection of historical data has already begun on several&#xD;
      centers since September 2009. This study is therefore a continuation of this work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over a period of 30 months, the total number of potentially includable subjects is estimated&#xD;
      at about 400 in this study (100 patients and 300 related to the first degree such as parents,&#xD;
      brothers and sisters).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be promoted by the Hospices Civils de Lyon. Authorization of the competent&#xD;
      authority and the ethical committee will be obtained as well as informed consent from&#xD;
      families before blood sampling.&#xD;
