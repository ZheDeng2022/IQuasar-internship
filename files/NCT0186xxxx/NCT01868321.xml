    <textblock>
      The purpose of this international, multicenter study is to determine ventilation practice and&#xD;
      outcomes of intubated and ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Ventilation&#xD;
      characteristics and outcomes will be compared between patients without the acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome (ARDS), patients at risk for ARDS, and patients with mild, moderate or&#xD;
      severe ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating centres worldwide will include adult patients undergoing mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      in the ICU during a 7-day period. Patients data will be collected during the first 7 days in&#xD;
      the ICU, or until ICU discharge. Follow up is until day 90. Primary endpoint is the tidal&#xD;
      volume size used during mechanical ventilation. Secondary endpoints are development of ARDS&#xD;
      in patients without ARDS at the onset of mechanical ventilation, worsening of ARDS in&#xD;
      patients with ARDS at the onset of mechanical ventilation, pulmonary infection, other&#xD;
      pulmonary complications, need for tracheostomy, extra-pulmonary complications, duration of&#xD;
      ventilation, length of ICU and hospital stay, and ICU, hospital and 90-day mortality.&#xD;

      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does ventilation practice, in particular tidal volume size, varies amongst patients&#xD;
           without ARDS, patients at risk for ARDS, and patients with mild ARDS?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Are tidal volumes used in patients without ARDS higher than those used in patients with&#xD;
           ARDS?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Are the outcomes in patients without ARDS dependent on the size of tidal volumes?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Methods: In this international observational study, consecutive patients in the ICU&#xD;
                under mechanical ventilation are eligible for participation. Patients in&#xD;
                participating centers will be screened on a daily basis. Patients in mechanical&#xD;
                ventilation will be included during a 7-day period, from Monday at 8:00 AM to the&#xD;
                next Monday at 7:59 AM (in time zones of the participating centers). The inclusion&#xD;
                period will be flexible for participating centers and determined at a later stage&#xD;
                together with the study-coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Times points of data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic data and baseline data, including severity scores (e.g. APACHE II-scores and&#xD;
           SAPS III) and LIPS, are collected from the clinical files on the day of intubation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ventilation settings, gas exchange variables and vital parameters are collected once a&#xD;
           daily in the morning, until ventilation is stopped&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Chest radiography data from available chest X-rays (i.e., no extra chest X-rays are&#xD;
           obtained)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Predefined complications are recorded from medical chart until discharge from ICU or&#xD;
           death, whatever comes first&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Length of ICU and hospital stay, and ICU, hospital and 90-day mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Centres: The investigators aim to recruit 40 - 150 centers worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ethics Approval: National coordinators will be responsible for clarifying the need&#xD;
                for ethics approval and applying for this where appropriate according to local&#xD;
                policy. Centres will not be permitted to record data unless ethics approval or an&#xD;
                equivalent waiver is in place. The investigators expect that in most, if not every&#xD;
                participating country, a patient informed consent is not be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Monitoring: Due to the observational nature of the study, a DSMB is not be&#xD;
                necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Study Population: Adult patients in the ICU under mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Data Collection: Data will be collected at inclusion, every day during seven days,&#xD;
                day of ICU and hospital discharge and on day 90. Data will be coded by a patient&#xD;
                identification number (PIN) of which the code will be kept safe at the local sites.&#xD;
                The data will be transcribed by local investigators onto an internet based&#xD;
                electronic CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sample Size Calculation: We did not perform a formal sample size calculation, seen&#xD;
                the largely descriptive character of this investigation. We expect to collect data&#xD;
                from at least 1000 patients, which will be sufficient to test the hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Statistical Analysis: Patient characteristics will be compared and described by&#xD;
                appropriate statistics. Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U-tests are used to&#xD;
                compare continuous variables and chi-squared tests are used for categorical&#xD;
                variables. Data are expressed as means (SD), medians (interquartile range) and&#xD;
                proportions as appropriate. Comparisons between and within groups are performed&#xD;
                using one-way ANOVA and post-hoc analyses for continuous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis concerns the determination of (variation of) tidal volume size in&#xD;
      patients without ARDS. Tidal volume size is compared between predefined patient groups:&#xD;
      patients at no risk for ARDS, patients at risk for ARDS, patients with mild ARDS, and&#xD;
      patients with moderate or severe ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify potential factors associated with outcome like development of ARDS, or worsening&#xD;
      of ARDS, development of pulmonary complications, duration of ventilation, or death,&#xD;
      univariate analyses are performed. A multivariate logistic regression model is used to&#xD;
      identify independent risk factors. A stepwise approach is used to enter new terms into the&#xD;
      model, with a limit of p &lt; 0.2 to enter the terms. Time to event variables are analyzed using&#xD;
      Cox regression and visualized by Kaplan-Meier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Organization: The study is conducted by the PROtective VEntilation Network (PROVENet).&#xD;
      National co-ordinators will lead the project within individual nations and identify&#xD;
      participating hospitals, translate study paperwork, distribute study paperwork and ensure&#xD;
      necessary regulatory approvals are in place. They provide assistance to the participating&#xD;
      clinical sites in trial management, record keeping and data management. Local coordinators in&#xD;
      each site will supervise data collection and ensure adherence to Good Clinical Practice&#xD;
      during the trial.&#xD;
