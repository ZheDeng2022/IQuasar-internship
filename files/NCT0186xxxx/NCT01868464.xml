  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I open-label, dose escalation trial to evaluate the use of Tice® BCG as a&#xD;
      challenge for future assessment of in vivo TB immunity. Subjects will be recruited from the&#xD;
      target population reflecting the community at 2 VTEU sites. Enrollment will occur over 14&#xD;
      months. Subjects who provide informed consent will be screened, and up to 120 eligible, HIV&#xD;
      and TB uninfected subjects, 18-45 years, inclusive, will be enrolled for study interventions&#xD;
      and sequentially assigned to 1 of 4 dose groups. Doses of Tice BCG from 2 to 16x10^6 cfu will&#xD;
      be delivered ID in a dose escalation format to 4 groups of 30 subjects per dose group.&#xD;
      Primary Objectives: 1) Evaluate the safety of different doses of ID Tice BCG for use as a&#xD;
      human challenge model for TB infection. 2) Examine shedding from ID challenge sites after&#xD;
      administration of different doses of Tice BCG in TB naive healthy subjects. 3) Evaluate the&#xD;
      reproducibility of BCG shedding over time with both quantitative PCR and culture.&#xD;

      This is a Phase I open-label, dose escalation trial to evaluate the use of Tice® BCG as a&#xD;
      challenge for future assessment of in vivo TB immunity. Subjects will be recruited from the&#xD;
      target population reflecting the community at large at 2 VTEU sites. It is anticipated that&#xD;
      enrollment will occur over a 14-month period. Subjects who provide informed consent will be&#xD;
      considered for eligibility (screened), and up to 120 eligible, willing, healthy, HIV and TB&#xD;
      uninfected subjects aged 18 to 45 years, inclusive, will be enrolled for study interventions&#xD;
      and sequentially assigned to 1 of 4 dose groups. Dose titrations of Tice® BCG from 2x10^6 cfu&#xD;
      to 16x10^6 cfu will be delivered intradermally in a dose escalation format to 4 groups of 30&#xD;
      subjects per dose group. In the first dose group, subjects will be immunized intradermally&#xD;
      with a single dose of 2x10^6 cfu Tice® BCG. The Tice® BCG doses will be increased&#xD;
      sequentially from 2x10^6 cfu to 4x10^6 cfu to 8x10^6 cfu to a maximum dose of 16x10^6 cfu&#xD;
      following assessment of safety and reactogenicity data from previous dose groups and sentinel&#xD;
      subjects. Following administration of Tice® BCG, intradermal (ID) site reactions will be&#xD;
      assessed for at least 30 minutes as well as by memory aid on a daily basis throughout the&#xD;
      first 15 days. Subjects will also return to the clinic on Days 22, 25, 29, 32, 36, 39, 43,&#xD;
      46, 50, 53, and 57 to evaluate the ID challenge site, assess for lymphadenopathy if indicated&#xD;
      based on review of interim medical history and clinical assessment, and review AEs/SAEs,&#xD;
      concomitant medications and health status, and collect and dispose of returned biohazard&#xD;
      materials. A final clinic visit will be performed at approximately 3 months (Day 99)&#xD;
      following administration of Tice® BCG to evaluate the ID challenge site, assess for&#xD;
      lymphadenopathy if indicated based on review of interim medical history and clinical&#xD;
      assessment, and review SAEs and health status. At approximately 6 months (Day 181) following&#xD;
      administration of Tice® BCG a telephone call will be performed to query for any SAEs that may&#xD;
      have occurred since the last visit. Based on this information, subjects may be asked to&#xD;
      return to the clinic to be evaluated. The duration of the study for each subject will be up&#xD;
      to approximately 7 to 8 months. Primary Objectives: 1) Evaluate the safety of different doses&#xD;
      of intradermal Tice® BCG for use as a human challenge model for Mycobacterium tuberculosis&#xD;
      infection. 2) Examine BCG shedding from intradermal challenge sites after administration of&#xD;
      different doses of Tice® BCG in TB naive healthy subjects. 3) Evaluate the reproducibility of&#xD;
      BCG shedding over time with both quantitative PCR and culture techniques. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives: 1) Determine a tolerable dose of intradermal Tice® BCG that will induce optimal&#xD;
      reproducibility of BCG shedding. 2) Determine the method of mycobacterial quantitation that&#xD;
      will result in the least variable results. 3) Characterize the magnitude and kinetics of BCG&#xD;
      shedding after intradermal Tice® BCG administration at 4 different doses. Parent protocol to&#xD;
      sub-study 12-0096.&#xD;
