  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extreme obesity is present in 9% of the Canadian population. Extremely obese people have a&#xD;
      high chance of developing health problems and dying early. Our national guidelines recommend&#xD;
      that extremely obese individuals receive multidisciplinary treatment, meaning that a number&#xD;
      of specialized care providers should be available to help administer obesity treatments to&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators oversee a large obesity program called the Weight Wise Obesity Program,&#xD;
      which delivers multidisciplinary care at 5 sites in Alberta, Canada (Edmonton, Calgary, Grand&#xD;
      Prairie, Medicine Hat, Red Deer). Wait times to enter the Weight Wise clinics range from a&#xD;
      few months to three years depending on the site in Alberta. The investigators performed a&#xD;
      survey of the patients on the wait list in Edmonton and discovered that they self- report&#xD;
      extremely poor health and feel that the long wait times are partly responsible for this poor&#xD;
      health. To try to support these patients as they wait for multidisciplinary care, the&#xD;
      investigators designed a group based self-management intervention, consisting of Weight Wise&#xD;
      Community Modules. Patients attend this program over three months to receive weight&#xD;
      management education (diet, exercise, stress management, coping strategies).A web-based&#xD;
      version of the modules is also available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to determine if these modules delivered to patients prior to entering&#xD;
      the clinic help to reduce weight, improve quality of life in the wait listed patients and&#xD;
      also to see if going through the modules helps patients to be more ready for weight&#xD;
      management when they reach the Weight Wise clinic. The investigators also wish to examine&#xD;
      whether or not these modules are cost effective. If these modules are not useful, a more&#xD;
      effective way to support wait listed patients will be sought.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extreme obesity (body mass index ≥ 35 kg/m2) affects 9% of Canadians; has tripled in&#xD;
      prevalence in 3 decades; shortens life expectancy by 5-13 years; and is debilitating and&#xD;
      costly. Current guidelines recommend that extremely obese patients receive treatment&#xD;
      [consisting of intensive lifestyle modification ± bariatric (obesity) surgery] within a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary bariatric setting. However, in Canada and other publicly funded health care&#xD;
      settings, demand for multidisciplinary bariatric care far outstrips the capacity to provide&#xD;
      it and so patients often face protracted, multiyear wait times. A recent study examining 150&#xD;
      patients on the Edmonton wait list (done at a time when the wait was several years in&#xD;
      Edmonton) demonstrated that these patients self-report severely impaired health status&#xD;
      (similar to those with diabetes or COPD) and strongly feel that prolonged wait times are a&#xD;
      major contributor to their health impairments. To support these patients as they wait for&#xD;
      more definitive management, our multidisciplinary team of clinicians, allied health&#xD;
      professionals and decision makers have designed and implemented a Weight Wise Community&#xD;
      Module (WWCM) program, consisting of a 3-month, 10-session group-based weight self-management&#xD;
      intervention. In addition, a web-based version of the WWCM is now available. The WWCM program&#xD;
      teaches self-management skills to improve diet, increase physical activity, reduce stress and&#xD;
      increase self-efficacy - but it has not yet been evaluated. We are interested both in the&#xD;
      outcomes after three months and after the patient has gone through the weight management&#xD;
      clinic.The comparative clinical and cost-effectiveness of the in-person WWCM, web-based WWCM&#xD;
      and usual care are not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if an evidence-based weight-management program currently being delivered to&#xD;
      adult (age 18 years or greater) extremely obese patients wait-listed for multidisciplinary&#xD;
      bariatric (obesity) care in a population-based program improves clinical and humanistic&#xD;
      outcomes, and is cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 9-month study will use a pragmatic, prospective, randomized, controlled design in which&#xD;
      consenting extremely obese patients, newly wait listed for the Weight Wise Adult Clinic, will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned one of three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Weight Wise Community Modules delivered in person (9 modules delivered over 10&#xD;
           sessions).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Weight Wise Community Modules delivered on the web (13 modules, content is similar to&#xD;
           the in-person modules)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mailed Educational Pamphlets (including Canada's Guide to Health Living and tips on&#xD;
           self-management strategies and improving readiness-to-change).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study arm will be comprised of 220 patients (660 total).Randomization will be performed&#xD;
      independently of the research team by an independent organization, the EPICORE Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled at the point of referral to each zonal program. They will have 3&#xD;
      months to complete the modules or review the mailed educational materials. After this, they&#xD;
      will enter the weight management clinic in their zone. They will be followed by the study&#xD;
      team for an additional six months while they are in the weight management clinic. Study&#xD;
      outcomes assessments will occur at 3,6, and 9-months post randomization. If patients undergo&#xD;
      bariatric surgery during the follow-up period, data will still be collected but they may need&#xD;
      to be censored in the analysis.&#xD;
