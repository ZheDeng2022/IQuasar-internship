      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Some children and teenagers have conditions known as conduct disorders. They often have&#xD;
      long-term chronic behavior problems, such as defiant behavior or violence. Conduct disorders&#xD;
      are often treated with antipsychotic medication. Researchers want to study two types of newer&#xD;
      antipsychotics (aripiprizole and risperidone) for children and adolescents with conduct&#xD;
      disorders. They will look at how these drugs affect brain activity. To do so, they will give&#xD;
      brain activity tests using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The tests will compare the&#xD;
      results from healthy volunteer children and teens to those of others with behavior problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see how atypical antipsychotics affect brain activity of children and teenagers with&#xD;
      conduct disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children and teenagers between 10 and 18 years of age who have a conduct disorder and&#xD;
           are taking aripiprizole.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children and teenagers between 10 and 18 years of age who have a conduct disorder and&#xD;
           are taking risperidone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children and teenagers between 10 and 18 years of age who have a conduct disorder and&#xD;
           are not taking an atypical antipsychotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers between 10 and 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.&#xD;
           Parents/guardians will be asked questions about their child s feelings, experiences, and&#xD;
           behavior. Participants will also answer questions about their feelings and moods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will involve two visits. Each visit will involve MRI scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first visit, participants will have memory and thinking tests. The tests will&#xD;
           involve making decisions or playing games. Some of these tests will use MRI scanning to&#xD;
           look at brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second visit will be 3 to 5 months after the first visit. The tests from the first&#xD;
           visit will be repeated.&#xD;

      Objective: To determine the impact, as indexed by BOLD response, of the administration of&#xD;
      aripiprazole and risperidone during the treatment of Conduct Disorder (CD) on the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Youth with CD receiving aripiprazole at admission to Boys Town Omaha, youth&#xD;
      with CD receiving risperidone at admission to Boys Town Omaha, youth with CD not receiving&#xD;
      antipsychotics at admission to Boys Town Omaha, typically developing youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The study will involve a 4 (Group: CD receiving aripiprazole at admission, CD&#xD;
      receiving risperidone at admission, CD not receiving antipsychotics at admission, typically&#xD;
      developing youth) x 2 (Time: At admission vs. four months subsequent to admission [when&#xD;
      treatment for the antipsychotic groups will have been tapered off]) design. Principle&#xD;
      dependent measures will relate to BOLD response indices of the pathophysiology of CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: Principle dependent measures will relate to BOLD response indices of the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of CD. In addition, assessments of symptom severity will be collected, as&#xD;
      will measurements of cognitive function.&#xD;
