  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Triaging new pediatric gastroenterology consultations is challenging as both inflammatory and&#xD;
      non-inflammatory gastrointestinal (GI) diseases can present with non-specific chronic&#xD;
      abdominal pain and/or diarrhea. Examples of inflammatory GI diseases include Crohn's disease,&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis and celiac disease and non-inflammatory GI diseases lactose intolerance,&#xD;
      irritable bowel syndrome and non-ulcer dyspepsia. Inflammatory GI diseases require different&#xD;
      investigations and treatment than non-inflammatory GI diseases and ideally, would be&#xD;
      identified early. Higher priority triage of these patients would allow timely organization of&#xD;
      further investigations including pertinent laboratory testing, radiologic studies and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal endoscopies. These more invasive procedures are not needed in most patients&#xD;
      presenting with non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms. Therefore, the investigators do not&#xD;
      routinely ask for screening laboratory testing or other studies in children referred to our&#xD;
      clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive screening tests for GI disorders may aid in appropriately triaging new&#xD;
      consultations to pediatric gastroenterology. Calprotectin is a protein found in inflammatory&#xD;
      cells called neutrophils. The concentration of calprotectin in stool reflects the presence of&#xD;
      an inflammatory process occurring in the GI tract. Thus, testing for calprotectin has been&#xD;
      proposed as a potentially useful test for detecting some inflammatory GI diseases, most&#xD;
      notably Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Alternatively, a simple gastrointestinal&#xD;
      questionnaire of &quot;red flag&quot; symptoms and family history of GI disorders may also be of&#xD;
      benefit. The investigators hypothesize that the use of fecal calprotectin and a screening GI&#xD;
      questionnaire will aid in identifying children at higher risk of an inflammatory GI disorder.&#xD;
      Subsequently, higher priority triaging of these patients will decrease the time to diagnosis&#xD;
      of inflammatory GI disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single centre, stratified, randomized clinical trial conducted in Kingston,&#xD;
      Ontario, Canada. Patients referred to the pediatric gastroenterology service without a known&#xD;
      diagnosis for non-specific chronic abdominal pain and/or diarrhea will be asked to&#xD;
      participate in the study. All patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be consented by&#xD;
      telephone with a standard form. Consenting patients will be mailed the GI questionnaire and&#xD;
      the fecal calprotectin test kit. The fecal calprotectin test kid includes instructions, a&#xD;
      stool collection kit and return postage. All patients will be given the next available&#xD;
      appointment with a pediatric gastroenterologist. Patients will then be randomized to receive&#xD;
      either usual care (50%, 40 patients) or to have a screening fecal calprotectin (FC)&#xD;
      measurement (50%, 40 patients). Patients in the FC group will have FC measured by the Quantum&#xD;
      Blue® Rapid Calprotectin Assay. If the calprotectin level is high (above 50 μg/g), the&#xD;
      patient will be contacted again by telephone and given a new appointment time (within 14&#xD;
      working days). This study may have a positive impact by demonstrating a novel method for&#xD;
      decreasing the time to diagnosis of inflammatory GI disease.&#xD;
