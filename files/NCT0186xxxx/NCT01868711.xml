      Psychological mindedness(PM) is a metacognitive process in which the person uses his&#xD;
      cognitive and affective abilities to understand his thoughts, feelings, and his behaviors as&#xD;
      they interact with his internal experiences and his external experiences in the world. It&#xD;
      dynamically modifies his behavior to move towards self-actualization in a manner positive to&#xD;
      himself and the world. We investigate whether the assessment of PM can distinguish depressed&#xD;
      patients who benefit from CBT.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective psychotherapy for depression.&#xD;
      Yet, it is effective only for 40% of the depressed people who receive this treatment.&#xD;
      Currently, there is no method of predicting who can be helped among depressed patients by&#xD;
      CBT. In this study, we examine whether the level of psychological mindedness can predict who&#xD;
      may benefit from CBT among depressed patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are clinically depressed are randomized to 12 sessions of CBT and supportive&#xD;
      therapy. The evaluation process and all sessions will be administered virtually using&#xD;
      HIPAA-compliant video teleconferencing. Participants must have access to the internet and&#xD;
      have video conferencing capabilities. Besides the virtual sessions, participants will need to&#xD;
      come in person once for a urine &amp; blood test (protocol #6669) and twice for an&#xD;
      electroencephalogram (EEG) (protocol #6559).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Please exercise caution when traveling in public and follow public health guidelines, such as&#xD;
      wearing masks in public and avoiding crowds. It would be best if you stay informed of public&#xD;
      health recommendations and guidelines regarding COVID-19, such as those issued by the Centers&#xD;
      for Disease Control (CDC.gov) and local governments. If you have questions about how you will&#xD;
      travel for appointments or do not feel safe traveling, please let us know, and know that you&#xD;
      can call to reschedule visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to note that subjects who enroll in the study can't take any psychiatric&#xD;
      medications, nor can they attend any other psychotherapy besides what is offered in the&#xD;
      study. Should the participant decide to make alternations and use medication, this will not&#xD;
      affect their participation in psychotherapy or this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are eligible for the study will begin within two weeks after the evaluation&#xD;
      visit. An evaluator will rate the HDRS-17 and CG I-Severity. If they are still eligible, they&#xD;
      will sign the study consent form, have the study explained, including its risks and possible&#xD;
      benefits, as well as alternatives and its voluntary nature. Once they sign the consent form,&#xD;
      patients will complete a battery of self-report instruments online. Also, they will be&#xD;
      interviewed by a clinician with a structured clinical interview of PM. They will then be&#xD;
      randomized between CBT and supportive therapy (control group) and will schedule their weekly&#xD;
      virtual sessions with the study therapist. During 12 weeks, they will be clinically monitored&#xD;
      by Beck Depression Inventory at the beginning of every session and HDRS-17 every three weeks.&#xD;
      They will complete study measures at week six and after the 12 weeks sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants who do not remit (end treatment HDRS-17 &gt; 7) at the end of the CBT trial&#xD;
      will receive a referral for alternative psychotherapy per the patient's preference.&#xD;
