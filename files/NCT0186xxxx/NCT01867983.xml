    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial compares the effectiveness for both smoking cessation and&#xD;
      weight control of two alternative combined interventions offered via telephone quitline, as&#xD;
      compared to standard of care quitline treatment addressing cessation alone. The interventions&#xD;
      to be compared are cessation treatment alone versus cessation treatment combined with weight&#xD;
      control treatment added either simultaneously or sequentially.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking and obesity are the leading causes of preventable morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      in the U.S. Quitting smoking can lead to weight gain and obesity-related co-morbidities.&#xD;
      Quitlines provide a natural population-based laboratory to test innovative approaches to help&#xD;
      people quit smoking and control their weight. However, there is a lack of understanding of&#xD;
      the effectiveness of intervening on both smoking and weight at the same time. Thus, we&#xD;
      propose to test the impact on abstinence and weight control of adding an evidence-based&#xD;
      weight control intervention simultaneously with or sequentially (following) cessation&#xD;
      treatment via telephone quitlines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study, modeled on Co-I Dr. Bonnie Springs successful efficacy trial, is the first&#xD;
      attempt to replicate the findings using widely available phone and web-based programs. The&#xD;
      cessation program will be the effective and cost effective Quit For LifeÂ® quitline operated&#xD;
      by Alere Wellbeing. The weight management program will be the Weight Talk program operated by&#xD;
      Alere Wellbeing, also shown to be feasible, acceptable and effective in producing positive&#xD;
      changes in weight, eating behaviors and physical activity. We will be using 5 calls from the&#xD;
      Weight Talk program for the intervention content for the simultaneous and sequential arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed randomized controlled trial compares the effectiveness for both smoking&#xD;
      cessation and weight control of two alternative combined interventions offered via telephone&#xD;
      quitline, as compared to standard of care quitline treatment addressing cessation alone. The&#xD;
      interventions to be compared are cessation treatment alone versus cessation treatment&#xD;
      combined with weight control treatment added either simultaneously or sequentially. We&#xD;
      propose to recruit 2550 smokers who call a quitline and randomly assign them to one of three&#xD;
      groups: (a) Standard Care (STD): cessation treatment calls (5 proactive calls with a quit&#xD;
      coach followed by 5 contact control calls); (b) Simultaneous: weight control treatment&#xD;
      simultaneous with cessation treatment (5 proactive calls with a quit coach combined with&#xD;
      weight coach/nutritionist followed by 5 'contact control calls'), or (c) Sequential: weight&#xD;
      control treatment added after cessation treatment (5 proactive calls with a quit coach&#xD;
      followed by 5 weight coach/nutritionist calls). All three interventions include a total of 10&#xD;
      phone counseling calls, interactive web, mailed support materials, access to nicotine&#xD;
      replacement therapy (NRT) and unlimited participant-initiated calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: This study is novel. Combining two phone/web based behavior change programs&#xD;
      together has never been tested. A cost-effective, population-based strategy for delivering a&#xD;
      combined smoking cessation and weight control intervention stands to make a significant&#xD;
      impact. The option of new telephone counseling that helps smokers quit and control their&#xD;
      weight could encourage smokers to call quitlines who otherwise might not because they are&#xD;
      concerned about gaining weight. Combined smoking and weight treatment could also increase&#xD;
      abstinence rates over current best-practice treatment and do so without weight gained its&#xD;
      adverse consequences. Moreover, if effective, the intervention could rapidly be disseminated&#xD;
      to the 500,000 smokers who use quitlines annually in the U.S., a large proportion of whom are&#xD;
      obese.&#xD;
