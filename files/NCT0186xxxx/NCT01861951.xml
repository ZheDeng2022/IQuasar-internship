  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a locally advanced or metastatic (i.e., there are already metastases of the&#xD;
      diagnosed tumor in the body outside the primary lesion) soft tissue sarcoma will be recruited&#xD;
      for this study. The minimum age to enter the study is 60 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy with doxorubicin is the mainstay of palliative chemotherapy for these patients, which&#xD;
      is associated with hematological toxicity and an increase of the infection rate. Pazopanib is&#xD;
      known to rarely induce hematological toxicity or to trigger infection. We therefore assume&#xD;
      that pazopanib exerts similar activity while decreasing neutropenia and neutropenic fever.&#xD;
      Pazopanib is already approved in the U.S. and Europe for the treatment of advanced soft&#xD;
      tissue sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doxorubicin and pazopanib will be randomly allocated to either receive doxorubicin or&#xD;
      pazopanib in a phase II clinical trial. The aim of this study is to measure the treatment&#xD;
      effect (reduction in tumor size or tumor stabilization) for both drugs, as well as the&#xD;
      survival rate, and the duration of tumor control by the different therapies. A further&#xD;
      objective is to measure the quality of life by standardized questionnaires throughout the&#xD;
      course of treatment.&#xD;
