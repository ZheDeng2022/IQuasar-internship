      This study will involve filling teeth which have decay on their roots with three different&#xD;
      filling materials. Patients will attend Cork University Dental School and hospital for a&#xD;
      clinical examination and to complete a questionnaire describing how they feel about the&#xD;
      comfort and appearance of their teeth. Patients will be asked to provide a sample of saliva&#xD;
      by spitting into a tube. This saliva will be tested to see what levels of bacteria are&#xD;
      present and how well their saliva neutralises acid in their diet. This is used to assess how&#xD;
      high or low the patient's risk of dental decay is. They will also complete a questionnaire&#xD;
      about the amount of sugar in their diet and how often they clean their teeth. If the exam&#xD;
      shows that any teeth are so decayed that they cannot be filled, the patient will then be&#xD;
      offered extraction of these teeth. All treatment will be discussed with the patient. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned one of the three materials and this material will be used for their&#xD;
      fillings. Patients will not know which of the three materials they received but all three&#xD;
      materials are already in use in dentistry and all of the elements of each treatment plan are&#xD;
      well recognised, routine dental procedures. After all the treatment has been completed, each&#xD;
      patient will be shown how best to take care of their teeth and how to manage their sugar&#xD;
      intake to reduce their risk of further decay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be given appointments to return for review at 6 months, 12 months, 18 months&#xD;
      and 24 months after treatment. This will include a dental examination and dental impressions&#xD;
      will be taken. These are used to measure how the restorative materials wear over time.&#xD;
      Patients will also be asked to complete again the two questionnaires that they completed at&#xD;
      their first visit to see if any of their answers have changed.&#xD;

      Randomized Clinical Trial This study is a prospective study of older adults. It will assess&#xD;
      the suitability of BiodentineTM as a filling material for Class V lesions and compare it's&#xD;
      performance to that of Glass ionomer cement (GIC) and Resin-modified glass ionomer cement&#xD;
      (RMGIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients for the study will attend Cork University Dental School and Hospital. These patients&#xD;
      will represent a sample of the population of elderly who are generally well and able to care&#xD;
      for themselves independently as well as adhere to a given maintenance programme. The general&#xD;
      methods are outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Approval Ethical approval has been obtained from the Research Ethics Committee of the&#xD;
      Cork Teaching Hospitals (CREC) for the recruitment, sampling, and treatment of elderly&#xD;
      patients. Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      For inclusion in this research patients will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be either male or female aged 65 or over&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Present a minimum of 6 teeth in one arch&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have sufficient manual dexterity to undertake tooth-brushing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have sufficient cognitive ability to understand consent procedures and be able to&#xD;
           complete a questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will not be eligible for inclusion if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They are medically frail (ASA III or IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They have pulpal involvement or painful symptomology other than sensitivity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They have severe periodontal disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They require antibiotic prophylaxis for invasive dental treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Recruitment (Phase 1) Prospective patients will be approached whilst attending Cork&#xD;
      University Dental School and Hospital. General medical and dental practitioners in Cork will&#xD;
      also be given information regarding the study to distribute to patients that may be suitable.&#xD;
      A number of social clubs will also be approached. They will receive all the information in&#xD;
      writing including the inclusion criteria as well as a consent form. If they indicate a&#xD;
      willingness to participate, they will be offered an examination appointment. Insurance will&#xD;
      be provided under the Clinical Indemnity Scheme, University College Cork.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Examination Procedure The clinical examination procedure will determine the extent&#xD;
      of dental disease and confirm the suitability of the patient for enrolment in the study.&#xD;
      Clinical data will be collected by a suitably trained examiner. This examiner will also&#xD;
      provide the restorative treatment to the patients in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the initial examination the following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of teeth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visually decayed, missing and filled teeth (VDMFT) index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visually decayed and filled root surfaces (RDFT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plaque score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bleeding score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Community Periodontal Index (CPI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Salivary flow rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Salivary buffer capacity (using CRT®buffer kits)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Strep mutans count (using CRT®bacteria kits)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lactobacilli count (using CRT®bacteria kits)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Denture wearing (Acrylic/Co-Cr, age of denture, abutment teeth)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluoride exposure (public/private water supply, toothpaste, mouthwash)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medications (xerostomic potential, sucrose containing)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of sugar intake&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dental attendance pattern&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alcohol consumption&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical History&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiographs (where clinically indicated) The patient will be given another appointment&#xD;
           to return if they are accepted into the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Intervention (Phase 2) Each patient will be randomly assigned (using random number&#xD;
      allocation) to be filled with one of three filling materials; Glass Ionomer Cement (GIC),&#xD;
      Resin Modified Glass Ionomer Cement (RMGIC) and BiodentineTM. Treatment groups will be&#xD;
      randomized and adjusted for the covariates age, gender and caries experience. Once it has&#xD;
      been determined which filling material is to be placed in each lesion the treatment&#xD;
      intervention stage will proceed as follows;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Scaling/prophylaxis to remove plaque and calculus&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Removal of carious tissue from Class V lesions with hand or rotary instruments and&#xD;
           restoration of the resulting cavities with the randomly assigned filling material&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will then be given review appointments for 6 months, one year, 18 months and two years.&#xD;
      They will be sent appointment cards with the date of the next appointment by post and a phone&#xD;
      call to confirm it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review Appointment (Phase 3) At each review appointment the following data will be gathered;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Survival and integrity of the restorations (according to USPHS Criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Wear rates of the restorations (by means of dental impressions and contact profilometry)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding A suitably trained examiner will assess the survival and integrity of the&#xD;
      restorations placed by the principal investigator to eliminate potential bias.&#xD;
