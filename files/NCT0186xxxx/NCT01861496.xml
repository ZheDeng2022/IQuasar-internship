  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liposomal formulations are frequently used today in the treatment of cancer. LiPlaCis is the&#xD;
      first targeted liposomal formulation with a tumour triggered release mechanism to undergo&#xD;
      clinical development in oncology and it is expected that LiPlaCis will improve the&#xD;
      therapeutic index of cisplatin compared to conventional cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cisplatin is one of the most widely used drugs in the treatment of cancer due to its&#xD;
      documented efficacy in a number of tumour types. Furthermore, it seems highly likely that&#xD;
      cisplatin will remain an important drug in the future treatment of cancer. However, the drug&#xD;
      is associated with a number of serious toxicities that complicates or necessitates&#xD;
      discontinuation of therapy - e.g. need for pre-hydration, neurotoxicity, nausea and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, there is a well-established need for improving cisplatin therapy in cancer patients.&#xD;
      One option here is improving the formulation of the drug, so that a more selective up-take of&#xD;
      cisplatin administered takes place at the tumour sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results of the pre-clinical studies of LiPlaCis, it seems clear that LiPlaCis&#xD;
      offers the potential to improve cisplatin therapy to the benefits of cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prematurely stopped Phase I Dutch study a Recommended Dose (RD) for a Phase II study was&#xD;
      never reached which was the aim of the finished Phase I dose escalating part of this study&#xD;
      for advanced or refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Phase 2 part of this study, patients with advanced breast cancer with a biopsy&#xD;
      examination showing a pattern compatible with sensitivity to LiPlaCis or patients with skin&#xD;
      cancer will be included.&#xD;
