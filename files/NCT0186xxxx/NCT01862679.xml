  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common forms of renal replacement therapy currently in use are high flux&#xD;
      haemodialysis (HF-HD) and haemodiafiltration (HDF). Although these techniques appear similar&#xD;
      to the patient, there are important differences in what happens to the blood as it travels&#xD;
      through the dialysis machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During HDF, the machine controls hydrostatic pressure across the dialyser to remove&#xD;
      additional water together with toxins from the blood and this fluid volume is continually&#xD;
      replaced with an ultra-pure solution. HDF has a theoretical advantage removing more waste&#xD;
      substances, especially larger molecules, from the blood than HF-HD which may be of benefit to&#xD;
      the patient in the medium to long term.Despite the theoretical advantages, trials have so far&#xD;
      been unable to find any significant difference in death rates or the development of health&#xD;
      problems among patients on HDF or HF-HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore important to examine other factors which may help doctors and patients to&#xD;
      decide which treatment to use. The investigators have designed a study which aims to answer&#xD;
      three main questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does HDF make patients feel better?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is blood pressure more stable on HDF in comparison with HF-HD?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Are Phosphate levels and other blood parameters better controlled with HDF than HF-HD?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will do this by randomly assigning patients on HF-HD to receive 2 months of&#xD;
      either HF-HD or HDF with as equivalent treatment prescriptions as possible and without the&#xD;
      patient knowing which treatment they are receiving. After two months the patients will switch&#xD;
      to the alternative form of dialysis for a further two months. During the study the&#xD;
      investigators will ask the patients how long it took them to recover from the preceding&#xD;
      session of dialysis, assess the frequency of symptomatic low blood pressure and also perform&#xD;
      blood tests at set intervals to measure specific blood parameters.&#xD;

    <description>During Haemodiafiltration, the dialysis machine removes more water from the blood than during &quot;normal&quot; hemodialysis. The additional liquid is continually replaced with an ultra-pure solution. Thus, the machine exchanges a high volume of fluid during treatment and removes the liquid together with toxins from the blood.</description>
