    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the&#xD;
      combination of everolimus with TheraSphere that can be given to patients with advanced NETs&#xD;
      that have spread to the liver. The safety of everolimus and TheraSphere will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everolimus is designed to block a protein inside the cancer cells, which is also involved in&#xD;
      cancer growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TheraSphere is a medical device containing a radioactive material called yttrium-90 (Y-90).&#xD;
      Tiny glass beads called microspheres are filled with Y-90 and then injected through an artery&#xD;
      directly into the liver. This allows a large dose of radiation to be given directly to the&#xD;
      tumor, which may lower the risk of side effects from the radiation to other parts of the body&#xD;
      and/or to healthy liver tissue. The radiation from TheraSphere stays in the body and begins&#xD;
      to lose its effect within 12 days. The glass microspheres will stay in the body from that&#xD;
      point on. The radiation will eventually decay (go away). By the time a participant leaves the&#xD;
      hospital, the amount of radiation outside of the body will be low enough to not be a threat&#xD;
      to others.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patient is are found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will be assigned to a&#xD;
      dose level of everolimus based on when they joined this study. Up to 3 dose levels of&#xD;
      everolimus will be tested. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The&#xD;
      first group of participants will receive the low dose level. Each new group will receive a&#xD;
      higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. If&#xD;
      intolerable side effects are seen, the dose may be lowered. This will continue until the&#xD;
      highest tolerable dose of everolimus is found. After that, 10 additional participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled at the highest tolerable dose that was found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose level of TheraSphere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 1, 2 weeks before the TheraSphere procedure, patient will start taking&#xD;
      everolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will take 1-2 tablets of everolimus by mouth 1 time every day. Patient will take the&#xD;
      everolimus tablets with a glass of water in the morning at the same time every day. The&#xD;
      tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed or crushed. The tablets may be taken either&#xD;
      always with or always without food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patient vomits after taking their dose, they should not take another tablet that day. It&#xD;
      is very important that patients take the tablets given to them just as the study doctor tells&#xD;
      them and that they do not miss any tablets. If patient does forget to take it one day, they&#xD;
      should not take any extra doses the next day. Instead, patient should contact their doctor&#xD;
      and ask for advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the days of patient's study visits, they should take their dose of everolimus at the&#xD;
      clinic, not at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TheraSphere Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 2 weeks before the TheraSphere procedure, patient will have an angiogram. An angiogram&#xD;
      is an imaging test that uses contrast dye to help the doctor look at the body's blood&#xD;
      vessels. Patient will be given drugs by vein in their arm or hand to help them relax, but&#xD;
      patient will stay awake during the procedure. An area in patient's groin will be numbed with&#xD;
      anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the procedure, the doctor will insert a catheter into a blood vessel in patient's&#xD;
      groin that leads to their liver. Dye will be injected into the catheter, and a series of&#xD;
      x-rays will be taken that will allow the doctor to see the blood vessels in patient's liver.&#xD;
      At the end of the procedure, the catheter will be removed from patient's groin area. The&#xD;
      x-rays taken will be looked at by patient's doctor to plan for their TheraSphere procedure.&#xD;
      The angiogram procedure should take about 1½ to 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 15 of Cycle 1, patient will receive TheraSphere. Before the procedure, patient will be&#xD;
      given drugs by vein in their arm or hand to help them relax, but patient will stay awake&#xD;
      during the procedure. An area in patient's groin will be numbed with anesthetic. Patient may&#xD;
      ask the study staff for information about how the anesthesia drugs are given and their risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doctor will insert a catheter into a blood vessel in patient's groin that leads to their&#xD;
      liver. Based on the planning from patient's angiogram procedure, the doctor will guide the&#xD;
      catheter to the target blood vessel. Once the catheter is in the proper blood vessel, the&#xD;
      TheraSphere microspheres containing Y-90 will be injected into the catheter to reach the&#xD;
      tumor in the liver. After the TheraSphere microspheres are injected, the catheter will be&#xD;
      removed from patient's groin. The entire procedure will take about 1½ to 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving the TheraSphere microspheres, patient will stay in the recovery area for&#xD;
      several hours so that the staff can check patient for possible side effects. If patient has&#xD;
      any serious side effects, they may be admitted to the hospital to be checked on and for&#xD;
      treatment, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before all visits, patient must fast starting at midnight the night before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 1, if the tests have not been done in the last 5 days:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient will have a physical exam, including measurement of their weight and vital&#xD;
           signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient will be asked about any symptoms they may have had and any drugs they may be&#xD;
           taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and tumor marker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If patient's doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to&#xD;
           check for hepatitis B and/or C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 14 or 15 of Cycle 1:&#xD;

           taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 3 and every 3-6 weeks after that, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be&#xD;
      drawn to check for hepatitis B and/or C if the doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 2, 4, and every 3 cycles after that, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be&#xD;
      drawn for tumor marker testing and additional routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 4 and beyond, urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 4 and every 3 cycles after that, patient will have a CT scan, MRI, and/or&#xD;
      x-ray to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Dosing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will receive TheraSphere on Day 15 of Cycle 1 and they may continue taking everolimus&#xD;
      for up to 12 cycles, as long as the doctor thinks it is in patient's best interest. Patient&#xD;
      will no longer be able to take everolimus if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side&#xD;
      effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;

           signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient will be asked about any side effects they may have had.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and tumor marker testing.&#xD;
           This blood draw will include a pregnancy test if patient can become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient will have a CT scan, MRI, and/or x-ray to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         12. The effects of TheraSphere and everolimus on the developing human fetus are unknown.&#xD;
             For this reason, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use highly effective&#xD;
             contraception from the time of study enrollment continuing for the duration of study&#xD;
             therapy and for 8 weeks after the last dose of TheraSphere and/or everolimus. Women of&#xD;

             sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of&#xD;
             sperm in the ejaculate). [For female subjects on the study, the vasectomised male&#xD;
             partner should be the sole partner for that subject.]; 4) Use of a combination of any&#xD;
             two of the following (a+b or a+c or b+c): a. Use of oral, injected, implanted or other&#xD;
             hormonal methods of contraception; b. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or&#xD;
             intrauterine system (IUS); c. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Continuation of # 13: In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been&#xD;
             stable on the oral agent before taking study treatment. Sexually active males must use&#xD;
             a condom during intercourse while taking the drug and for 8 weeks after stopping&#xD;
             treatment and should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be&#xD;
             used also by vasectomised men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal&#xD;
             fluid. Female partners of male patients must also be advised to use one of the&#xD;
             following contraception methods: Use of (1) oral, injected, implanted or other&#xD;
             hormonal methods of contraception, or (2) intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine&#xD;
             system (IUS), or (3) prior male/female sterilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Women of childbearing potential must have a serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior&#xD;
             starting study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
