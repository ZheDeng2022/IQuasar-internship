      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - RM-493 is a drug that stimulates parts of the brain that control eating and metabolism. It&#xD;
      has helped to reduce body weight and improve insulin sensitivity in lab tests. However, it is&#xD;
      not fully known whether RM-493 causes weight loss by just decreasing appetite or by&#xD;
      increasing metabolism or both. Researchers want to see how RM-493 affects metabolism and&#xD;
      hormones that affect the metabolic rate. They also want to see how RM-493 affects appetite by&#xD;
      assessing feelings of hunger and fullness. They will study this drug in people who are obese&#xD;
      but are otherwise in good health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see how RM-493 affects metabolic rate and appetite in obese but otherwise healthy&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 50 years old who are obese (body mass index between 30 and 40&#xD;
      kg/m2) but are otherwise healthy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study consists of three phases. The first phase is the screening visit. The second&#xD;
           phase is an 8-day inpatient stay. The final phase is a follow-up phone call one week&#xD;
           after the end of the second phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be divided into two groups. One group will receive the study drug&#xD;
           first, followed by a placebo. The other group will receive the placebo followed by the&#xD;
           study drug. The study drug and placebo will be given under the skin for 3 days each by a&#xD;
           small device (OmniPod) that normally is used to give insulin to people with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected. They will also meet with a dietitian. The OmniPod device will&#xD;
           be demonstrated before use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have the following procedures during their 8-day inpatient stay:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily exercise routine (walking on treadmill) after setting a comfortable pace (miles&#xD;
           per hour) during an exercise test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wear physical activity monitors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body composition study to measure amounts of fat and muscle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calorie controlled study diet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study drug/placebo dose through the OmniPod (Days 2 through 4 and 5 through 7)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metabolic rate studies using a cart or the metabolic chamber&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily blood samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine collection for 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions about weight history and appetite&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  About a week after the inpatient stay, participants will have a followup phone call to&#xD;
           ask about any side effects from the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a chronic relapsing health problem and a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes,&#xD;
      hypertension, heart disease and stroke. Life expectancy is shorter in obese individuals who&#xD;
      often suffer from costly related co-morbidities such as certain cancers, liver disease,&#xD;
      osteoarthritis, sleep apnea and depression. Weight loss improves the co-morbidities. Diet and&#xD;
      exercise are effective in the short term, but are rarely effective over a span of years. New&#xD;
      therapies are needed especially for patients with obesity. The melanocortin system, and&#xD;
      specifically, melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) is involved in the regulation of energy&#xD;
      homeostasis and body weight. This role is validated in human genetic mutations, and in animal&#xD;
      models of obesity, stimulation of MC4R reduces food intake and increases metabolic rate,&#xD;
      causing a reduction in body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RM-493 is a potent, selective peptide agonist for the MC4R that suppressed food intake and&#xD;
      reduced body weight in preclinical studies. RM-493 has been studied in single dose and&#xD;
      multiple ascending dose clinical studies in obese volunteers. This study is a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, 2-period, crossover study to assess the&#xD;
      effects of RM-493 on resting energy expenditure measured in a room calorimeter. Twelve obese&#xD;
      but otherwise healthy adult subjects between the ages of 18 and 50 inclusive, will be&#xD;
      enrolled and randomized to one of 2 treatment sequences (RM-493 then placebo; or placebo then&#xD;
      RM-493) over an 8-day study interval. Components of 24-hour energy expenditure, exercise&#xD;
      induced energy expenditure, spontaneous physical activity, respiratory quotient, safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic data will be collected.&#xD;

        and exclusion criteria will be eligible for enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide written informed consent prior to any study procedures, and be willing&#xD;
             and able to comply with study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index of 30-40 kg/m(2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are medically healthy with normal or clinically insignificant screening&#xD;

             examination)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects must have negative serum or urine pregnancy tests and must not be&#xD;
             lactating. For females able to bear children, a hormonal (i.e., oral, implantable, or&#xD;
             injectable) and single-barrier method, or a double-barrier method of birth control or&#xD;
             abstinence must be used/ practiced throughout the study. Female subjects unable to&#xD;
             bear children must have this documented in the case report form (CRF) (i.e., tubal&#xD;
             ligation, hysterectomy, or post-menopausal [defined as a minimum of one year since the&#xD;
             last menstrual period]). Post-menopausal status will be confirmed by follicle&#xD;
             stimulating hormone (FSH).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to administering the&#xD;
             OmniPod in both Period 1 and Period 2 to continue in the study.&#xD;

             acceptable forms of contraception as described above, with one of the two forms being&#xD;
             condom with spermicide, from the Screening Period through the follow up phone call&#xD;
             after completion of study treatment. Males with female partners of childbearing&#xD;
             potential who themselves are surgically sterile (status post vasectomy) must agree to&#xD;
             use condoms with spermicide over the same period of time.&#xD;
