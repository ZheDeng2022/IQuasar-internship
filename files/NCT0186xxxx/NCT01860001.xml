      The aim of this study is to define the incidence and nature of acidosis after major surgery&#xD;
      using Figge's equations to directly measure acidosis. This study will also aim to compare the&#xD;
      ability of indirect measures (base deficit, anion gap,corrected anion gap and lactate) to&#xD;
      identify the presence of tissue acids in this population. The incidence of postoperative&#xD;
      ketoacidosis as a contributor to tissue acidosis will be assessed through the use of point of&#xD;
      care urinalysis.&#xD;

      Metabolic acidosis is a frequent occurrence following major surgery. Monitoring acid base&#xD;
      disturbances and in particular diagnosing the aetiology of the acidosis are important parts&#xD;
      of assessing a patient's cardiovascular status following surgery. The presence of a metabolic&#xD;
      acidosis is frequently attributed to anaerobic metabolism leading to the generation of lactic&#xD;
      acid due to hypovolaemia and poor tissue perfusion. This commonly results in clinicians&#xD;
      treating postoperative patients with a metabolic acidosis by administering intravenous fluids&#xD;
      containing 0.9% saline or Hartmann's solution (compound sodium lactate). If the cause of the&#xD;
      metabolic acidosis is not hypovolaemia, treatment with intravenous fluids may actually&#xD;
      exacerbate the acidosis by causing hyperchloraemia. An often overlooked cause of metabolic&#xD;
      acidosis after surgery is starvation leading to ketoacidosis. All patients are starved for a&#xD;
      minimum of six hours prior to general anaesthesia due to the potential risk of aspiration of&#xD;
      gastric contents into the bronchial tree. Many patients are in fact fasted for much longer&#xD;
      periods than this. There is, however, little data describing the incidence of ketoacidosis&#xD;
      following surgery. In addition, there may be other causes of acidosis after surgery which&#xD;
      often overlooked but can be determined using equations and mathematical models. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to define the incidence and nature of acidosis after major cancer surgery using&#xD;
      using equations to directly determine acids. This study will also aim to compare the ability&#xD;
      of commonly used indirect measures (base deficit, anion gap, corrected anion gap and lactate)&#xD;
      to identify the presence of tissue acids in this population. The incidence of postoperative&#xD;
      ketoacidosis as a contributor to tissue acidosis will be assessed through the use of point of&#xD;
      care urinalysis.&#xD;
