    <textblock>
      This research study is a prospective pilot study. The purpose of a pilot clinical study is to&#xD;
      obtain preliminary data to support the reason for doing a larger clinical trial on testing&#xD;
      the clinical effectiveness of an investigational intervention. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that&#xD;
      the role of MET-PET scans is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find&#xD;
      out more about it. It also means that the FDA has not approved this intervention for your&#xD;
      type cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating whether or not MET-PET scans have&#xD;
      value in predicting response to standard chemoradiation therapy in participants with&#xD;
      newly-diagnosed glioblastoma. A standard treatment for glioblastoma is treatment with a&#xD;
      combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy with the drug temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In PET scans, a radioactive substance is injected into the body. The scanning machine finds&#xD;
      the radioactive substance, which tends to go to cancer cells. With standard PET scans, the&#xD;
      radioactive substance used is FDG. FDG goes to many areas of the normal brain which makes it&#xD;
      difficult for use in distinguishing brain tumors from normal tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the PET scans in this research study, the investigators are using a radioactive substance&#xD;
      called MET, instead of the standard substance FDG. MET gets absorbed by cancer cells but not&#xD;
      by normal brain and therefore may be better than FDG in evaluating brain tumors and therefore&#xD;
      may be better than FDG in evaluating brain tumors and their response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, participants will receive standard chemotherapy and radiation therapy&#xD;
      for glioblastoma as well as standard MRI scans. In addition, participants will undergo&#xD;
      L-[Methyl]-11C Methionine Positron Emission Tomography (MET-PET) scans twice. The first&#xD;
      MET-PET scan will occur after enrollment but prior to radiation therapy. The second MET-PET&#xD;
      scan will occur approximately one month after completion of radiation therapy.&#xD;

      After agreeing to take part in this research study you will be asked to undergo some&#xD;
      screening tests or procedures to confirm that you are eligible. Many of these tests and&#xD;
      procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out&#xD;
      that you do not take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or&#xD;
      procedure recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. The screening process will&#xD;
      include the following: A medical history, performance status, physical exam, routine blood&#xD;
      tests, assessment of your tumor, diagnosis confirmation and pregnancy test. If these tests&#xD;
      show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the study&#xD;
      treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to participate&#xD;
      in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 3 weeks after your surgery you will undergo a MET-PET scan to define residual&#xD;
      metabolic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of radiation therapy at 1,3,5,7,9 and 11 months following radiation therapy&#xD;
      you will undergo: a medical history, physical exam, assessment of your tumor by MRI,&#xD;
      documentation of your current dose of steroids, blood tests and an evaluation for side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At one month after the completion of radiation therapy you will undergo the second and final&#xD;
      MET-PET scan to assess response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 11 month follow-up visit, we would like to keep track of your medical condition for&#xD;
      the rest of your life as part of our routine care. If we no longer see you in person in the&#xD;
      clinic, we would like to do this by calling you on the telephone once a year to see how you&#xD;
      are doing. Keeping in touch with you and checking your condition every year helps us look at&#xD;
      the long-term effects of the research study.&#xD;

The persistence ratio (PR) is the percentage of residual metabolic tumor volume remaining after chemoradiation therapy and will be determined using the following equation: (volume of metabolic tumor on post-treatment scan at original site of disease)/(volume of metabolic tumor on pre-treatment MET-PETC-11 methionine PET scan).</description>
