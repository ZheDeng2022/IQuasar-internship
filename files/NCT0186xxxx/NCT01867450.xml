      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Diesel fuel is the most commonly used fuel to power cars and trucks worldwide. However,&#xD;
      diesel exhaust fumes can have harmful effects on the body. Researchers are interested in&#xD;
      studying how diesel exhaust exposure can affect lung health. To study these effects,&#xD;
      researchers will look at employees of a diesel truck engine testing facility in China. Some&#xD;
      workers at this facility are exposed to high levels of diesel exhaust. This study will&#xD;
      compare tests and monitoring information from a group of highly exposed workers and a similar&#xD;
      group of unexposed comparable controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the effects of diesel exhaust on lung health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be drawn from a diesel truck engine testing facility and other&#xD;
           workplaces in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who work in workshops with diesel fuel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who work in workshops that do not use diesel fuel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depending on what type of factory study subjects work in, participants will wear&#xD;
           personal air pumps and small badges on their clothing on one or more days. This&#xD;
           equipment will measure particles, chemicals, and other compounds in the air. This&#xD;
           information plus other information collected in the study including workplace practices&#xD;
           will be used to estimate exposure to diesel exhaust among study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide a number of study samples. These samples include blood, urine,&#xD;
           and sputum. To collect other samples, participants will also have a mouth rinse, cheek&#xD;
           cell scrapes, and nasal cell scrapes. They will also have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study. Participants will receive&#xD;
           financial compensation for participation in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch has a long history of conducting&#xD;
      research on the carcinogenicity of diesel exhaust exposure. Most recently, a 20 year effort&#xD;
      in collaboration with NIOSH has resulted in a seminal publication showing a dose-response&#xD;
      relationship between air levels of elemental carbon, a surrogate for diesel exhaust, and risk&#xD;
      of lung cancer in underground miners (Silverman et al. 2012). This study made a critically&#xD;
      important contribution to the recent IARC decision to categorize diesel exhaust as a Group I&#xD;
      carcinogen. Despite years of experimental studies, and small and limited workplace biomarker&#xD;
      studies, there are still major uncertainties about the mechanism by which diesel exhaust&#xD;
      causes lung cancer in humans. To address this gap in knowledge, we have identified a diesel&#xD;
      truck engine testing facility in China, where workers are exposed to very high levels of&#xD;
      diesel exhaust, which provides what we believe to be the very best opportunity to conduct a&#xD;
      study to provide new insights into diesel exhaust carcinogenesis. We propose to carry out a&#xD;
      cross-sectional molecular epidemiology study of 50 highly exposed workers in this facility&#xD;
      and 50 unexposed comparable controls to study potential mechanisms of action for diesel&#xD;
      exhaust exposure. These include upper-airway nitro-PAH-DNA adducts; inflammatory effects&#xD;
      determined by alterations in cytokines and related markers that have been linked&#xD;
      prospectively to risk of lung cancer; and alterations in gene expression in a wide range of&#xD;
      potentially relevant pathways.&#xD;

        This is a cross-sectional molecular epidemiologic study of workers exposed to diesel&#xD;
        exhaust in an enginetesting facility. These workers, all of whom are male, spend most of&#xD;
        their shift in direct proximity to the engine being tested and as a consequence have&#xD;
        potential for exposure to substantial levels of diesel exhaust. Fifty male workers will be&#xD;
        selected who are non-smokers or light smokers (&lt; 10 cigarettes per day) and who have worked&#xD;
        in the testing facility for the longest amount of time. Fifty male controls,&#xD;
        frequency-matched to the exposed workers by age and smoking status (i.e., never, former,&#xD;
        current light smoking) will be identified in factories that work in the same local region&#xD;
        of China with work processes that do not involve exposure to diesel exhaust, other types of&#xD;
        particulates, or any known or suspected@@@genotoxic, hematotoxic, or immunotoxic chemicals.&#xD;
