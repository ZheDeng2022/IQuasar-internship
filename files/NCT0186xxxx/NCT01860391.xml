      The aim of the study is to measure salivary fluoride and silver levels up to 7 days&#xD;
      post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be 6 healthy adults. They will be given a fluoride free toothpaste to&#xD;
      use the day before the study and all during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 participants will have 6 teeth treated (Group A).3 participants will have 28 teeth treated&#xD;
      each on the facial aspect (Group B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 0, the participant will be given 25 ml of de-ionized fluoride free water to swish in&#xD;
      the mouth and spit the entire contents into a 50 ml collection tube. This will be done 3&#xD;
      times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 0, 10 minutes after the rinsing and spitting, the participant will provide a&#xD;
      unstimulated salivary sample into a universal collection tube until 5 ml are collected. The&#xD;
      tubes with saliva will be stored on ice and then frozen at -20oC for transfer to the lab at&#xD;
      the University of Washington.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 0, Isolation and application of silver fluoride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quadrant will be isolated with cotton rolls, and surrounding gingiva will be covered with&#xD;
      petroleum jelly to provide additional protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After application, participant will be given 25 ml of fluoride free water to rinse as in 1&#xD;
      above and water collected. This will be done 10 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DAY 1-6 Salivary Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures: Fluoride will be measured using standard fluoride electrode analysis (Martinez-Mier&#xD;
      et al., 2011). Silver will be measured using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry&#xD;
      (EPA 6020a Rev.1 2007) at the University of Washington&#xD;

      Aim: to measure salivary fluoride and silver levels up to 7 days post-treatment. Based on&#xD;
      extrapolation of the study by Vasquez and colleagues (2012), it is hypothesized that 7-day&#xD;
      levels in the clinical study will not exceed baseline values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 6 healthy adults of either sex, 21+ years old, who do not have gingivitis but&#xD;
      who have generalized gingival recession &gt;1mm, 3 subjects must have at least 28 teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given a fluoride free toothpaste to use the day before the study and all&#xD;
      during the study. Participants will be reminded not to use fluoride toothpaste or other&#xD;
      fluoride products and to avoid fish and tea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No toothbrushing or eating at all within an hour of any visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Observational study with each participant as his/her own control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 participants will 6 treated (Group A).3 participants will have 28 teeth treated each on the&#xD;
      facial aspect (Group B). Teeth with anterior fillings or decay at the gingival where staining&#xD;
      would show will not be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 0 Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. On day 0, the participant will be given 25 ml of de-ionized fluoride free water to swish&#xD;
           in the mouth and spit the entire contents into a 50 ml collection tube. This will be&#xD;
           done 3 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. On day 0, 10 minutes after the rinsing and spitting, the participant will provide a&#xD;
           unstimulated salivary sample. The individual will be instructed to swallow once, and&#xD;
           allow saliva to pool in the mouth without swallowing, and then periodically spit the&#xD;
           saliva into a universal collection tube until 5 ml are collected. The tubes with saliva&#xD;
           will be stored on ice and then frozen at -20oC for transfer to the lab at the University&#xD;
           of Washington.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Day 0, Isolation and application of silver fluoride.&#xD;
&#xD;
           GROUP A (6 TEETH): 18 mcL will be expressed from a Hamilton syringe into a dappen dish,&#xD;
           and then a single preweighed microbrush will be used to apply the material to the tooth&#xD;
           surface after drying with cotton gauze. The 6 teeth will be treated consecutively until&#xD;
           all the material in the dappen dish will be used. Then the brush will be reweighed to&#xD;
           establish the non-applied amount.&#xD;
&#xD;
           GROUP B (28 TEETH) Measure out 3 mcL X number of teeth present into dappen dish.&#xD;
           Procedure is the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Application of silver fluoride. The quadrant will be isolated with cotton rolls, and&#xD;
           surrounding gingiva will be covered with petroleum jelly to provide additional&#xD;
           protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Day 0, after application, participant will be given 25 ml of fluoride free water to&#xD;
           rinse as in 1 above and water collected. This will be done 10 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
           DAY 1-6 Salivary Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Days 1-6, collection a single salivary sample at same time each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: Ten minutes before collection (on days 1-6), each individual will be given 100 ml&#xD;
      of de-ionized fluoride free water to rinse the mouth and swallow to increase hydration. The&#xD;
      individual will be instructed to swallow once, and allow saliva to pool in the mouth without&#xD;
      swallowing, and then periodically spit the saliva into a universal collection tube until 5 ml&#xD;
      are collected. The tubes with saliva will be stored on ice and then frozen at -20oC for&#xD;
      transfer to the lab at the University of Washington.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures: Fluoride will be measured using standard fluoride electrode analysis (Martinez-Mier&#xD;
      et al., 2011). Silver will be measured using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry&#xD;
      (EPA 6020a Rev.1 2007).&#xD;
