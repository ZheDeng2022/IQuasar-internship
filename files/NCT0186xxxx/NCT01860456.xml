      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacokinetics of imatinib and nilotinib, two BCR/Abl tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKI),&#xD;
      is variable among patients suffering from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Transmembrane&#xD;
      transporters may play a pivotal role in interindividual variability in TKI disposition.&#xD;
      Furthermore, minimum plasma concentrations (Cmin) higher than 1 mg/L could be associated with&#xD;
      a higher likelihood of molecular and cytogenetic responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TIKlet study is aimed at evaluating correlations among the pharmacogenetics,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and treatment efficacy/tolerability of imatinib and nilotinib in CML&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. PATIENTS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1. Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients affected by CML will be enrolled after the informed consent will be signed,&#xD;
      according to the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients of both sexes,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age between 18 and 80 years,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  treated with imatinib or nilotinib,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  included in follow-up activities at the participating Hematology Divisions,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  able to give informed consent,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  with a proved compliance with the scheduled treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The administration of other drugs will be allowed, being known the dose and duration of&#xD;
      treatment, as well as smoking and herbal products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alterations in organ functions or physicochemical exams, body mass index &gt;28 do not represent&#xD;
      exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2. Enrollment and follow-up visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      During enrollment visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients will be informed about the study, their signed informed consent form will be&#xD;
           collected and an individual alphanumeric code will be assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients' data will be recorded within the individual case report form (CRF) and a blood&#xD;
           sample will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At follow-up visits, a blood sample will be collected for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)&#xD;
      and patients' CRF will be updated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3. Blood samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      After centrifugation, the resulting plasma will be collected for TDM. During the enrollment&#xD;
      visit, an aliquot of whole blood will be collected for molecular analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Laboratory analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      TDM will be performed by high-performance liquid chromatography systems, then results will be&#xD;
      evaluated by a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Single nucleotide polymorphisms will be&#xD;
      investigated in the following genes: ABCB1, ABCG2, hOCT1, OCTN1, OATP1A2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, response to drugs, in terms of Major Molecular Response (MMR) and Complete&#xD;
      Cytogenetic Response (CCyR), and tolerability will be evaluated. Any possible correlation&#xD;
      among drug disposition, pharmacogenetics and treatment effects will be analyzed.&#xD;

      1. Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1. Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      CML patients will be included according to the following inclusion criteria: a) patients of&#xD;
      both sexes, b) age between 18 and 80 years, c) treated with imatinib or nilotinib, d)&#xD;
      included in the follow-up in the Divisions / Units of Hematology involved in the project e)&#xD;
      able to give informed consent to trial participation, f) with a proved compliance with the&#xD;
      scheduled treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be excluded from participation to the study if: a) age &lt;18 or &gt;80 years or b)&#xD;
      unable to provide informed consent. The inability to attend the follow-up visits will not be&#xD;
      considered an exclusion criterion from the study. In this case, collected data will be used&#xD;
      in pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses on the basis of an intention-to-treat criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following conditions should be noted:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the concomitant administration of other drugs will be allowed, provided it will be known&#xD;
           the active ingredient, the dose and the period of administration;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. smoking and herbal products will be allowed but they should be reported on patient's&#xD;
           case report form;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. alterations in liver and kidney functions, body mass index higher than 28, or any other&#xD;
           alteration in physicochemical exams do not represent exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2. Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of this study it has been estimated that it will need to recruit at least&#xD;
      206 subjects per drug (total, 412 patients), taking into account:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the minor allele frequency of the most studied polymorphism evaluated in this research&#xD;
           protocol (i.e., 0.3, T allele of the ABCB1 c.3435C&gt;T polymorphism);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the 1:1 ratio allele C carriers and patients homozygous for the T allele of the ABCB1&#xD;
           c.3435C&gt;T polymorphism;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. covariate effects on drug pharmacokinetics will be considered significant when the mean&#xD;
           difference in pharmacokinetic parameters will be at least 20%;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the power of the study will be 80%;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. the alpha error will be set at 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3. Enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient enrollment in the various participating centers will be competitive, up to the&#xD;
           achievement of 206 individuals per drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the first visit, the TIKlet study will be presented to patients who will satisfy the&#xD;
           inclusion / exclusion criteria. The following activities will take place:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  patients will be informed about the characteristics, objectives, and procedures of&#xD;
                the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Consent to study participation will be confirmed by signing the informed consent&#xD;
                form.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Personal alphanumeric code assignment for patient's identification and privacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Updating of the enrollment list.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Collection of main data of the patient (age, sex, age at diagnosis, clinical&#xD;
                chemistry test results as reported in the patient's record and any combination&#xD;
                therapies, with their doses and duration) within the individual case report form&#xD;
                (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A blood withdrawal (approximately 4 mL) will be performed from a peripheral vein of&#xD;
                the forearm. The time at which blood will be withdrawn will be registered within&#xD;
                patient's CRF, together with the time elapsed from the last administration of&#xD;
                imatinib or nilotinib. For sample handling see section 2.1. &quot;Blood sample&#xD;
                handling&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The updated list of enrolled patients and individual case report forms will be sent&#xD;
                to the Division of Hematology, Dept. of Clinical and Experimental Medicine,&#xD;
                University of Pisa&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.4 Follow-up visits&#xD;
&#xD;
           According to clinical routine at each participating center, the following activities&#xD;
           should be performed during each follow-up visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Collection of patient's data: clinical chemistry test results, cytogenetic analysis&#xD;
                and molecular biology results (BCR/Abl transcript levels), any concomitant therapy,&#xD;
                any adverse drug reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A blood sample (approximately 4 mL) will be collected from a peripheral vein of the&#xD;
                forearm. The time at which blood will be withdrawn will be registered within&#xD;
                patient's CRF, together with the time elapsed from the intake of last imatinib or&#xD;
                nilotinib dose. For sample handling see section 2.1. &quot;Blood sample handling&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
                2. Laboratory analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
           Laboratory analyses will be conducted at the Division of Pharmacology, Department of&#xD;
           Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa (measurement of drug plasma&#xD;
           concentrations, pharmacogenetic analyses) and at the Department of Pharmacology,&#xD;
           University of Bologna (pharmacogenetic analyses).&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1. Blood sample handling&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each tube containing the patient's whole blood, plasma or DNA (see below) and used for&#xD;
           the execution of therapeutic monitoring or pharmacogenetic analyses will be identified&#xD;
           by a) the patient's code and b) the date of execution of blood withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All blood samples will be collected in lithium-heparin Vacutainer® tubes, then they will&#xD;
           be stored at 4 °C until centrifugation. The sample will be centrifuged and the resulting&#xD;
           plasma (1.5 mL) will be collected and stored in a tube for therapeutic drug monitoring.&#xD;
           Only during the enrollment visit, an aliquot of whole blood (0.5 mL) will be collected&#xD;
           in a sterile eppendorf for molecular analyses. Both samples will be stored at -20 °C for&#xD;
           a maximum of 2 weeks, then they will be sent to the Dept. of Clinical and Experimental&#xD;
           Medicine, University of Pisa.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For sample storage see section 2.7. &quot;Biological sample storage&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2 Measurement of plasma concentration of drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
           The measurement of plasma concentrations of imatinib and its active metabolite, and&#xD;
           nilotinib will be conducted by a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method&#xD;
           using commercially available kits (Chromsystems GmbH, Munich, Germany) on Waters Breeze&#xD;
           and Alliance instruments (Waters, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Briefly, solid-phase extraction columns will be balanced with Equilibration buffers 1&#xD;
           and 2, then the internal standard and plasma (0.5 mL) will be added. The column will be&#xD;
           centrifuged, and subsequently washed with Wash buffer and water for HPLC. The eluate&#xD;
           will be collected by centrifugation, diluted with water for HPLC and injected (0.025 mL)&#xD;
           into the HPLC system for the execution of the analysis. The peak area of the analytes of&#xD;
           interest (imatinib and its active metabolite, nilotinib and internal standard) will be&#xD;
           recorded and the actual concentration of drug in plasma will be obtained by comparison&#xD;
           with standard calibration curves for each day of analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The HPLC analyses will be carried out on a weekly basis. The reports of the analysis&#xD;
           will be sent to the Divisions / Units of Hematology and registered into both the&#xD;
           patient's medical record and study CRFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3. Pharmacokinetic analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
           Plasma concentrations of imatinib/active metabolite and nilotinib will be analyzed&#xD;
           trough a population pharmacokinetic analysis according to a nonlinear mixed-effects&#xD;
           modeling approach, using the NONMEM software, version 7.2. The Xpose and PsN packages&#xD;
           will be used to check database, for model diagnostic and covariate testing. Former&#xD;
           models for imatinib/metabolite and nilotinib will be 1- and 2-compartment models with&#xD;
           first-order elimination and parameterized in terms of apparent drug clearance (CL/F),&#xD;
           volume of distribution (V/F) and absorption constant (ka), while the residual error will&#xD;
           be modeled as additive, proportional or mixed (additive and proportional) error. The&#xD;
           availability of records, goodness-of-fit plots and the precision of parameter estimates,&#xD;
           together with a generalized additive modeling procedure (GAM) implemented in the Xpose&#xD;
           package, will be adopted for model development and to explore correlations among the&#xD;
           covariates. In particular, age, weight, body mass index, liver (ALT, AST) and renal&#xD;
           function (creatinine plasma concentration), albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein plasma&#xD;
           concentrations and results of pharmacogenetic analyses will be considered as possible&#xD;
           covariates. A stepwise covariate model building will be performed with forward inclusion&#xD;
           and backward exclusion. In particular, a decrease in the objective function value (OFV)&#xD;
           greater than 3.84 points (i.e., p&lt;0.05) and 6.63 points (i.e., p&lt;0.01) will be the&#xD;
           criteria used in the forward inclusion and backward exclusion steps, respectively. The&#xD;
           goodness of the final model will be checked by bootstrap analysis using the PsN and&#xD;
           Xpose packages and calculating η-shrinkage. The area under the plasma concentration-time&#xD;
           curve from time zero up to infinity (AUC) and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) will&#xD;
           be calculated from the individual empirical Bayes estimates (EBE) from the final&#xD;
           population pharmacokinetic model as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           AUC=(Total daily dose)/(CL/F) t1/2=ln(2)/kel where kel is imatinib elimination constant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.4. Pharmacogenetic analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aliquot of frozen whole blood will be employed for the extraction of genomic DNA&#xD;
           with a suitable kit (Qiagen, Milan, Italy) following manufacturer's instructions and the&#xD;
           nucleic acid will be stored at -80 ° C until the time of analysis in sterile tube&#xD;
           bearing the identification code of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the following genes will be assayed: ABCB1,&#xD;
           ABCG2, hOCT1, OCTN1, OATP1A2. SNPs will be evaluated by specific kits from Applied&#xD;
           Biosystems (Life Sciences, Milan, Italy) on an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection&#xD;
           System (Life Sciences). Each analysis will be performed in triplicate. Genotypes will be&#xD;
           automatically identified through the software SDS (Life Sciences). Frequency of alleles&#xD;
           and genotypes according to the Hardy-Weinberg law, haplotype and linkage disequilibrium&#xD;
           analysis will be performed using Arlequin software package.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.5. Treatment effectiveness and tolerability&#xD;
&#xD;
           The response to the therapy with imatinib will be evaluated in agreement with criteria&#xD;
           recently published and adopted. In particular, results from chemical, biochemical and&#xD;
           molecular analyses will be performed every 2 weeks during the first 3 months of&#xD;
           treatment, then cytogenetic (metaphase chromosomal banding assay) and molecular analyses&#xD;
           (quantification of BCR-ABL transcription levels in plasma by real-time-PCR) were&#xD;
           performed every 6 and 3 months, respectively, until the attainment of a complete&#xD;
           response. The time to complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and to major molecular&#xD;
           response (MMR) will be defined as the length of time elapsed from diagnosis and response&#xD;
           attainment for every patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Furthermore, treatment-associated adverse reactions (i.e., nausea and vomiting,&#xD;
           periorbital oedema, cramps and myalgia, neutropenia, skin and liver toxicities) will be&#xD;
           identified and scored according to the Common Toxicity Criteria-NCI grading system&#xD;
           (version 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.6. Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           The results will be analyzed in aggregate form. Parameter of dispersion (standard&#xD;
           deviation, range), central indexes (mean, median) and distribution (i.e.,&#xD;
           Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) will be calculated. The most appropriate statistical tests&#xD;
           (ANOVA, Fisher test, etc.) will be applied to investigate any possible difference&#xD;
           between groups, and the level of significance will be set at p = 0.05. The&#xD;
           identification of cut-off values for parameters predictive of efficacy / tolerability&#xD;
           (plasma concentrations, polymorphisms) will be pursued trough ad hoc analyses (receiver&#xD;
           operating characteristics analysis, evaluation of positive and negative predictive&#xD;
           values).&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.7. Biological sample storage&#xD;
&#xD;
           All biological samples [whole blood (0.5 mL), plasma (1.5 mL) and genomic DNA] will be&#xD;
           stored at the Division of Pharmacology, Department of Clinical and Experimental&#xD;
           Medicine, University of Pisa. Aliquots of DNA samples for pharmacogenetic analyses will&#xD;
           be stored at the Department of Pharmacology, University of Bologna.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each sample will be identified by the individual alphanumeric code assigned to every&#xD;
           patient. According to protocol, patients may require the destruction of their own&#xD;
           biological samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.8. Authorship&#xD;
&#xD;
           The criteria declared by the ICMJE (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors)&#xD;
           will be adopted for authorship definition.&#xD;
