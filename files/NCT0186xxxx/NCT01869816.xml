  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Visceral obesity is the one of the major causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      industrialized countries. Adipose tissue secretes various kinds of bioactive molecules termed&#xD;
      adipokines which contribute to the development of obesity-related disorders including&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Progranulin and CTRP3 are recently discovered novel adipokines.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators tried to compare circulating CTRP-3 and progranulin levels in&#xD;
      patients with CAD and investigated whether CTRP-3 or progranulin is significantly associated&#xD;
      with CAD prevalence after adjustment for well-known CAD risk factors.&#xD;

      CTRP-3 (synonyms CORS-26, cartducin and cartonectin) is a potent anti-inflammatory adipokine&#xD;
      that inhibits proinflammatory pathways in monocytes and adipocytes. Using a recently&#xD;
      developed enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we reported that circulating CTRP-3&#xD;
      levels were elevated in patients with glucose metabolism dysregulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progranulin was identified as a key adipokine mediating high fat diet-induced insulin&#xD;
      resistance and obesity through interleukin-6 (IL-6) in adipose tissue. We previously reported&#xD;
      that progranulin levels were significantly higher in individuals with type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      were associated with macrophage infiltration in omental adipose tissue. Moreover, the&#xD;
      expression of progranulin reduces inflammation and its degradation into granulins peptides&#xD;
      enhances inflammation in atherosclerotic plaque, which may contribute to the progression of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis There has been no previous report on the implication of CTRP-3 or progranulin&#xD;
      in humans with cardiovascular disease (CAD). In the present study, we compared circulating&#xD;
      CTRP-3 and progranulin levels in patients with CAD and investigated whether CTRP-3 or&#xD;
      progranulin is significantly associated with CAD prevalence after adjustment for well known&#xD;
      CAD risk factors.&#xD;
