      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Researchers are interested in how the muscles affect the movement of the knee cap. These&#xD;
      muscles may be related to different kinds of knee pain that are not caused by an injury or a&#xD;
      disease. Imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to look at&#xD;
      these muscles. To study these muscles and how they move, researchers will use MRI to look at&#xD;
      healthy individuals and individuals with knee cap pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study how changes to the muscles around the knee can influence knee pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between 18 to 55 years of age who have knee cap pain that cannot be&#xD;
           explained by a specific injury or disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers between 18 and 55 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study requires two visits. Each visit will use standard MRI sequences to take&#xD;
           images of the knee in motion and at rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the first visit, the MRI scan will look at the knee in its natural state.&#xD;
           Participants will move the knee up and down for 1 to 3 minutes at a time during the&#xD;
           scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the second visit, a local anesthetic agent will be injected into the muscle of the&#xD;
           thigh. The anesthetic will block this muscle from generating force for 2 or 3 hours.&#xD;
           Participants will move the knee up and down for 1 to 3 minutes at a time during the MRI&#xD;
           scan.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic idiopathic patellofemoral pain, a potential precursor to osteoarthritis, is one of&#xD;
      the most common problems of the knee. It is characterized by anterior knee pain that is&#xD;
      aggravated by deep knee flexion, prolonged sitting, and repetitive flexion/extension. The&#xD;
      most widely accepted theory in regards to the source of this pain is that a force imbalance&#xD;
      around the knee leads to static patellofemoral malalignment and dynamic patellofemoral&#xD;
      maltracking. In turn, this malalignment and maltracking leads to elevated joint contact&#xD;
      stresses, which ultimately leads to patellofemoral pain. Current understanding of&#xD;
      patellofemoral maltracking is typically focused on static 2D alignment (lateral tilt and&#xD;
      displacement). Yet, patellofemoral pain is most often exacerbated during dynamic events and&#xD;
      the patella has complete six degrees of freedom in its movement. More recent studies have&#xD;
      been able to quantify patellofemoral kinematics during volitional dynamic tasks and&#xD;
      demonstrate that the maltracking problem is more complex than originally postulated.&#xD;
      Specifically, in patients with patellofemoral pain, altered kinematics are not limited to&#xD;
      excessive patellar lateral translation and tilt, but include excessive patellar superior&#xD;
      translation along with excessive flexion and valgus rotations. Flexion and valgus are&#xD;
      sagittal and coronal plane rotations that cause the superior pole of the patella to shift&#xD;
      anteriorly and medially, respectively. Recent work has shown that altered force balance&#xD;
      around the knee can indeed lead to maltracking. However, the question remains whether&#xD;
      correcting an existing force imbalance around the knee can normalize patellar kinematics&#xD;
      and/or reduce pain. The purpose of this study is to determine how temporary iatrogenic loss&#xD;
      of force in the vastus lateralis muscle alters the aberrant patellar kinematics in subjects&#xD;
      with chronic idiopathic patellofemoral pain.&#xD;
