  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite abundant evident supporting the use of acute reperfusion therapy in the setting of&#xD;
      acute ischemic stroke (AIS), adoption of this practice in routine clinical care is poor. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that a significant barrier is the difficulty in weighing the benefits and risks&#xD;
      of rt-PA treatment in the care of an individual patient, a problem compounded by the time&#xD;
      urgency of decision-making and clinical fears that weigh risks of treatment more heavily than&#xD;
      benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this Quality Improvement (QI) study is to leverage an IT solution that we have&#xD;
      developed, ePRISM, that executes multivariable risk models with patient-specific data so that&#xD;
      a personalized estimate of an individual's outcomes (both risks and benefits) with and&#xD;
      without rt-PA, can be generated so support safer, more effective clinical care. Through an&#xD;
      earlier project, we will have programmed ePRISM with the best available risk-stratification&#xD;
      models and developed a clinically useful format for presenting the data to support clinical&#xD;
      decision-making in AIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through QI, we propose to identify the optimal mechanism for integrating the tool within the&#xD;
      routine flow of patient care in preparation for more definitive studies, or dissemination&#xD;
      strategies, to improve the treatment of patients with AIS.&#xD;

      Specific Aim 1: Implement ePRISM and the RESOLVE Decision Aid (DA) at 2 sites (Saint Luke's&#xD;
      Hospital in Kansas City and Saint Luke's North) for Emergency Department (ED) access and&#xD;
      decision support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Procedures and Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Map process flow and define the optimal points of care for both the informed consent and&#xD;
           decision aid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pre-implementation registry or data retrieval of patient/family satisfaction with&#xD;
           information during consent process pre-PRISM, as well as time from presentation to&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Implementation of ePRISM software and the RESOLVE DA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Monitor proportion of patients in whom the RESOLVE DA is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Post-implementation registry or data retrieval of patient/family satisfaction and&#xD;
           knowledge, as well as time from presentation to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Interviews of providers on confidence in making treatment decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Monitor patient outcomes through 90 day follow up phone call as per the standard of&#xD;
           care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Implement ePRISM and the RESOLVE DA onsite at the the Barnes Jewish Hospital&#xD;
      Emergency Department. After optimizing the integration of ePRISM and the RESOLVE DA at Saint&#xD;
      Luke's Hospital and Saint Luke's North, we will evaluate strategies for implementation at&#xD;
      Barnes Jewish Hospital's Emergency Department Telestroke Program.&#xD;

    <description>Successful implementation of ePRISM and the RESOLVE DA in 3 ED's and a telestroke program. Successful implementation is defined as: 1) the activation of ePRISM and generation the RESOLVE DA by ePRISM; 2) the staff and clinician's reported value of the new RESOLVE DA for use during the rt-PA decision making process.</description>
