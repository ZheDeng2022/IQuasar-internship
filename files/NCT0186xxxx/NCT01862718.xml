      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot study to assess feasibility for combining treatment modalities that should be&#xD;
      synergistic (radiation and thermal ablation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thermal ablation with Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) are standard&#xD;
      treatments for focal neoplasms in the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High volume or scattered locations of tumor burden results in inability to successfully use&#xD;
      this technology for a large proportion of patients with hepatic neoplasms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods to enhance treatment volumes could be advantageous in potentially increasing the&#xD;
      indications for thermal ablation or the number of patients benefitting from local ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety of combining 2 standard therapies (thermal ablation and external beam&#xD;
      radiation therapy) for liver neoplasms up to 10 cm diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients greater than 18 years of age with pathologically proven unresectable primary or&#xD;
      metastatic hepatic neoplasms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients whose extent of hepatic metastases represents approximately less than 60% of total&#xD;
      liver volume AND whose extrahepatic metastatic disease is determined to be minimal&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECOG performance status of less than or equal to 2 and a life expectancy of more than 3&#xD;
      months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a history of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or biological therapy for at&#xD;
      least 4 weeks prior to starting study treatments, and 4 weeks after treatments Patients must&#xD;
      not have an acute, critical illness&#xD;
&#xD;
      If clinical or imaging evidence for cirrhosis present, then Bilirubin must be less than 3&#xD;
      mg/dl and Child-Pugh Classification A, (Class B &amp; C are excluded)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo external beam radiation as well as thermal ablation according to&#xD;
      standard operating procedures of the NCI and NIH CC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored using the standard imaging studies when clinically warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may be treated with a second (or more) thermal ablation procedure ALONE if it is&#xD;
      deemed beneficial for the patient by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size will be 10 evaluable patients&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with hepatic-dominant neoplasms where the life limiting component of the disease&#xD;
        is hepatic neoplasms&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients hepatic lesions must be considered technically unresectable or that their overall&#xD;
        health makes surgery inadvisable&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have 5 or fewer lesions and with no single lesion greater than 10 cm in maximum diameter&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with extrahepatic neoplasms or an unresected primary lesion will be considered&#xD;
        eligible if the extrahepatic disease is minimal and stable&#xD;
&#xD;
        Serum Creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl unless the measured creatinine clearance&#xD;
        is greater than 60 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to1500/m3 without help of Filgastim,&#xD;
        hemoglobin greater than 8 g/dL, and platelet count greater than or equal to 75,000 m3&#xD;
&#xD;
        Bilirubin less than 3 mg/dl, and AST and ALT less than 5 X upper limit of normal except in&#xD;
        the presence of obstructive liver neoplasms where ALT/AST may be up to 10 X the upper limit&#xD;
        of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prothrombin Time (PT) within 2 seconds of the upper limit normal (INR less than or equal to&#xD;
        1.5)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient on oral, SQ or IV anticoagulants will be expected to have an abnormal PT and will&#xD;
        be considered eligible if they can safely dicontinue the anticoagulant before ablation. A&#xD;
        repeat PT will be obtained at least 24 hours prior to the radiofrequency ablation (only)&#xD;
        and should be within practice safety guidelines of an INR less than 1.5 or if greater than&#xD;
        1.5 have clinical reversal agent as appropriate to the anticoagulant administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Extent of hepatic neoplasms is approximately less than 60% of total hepatic volume&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have pathology proof of neoplasm. If proof of pathology is unavailable,&#xD;
        histopathological confirmation of liver neoplasm may not be requisite in the setting of&#xD;
        clinical or radiological characteristics that are highly suggestive of a neoplastic&#xD;
        diagnosis, with such designation determined by PI and a medical or surgical oncologist,&#xD;
        with the NCI multidisciplinary gastrointestinal tumor board review, in the event of absence&#xD;
        of such consensus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients referred for ablation or radiation of liver neoplasm&#xD;
&#xD;
        ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        Life expectancy greater than 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        At least 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age less than 85 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have had no chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or biologic therapy for their&#xD;
        malignancy for at least 28 days prior to treatment and must have recovered from all&#xD;
        clinically significant side effects of therapeutic and diagnostic interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Portal Vein Occlusion or other contraindications to thermal ablation or radiation Prior&#xD;
        selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with Yttrium-90 or prior radiation to the liver&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior biliary diversion surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with active bacterial infections with systemic manifestations (malaise, fever,&#xD;
        leukocytosis) are not eligible until completion of appropriate therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any exclusion criteria for radiation or for ablation, such as ataxia telangiectasia, active&#xD;
        connective tissue disease, or inflammatory bowel disease, or other known conditions which&#xD;
        predispose to radiation toxicities&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with an acute, critical illness&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women are excluded from the study. Patients are excluded from pregnancy testing if&#xD;
        they are above the childbearing age of 55 years old, or if they have documented history of&#xD;
        infertility or acquired or congenital disorders incompatible with pregnancy or if the&#xD;
        patient has had a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy. Patients are also excluded from&#xD;
        pregnancy testing if they are at least 50 years of age AND have not menstruated for at&#xD;
        least 12 months OR have a documented Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) level of greater&#xD;
        than 40 mIU/mL.&#xD;
