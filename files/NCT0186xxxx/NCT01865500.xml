  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease that has a chronic and&#xD;
      progressive course. Patients with COPD may have exacerbations one to four times in a year.&#xD;
      Numbers of exacerbations are important because of increased morbidity and mortality and&#xD;
      healthcare costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic corticosteroids (SC) are recommended in the management of exacerbations of COPD as&#xD;
      well as bronchodilator, oxygen and antibacterial treatment by all international guidelines.&#xD;
      However, there are still some concerns about systemic corticosteroid use because COPD&#xD;
      patients are older and relatively immobilized. In addition, exacerbation rate is&#xD;
      significantly higher in a group of COPD patients, and these patients need higher amounts of&#xD;
      SC in order to control of exacerbation. It results in some adverse effects such as&#xD;
      osteoporosis and bone fractures, thinning of the skin, posterior subcapsular cataract&#xD;
      formation, glucose intolerance and myopathy. Thus, this condition leads clinicians to seek&#xD;
      alternative options. However, there are few studies showing that nebulized steroids (NS) are&#xD;
      as effective as SC in exacerbations of COPD and the optimal NS dose is not certain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aimed to determine the optimal NS dose and evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of NS compared with SC in the treatment of patients with COPD exacerbations requiring&#xD;
      hospitalization.&#xD;

      Study Population One hundred twenty patients with moderate or severe COPD exacerbation who&#xD;
      are older than 40-years-old, had a smoking history of at least 10-pack-years and requiring&#xD;
      hospitalization were included in the study. COPD diagnosis was based on clinical evaluation&#xD;
      as defined by the American Thoracic Society (ATS). The patients were excluded if they had a&#xD;
      presence of asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopy or any systemic disease (such as diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus or hypertension); were exposed to systemic corticosteroids in the preceding month;&#xD;
      used more than 1,500 microg/d of inhaled beclomethasone equivalent; were admission to the&#xD;
      intensive care unit (pH&lt;7.30 and/or arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) &gt; 70&#xD;
      mm Hg, and/or arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) &lt; 50 mm Hg despite supplemental&#xD;
      oxygen); if a specific cause for the exacerbation, such as pneumonia, pneumothorax, or heart&#xD;
      failure, was diagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design The study was as a randomized, double-blind, parallel design trial. The&#xD;
      randomization order was determined using a computer-generated list of random numbers.&#xD;
      Eligible patients were randomly allocated to one of the three treatment groups, that is,&#xD;
      parenteral corticosteroid (PS), 4 mg nebulized budesonide (NB) or 8 mg NB. The efficacy of&#xD;
      the study medications was assessed at hospitalization, 24 h, 48 h and before discharge.&#xD;
      Patients were monitored during the hospitalization. Patients were withdrawn from the study if&#xD;
      they required intubation and managed in intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments Treatment in the PS group consisted of methylprednisolone 40 mg (intravenous&#xD;
      ampoule); treatment in the NB groups consisted of nebulized budesonide suspension (Pulmicort&#xD;
      nebuampul® 0.5 mg/ml; Astra-Zeneca Pharmaceutical Production) for 10 days. Budesonide were&#xD;
      given as 2 mg twice daily or 4 mg twice daily; methylprednisolone were given once daily&#xD;
      intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nebulization procedures were performed by jet nebulizer (Porta Neb® Ventstream® 1803;&#xD;
      Medic-Aid) with 80% of output of less than 5 micron. Patients received standard treatment&#xD;
      with a nebulized ß-agonist (salbutamol 3.01 mg) and anticholinergic (ipratropium bromide 0.5&#xD;
      mg) combination every 6 hours, intravenous aminophylline (0.5 mg/kg/h) and oral or&#xD;
      intravenous antibacterial at the discretion of the attending physician. Supplementary oxygen&#xD;
      therapy was used to maintain oxygen saturation (SaO2) &gt;90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements Patients were assessed every 12 h during the acute phase (from H0 to H48), and&#xD;
      at hospital discharge. Arterial blood samples were taken at baseline, 24, 48 h and before&#xD;
      discharge for the determination of PaO2, PaCO2, and pH, regardless of whether the patient was&#xD;
      on room air or on supplementary oxygen. Spirometry (Sensor Medics, Vmax22) was carried out&#xD;
      before and 15 to 20 min after bronchodilator nebulization (ß2-agonist and ipratropium&#xD;
      bromide) according to ATS standards. Dyspnea was assessed according to the modified Borg&#xD;
      scale. Complete blood cell counts were obtained at entry, and blood glucose, sodium,&#xD;
      potassium were measured at H0 and H48.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints The primary endpoint was to assess treatment efficacy by the change of arterial&#xD;
      blood gases from H0 to H24, H48 and before discharge. Secondary endpoints included the&#xD;
      changes in FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second), dyspnea score, duration of&#xD;
      hospitalization, and occurrence of adverse events. An adverse event was defined as any&#xD;
      medical event reported by the attending physician and events resulting in treatment change,&#xD;
      discontinuation study medication or prolonged of hospitalization.&#xD;
