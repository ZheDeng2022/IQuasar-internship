      A phase IV, randomization, single center, controlled clinical trial to compare the safety,&#xD;
      immunogenicity,three-year immune persistence of inactivated hepatitis A vaccine (HAV) with&#xD;
      one- or two-dose regimen and live attenuated HAV with one-dose regimen in Chinese young&#xD;
      adults, and to evaluate the immunogenicity of a booster dose.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Healthy undergraduate students aged 16 to 25 years with anti-HAV negative were randomly&#xD;
      divided into three groups. Group A and B were administrated with one-dose inactivated and&#xD;
      live attenuated hepatitis A vaccines respectively; Group C was immunized with two doses of an&#xD;
      inactivated vaccine with 6 months apart. Blood samples were collected at month 1, and 12, 24&#xD;
      and 36 for anti-HAV titers determination. Safety observation in 30 minutes' duration after&#xD;
      vaccinations and injection-site reactions and systemic reactions for three consecutive days&#xD;
      were recorded to assess the safety of investigational vaccines. At Month 36, subjects who&#xD;
      received one dose of inactivated or live attenuated HAV were administrated a booster dose and&#xD;
      then were taken blood samples one month later for anti-HAV titers determination.&#xD;
