      Background Arteriovenous (AV) fistula is the most common vascular access for long-term&#xD;
      hemodialysis in the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. About 25% of these patients are&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus. However, the effects of hyperglycemia on the vascular function of&#xD;
      arteriovenous fistula are still remained unclear. Studies have shown that blood flow in the&#xD;
      AV fistula is significantly reduced in patients with diabetes mellitus. Diabetic patients&#xD;
      also require a longer period of time for the maturation of AV fistula, and have slightly&#xD;
      higher complication rate than non-diabetic patients. Statins have been widely shown to&#xD;
      mediate several important pleiotropic effects in the improvement of vascular endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction, attenuation of inflammatory responses, stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques,&#xD;
      inhibition of vascular smooth muscle proliferation, and modulation of procoagulant activity&#xD;
      and platelet function.Our experimental studies in diabetic animals demonstrate that&#xD;
      administration of a water-soluble statin rosuvastatin significantly improves the fistula&#xD;
      flow, vascular function and luminal dilatation of AV fistula in diabetic rats by suppression&#xD;
      of vascular oxidative stress and inflammatory load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis The central hypothesis of this research project is rosuvastatin mediates&#xD;
      pleiotropic protective effect on vascular endothelial function and suppresses the regional&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory reaction in the vasculature, therefore administration of rosuvastatin during&#xD;
      the perioperative period of creation of native AV fistulas in diabetic patients with ESRD may&#xD;
      potentiate the vascular function and reduce the primary failure rate of AV fistulae.&#xD;

      Background In Taiwan, diabetic nephropathy is the second most common cause of end-stage renal&#xD;
      disease (ESRD), but diabetic patients engender 12% more expense for care of dialysis than&#xD;
      non-diabetic patients. ESRD patients with diabetes are also more frequently hospitalized due&#xD;
      to problems such as failure of vascular access. Hemodialysis necessitates the placement of an&#xD;
      arteriovenous (AV) fistula, which involves a direct anastomosis of the radial/brachial artery&#xD;
      and cephalic vein. In the United States, procedures for creating the AV fistula and treatment&#xD;
      of the related complication account for over 20% of hospitalizations of dialysis patients and&#xD;
      cost about US$100 million annually. Two major hurdles in establishing a useable and patent AV&#xD;
      fistula for dialysis are primary failure (failure of fistula to mature adequately for&#xD;
      dialysis) and long-term survival of the vascular access. The reported primary failure rate&#xD;
      varies from 20 to 50%. It has been shown that reduction of blood flow (&gt;15% drop of flow over&#xD;
      time) is the most critical factor for premature failure of AV fistula. Although blood flow in&#xD;
      the venous site of AV fistula is also determined by the surrounding draining veins, blood&#xD;
      pumped from the arterial site is the most important factor in maintaining sufficient fistula&#xD;
      blood flow. However, very limited of studies have reported the effect of arterial blood flow&#xD;
      on the function and patency of AV fistula. More evidences have shown that progressive failure&#xD;
      of AV fistula after long-term use is due to the development of thrombosis (~80%) and stenosis&#xD;
      (~20%). The mechanisms that underlie the failure of AV fistula are still poorly understood&#xD;
      and there are very few, if any, specific therapeutic approaches that can increase the&#xD;
      lifespan of these fistulas. Therefore, there is the critical need for experimental studies&#xD;
      that seek to understand the basic mechanisms of primary failure and progressive failure of&#xD;
      the AV fistula in diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creation of an AV fistula is the most common vascular access for ESRD patients, who require&#xD;
      long-term hemodialysis. In Taiwan, about 25% of these patients have underlying diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus. However, the effects of hyperglycemia on the vascular function of arteriovenous&#xD;
      fistula are still remained unclear. Studies have shown that blood flow in the AV fistula is&#xD;
      significantly reduced in patients with diabetes mellitus. Diabetic patients also require a&#xD;
      significantly longer period of time (2 more months) for the maturation of AV fistula, and&#xD;
      have slightly higher complication rate than non-diabetic patients. Diabetes mellitus has been&#xD;
      shown as an independent risk factor of reduced blood flow in the native vessel arteriovenous&#xD;
      fistula. Compared with patients without diabetes access blood flow was significantly lower in&#xD;
      patients with diabetes mellitus (788±580 vs 1054±681 ml/min, P = 0.002). Patients with&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus required a longer time until first use of their AV fistula than did&#xD;
      patients without diabetes (4.4±2.9 vs 2.9±1.6 months, respectively, P= 0.02). AV&#xD;
      access-related complications and need of re-intervention were higher in these patients. Most&#xD;
      recently, Previous study identified that risk for reduced primary patency of AV fistula was&#xD;
      increased by diabetes (Hazard Ratio, 1.54; 95% Confidence Interval, 1.14-2.07). Presence of&#xD;
      diabetes is also a strong independent predictive factor for reduced initial intra-access&#xD;
      blood flow within 6 months after creation of AV fistula (OR 3.5, P = 0.001). However, there&#xD;
      is currently very limited effective therapeutic strategy in the prevention of loss of primary&#xD;
      patency and improvement of life expectancy of AV access in patients with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are one of the&#xD;
      most commonly prescribed agents in controlling hyperlipidemia. Apart from their serum&#xD;
      lipid-lowering properties, statins have been widely shown to mediate several important&#xD;
      pleiotropic effects, such as improvement of vascular endothelial dysfunction, attenuation of&#xD;
      inflammatory responses, stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques, inhibition of vascular&#xD;
      smooth muscle proliferation, and modulation of procoagulant activity and platelet function.&#xD;
      Among these pleiotropic effects, the protective effects on vascular endothelial function have&#xD;
      mostly been highlighted. In clinical settings, statins improve cardiovascular outcomes of&#xD;
      patients with atherosclerosis even in the population of normal plasma cholesterol level. The&#xD;
      improvement in cardiovascular outcomes is well correlated with improved endothelial function&#xD;
      by upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and nitric oxide (NO)&#xD;
      bioavailability following treatment with statins. At subcellular levels, statins stabilize&#xD;
      the eNOS messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), enhance eNOS enzymatic activity via phosphatidyl&#xD;
      inositide (PI)3 kinase signaling pathway, reduce inflammatory responses in the vasculature,&#xD;
      inhibit Rho isoprenylation and suppress oxidized- LDL-induced endothelin-1 expression.&#xD;
      Statins have also been characterized to enhance re-endothelialization of damaged vascular&#xD;
      endothelium by stimulating pre-existing endothelial cells and by mobilizing bone&#xD;
      marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Collectively, stains restore vascular&#xD;
      endothelial function and mediate vascular protective effects that are independent from their&#xD;
      lipid-lowering effects. Although the beneficial pleiotropisms by statins are well documented&#xD;
      in a variety of endothelial dysfunctional disorders, their potential therapeutic effects in&#xD;
      maintaining a healthy, usable AV fistula in subjects with diabetes mellitus have been&#xD;
      previously demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the knowledge of applicant, there was no published randomized control clinical&#xD;
      study prospectively investigated the vascular protective effect of statins on the&#xD;
      establishment of AV fistula in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or ESRD. A&#xD;
      long-term (up to 987 days) case-control study suggested that patients receiving statin&#xD;
      therapy were associated with significantly higher overall primary patency rate of AV fistula&#xD;
      after 1 year (81.7 vs 66 %) and after 2 years (71.5 vs 39.1%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the past national science council (NSC)-funded years 2009-2011, the applicant&#xD;
      undertook experimental study in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, in which an AV&#xD;
      fistula was created in each control and diabetic animals. The diabetic rats received either&#xD;
      placebo or rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg/d) in chow for a period 18 days (3 days before creation of&#xD;
      AV fistula and 14 after operation). Circulating cluster of differentiation (CD)133+/vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor receptor (KDR)+ EPCs were determined 2 weeks after creation of AV&#xD;
      fistula using flow cytometry. Vascular function of AV fistula was assessed by isometric force&#xD;
      testing. The expression of pro-inflammatory genes (iNOS and NADPH oxidase) and generation of&#xD;
      superoxide anions in the fistula were examined. The results showed that number of EPCs was&#xD;
      reduced in diabetic rats, and rosuvastatin significantly increased numbers of circulating&#xD;
      EPC. Reduced blood flow and impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation in the AV fistula of&#xD;
      animals with diabetes was significantly potentiated following treatment with rosuvastatin.&#xD;
      Rosuvastatin also attenuated the expression of iNOS and NADPH oxidase, and generation of&#xD;
      superoxide anions in the fistula tissues isolated from diabetic rats. These findings provide&#xD;
      the first and very important evidence demonstrating that rosuvastatin improves blood flow and&#xD;
      endothelial function of AV fistula in subjects with diabetes mellitus by attenuating the&#xD;
      activity of pro-inflammatory genes and generation of superoxide anions in the remodeled&#xD;
      vasculature. Based on these fascinating and encouraging findings, the applicant proposes to&#xD;
      undertake clinical study in translating these experimental results to diabetic patients with&#xD;
      CKD, who are scheduled to creation of AV fistula for further hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central Hypothesis and Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis of this research project is rosuvastatin mediates pleiotropic&#xD;
      protective effect on vascular endothelial function and suppresses the regional&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory reaction in the vasculature, therefore administration of rosuvastatin during&#xD;
      the perioperative period of creation of native AV fistulas in diabetic patients with ESRD may&#xD;
      potentiate the vascular function and reduce the primary failure rate of AV fistulae. Here,&#xD;
      the applicant proposes to undertake a three-year research project investigating the&#xD;
      therapeutic potential of rosuvastatin in the establishment of AV fistula in patients with&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus. The applicant opts to test the proposed effect of rosuvastatin in diabetic&#xD;
      patients. The long-term aim of this project is to develop a clinical feasible,&#xD;
      endothelium-targeted therapeutic strategy for a durable AV fistula in human subjects&#xD;
      necessitates hemodialysis. To achieve these research goals the applicant proposes studies&#xD;
      with following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Administration of rosuvastatin protects the endothelial function in the AV fistula and&#xD;
           restores the blood flow rate in the shunt of diabetic patients with ESRD, thereby&#xD;
           improves the primary patent rate and early maturation of these fistulas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Administration of rosuvastatin improves the vascular function of AV fistulas in diabetic&#xD;
           patients with ESRD, therefore reduces the overall shunt-related complication rate and&#xD;
           the requirement for surgical re-interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Administration of rosuvastatin is associated with reduction of the systemic&#xD;
           pro-inflammatory response and oxidative stress (levels of proinflammatory cytokines and&#xD;
           other mediators in the circulation) in diabetic patients with ESRD. On the other hand,&#xD;
           administration of rosuvastatin may mobilize the bone marrow-derived EPCs into systemic&#xD;
           circulation, and the number of these circulating endothelial progenitors may provide&#xD;
           prognostic value to the outcomes of AV fistula.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Administration of rosuvastatin reduces the overall perioperative cardiovascular and&#xD;
           other morbidities in diabetic patients with ESRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Administration of rosuvastatin does not increase the incidence of statin-related&#xD;
           complications (such as myopathy, abnormal liver function and neurologic deficit) in&#xD;
           diabetic patients with ESRD.&#xD;

    <description>The most commonly shunt-related complications are formation of aneurysms, failure of shunt to mature, and development of thrombosis in AV fistula (Ann Vasc Surg 2012;26:680). The occurrence of shunt-related complications usually require surgical reintervention.
