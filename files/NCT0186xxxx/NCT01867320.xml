      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis&#xD;
      (HAM/TSP) is an infection of the spinal cord. The infection is caused by a virus that has&#xD;
      been known to cause cancers like leukemia and lymphoma. It causes a weakening of the legs.&#xD;
      Researchers want to see if raltegravir, a drug for treating human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
      (HIV), can be used to treat HAM/TSP. They will see if the drug can reduce the amount of virus&#xD;
      in the blood of people with HAM/TSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if raltegravir can reduce the viral load of people with HAM/TSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have HAM/TSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples&#xD;
           will be collected. Imaging studies will be performed. A lumbar puncture will also be&#xD;
           taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take the study drug twice a day for 6 months. They will note each dose&#xD;
           in a study diary, as well as any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the 6-month visit, participants will stop taking the study drug. They will have a&#xD;
           physical exam and blood samples, as well as other tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have two further exams 9 months and 15 months after starting the study&#xD;
           drug. They will have a physical exam and blood samples, as well as other tests.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study, we wish to determine the effects of Raltegravir, a clinically approved&#xD;
      HIV-1 integrase inhibitor, on HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) in patients with HTLV-1 associated&#xD;
      myelopathy / tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). We will also provide safety and&#xD;
      tolerability information on Raltegravir use in this condition and examine the correlation of&#xD;
      immune activation markers in HAM/TSP with the effects of Raltegravir on the PVL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HAM/TSP, a relentlessly progressive and disabling myelopathy, occurs in up to 3% of HTLV-1&#xD;
      infected subjects. It results from immune-mediated bystander damage of the neural tissues in&#xD;
      association with an elevated PVL. In fact, a high PVL is considered to be the main risk&#xD;
      factor for developing HAM/TSP as the risk of disease rises exponentially once the PVL exceeds&#xD;
      1 %. Currently there is no effective treatment for HAM/TSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence that active HTLV-1 replication, through the retroviral life cycle with new&#xD;
      virus integration, is occurring in vivo and contributes to the total HTLV-1 PVL in infected&#xD;
      subjects. Recently it was shown that Raltegravir could inhibit cell-free and cell-to-cell&#xD;
      transmission of HTLV-1 in vitro. Given the substantial clinical experience with its use in&#xD;
      HIV-1 infection and particularly its excellent safety profile, this agent is an attractive&#xD;
      therapeutic option for patients with HAM/TSP, either alone or in combination with&#xD;
      immunomodulatory treatment. In this pilot study we wish to determine the effects of&#xD;
      Raltegravir in vivo on HTLV-1 PVL and immune activation markers in patients with HAM/TSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this 15 months single center, single arm, open label, baseline versus treatment pilot&#xD;
      clinical trial, sixteen subjects with HAM/TSP will receive Raltegravir at 400mg by mouth&#xD;
      twice daily in an initial 6 months treatment phase, followed by an additional 9 months post&#xD;
      treatment phase. Outcome measures will be collected every 3 months for the duration of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is HTLV-1 proviral load, which will be measured by quantitative&#xD;
      PCR. Secondary outcome measures include safety and tolerability of Raltegravir, which will be&#xD;
      assessed by clinical exam and standardized neurological disability scales as well as clinical&#xD;
      laboratory studies. In addition, viral and immunologic outcome measures investigating the&#xD;
      impact of Raltegravir on HTLV-1 biology and its effects on immune function will be measured&#xD;
      including HTLV-1 proviral load in different lymphocyte populations, the number of long&#xD;
      terminal repeat (LTR) circles and HTLV-1 mRNA expression levels in freshly isolated PBMC,&#xD;
      assays of spontaneous lymphoproliferation and T-cell phenotype analysis.&#xD;
