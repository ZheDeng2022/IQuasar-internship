  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MRI, without any contrast injection, allows a non-invasive evaluation and quantification of&#xD;
      hepatic overloads, especially iron (liver iron content LIC) and fat (steatosis) overloads,&#xD;
      but in certain clinical circumstances, cases require to improve performances. The aim of the&#xD;
      study is to add to MRI scans which currently must be performed innovative sequences&#xD;
      appropriate for the clinical question to overall appreciate on a varied range of patients&#xD;
      their quality, their robustness, their relative performance and, for patients having a&#xD;
      biopsy, their accuracy.&#xD;
