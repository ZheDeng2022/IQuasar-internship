      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Women who have a BRCA1/2 gene mutation have a very high risk of developing breast or&#xD;
      ovarian cancer. They are also at increased risk of other developing other cancers. Male&#xD;
      carriers are at increased risk for breast, prostate and other cancers. Testing for this&#xD;
      mutation and living with this increased risk can be a source of stress for both people with&#xD;
      the mutation and their partners. Researchers want to look at how well people adapt to living&#xD;
      with this type of cancer risk over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see how women with the BRCA1/2 gene mutation and their partners adapt to the stress of&#xD;
      long-term cancer risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Women at least 18 years of age who have a BRCA1/2 mutation, and their male or female&#xD;
      partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study involves a one-time self-administered questionnaire. Participants will be&#xD;
           recruited from local and national hereditary cancer support groups and cancer centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are two versions of the survey. One is for the woman with the BRCA1/2 gene&#xD;
           mutation. The other is for her partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The survey will ask about risk perception, cancer worry, risk-related stress, and coping&#xD;
           and adaptation methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to describe adaptation and dyadic adjustment in unaffected BRCA1/2&#xD;
      carriers and their partners. It is not fully understood how women and their partners adapt to&#xD;
      highrisk status over time, nor how different aspects of living at risk relate to this&#xD;
      process. Neither psychological adaptation nor dyadic adjustment has been systematically&#xD;
      measured in this population. This study is informed by Lazarus &amp; Folkman s Transactional&#xD;
      Model of Stress and Coping and modifications made to this model for use in studying dyadic&#xD;
      relationships. A crosssectional research design will quantitatively explore the relationships&#xD;
      between the appraisals and timing of risk-related stressors, dyadic coping, and the outcomes&#xD;
      of adaptation and dyadic adjustment. Participants will be recruited from hereditary breast&#xD;
      and ovarian cancer (HBOC) support groups, website postings, listservs, and clinic patient&#xD;
      lists. They will have the option of completing either a paper or online version of the&#xD;
      survey.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants will be women aged 18 or older who have a BRCA1/2 mutation and their (male or&#xD;
        female) partners. Carriers must have no personal history of cancer, but partners will not&#xD;
        be excluded based on cancer history. Participants will be asked to disclose their mutation&#xD;
        status (BRCA1 or BRCA2), but no screening evaluation will be required. If only one member&#xD;
        of a couple completes the survey, their data will be included in the individual level&#xD;
        analysis, but excluded from the dyadic level analysis.&#xD;
