      Small association studies have hypothesised that shoes protect against hookworm infection.&#xD;
      The purpose of this pragmatic study was determine, under field conditions, whether school-age&#xD;
      children on Pemba Island, Zanzibar, would wear shoes and if shoes protected them against&#xD;
      hookworm infection.&#xD;

      Aim: To carry out a cluster randomised controlled trial (non-blinded) to test under field&#xD;
      conditions whether the provision of shoes to school-aged children on Pemba Island, Zanzibar,&#xD;
      an area of high hookworm prevalence and anaemia, could reduce the transmission, incidence and&#xD;
      disease burden of hookworm infection among this susceptible population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Pemba Island is the northern of the two main islands that make up the Zanzibar&#xD;
      archipelago, situated in the Indian Ocean and close to the coast of East Africa, just below&#xD;
      the equator. The climate is tropical and humid and the island has two rainy seasons, from&#xD;
      March-June (Masika) and October-December (Vuli). Humidity is high, up to 1000mm during the&#xD;
      Masika rains. Economic activities are mainly agriculture and fishing and considerable&#xD;
      improvements to infrastructure - roads and electricity - have been made in recent years. The&#xD;
      island's population totalled 460,196 in 2008, of whom 50 percent were children aged &lt;15&#xD;
      years. Zanzibar is an autonomous part of the United Republic of Tanzania and on the mainland,&#xD;
      the under 5 mortality rate (U5MR) is 81 per 1,000 live births but is substantially higher on&#xD;
      Zanzibar at 116 per 1,000 live births. The area is highly endemic for soil transmitted&#xD;
      helminths - a recent study on neighbouring Unguja Island found three-quarters of rural&#xD;
      inhabitants and half of urban inhabitants to be infected with parasitic worms, despite 15&#xD;
      years of mass drug treatment. Other risk factors for concomitant anaemia are poor nutrition,&#xD;
      focal areas of Schistosoma haematobium transmission and malaria, although recent control&#xD;
      efforts have made impressive reductions in malaria transmission (reduced to 0.8% prevalence&#xD;
      in 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study schools (clusters): 12 government primary schools from across the entire island were&#xD;
      identified for the trial, where hookworm prevalence in a previous survey totalled &gt;50%:&#xD;
      Mizingani, Ng'ombeni, Chambani, Uwandani, Bagamoyo, Shumba Viamboni, Mkanyageni, Ziwani,&#xD;
      Wesha, Tumbe, Wingwi, and Ngwachani.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Pragmatic, cluster (non-blinded) randomised controlled trial with school-aged&#xD;
      children randomized to either the intervention (a pair of shoes alongside standard care) or&#xD;
      standard care (periodic de-worming with antihelminthics and health education). Children&#xD;
      already wearing shoes were advised to continue to do so in the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The study aimed for 80% power and 5% significance, adjusted for cluster design,&#xD;
      to look for a 25% reduction in hookworm prevalence, a 25% reduction in hookworm incidence and&#xD;
      a 40% reduction in the geometric mean of residual hookworm infection intensity in the&#xD;
      intervention arm, based on survey data at selected schools which showed &gt;50% prevalence of&#xD;
      hookworm infection in 2010. Using a sample size calculation in Stata 11.2 (StataCorp, 2009),&#xD;
      adjusted for cluster design, the study needed to enrol an average 77 children in each of the&#xD;
      12 clusters (n=924, 462 in each arm), using a correlation coefficient of 0.01. A greater&#xD;
      number of clusters would have been preferable but available resources limited the study&#xD;
      design to 12 schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Healthy school children were randomly selected (but stratified by class&#xD;
      and sex) from 12 schools selected for enrolment into the trial. Stratification took place as&#xD;
      follows: Class 1 at each school was called in and boys and girls divided into two groups. The&#xD;
      children were then asked to count off '1', '2' along the line they had formed up in and then&#xD;
      either the 1s or the 2s were asked to file out. The first 10 children in each group remaining&#xD;
      (10 girls and 10 boys so 20 children in each class) were given a sample pot and a consent&#xD;
      form to take home to their parents. This was repeated for all 5 primary school classes at&#xD;
      each of the 12 schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusions: children whose parents did not consent to the participation of their child in the&#xD;
      trial or children who have had a life-threatening allergic reaction to Albendazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics: were collected from enrolled children attending schools in both&#xD;
      arms. A short questionnaire was used to collect information on age, sex, housing&#xD;
      characteristics and other measures of wealth, sanitation at home and at school, footwear use&#xD;
      (both observed and subjective), history of recent illness, when the child last had an&#xD;
      antihelminthic drug (for Schistosomiasis or STHs) and bed net use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parasitology: 1 stool sample from each child at baseline (July 2011) and six months after&#xD;
      shoe distribution (October 2012) was examined at the Public Health Laboratory (PHL), Pemba&#xD;
      Island, using the Kato-Katz method, to measure both prevalence of soild transmitted helminths&#xD;
      (STH) and STH infection intensity in eggs/gram of stool. To minimise hookworm egg loss, the&#xD;
      stool was collected at the beginning of the school day and placed in a coolbox while waiting&#xD;
      for transfer to Pemba's Public Health Laboratory and then processed on arrival. An average 10&#xD;
      percent of sample slides were re-checked for quality control by the most experienced&#xD;
      microscopist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation of clusters: Simple randomisation was used where schools were entered into an&#xD;
      Excel (Microsoft, 2010) spreadsheet and the &quot;RAND&quot; function was used to assign random numbers&#xD;
      between 0 and 1. The six lowest numbers were assigned to the intervention arm and the six&#xD;
      highest were assigned to the control arm before baseline data was gathered. Given the nature&#xD;
      of the intervention, the trial is non-blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data handling: Baseline data was analysed using Stata 11.2 (StataCorp, 2009). Subsequent data&#xD;
      was analysed using SOFA Statistics Version 1.3.2 (Paton-Simpson and Associatiates Ltd, 2012).&#xD;
      Data containing identity numbers but no names was stored on password-protected computers and&#xD;
      available only to the prinicipal investigator, the co-principal investigator and the study's&#xD;
      supervisor. Study registration details (to identify children with heavy hookworm load and for&#xD;
      subsequent follow-up) are stored at the Public Health Laboratory, Pemba island.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shoe distribution: Shoes were distributed to all schools' pupils in the intervention arm (ie&#xD;
      not only those being monitored in the trial, with approximately 6,500 pupils receiving a pair&#xD;
      of shoes) to ensure trial subjects did not stand out from their peers; government sponsored&#xD;
      de-worming and healthcare education (one stat dose Albendazole 400mg) continued for all&#xD;
      schools' pupils in both intervention and control arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics approval: The study protocol was approved by both the Zanzibar Medical Research and&#xD;
      Ethics Committee (ZAMREC) and the MSc Ethics Committee of the London School of Hygiene and&#xD;
      Tropical Medicine. Approval was also sought and granted from Zanzibar's Ministry of Education&#xD;
      at a presentation and meeting of ministry officials and school head teachers at the Public&#xD;
      Health laboratory, Pemba Island.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent: Consent forms, providing a detailed description of the trial in plain language and&#xD;
      translated into Swahili, were distributed to children eligible for the study (see enrolment&#xD;
      below) to take home to their parents or primary carers. It was explained to parents that they&#xD;
      were free to remove their children from the study at any time. A telephone number to the&#xD;
      research team was made available to parents (and was used on several occasions) in case&#xD;
      parents had any questions or concerns. A child was enrolled in the study only if they brought&#xD;
      a signed consent form with their stool sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety monitoring and treatment: All children in both the intervention and control arms of&#xD;
      the trial were treated for soil transmitted helminths as part of the Zanzibar government's&#xD;
      ongoing mass drug treatment programme. Both shoes and Albendazole (de-worming drug) have&#xD;
      established safety profiles and therefore monitoring between each phases of the trial was not&#xD;
      considered necessary. Children in the study found to have heavy hookworm infection (&gt;4,000&#xD;
      eggs per gram of stool) were treated by a paediatrician with stat Mebendazole (Vermox 100mg&#xD;
      twice daily for 3 days) and 10 days of Ferrous gluconate syrup (10mls twice daily - dosing&#xD;
      for 6-18 year-olds) directly following diagnosis.&#xD;
