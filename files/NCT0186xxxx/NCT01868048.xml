    <time_frame>The Modified Ashworth Scale will be performed at each visit of the study</time_frame>
    <description>All 20 muscle groups were assessed for spasticity (using a 0-4 scale): 0= no increase in muscle tone to 4=considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement is difficult. The score for all 20 muscle groups were added to give a total score out of 80. A decrease in score indicates an improvement in condition.</description>

    <measure>Subject global impression of change (SGIC) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>To be completed by the patient at every visit during treatment</time_frame>
    <description>At Visit 2 (i.e. prior to commencing any treatment) subjects were asked to write a brief description of their spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis and how it affected them emotionally, physically and their ability to function with day to day activities. If subjects were unable to write due to disability then the investigator staff could assist as necessary. Prior to answering the Subject global impression of change, subjects were given the description of their spasticity to aid their memory regarding their symptoms at the start of the study. They were then be asked to complete the global impression of change by answering the following question to be rated on a seven-point scale, &quot;Please assess the change in your spasticity due to multiple sclerosis since immediately before receiving the first course of study treatment (Visit 2) using the scale below&quot; with this anchors: Very much worse, Much worse, Minimally worse, No change, Minimally better, Much better, Very much better.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Spasticity due to multiple sclerosis of at least six months duration, which is not&#xD;
             wholly relieved with current anti-spasticity therapy, and which is expected to remain&#xD;
             stable for the duration of the study.&#xD;

             stable dose for at least three months prior to the screening visit; the dose must also&#xD;
             remain stable for the duration of the study.&#xD;
