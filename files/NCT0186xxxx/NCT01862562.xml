  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly patients have poorer preoperative conditions than younger patients. Therefore,&#xD;
      minimally invasive surgery should be an effective treatment method for elderly patients. The&#xD;
      investigators conducted a randomized trial that compared laparoscopic surgery and&#xD;
      conventional open surgery in elderly patients who were 75 years old or over. The purpose of&#xD;
      the present study was to clarify the effect of laparoscopic surgery in elderly patients. In&#xD;
      our hypothesis of this trial, laparoscopic surgery is superior to conventional open surgery&#xD;
      in short-term results, and same outcome in long -term results. Therefore, laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgery would be recommended as standard procedure in an elderly colorectal patient.&#xD;

      Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This was a randomized controlled trial conducted at a single institute, which was&#xD;
           Yokohama City University Medical Center (Japan).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  200 patients were age of 75 years old or over were randomly allocated to receive&#xD;
           laparoscopic surgery or conventional open surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All surgical procedures were performed by one specialized colorectal treatment team. The&#xD;
           laparoscopic surgeries were performed by a surgeon who passed the skill accreditation&#xD;
           system for laparoscopic gastroenterological surgery was established by the Japanese&#xD;
           Society for Endoscopic Surgery (JSES), and all open surgeries were performed under the&#xD;
           supervision of these skillful surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All operations were performed according to the standard radical cure procedure described&#xD;
           in the seventh edition of the Japanese General Rules for Clinical and Pathological&#xD;
           Studies on Cancer of the Colon, Rectum and Anus. That is, intestinal excision with lymph&#xD;
           node dissection that separated the feeding blood vessel at its origin was performed in&#xD;
           all surgical procedures. Patients who underwent palliative partial excision were not&#xD;
           included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the laparoscopic surgery, a medial-to-lateral approach was performed in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the conventional open surgery, the first procedure was done in lateral approach. The&#xD;
           reconstruction techniques were the same as those used in laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To balance the operative backgrounds between the laparoscopic and the conventional open&#xD;
           surgery groups, the patients were stratified by the tumor location (right colon, left&#xD;
           colon and rectum).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A transverse colon cancer was allocated to the right colon group, and a rectosigmoid&#xD;
           cancer was allocated to the rectum group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjuvant therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When the pathological stage was diagnosed as stage 3 by histological examination of the&#xD;
           resected specimen, adjuvant chemotherapy was done with oral fluoropyrimidine anti-cancer&#xD;
           drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neither radiation therapy nor preoperative chemotherapy was given to any patient.&#xD;
           Preoperative chemo-radiotherapy even for rectal cancer is not yet standard treatment in&#xD;
           Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The preoperative parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Operative assessment parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative assessment parameters An early postoperative complication was defined as a&#xD;
           complication that occurred between the finish of the operation and postoperative day 30.&#xD;
           A late postoperative complication was defined as a complication that occurred after&#xD;
           postoperative day 30. The terminologies of complications were classified according to&#xD;
           the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, and grading was&#xD;
           done by Classification of Surgical Complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pathological results were recorded according to the 7th edition of the Japanese&#xD;
           General Rules for Clinical and Pathological Studies on Cancer of the Colon, Rectum and&#xD;
           Anus and 7th edition of primary tumor, regional nodes, metastasis (TNM) classification.&#xD;
           Circumferential margin involvement was defined as exposure of a cancer cell at the&#xD;
           vertical dissection surface on histological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life (QOL) scores. The QOL score was measured using the 36-item Short Form&#xD;
           Health Survey (SF-36) version 2.0. It is a tool that measures health-related QOL (HRQOL)&#xD;
           according to an inclusive standard and not a disease-specific standard. The SF-36 is&#xD;
           composed of 36 questions. The score is expressed numerically by the provided scoring&#xD;
           algorithm. SF-36 questionnaires were sent to the patients at one month, 6 months and one&#xD;
           year after the surgery by postal mail. A return envelope was enclosed with the SF-36&#xD;
           questionnaire, and the patient sent it back to the research secretariat by postal mail.&#xD;
           A questionnaire on the defecation situation and wound pain besides the SF-36 was added&#xD;
           all three times. The question of when complete rehabilitation occurred was added in the&#xD;
           questionnaire at one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The follow-up schedule was as follows according to stage. Patients with stages 0 and 1 were&#xD;
      followed up with outpatient examinations including tumor marker measurements, and chest,&#xD;
      abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) once a year for five years. Patients with stage&#xD;
      2 and 3a were examined by CT and tumor marker measurements every six months for the first two&#xD;
      years. These examinations were done once a year from the third year to the fifth year.&#xD;
      Patients with stage 3b and 3c were examined by CT and tumor marker measurements every four&#xD;
      months for the first two years, and every six months from the third year to the fifth year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary endpoint was early complication rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The secondary endpoints were 5-year overall survival, 3-year recurrence-free survival,&#xD;
           length of postoperative hospital stay, and HRQOL score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A sample size of 200 patients was assured to achieve a power of more than 80% to detect&#xD;
           a difference between the groups using a two-sided Chi-squared test with type I error&#xD;
           rate equal to 0.05, when the true complication rates were 20% and 40% for the&#xD;
           laparoscopic and open surgeries, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For continuous variables, data are presented as means Â± standard deviation (SD). For&#xD;
           categorical variables, data are presented as frequencies and percentages (%). Comparison&#xD;
           of the endpoints was based on intention-to-treat principle, that is, the patients who&#xD;
           switched to another group during surgery were treated as members of the allocated group.&#xD;
           The Chi-squared test was applied to evaluate the significance of differences in&#xD;
           proportions, and t-test was used to evaluate the significance of differences in&#xD;
           continuous variables. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically&#xD;
           significant.&#xD;
