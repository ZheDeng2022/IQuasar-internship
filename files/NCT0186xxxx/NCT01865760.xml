  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With increasing rates of obesity the number of anti-obesity operations performed is&#xD;
      increasing; one of the most common is gastric bypass. Anti-obesity surgery ameliorates&#xD;
      diabetes and several other serious comorbidities, but bariatric surgery is also associated&#xD;
      with medical and nutritional complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-gastric bypass hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is a relative rare but serious complication&#xD;
      often seen months to years after gastric bypass surgery. The patients experience&#xD;
      neuroglycopenic symptoms (eg. inability to concentrate, weakness, altered mental status, loss&#xD;
      of consciousness).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)or other&#xD;
      enteropancreatic factors (eg. gastric emptying rate) are responsible for the excessed insulin&#xD;
      secretion seen in some patients after bariatric surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The increasing prevalence of obesity has led to parallel increase in bariatric surgery.&#xD;
      Sustained weight reductions of up to 50 % of excess body weight are achieved in the majority&#xD;
      of patients, and bariatric surgery is more effective in producing sustained weight loss.&#xD;
      Another remarkable effect of bariatric surgery, especially Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB),&#xD;
      is the profound and durable resolution of clinical manifestations of type 2 diabetes. Despite&#xD;
      the favorable effects of bariatric surgery on obesity-associated morbidity and mortality,&#xD;
      there has been mounting concerns about severe hypoglycemia associated with Roux-en-Y gastric&#xD;
      bypass surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an increasingly recognized condition characterized by neuroglycopenia and&#xD;
      inappropriately elevated insulin concentrations. The patients experience autonomic symptoms&#xD;
      with tremor, palpitation, sweating and hunger, and symptoms of neuroglycopenia such as&#xD;
      inability to concentrate, weakness, drowsiness and behavioral changes. One issue complicating&#xD;
      the characterization of post-gastric bypass surgery is that patients who have undergone&#xD;
      bariatric surgery typically experience numerous post-prandial symptoms including the &quot;dumping&#xD;
      syndrome&quot;, which may be part of a continuum of post-gastric bypass hypoglycemia. We know that&#xD;
      affected individuals have exaggerated insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 response to meal&#xD;
      consumption compared with asymptomatic individuals with prior gastric bypass surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten patients with recurrent hypoglycemia events, including the presence of Whipple's triad,&#xD;
      following gastric bypass surgery will participate in this study. Ten asymptomatic subjects&#xD;
      with previous gastric bypass surgery and 10 control subjects with normal glucose tolerance&#xD;
      and no prior gastrointestinal surgery will be recruited. Ten subjects with prior&#xD;
      sleeve-gastrectomi will also participate in order to see if this operation is more beneficial&#xD;
      in avoiding post-gastric bypass hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre- and postprandial hormone levels and insulin secretion rates in response to 50 mg oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance test (OGTT), isoglycemic intravenous glucose infusion (IIGI) and 300 kcal&#xD;
      liquid mixed meal will be measured in 3 different days separated by an interval of at least 1&#xD;
      week. These tests will be performed to see how the response to intravenous versus per oral&#xD;
      glucose stimulation differ in the four different groups in regard to biomedical markers and&#xD;
      symptoms of hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will wear Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) for at least 5 days. During&#xD;
      this period of time the subjects will be asked to come to the laboratory on two separate days&#xD;
      to receive a high-carbohydrate meal and a low-carbohydrate meal respectively. The ingestion&#xD;
      of the will be followed by three hours blood glucose measurements along with the CGM. The&#xD;
      purpose of these test are to see the different response in glucose depending on the&#xD;
      composition of the meal ingested, and to see whether CGM is reliably especially for measuring&#xD;
      low levels of glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects with recurrent hypoglycemia events following gastric bypass surgery will receive&#xD;
      the liquid mixed meal three times separated by at least one week; first as described earlier&#xD;
      without receiving any drug and afterwards receiving either Exendin 9-39 (a specific GLP-1&#xD;
      receptor antagonist) or a Octreotid (Somatostatin analog). The purpose of these tests are to&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that gastric bypass surgery associated hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is&#xD;
      mediated by increased GLP-1 actions. Furthermore we use the somatostatin analog to test&#xD;
      whether an inhibition of other gastroenteropancreatic hormones and a delay in gastric&#xD;
      emptying of solids will change the glucose-insulin metabolism. To evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      these pharmacologically interventions on gastric emptying rate we use acetaminophen&#xD;
      absorption test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is GLP-1 or other gastroenteropancreatic hormones pathophysiologically involved in the&#xD;
           development of post-gastric bypass hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate whether CGM can be used to diagnose hypoglycemia after gastric bypass&#xD;
           surgery?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Which nutritional and pharmacological options do we have in managing the treatment of&#xD;
           this condition?&#xD;
