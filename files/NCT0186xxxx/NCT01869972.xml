    <textblock>
      Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare disease where the level of phenylalanine (one of the amino&#xD;
      acids) in the body is greatly increased. High levels can cause brain damage, especially in&#xD;
      babies and children. This brain damage can be prevented if a special low phenylalanine diet&#xD;
      is started soon after birth. A new drug, sapropterin, can also lower phenylalanine levels in&#xD;
      some patients. PKU therapy is monitored by measuring the blood phenylalanine every week, with&#xD;
      the goal to keep the level within a target range. Recently, studies have suggested that the&#xD;
      variation in the blood phenylalanine may be just as important as the absolute blood&#xD;
      phenylalanine level for brain outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will look at the variation in blood phenylalanine level over 24 hours to&#xD;
      see how much the level changes. The investigators will measure this in patients with typical&#xD;
      PKU who are compliant with the diet and in patients who are not compliant with the diet. The&#xD;
      investigators will also measure this in patients with &quot;mild&quot; PKU who do not usually have as&#xD;
      high levels of phenylalanine. Finally, the investigators will see if patients on sapropterin&#xD;
      have lower variation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phenylketonuria (OMIM 261600) results from the inherited deficiency of the enzyme&#xD;
      phenylalanine hydroxylase, (PAH, Enzyme Classification 1.14.16.1). A deficiency of this&#xD;
      enzyme leads to elevated blood and tissue levels of the amino acid phenylalanine upon&#xD;
      exposure to normal amounts of dietary protein. The elevated phenylalanine in the brain is&#xD;
      harmful to cognitive development, usually resulting in permanent severe mental retardation.&#xD;
      Soon after the development of a special dietary treatment for PKU and of a simple screening&#xD;
      test to detect elevated phenylalanine, newborn screening for PKU became widespread and early&#xD;
      detection and treatment largely prevented the severe neurological effects of PKU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With population-based detection of hyperphenylalaninemia, it soon became apparent that there&#xD;
      was significant biological variation of phenylalanine levels between patients (i.e.&#xD;
      inter-individual biological variation) with phenylketonuria (PKU) and this now forms part of&#xD;
      the classification system for hyperphenylalaninemia (i.e. benign hyperphenylalaninemia, mild,&#xD;
      moderate or classical phenylketonuria). While variations of the classification system exist,&#xD;
      most commonly &quot;classical&quot; PKU refers to individuals with plasma phenylalanine levels greater&#xD;
      than 1200 µmol/L on an unrestricted diet. &quot;Moderate&quot; PKU refers to levels between 900 and&#xD;
      1200 µmol/L, while &quot;mild&quot; PKU refers to levels between 600 and 900 µmol/L. &quot;Non-PKU&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;benign&quot; hyperphenylalaninemia refers to phenylalanine levels less than 600 µmol/L on an&#xD;
      unrestricted diet, that while greater than normal phenylalanine levels (&lt; 100 µmol/L),&#xD;
      historically have not been prescribed dietary restriction of phenylalanine. This&#xD;
      inter-individual variation is generally due to variable residual enzyme activity and genotype&#xD;
      in PKU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-individual variation (the changes of phenylalanine levels in one individual) has been&#xD;
      observed by all clinicians who treat PKU. While some of this variation is simply the&#xD;
      expression of the underlying genotype when a patient's dietary phenylalanine level exceeds&#xD;
      prescribed amounts (i.e. &quot;cheating&quot; on their diet), other variation represents shifts from&#xD;
      anabolic to catabolic states in a diurnal pattern or during intercurrent illness. While&#xD;
      overall exposure to high phenylalanine has long been known to adversely affect IQ scores,&#xD;
      recently increased variability in phenylalanine levels has been reported to be linked to&#xD;
      lower IQ, highlighting the importance of improving our understanding of intra-individual&#xD;
      variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New treatments for PKU, therefore, need to be assessed in terms of their effect on biological&#xD;
      variation of phenylalanine. Sapropterin dihydrochloride (KuvanTM) is a small molecule drug&#xD;
      that can lower phenylalanine levels in patients with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency by&#xD;
      a direct interaction with the enzyme . The pharmacokinetics of KuvanTM have been evaluated in&#xD;
      adults and are undergoing evaluation in pediatric patients, however, the biological effect of&#xD;
      KuvanTM in terms of lowering of blood phenylalanine levels would be expected to have a longer&#xD;
      profile than the blood levels of the drug itself because the half-life of the activated&#xD;
      enzyme would be longer. This suggests that KuvanTM may have a modulating effect on variation&#xD;
      of blood phenylalanine levels in PKU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this observational study, the investigators will directly measure the short-term&#xD;
      biological variation of blood phenylalanine in hyperphenylalaninemic patients by frequent&#xD;
      measurements of phenylalanine levels over a 24 hour period. The investigators will enroll&#xD;
      subjects already followed at one of the two study sites who are treated by diet alone or who&#xD;
      are treated with KuvanTM therapy (+/- diet). During the 24 hour period subjects will be asked&#xD;
      to maintain their typical diet/therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Biological variation will be less in KuvanTM treated patients than in classical&#xD;
      phenylketonuria treated by diet alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine short-term biologic variation in people with hyperphenylalaninemia, with and&#xD;
      without KuvanTM therapy.&#xD;
