      This project was undertaken by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University and other well-known&#xD;
      hospitals in China. In order to report the alteration on the macrophage function in the&#xD;
      spleen tissue of primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  adult ITP patients whose platelet counts remain less than 10 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients whose platelet counts remain less than 30 x 10^9/L and who continue to&#xD;
             experience excessive bleeding after 4 to 6 weeks of appropriate medical treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients who have experienced a transient response to primary treatment and have&#xD;
             platelet counts less than 30 x 10^9/L after 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  require continuous glucocorticoid therapy to maintain safe platelet counts&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to sign written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received chemotherapy or anticoagulants or other drugs affecting the platelet counts&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Current HIV infection or hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe medical condition (lung, hepatic or renal disorder) other than chronic ITP.&#xD;

             (e.g., unstable angina, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension or cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients who are pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a known diagnosis of other autoimmune diseases, established in the medical&#xD;
             history and laboratory findings with positive results for the determination of&#xD;
             antinuclear antibodies, anti-cardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant or direct&#xD;
