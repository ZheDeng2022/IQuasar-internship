      In our communications with the public, the investigators will call this the Not Quite Ready&#xD;
      to Quit Smoking Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One new method to increase quit attempts is to have smokers reduce their cigs/day. The&#xD;
      investigators and others have shown that reduction aided by nicotine medications can increase&#xD;
      quit attempts and later abstinence among smokers not ready to quit. Because half of smokers&#xD;
      are reluctant to use nicotine medications for a non-cessation reason, the investigators now&#xD;
      propose to test whether reduction not aided by nicotine medications can be effective. Another&#xD;
      new method to increase quit attempts is motivational counseling. The investigators previously&#xD;
      found implementation of the brief United States Public Health Service (USPHS) Guidelines 5 Rs&#xD;
      motivational intervention via three 15 min phone calls can provide a large increase in&#xD;
      quitting (OR = 6.3); however, the investigators need to replicate that result. A vendor will&#xD;
      proactively email adult, daily smokers listed in a consumer panel to recruit 560 smokers who&#xD;
      do not plan to quit in the next month and randomize them to a) reduction counseling without&#xD;
      the aid of nicotine medications , b) brief counseling guided by the USPHS 5 R's, or c) usual&#xD;
      care. The first two conditions will be delivered via brief counseling calls at study onset&#xD;
      and then 2 and 4 weeks later (total = 35 min). The usual care condition will consist of a&#xD;
      brief (&lt; 5 min) phone intervention followed by a quit guide. Our major hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      incidence of quit attempts over the 6 months of the study will be greater in both the&#xD;
      reduction and the motivational conditions than in the usual care condition. A secondary&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the increase in quit attempts will lead to increased abstinence. Another&#xD;
      secondary hypothesis is that beneficial effects of both treatments will be mediated by&#xD;
      increases in self-efficacy and intentions to quit. A final hypothesis is that decreases in&#xD;
      cigs/day and nicotine dependence will mediate the efficacy of the reduction treatment but not&#xD;
      the motivational treatment and, conversely, that a shift in decisional balance will mediate&#xD;
      the efficacy of the motivational treatment but not of the reduction treatment.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among smokers who wish to quit at some time but do not plan to quit in the next month:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major Hypothesis 1: A treatment to reduce cigs/day that does not include nicotine replacement&#xD;
      therapy (NRT) will increase the incidence of a quit attempt (yes/no outcome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major Hypothesis 2: A motivational treatment based on the USPHS's 5 Rs will increase the&#xD;
      incidence of a quit attempt (yes/no outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparison of the two active conditions is not an objective of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current application focuses on new clinical interventions to increase quit attempts. One&#xD;
      recent method to increase quit attempts in ambivalent smokers has been reduction of cigs/day.&#xD;
      This method typically includes teaching ways to reduce cigs/day with the aid of nicotine&#xD;
      replacement therapy (NRT). Recent reviews and meta-analyses have concluded reduction aided by&#xD;
      NRT among ambivalent smokers consistently increases the probability of future quit attempts&#xD;
      and abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another recent clinical method to prompt quit attempts is motivational treatments. The USPHS&#xD;
      treatment guidelines recommend smokers not ready to quit receive a briefer, somewhat&#xD;
      different motivational treatment focusing on the &quot;5 Rs;&quot; i.e., a) personal relevance of&#xD;
      smoking, b) risks of smoking, d) rewards from smoking cessation, d) roadblocks to quitting&#xD;
      and e) repetition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for Proposed Studies: We now propose to test the efficacy of a non-pharmacological&#xD;
      reduction treatment for two reasons. First, many smokers are not willing to use NRT for&#xD;
      reduction. Another reason for testing a non-pharmacological treatment for reduction is that&#xD;
      prior studies of NRT- aided reduction have been interpreted to indicate that reducing&#xD;
      cigs/day will increase later quitting; however, since many(but not all)recent studies suggest&#xD;
      pretreatment with NRT alone improves quitting, it is unclear whether reduction or&#xD;
      pretreatment is the cause of any increase quitting in prior studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also propose a replication test of our 5 Rs intervention because, although the counseling&#xD;
      technique of reviewing Relevance, Risks, Rewards, Roadblocks, and Repeat (5R's) have been&#xD;
      part of the last two USPHS Guidelines (most recently updated in 2008), our search of PubMed,&#xD;
      PsychINFO, NIH RePorter (database of NIH grants) and clinicaltrials.gov in 11/11 indicates no&#xD;
      published and no current or planned test of the 5 Rs, other than our study (Carpenter et al.,&#xD;
      2004). Clearly, more than one test of the approach recommended for &gt;80% of smokers who are&#xD;
      not ready to quit (Wewers, Stillman, Hartman, &amp; Shopland, 2003) is needed. Another reason for&#xD;
      our replication test is that our prior Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology (JCCP)&#xD;
      study of the 5 Rs used a no treatment control group; thus, we wish to increase clinical&#xD;
      relevance and methodological rigor by employing a usual care comparison condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Design and Rationale for Methodological Decisions: We will use a three-group (n=&#xD;
      560 total)Randomized Control Trial (RCT) to test whether a reduction and a 5 Rs motivational&#xD;
      intervention each increases the incidence of a quit attempt (Table 2). The reduction and 5 Rs&#xD;
      interventions will be time-matched with an initial 15 min call at baseline followed by two 10&#xD;
      min calls at 2 and 4 weeks later (total = 35 min). The usual care condition will receive a&#xD;
      brief (&lt; 5 min) call and mailed information about risks of smoking, self-quitting and&#xD;
      treatment resources at the same time-points. Monitoring of cigs/day and abstinence will be&#xD;
      via weekly online questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timing of treatments and measure Counseling calls Usual care: at baseline only Reduction:&#xD;
      baseline, Week 2, Week 4 5Rs: baseline, Week 2, Week 4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures for all 3 groups--all asked weekly x 4 then monthly x 5 cigs/day quit attempts&#xD;
      abstinence mediators Subject Selection Subjects will be current smokers who do not plan to&#xD;
      quit in the near future; i.e., about 70% of all smokers, because the purpose of our treatment&#xD;
      is to prompt new quit attempts among ambivalent smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vulnerable Populations Not applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects 560 current smokers. We will consent 560 in an effort to have 516 who&#xD;
      complete at least one counselor call.&#xD;
