      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Malaria is a disease caused by a parasite that infects the blood. It affects millions of&#xD;
      people every year and frequently harms or kills pregnant woman and infants. Researchers are&#xD;
      looking for treatments that may help pregnant women in areas of the world where malaria is&#xD;
      common. To do so, they want to collect blood and other samples from pregnant women in&#xD;
      south-central Uganda. They will also collect samples from newborn babies if the mother agrees&#xD;
      to it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect biological material such as blood samples from pregnant women and newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women between 14 and 45 years of age who are pregnant or are in labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be from the Kalisizio area of south-central Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are pregnant will provide blood and urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are in labor will allow researchers to collect samples from their baby after&#xD;
           the delivery. Samples will be taken of placenta tissue and umbilical cord blood. The&#xD;
           baby will also be weighed and measured. Researchers will look at the baby's physical&#xD;
           appearance and muscle strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be offered as part of this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum continues to be a global problem with devastating&#xD;
      consequences. Pregnancy malaria is associated with low birth weight, maternal anemia, and&#xD;
      gestational hypertension, and both inflammation and the fetal response to infection may&#xD;
      contribute to these poor outcomes. Pregnancy malaria is caused by P. falciparum-infected&#xD;
      erythrocytes that bind to the placental receptor chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) and sequester in&#xD;
      the placenta, where they cause disease and death for the mother and her offspring. Women&#xD;
      become resistant to pregnancy malaria as they acquire antibodies that target surface proteins&#xD;
      of placental parasites. Malaria vaccine candidates targeting the parasite s liver stage or&#xD;
      blood stage may not protect pregnant women and their unborn children. The primary hypothesis&#xD;
      in this study is that antibodies raised in animals against recombinant pregnancy malaria&#xD;
      vaccine candidates will have a similar functional activity as naturally acquired antibodies.&#xD;
      Up to 1500 pregnant women will be recruited into a cross sectional study that will be&#xD;
      conducted in Rakai, Uganda. Women presenting for delivery and their newborns and women&#xD;
      presenting for antenatal visit at Kalisizo Hospital, Rakai District will be enrolled. Samples&#xD;
      collected from the women will be used in in-vitro assays to assess the functional activity of&#xD;
      antisera raised against pregnancy malaria vaccine candidates as the primary outcome of this&#xD;
      study. For our secondary outcomes, we will examine various factors that can lead to poor&#xD;
      outcomes such as low birth weight of infants by measuring newborns for birth weight and&#xD;
      physical and muscular maturity using the Dubowitz Ballard Exam for Gestational Age. We will&#xD;
      also study the effects of intermittent preventive therapy during pregnancy (IPTp) on immune&#xD;
      responses in the mother as well as the effect of HIV infection on the acquisition of immunity&#xD;
      to pregnancy malaria. Clinical, parasitological and host response endpoints (including&#xD;
      naturally acquired functional antibodies against CSA-binding parasites) will be analyzed&#xD;
      using appropriate statistical methods, including adjustment for possible confounders, to&#xD;
      determine factors associated with malaria infection and disease in pregnant women, as well as&#xD;
      pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
