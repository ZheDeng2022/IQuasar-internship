  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to learn more about the heart and blood vessels in the lungs&#xD;
      of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). This study will include approximately 36 children and&#xD;
      adults with CF and 12 children and adults without CF. The study will involve one magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) . The research also includes blood samples to look at inflammation&#xD;
      and lung tests called spirometry and Lung Clearance Index (LCI) determined by Multiple Breath&#xD;
      Washout test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the CF subjects, enrollment will be timed to coincide with routine scheduled computerized&#xD;
      tomography (CT) or the CF subject may choose to have a CT for research purposes. The MRI will&#xD;
      be compared to CT images of the lungs. The goal is to develop better imaging that does not&#xD;
      use radiation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF), the most common inherited disease in Caucasians, is characterized by&#xD;
      chronic pulmonary inflammation and progressive loss of gas exchange units that eventually&#xD;
      results in respiratory failure. There is strong evidence that in CF abnormally low vascular&#xD;
      perfusion carries a high risk of death independent from the presence of pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension. However, the evolution of pulmonary vascular disease in CF and how it might&#xD;
      contribute to the rate of decline in lung function is not known. Knowledge remains limited to&#xD;
      the results of old observational studies which concluded that the major causes of pulmonary&#xD;
      vascular remodeling and hypertension in CF are hypoxic respiratory failure and destruction of&#xD;
      lung tissue. Recent data obtained by state-of-the-art Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the&#xD;
      pulmonary circulation, challenges the existing paradigm. Studies demonstrate that in the&#xD;
      absence of hypoxia, significant changes in pulmonary perfusion and in surrogate measures of&#xD;
      vascular resistance as well as in collateral blood flow begin early in the course of CF. The&#xD;
      newly developed therapeutics in the last decade which altered dramatically the course of&#xD;
      patients suffering from pulmonary vascular disease provide opportunities to understand the&#xD;
      role of pulmonary vasculature in CF lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study (Pilot 3) will assess the relationships between pulmonary perfusion, serum&#xD;
      markers of pulmonary inflammation and vascular remodeling, and hemodynamic measures&#xD;
      consistent with pulmonary hypertension. This study will establish MRI as a readily obtainable&#xD;
      modality to be used in the CF population to obtain measurements of pulmonary perfusion;&#xD;
      pulmonary arterial hemodynamic, dimension, and flow measures; and ventricular mass and&#xD;
      function measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to improve the understanding of pulmonary vascular disease&#xD;
      in CF by examining pulmonary perfusion abnormalities and their association with markers of&#xD;
      pulmonary inflammation and pulmonary vascular remodeling, the severity of obstructive airways&#xD;
      disease, and pulmonary hemodynamic abnormalities in CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include a single MRI of the pulmonary circulation on about 36 pediatric and&#xD;
      adult patients with CF and about 12 non-CF controls. UTE (Ultrashort Echo Time) MRI will be&#xD;
      performed without contrast. CF patients who are scheduled for clinical chest CT will be&#xD;
      enrolled and the scheduling of the MRI will be coordinated with the clinical CT. CF subjects&#xD;
      may also choose to enroll independent of clinical CT and choose to have a CT for research&#xD;
      purposes only. Other study procedures include blood specimen for serum biomarkers and lung&#xD;
      tests called spirometry and Lung Clearance Index (LCI) determined by Multiple Breath Washout&#xD;
      test. Blood specimens will be analyzed for a panel of inflammatory markers.&#xD;
