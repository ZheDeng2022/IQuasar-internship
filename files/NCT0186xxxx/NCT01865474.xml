  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, double-blind, randomized, and controlled study. The investigational&#xD;
      product, DLBS1033 at a dose of 490 mg thrice daily or placebo, will be given for an 8-week&#xD;
      course of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DLBS1033 effectively demonstrated fibrinolytic, fibrinogenolytic as well as antithrombotic&#xD;
      activities. Hypercoagulation state with high fibrinogen level is usually found in diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the hypothesis of interest of this study is that DLBS1033 will reduce fibrinogen&#xD;
      level of diabetes mellitus patients better than that of the Control Group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be 2 groups of treatment, each consisting of 68 subjects, with the treatment&#xD;
      regimens as the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment I : DLBS1033 bioactive fraction tablet @ 490 mg, three times daily. Treatment II :&#xD;
      Placebo tablet of DLBS1033, three times daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examination to evaluate the efficacy of the investigational drug will be performed&#xD;
      at baseline and every follow-up visit (at interval of 4 weeks) over the 8 weeks of study&#xD;
      period. All subjects will be advised to follow such a lifestyle modification throughout the&#xD;
      study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be under direct supervision of a medical doctor during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period, anti-diabetes treatment taken by study subjects should still be&#xD;
      continued. Other treatment related to subjects' concomitant illnesses, such as hypertension,&#xD;
      and/or dyslipidemia, is allowed during subjects' participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other medication such as anti-platelets, fibrinolytic agents and anti-coagulants, or other&#xD;
      treatment including herbals/alternatives which may affect haemostatic system, are not allowed&#xD;
      to be used during the study period.&#xD;
