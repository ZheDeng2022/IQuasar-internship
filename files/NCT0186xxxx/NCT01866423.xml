    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well orteronel works in treating patients with metastatic&#xD;
      hormone-resistant prostate cancer. Orteronel may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the relationship between circulating tumor cell (CTC)-based androgen receptor&#xD;
      (AR) expression level and &gt;=-50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline following 12 weeks&#xD;
      of therapy with TAK-700 (orteronel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess changes in PSA and CTC levels and time to PSA progression (best response,&#xD;
      decline at 12 weeks as continuous variable, etc.) with or without prior docetaxel-based&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess measurable disease response and time to radiographic disease progression for&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with or without prior docetaxel-based treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore relationships between endocrine and clinical responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To confirm the safety of TAK-700 administered without prednisone in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic CRPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive orteronel orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

Once association between AR protein expression levels and response is established, graphical methods such as receiver-operator curves (ROC) or more quantitative methods such as the maximal chi-square method to determine whether there might be a cut-point with either great sensitivity or great specificity (or both) for identifying a cohort with either a high or low likelihood of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response.</description>
