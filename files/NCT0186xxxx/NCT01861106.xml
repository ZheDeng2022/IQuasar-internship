      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - GATA2 deficiency is a disease caused by mutations in the GATA2 gene. It can cause different&#xD;
      types of leukemia and other diseases. Researchers want to see if a stem cell transplant can&#xD;
      be used to treat this condition. A stem cell transplant will give stem cells from a matching&#xD;
      donor (related or unrelated) to a recipient. It will allow the donor stem cells to produce&#xD;
      healthy bone marrow and blood cells that will attack the recipient s cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if stem cell transplants are successful at treating GATA2 mutations and related&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Recipients who are between 8 and 70 years of age and have GATA2 deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood&#xD;
           samples will be collected. Recipients will have imaging studies and other tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recipients will have chemotherapy or radiation to prepare for the transplant. On the day&#xD;
           of the transplant, they will receive the donated stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recipients will stay in the hospital until their condition is stable after transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequent blood tests and scans will be required for the first 6 months after the&#xD;
           transplant, followed by less frequent visits over time.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic and sporadic mutations on one allele of the GATA2 gene lead to a syndrome termed&#xD;
      MonoMAC. MonoMAC is characterized by: 1) infections with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)&#xD;
      and other opportunistic infections, 2) deficiency of monocytes, B-lymphocytes, and Natural&#xD;
      Killer (NK) cells in the peripheral blood, and 3) progression to myelodysplastic syndrome&#xD;
      (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and 4)&#xD;
      mutations on one allele of GATA2 in most participants. We propose to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using different&#xD;
      conditioning regimens from different donor sources in reconstituting normal hematopoiesis and&#xD;
      reversing the disease phenotype in participants with mutations in GATA2, or the clinical&#xD;
      syndrome of MonoMAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine whether allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) approach&#xD;
      reconstitutes normal hematopoiesis and reverses the disease phenotype by one year&#xD;
      posttransplant in participants with mutations in GATA2 or the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recipients ages 8-70 years old with mutations in GATA2 or the clinical syndrome of&#xD;
           MonoMAC. Clinical history of at least one serious or disfiguring infection and GATA2&#xD;
           bone marrow immuneodeficiency disorder with loss of one or more immune populations in&#xD;
           the bone marrow including monocytes, Natural Killer (NK) cells, and B-lymphocytes, with&#xD;
           or without additional cytopenias involving the red blood cell, neutrophil, or platelet&#xD;
           compartment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a 10/10 or a 9/10 or an 8/10 HLA-matched related or unrelated donor (HLA -A, -B,&#xD;
           -C, DRB1, DQB1 by high resolution typing) or a haploidentical related donor; unrelated&#xD;
           donors are identified through the National Marrow Donor Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Two Arms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with mutations in GATA2, or the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC, with a 10/10&#xD;
           (or 9/10 matched if the mismatch is at DQ) HLA-matched related or unrelated donor will&#xD;
           receive a pre-transplant conditioning regimen consisting of fludarabine 40 mg/m2 IV once&#xD;
           daily for 4 days on day s -6, -5, -4, and -3, busulfan based on pharmacokinetic levels&#xD;
           from test dose or real time pharmacokinetics (PKs) (3.2 mg/kg IV will be the default&#xD;
           dose) once daily on days -6, -5, -4, and -3, and HSCT on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with mutations in GATA2, or the clinical syndrome of MonoMAC, with a 9/10&#xD;
           or an 8/10 HLA-matched related or unrelated donor (if the mismatch is not at DQ), or&#xD;
           with a haploidentical related donor, will receive a pre-transplant conditioning regimen&#xD;
           consisting of cyclophosphamide 14.5 mg/kg IV once daily for 2 days on days -6 and -5,&#xD;
           busulfan based on pharmacokinetic levels from test dose or real time PKs ( 3.2 mg/kg IV&#xD;
           will be the default dose) once daily on days -4, -3, (if poor or very poor risk clonal&#xD;
           cytogenetic abnormalities are present, then three days of busulfan IV once daily on days&#xD;
           -4, -3, and -2 will be given), fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV once daily for 5 days on days -6&#xD;
           to -2, 200 cGy TBI on day -1, and HSCT on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-transplant immunosuppression for GVHD prophylaxis for recipients of all groups will&#xD;
           consist of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV once daily for 2 days on day's +3 and +4, along&#xD;
           with mycophenolate mofetil from day +5 to approximately day +35 and tacrolimus from day&#xD;
           +5 to approximately day +180. If there is no evidence of graft-versus- host disease,&#xD;
           tacrolimus will be stopped or tapered at approximately day +180.&#xD;

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA- Recipient&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient age of 8-70 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Mutation in the GATA2 gene, or evidence of loss of expression of one allele of GATA2,&#xD;
             by cDNA analysis performed by a CLIA certified laboratory, or the clinical syndrome of&#xD;
             MonoMAC&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Clinical history of at least one serious or desfiguring infection and GATA2 bone&#xD;
             marrow immunodeficiency disorder with lose of one or more immune populations in the&#xD;
             bone marrow including monocytes, Natural Killer (NK) cells, and B-lymphocytes, with or&#xD;
             without additional cytopenias involving the red blood cell, neutrophil, or platelet&#xD;
             compartment..&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Availability of a 10/10 or 9/10 or 8/10 HLA-matched related or unrelated donor, or a&#xD;
             haploidentical related donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients may have evidence of MDS with one or more peripheral blood cytopenias and&#xD;
             greater than 5% blasts but must have less than 10% blasts in the bone marrow in the&#xD;
             absence of filgrastim in order to proceed directly to transplant. The majority of&#xD;
             patients with MDS will have less than 5% blasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Disease status: Patients are to be referred in remission for evaluation. Should a&#xD;
             patient have progressive disease with greater than 10% blasts on screening/baseline&#xD;
             bone marrow biopsy, the patient may receive standard treatment under the current study&#xD;
             prior to proceeding with transplant. Once the patient has less than10% blasts, they&#xD;
             may proceed to transplant. The patient may also be referred back to their primary&#xD;
             hematologist or oncologist for treatment. If this course of action is not in the best&#xD;
             interest of the patient according to the clinical judgment of the PI/LAI, then the&#xD;
             patient may receive standard treatment for the malignant disease or hematological&#xD;
             disorder under the current study. If under either of these settings, it becomes&#xD;
             apparent that the participant will not be able to proceed to transplant, then he/she&#xD;
             must come off study. Recipient-Subjects receiving a standard therapy will be told&#xD;
             about the therapy, associated risks, benefits and alternatives of the proposed&#xD;
             therapy, and availability of receiving the same treatment elsewhere, outside of a&#xD;
             research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 40%, preferably by 2-D echocardiogram obtained&#xD;
             within 90 days prior to initiation of conditioning therap.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Creatinine: Adult patients: less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl and creatinine clearance&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 30 ml/min; Pediatric patients ( &lt;18 years old): creatinine&#xD;
             &lt;1.5 mg/dL and a creatinine clearance , using the Schwartz Formula, &gt; 30&#xD;
             mL/min/1.73m(2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Serum conjugated bilirubin &lt; 2.5 mg/dl; serum ALT and AST less than or equal to 5&#xD;
             times upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Pulmonary function tests: FEV1 and DLCO &gt;30%&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Ability of patient or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) (if the patient is&#xD;
             deemed by the treating physician to be cognitively impaired or questionably impaired&#xD;
             in such a way that the ability of the patient to give informed consent is&#xD;
             questionable) to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
             document indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this study or&#xD;
             written informed consent obtained from parent or legal guardian if subject is a minor.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Disease status: Patients are to be referred in remission for evaluation. Should a&#xD;
             patient have progressive disease, or a donor becomes not available after enrollment,&#xD;
             the patient will be referred back to their primary hematologist-oncologist for&#xD;
             treatment. If this course of action is not in the best interest of the patient&#xD;
             according to the clinical judgment of the PI/LAI, then the patient may receive&#xD;
             standard treatment for the malignant disease or hematological disorder under the&#xD;
             current study. If under either of these settings, it becomes apparent that the&#xD;
             participant will not be able to proceed to transplant, then he/she must come off&#xD;
             study. Recipient-Subjects receiving a standard therapy will be told about the therapy,&#xD;
             associated risks, benefits and alternatives of the proposed therapy, and availability&#xD;
             of receiving the same treatment elsewhere, outside of a research protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. As therapeutic agents used in this trial may be harmful to a fetus, women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for at least&#xD;
             one-year post-allo HSCT. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while she or her partner is participating in the study, she should inform her treating&#xD;
             physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  All transplant patients remain in the NIH hospital or, if discharged, stay close&#xD;
                  to the NIH for a minimum of 100 days after transplant or longer, if there are&#xD;
                  complications. An adult caregiver must be with the patient at all times from&#xD;
                  discharge to day 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA- Recipient&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents with the exception of&#xD;
             virus- specific cytotoxic T-cells for the treatment of viral infection/reactivation&#xD;
             prior to allo HSCT&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. HIV-positive patients are ineligible because these patients are at increased risk of&#xD;
             lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies&#xD;
             will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when&#xD;
             indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;
             biological composition to agents (steroids, cyclophosphamide, busulfan) used in the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Chronic active hepatitis B. Patient may be hepatitis B core antibody positive. For&#xD;
             patients with a concomitant positive hepatitis B surface antigen, patients will&#xD;
             require a hepatology consultation. The risk-benefit profile of transplant and&#xD;
             hepatitis B will be discussed with the patient, and eligibility determined by the PI&#xD;
             or Lead Associate Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of psychiatric disorder which may compromise compliance with transplant&#xD;
             protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Active infection refractory to antimicrobial therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Active CNS involvement by malignancy (patients with known positive CSF cytology or&#xD;
             parenchymal lesions visible by prior CT or MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The effects on breast-milk are unknown and may be harmful to the infant; therefore,&#xD;
             women should not breast feed during the interval from study entry to one year&#xD;
             post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Presence of active malignancy in another organ system other than the hematopoietic,&#xD;
             except when driven by viruses in which case the immune reconstitution after transplant&#xD;
             may control the malignancy. This includes solid tumors not in remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. No available 10/10 or 9/10 or 8/10 HLA-matched related or unrelated donor, or&#xD;
             haploidentical related donor.&#xD;
