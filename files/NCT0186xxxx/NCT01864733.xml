  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF) is a key challenge in public health. Despite&#xD;
      medical advances, 1-year mortality of NYHA III-IV CHF is 28%. Undernutrition is an&#xD;
      independent risk factor for mortality and complications. Up-to-date, interventional studies&#xD;
      involving nutrition are scarce in CHF. Academic societies are recommending the use of oral&#xD;
      nutritional supplements (ONS) in case of weight loss, without defining the modalities. ONS&#xD;
      could improve nutritional status in undernourished CHF patients, but solely administered,&#xD;
      have a limited impact on undernutrition, physical performance and prognosis. A multimodal&#xD;
      approach integrating physical exercise, nutritional intakes, polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids&#xD;
      (n-3 PUFA), and anabolizing hormones, has to be privileged. A recent trial has shown the&#xD;
      clinical benefits of such an approach in patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency&#xD;
      (CRI), who have similar nutritional and muscular characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise rehabilitation is well validated in CHF patients, but has never been validated in&#xD;
      case of undernutrition. Exercise rehabilitation allows improving exercise capacity, quality&#xD;
      of life and cardiovascular outcomes including mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N-3 PUFA supplementation improves muscle strength and endurance in CRI patients. n-3 PUFA&#xD;
      supplementation decreases by 30% cardiovascular mortality of CHF patients. n-3 PUFA could be&#xD;
      useful for CHF patients rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Androgenopenia is a prognostic factor in CHF. Androgen substitution improves significantly&#xD;
      muscle strength, walking endurance and quality of life. In the context of a multimodal&#xD;
      approach, Androgen substitution together with exercise rehabilitation and ONS could have a&#xD;
      beneficial effect on muscle mass, strength and endurance of CHF patients, as already&#xD;
      described in CRI, elderly and HIV patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypotheses that a 3-month multimodal approach associating exercise rehabilitation,&#xD;
      androgen substitution, n-3 PUFAs and ONS improves exercise capacity of undernourished CHF&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      Study aims :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study aim :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the impact of a 3-month multimodal approach associating exercise rehabilitation,&#xD;
      androgen substitution, n-3 PUFAs and ONS on exercise capacity of undernourished CHF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study aims :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To Evaluate the impact of the 3-month multimodal approach on :&#xD;
&#xD;
      heart function muscle strength exercise endurance body composition and nutritional status&#xD;
      quality of life drugs compliance number of hospital stays during one year 1-year survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Undernourished CHF patients will be randomized into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) The 'intervention' group: 3-month multimodal approach associating exercise rehabilitation,&#xD;
      ONS, n-3 PUFAs and androgen substitution. 2) The 'control' group: no multimodal approach but&#xD;
      the treatment currently recommended: heart rehabilitation and dietary counseling during 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will receive by the oral route for 3 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
      vitamin D : 100 000UI/month if plasma 25-OH vitamin D &lt;30 ng/l, ubiquinone : 250 mg/jour in&#xD;
      all patients. Both groups will benefit of dietary counseling. A monthly follow-up of&#xD;
      compliance will be performed during the 3- month treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall follow-up period will be 15 months, including the 3-month treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering a recruitment period of 18 months and a 15-month follow up, the total study&#xD;
      duration will be 33 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: measurement of VO2 at the ventilatory level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is to demonstrate in a population of malnourished CHF patients a 10%&#xD;
      difference (with a 15% standard error) of the level of VO2 variation between the two groups,&#xD;
      measured during the maximal cycle exercise capacity test coupled with respiratory exchanges.&#xD;
      VO2 will be measured by the same operators, at baseline and after the 3-month multimodal&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects to be included :&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 patients per group are needed to demonstrate a 10% difference (with a 15% standard error)&#xD;
      if 1st and 2nd error risks respectively fixed at 5% (bilateral) and 10%. Considering the&#xD;
      potential studies dropouts, 120 patients will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stable patients with CHF, defined by the absence of acute episodes since 2 months, and&#xD;
      absence of exercise rehabilitation in the two last months NYHA III Heart failure VO2 peak &lt;&#xD;
      18 ml/kg/min Left ventricle ejection fraction ≤ 40% Age ≥ 18 years, informed, having given&#xD;
      their consent Absence of acute disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Undernutrition, defined by :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Involuntary weight loss ≥5% during the 12 last months, without any increase of diuretics&#xD;
      doses or body mass index &lt;20 or fat-free mass index assessed by BIA &lt;18 in men, and &lt;15 in&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart failure related to pulmonary hypertension Heart failure treatable by surgery or&#xD;
      angioplasty Patients eligible to ventricular resynchronisation Instable heart failure&#xD;
      Patients waiting for transplantation On-going imunosuppressant or corticosteroids Disease&#xD;
      affecting 6-month survival (end-stage cancer, or chronic disease,…) Positive VIH or hepatitis&#xD;
      C serology Liver failure Respiratory insufficiency End-stage (stage 5) renal failure&#xD;
      (creatinine clearance ≤15ml/kg/min) Acute disease Previous history of hormonal cancer&#xD;
      (breast, prostate) Suspected or proved hormonal cancer (breast, prostate) Hypersensibility to&#xD;
      testosterone or components of testosterone patch Liver tumor or previous history of liver&#xD;
      tumor Unability or contra-indication to rehabilitation program (defined by the French society&#xD;
      of Cardiology including contra-indication to physical exercise) Orthopedical limitations to&#xD;
      exercise Type 2 diabetes requiring insulin since less than 3 months Patients having not&#xD;
      giving their consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis STATA V10 (Stata Corp) will be used. The analysis will be performed by&#xD;
      intention-to-treat, and, secondly per-protocol. All statistical tests (except for&#xD;
      intermediary analysis) will be performed considering a 5% α error risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be presented as mean and standard deviation if normal distribution&#xD;
      (Shapiro-Wilk test), and as median, quartiles and extremes, if not. Qualitative variables&#xD;
      will be expressed as n (%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons between groups will be (1) systematic without any adjustment, and (2) with&#xD;
      adjustment on factors not equally distributed between groups despite randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main endpoint, i.e. ventilatory peak VO2, wil be compared between randomization groups by&#xD;
      Student or Kruskal-Wallis tests. Variances equality will be tested with the Fisher-Snedecor&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of adjustment on factors (stratification and treatments), a linear regression model&#xD;
      will be performed in the context of a secondary analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will be compared according to the same tests and by Chi2 test or exact&#xD;
      Fisher test for qualitative parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure the variation through time of the different collected parameters, a longitudinal&#xD;
      data analysis with ANOVA for repeated data, or Friedman test, followed by a post-hoc test and&#xD;
      by mixt models allowing to study inter- or intra-patient variabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-group comparisons will be performed with paired-t Student or Wilcoxon tests for&#xD;
      quantitative parameters and Stuart-Maxwell test for qualitative parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12-month survival analysis will be performed according to: univariate analysis: comparison of&#xD;
      survival curves with Kaplan-Meier method by log-rank test multivariate analysis with Cox&#xD;
      model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multivariate analysis models of quality of life (e.g. SF36) will consider the group effect&#xD;
      and the patient's demographical/clinical data. To keep a 5% risk for every analysed area, a&#xD;
      procedure of 1st species risk correction will be done to calculate the level of significancy&#xD;
      of each test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of expected missing data of the main endpoint was estimated to 20%. A sensitivity&#xD;
      analysis of these data will be performed to evaluate its statistical nature: MAR or MCAR and,&#xD;
      if necessary it will be decided to use the most appropriate method.&#xD;
