  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the SONR-ECHO trial is to demonstrate that optimization of CRT&#xD;
      parameters by SonR technology is able to increase the rate of CRT-D responders, based on&#xD;
      significant LV reverse remodeling, as compared to Standard of Care settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also evaluate the effectiveness of CRT-D SonR system as compared to Standard&#xD;
      of care (SoC) programming methods in providing appropriate LV filling, as expected from the&#xD;
      Ritter method.&#xD;

      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of CRT-D SonR system as compared to SoC&#xD;
      programming methods to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase the rate of patients responding to CRT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide appropriate hemodynamic cardiac effect, as expected from the Ritter method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identification of CRT responders, as defined by echocardiography, generally refers to a&#xD;
      significant reduction of the LV End-Systolic Diameter (LVESD) and/or LVESV during Follow-Up&#xD;
      (FUp).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be considered as responders to CRT if their LVESV decreased by &gt; 15% after 6&#xD;
      months of CRT therapy as compared to baseline. The percentage of CRT responders will be&#xD;
      compared between the two study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SoC is defined as the standard CRT system programming/optimization method currently used by&#xD;
      physicians in study centers and any method may be used in the study if considered as routine&#xD;
      practice in the study center.&#xD;

    <description>For the purpose of this study, CRT-responders are defined as patients experiencing a decrease in LVESV of 15% or more at M6 Fup as most clinical trials used.&#xD;
The main objective of the SONR-ECHO trial is to show a minimum increase of CRT-responders rate of 15% (up to 72% or more) in the SonR study group as compared to SoC arm.</description>

    <description>The Ritter's method attempts to optimize AV and VV timings in dual-chamber PM patients. According to this method, AV delay is optimal when LVFT is maximal and mitral valve closure only occurs after atrial systole (A-wave) is complete.</description>
