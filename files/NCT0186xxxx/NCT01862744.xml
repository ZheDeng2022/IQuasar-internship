      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Parkinson's disease causes slow movements, stiffness, and tremor. It can get worse over&#xD;
      time, and in some cases can lead to dementia. Researchers are interested in how dementia&#xD;
      affects the brain in people with Parkinson's disease. They will study both people with&#xD;
      Parkinson s disease and healthy volunteers. They will give tests of thinking and memory, and&#xD;
      look at brain activity using imaging studies. This may provide more information on what parts&#xD;
      of the brain are not working well in people who have dementia related to Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To use imaging studies to see what parts of the brain do not work well in people with&#xD;
      dementia caused by Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 40 years of age who have Parkinson s disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers at least 40 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study requires two outpatient visits over 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have tests of thinking, memory, and concentration. They will answer&#xD;
           questions and fill out questionnaires. The tests will also look at how quickly they can&#xD;
           move and handle small objects. The tests will take about 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have magnetic resonance imaging to study the brain. Functional MRI&#xD;
           (fMRI) can show what parts of the brain are used when performing a task. Participants&#xD;
           will respond to images on a computer screen during fMRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this protocol is to identify the neural correlates of cognitive impairment in&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parkinson disease (PD) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will study 36 PD patients, defined by the UK Parkinson s Society Brain Bank diagnostic&#xD;
&#xD;
      criteria [1], consisting of 12 patients with cognitively normal PD (PD-CogNL), 12 with PD&#xD;
&#xD;
      with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) [2], and 12 with PD with dementia (PDD) [3]. We&#xD;
&#xD;
      will also study 12 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers (HVs) as controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study and includes 3 PD patient subgroups (PD-CogNL, PD-MCI and PDD)&#xD;
      and HVs group. Eligible participants will have one visit lasting 2- 4 days, ideally over 2&#xD;
      consecutive days. If the visit cannot be completed within that time frame, a second visit may&#xD;
      be scheduled within 3 months to complete the assessments. They will have a clinical&#xD;
      assessment, cognitive assessment, and MRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures and Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score and&#xD;
&#xD;
      functional connectivity of cognitive networks, including default mode network, using&#xD;
      restingstate&#xD;
&#xD;
      functional MRI (fMRI). We hypothesize that there is a group difference in functional&#xD;
&#xD;
      connectivity of cognitive networks between the PD patient subgroups and HVs. We also&#xD;
&#xD;
      hypothesize that there is a correlation between the MMSE score and functional connectivity&#xD;
&#xD;
      of the default mode network in PD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures are fractional anisotropy (FA) values, functional&#xD;
&#xD;
      connectivity of the cognitive networks during working memory tasks, olfactory function&#xD;
&#xD;
      score and the functional connectivity of olfactory network, and scales of brain perfusion and&#xD;
&#xD;
      the functional connectivity of default mode network. We hypothesize that there: 1) is a group&#xD;
&#xD;
      difference in FA values between PD patient subgroups and the HVs; 2) are group differences&#xD;
&#xD;
      in functional connectivity of the cognitive networks during the working memory task&#xD;
&#xD;
      between PD patient subgroups and HVs; 3) is a correlation between olfactory function and&#xD;
&#xD;
      functional connectivity of the olfactory network in patients with PD-CogNL or PD-MCI; and&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) are correlations between brain perfusion and the functional connectivity of the default&#xD;
&#xD;
      mode network in PD patients.&#xD;
