      The aim of this observational study was to describe usual practices in lymphedema management&#xD;
      in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was the opportunity to assess the effects of these practices on lymphedema volume in a&#xD;
      large number of patients, to identify predictive factors of response, and to assess the&#xD;
      safety of this therapy.&#xD;

      Lymphoedema is commonly treated according a strategy called Complex Decongestive Therapy&#xD;
      (CDT). This CDT is usually composed of 2 different treatment phases. The first phase is an&#xD;
      acute phase which aim is to reduce affected limb volume. The second phase is a maintenance&#xD;
      phase which aim is to maintain as long as possible the volume reduction acheived during the&#xD;
      first phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These 2 phases required multi modal parameters such as bandages, lymphatic drainages,&#xD;
      physical exercises...and can be managed very differently from one site to another.&#xD;
