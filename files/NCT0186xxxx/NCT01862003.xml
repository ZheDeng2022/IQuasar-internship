      Recruitment to phase I of the PANTHER trial is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II, is to evaluate the best overall response rate for AZD8931 + FOLFIRI treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PANTHER is a registered phase I/phase II trial in patients with recurrent or metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase II part of the study will be a single arm trial. Patients will receive AZD8931 (an&#xD;
      EGFR/ERBB inhibitor) in combination with FOLinic acid, Fluorouracil and IRInotecan (FOLFIRI),&#xD;
      Treatment will be given in two-weekly cycles. Phase II's primary objective is to evaluate the&#xD;
      Best overall response&#xD;

    <measure>To evaluate the efficacy of AZD8931 plus FOLFIRI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks post treatment start</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage change in tumour size will be considered the best response only if a second assessment has been carried out which confirms SD at least four weeks after trial entry. Assessment will be determined using CT scans performed at baseline, 12 weeks after start of chemotherapy, then every 3 months until disease progression up to 3 years from registration/ randomisation</description>

    <measure>Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of randomisation to date of documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 3 years from date of registration/ randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival time will be calculated from the date of trial entry to the date of documented progression, or death from any cause. In cases where progression is suspected and subsequently confirmed by scans, the date of documented suspected progression will be used.</description>
