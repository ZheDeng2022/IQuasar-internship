  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To provide children dependent on total parenteral nutrition with Omegaven®, a fish oil-based&#xD;
      intravenous lipid emulsion that may be less hepatotoxic than conventional, vegetable&#xD;
      oil-based intravenous lipid emulsions, and that may therefore reduce the need for liver&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with a sustained TPN requirement due to short bowel syndrome and TPN-associated liver disease that threatens progression to liver failure and death, for which the only available means of prevention at present is timely liver and/or intestinal transplant.&#xD;
Omegaven 10%, 1 gram/kg, IV, every 12 hours until transplantation, or stopping TPN</description>

  <eligibility>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The targeted population for enrollment is the cohort of patients with TPN-dependent&#xD;
             short bowel syndrome, defined as any pediatric patient who, following abdominal&#xD;
             surgery, has a residual small bowel length less than 25% of that predicted for&#xD;
             gestational age or requires postoperative TPN for more than 42 days because of&#xD;
             gastrointestinal intolerance and who has developed TPN-associated liver disease&#xD;
             sufficient to pose a significant risk for progression to liver failure based on the&#xD;
             following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total serum bilirubin concentration greater than 3 mg/dL after a total duration&#xD;
                  of TPN greater than 2 months in the absence of a proven episode of bacteremia&#xD;
                  within the preceding 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        PLUS EITHER:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Platelet count less than 200,000/μL after a total duration of TPN greater than 2 months&#xD;
        in the absence of a proven episode of bacteremia within the preceding 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Serum albumin concentration less than 3.2 mg/dL after a total duration of TPN greater&#xD;
        than 2 months in the absence of a proven episode of bacteremia within the preceding 3&#xD;
        weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with coagulopathy due to parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (INR &gt; 1.2)&#xD;
        will be potential candidates for enrollment, because patients with an elevated INR&#xD;
        exceeding 2 have demonstrated resolution of coagulopathy after treatment with Omegaven®.&#xD;
        Similarly, patients with hyperlipidemia will be potential candidates for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Alternatively, patients currently receiving Omegaven that was initiated at another center&#xD;
        because of intestinal failure with liver disease that do not need to meet the lab criteria&#xD;
        listed above. The subject may continue Omegaven under this protocol at the discretion of&#xD;
        the Principle Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a history of the following will be excluded from enrollment in this protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy to fish or egg protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Liver disease proven or suspected to be caused by a process other than TPN-dependent&#xD;
             short bowel syndrome, including but not limited to hepatitis C, hepatitis B, cystic&#xD;
             fibrosis, biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome, familial intrahepatic cholestasis, and&#xD;
             alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Refusal of third party providers to reimburse hospital for the cost of Omegaven®.&#xD;
