  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity has become a global epidemic causing enormous human and economic costs. Incidence&#xD;
      rates have doubled over the last few decades and obesity-related illnesses such as diabetes&#xD;
      and cardiovascular diseases now constitute one of the major contributors to the global burden&#xD;
      of disability. Overall, obesity has been recognized as one of the most pressing public health&#xD;
      concerns worldwide and effective treatment and prevention strategies are urgently required.&#xD;
      While behavioral and pharmacological treatments (e.g.low calorie diets, medication) are&#xD;
      successful means for overcoming overweight and mild obesity, more severe cases of obesity&#xD;
      usually fail to respond to such interventions. As a result, the demand for weight loss&#xD;
      surgery is growing among this population. However, uncertainties about the effectiveness of&#xD;
      obesity surgery persist and high relapse rates (i.e. weight regain) are common. Further&#xD;
      research in this field is needed to identify risk factors that may trigger relapse and to&#xD;
      understand patients' treatment needs in greater depth. Previous studies have pointed toward&#xD;
      high levels of mental health problems among patients. However, the impact of preoperative&#xD;
      psychopathology on actual surgery outcomes remains unclear. Similarly, few studies have&#xD;
      investigated the effect of postoperative therapy on patients' psychological functioning and&#xD;
      weight loss patterns. Research addressing these gaps is imperative to establish best-practice&#xD;
      approaches. This challenge applies in particular to Middle East and North Africa(MENA)&#xD;
      countries where research in the field of bariatric surgery and related mental health is&#xD;
      largely missing. This is a major concern given the fact that the MENA region experienced the&#xD;
      highest increase in overweight and obesity in recent decades compared to other countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study aims to address this deficiency by examining obesity surgery patients in&#xD;
      two Arab countries (UAE and Jordan). The goals of the project are to investigate the nature&#xD;
      and extent of psychological health concerns among these patients before and after surgery and&#xD;
      potential associations with treatment outcomes. Moreover, it will test the efficacy of&#xD;
      post-operative counseling to improve weight loss and psychological health. For this purpose,&#xD;
      a randomized clinical trial design will be employed so that cause and effect relationships&#xD;
      between postoperative counseling and treatment outcomes(i.e. weight loss and psychological&#xD;
      functioning) can be examined experimentally. The study will start by assessing participants'&#xD;
      psychological health prior to surgery by using standardized self-report measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention condition&#xD;
      consisting of 3-monthly post-operative medical checkups plus group counseling or the&#xD;
      treatment as usual condition (i.e. 3-monthly standard medical checkups only). Additionally,&#xD;
      participants' psychological health will be reassessed in both groups at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months&#xD;
      after surgery. The benefit of the experimental study design is that it allows comparing&#xD;
      patient outcomes between groups while at the same time controlling for a wide range of&#xD;
      potential confounding variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected are expected to make a significant contribution to the treatment challenge&#xD;
      of one of the most pressing public health concerns worldwide. Study results will add to&#xD;
      clinical practice by broadening and deepening our knowledge of the treatment needs of obese&#xD;
      patients. By identifying psychological health concerns that may threaten successful treatment&#xD;
      outcomes high-risk patient groups can be recognized early, which in turn may help to reduce&#xD;
      postoperative weight regain and other complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of the PI's knowledge, the proposed work would be the first study of this kind in&#xD;
      the Arab world. Findings will be helpful for developing culturally sensitive and&#xD;
      evidence-based best-practice guidelines, which are vital to achieve satisfying long-term&#xD;
      outcomes. Moreover, study results will be relevant for research communities and practitioners&#xD;
      outside the MENA region since empirical support for the effectiveness of obesity surgery&#xD;
      remains weak internationally.&#xD;

      Obesity has become a global epidemic causing enormous human and economic costs. According to&#xD;
      the World Health Organization in 2011 overweight and obesity represent the fifth leading risk&#xD;
      of death globally, with 2.8 million adults dying each year as a result of excess weight.&#xD;
      Worldwide, estimates of overweight and obesity have reached 1.5 billion and 500 million&#xD;
      respectively. In addition to an overall increased mortality among this population, a large&#xD;
      body of evidence has shown that excess weight is linked to several chronic illnesses&#xD;
      including cardiovascular diseases (e.g. stroke), diabetes mellitus (type 2), certain cancers&#xD;
      (e.g. breast and colon cancer) and osteoarthritis. Furthermore, obesity inflicts major&#xD;
      economic losses. Past research has confirmed that obesity is associated not only with higher&#xD;
      medical expenditures due to greater usage of medical services but also with increased&#xD;
      non-medical costs, for example due to absenteeism from work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the continuous rise of overweight and obesity is a major concern globally, it has&#xD;
      reached particular urgency in the MENA region where prevalence rates of both conditions have&#xD;
      risen to alarming levels. For example, two recent systematic literature reviews focusing on&#xD;
      the Arabian Gulf States reported overweight and obesity rates from 25 to 48% and 13 to 49%&#xD;
      respectively across the six countries. UAE-specific data showed obesity rates ranging from 26&#xD;
      to 47%. Additionally, the authors identified the UAE as the Gulf state with the highest&#xD;
      hypertension and diabetes rates. In fact, the 2011 UAE diabetes figure of 19% has been&#xD;
      confirmed to be one of the highest in the world. When looking at MENA countries outside the&#xD;
      Gulf, the highest obesity rates were reported for Syria and Jordan (38% and 35%,&#xD;
      respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to tackle the increasing burden of obesity, effective intervention and prevention&#xD;
      approaches are required. While behavioral and pharmacological treatments (e.g. low calorie&#xD;
      diets, exercise, medication) are successful means for overcoming overweight and mild obesity,&#xD;
      cases of more severe obesity usually fail to respond to such interventions. Instead, more&#xD;
      radical measures such as bariatric surgery are typically needed to achieve substantial weight&#xD;
      loss. Past research has shown that most patients lose significant amounts of weight after&#xD;
      surgery. However, weight loss maintenance remains problematic with weight regain and other&#xD;
      adjustment difficulties (e.g. adapting healthy eating behaviors) being common. Yet, little is&#xD;
      known about the risk factors that may trigger weight relapse. Previous research in this&#xD;
      context has pointed toward high levels of mental health problems among obese individuals&#xD;
      including bariatric surgery patients. Affective, anxiety and eating disorders (in particular&#xD;
      binge eating symptoms) were most commonly reported with prevalence rates reaching up to 84%.&#xD;
      However, the impact of preoperative psychopathology on actual surgery outcomes is not well&#xD;
      understood. Results remain inconsistent and further research is needed to determine whether&#xD;
      or not psychological factors jeopardize successful surgery outcomes. Another important&#xD;
      question in this regard is whether postoperative interventions that focus on patients'&#xD;
      psychological health are helpful in sustaining the achieved weight loss and in coping with&#xD;
      postoperative adjustment difficulties. Until now, only few empirical studies have addressed&#xD;
      this question. Findings so far indicated a positive impact of postoperative counseling on&#xD;
      patients' weight management and overall well-being. However, small sample sizes, differences&#xD;
      in study methodology (e.g. qualitative vs. quantitative), and the diversity of therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions provided impede any firm conclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to these uncertainties, it is important to recognize that research in the field&#xD;
      of bariatric surgery and mental health has been almost entirely restricted to Western&#xD;
      countries. Despite repeated searches of several databases (e.g. PsycInfo, Academic Search&#xD;
      Premier, and Medline) and examination of bibliographies of relevant papers no matching&#xD;
      studies from MENA countries could be found. This lack of regional data is a major concern&#xD;
      given the difficulty of generalizing findings cross-culturally on the one hand and the high&#xD;
      obesity rates in this part of the world on the other. MENA-based research in this field would&#xD;
      yield vital insights for policy makers, commissioners and practitioners in the management and&#xD;
      delivery of evidence-based best-practice and patient-oriented care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the proposed study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Examine psychological health before and after bariatric surgery among obese patients in&#xD;
           the UAE and Jordan&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate the impact of patients' psychological health on postoperative weight loss,&#xD;
           and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the efficacy of group-based counseling to improve patient outcomes (i.e. weight&#xD;
           loss and psychological health) after bariatric surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypotheses are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants with higher levels of psychological health problems before surgery will&#xD;
           lose less weight (in %) during the first 12 months after surgery than patients with&#xD;
           lower levels of psychological health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants who receive postoperative counseling in addition to standard treatment will&#xD;
           lose more weight (in %) during the first 12 months after surgery than patients who are&#xD;
           provided with standard treatment only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants who receive postoperative counseling in addition to standard treatment will&#xD;
           show less psychological health problems at 12 months after surgery than patients who are&#xD;
           provided with standard treatment only.&#xD;
