  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2007, the Haifa and Western Galilee district of the CHS set out to test the feasibility of&#xD;
      integrating complementary medicine (CM) within the CHS Oncology Service. In 2008, the CHS&#xD;
      established the Integrative Oncology Program with the goal of addressing patient concerns and&#xD;
      improving quality of life parameters during chemotherapy and advanced disease. The study&#xD;
      hypothesis is that integrated medicine consultation and treatment provided within the&#xD;
      oncology department may improve patients' concerns and well-being.&#xD;

      In 2007, the Haifa and Western Galilee district of the CHS set out to test the feasibility of&#xD;
      integrating complementary medicine (CM) within the CHS Oncology Service. In 2008, the CHS&#xD;
      established the Integrative Oncology Program with the goal of addressing patient concerns and&#xD;
      improving quality of life parameters during chemotherapy and advanced disease. The study is&#xD;
      purposed to assess concerns, needs and perspectives of patients referred to integrative&#xD;
      consultation during chemotherapy and/or advanced cancer; to characterize social demographic&#xD;
      and health parameters of patients who consult or avoid integrative medicine consultation; to&#xD;
      document complementary medicine use prior and during consultation; to assess if complementary&#xD;
      medicine consultation and treatment improve patient's concerns and well-being; and to assess&#xD;
      oncology provider and integrative practitioner communications issues concerning integrative&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
