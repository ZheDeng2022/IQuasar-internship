  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare disease, but with a very high mortality. MPM&#xD;
      is frequently found in advanced stages. The standard treatment in advanced pleural&#xD;
      mesothelioma is cisplatin-based chemotherapy combined with pemetrexed/raltitrexed (phase III&#xD;
      studies showed its benefit in response and overall survival compared with cisplatin alone).&#xD;
      There are other active drugs such as liposomal doxorubicin and gemcitabine. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      cost is an important factor to consider in our population and standard treatments are very&#xD;
      expensive. Gemcitabine 250 mg infused over 6 hrs in combination with cisplatin, compared to&#xD;
      the standard administration of gemcitabine 1250 mg infusion of 30 minutes in NSCLC, combined&#xD;
      with cisplatin showed 75 mg shown in a study to be equally effective in treating cancer&#xD;
      non-small cell lung. A phase II study using this strategy for advanced MPM has shown&#xD;
      promising results. Gemcitabine administered in low dose in a six hour infusion may reduce&#xD;
      cost of treatment without altering the effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Evaluate the response of treatment with gemcitabine at a dose of 250 mg/m2SC in 6-hour&#xD;
      infusion combined with cisplatin in patients with unresectable malignant mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate toxicity of the combination of gemcitabine at a dose of 250 mg/m2 infused over&#xD;
           6 hours in with cisplatin in patients with unresectable malignant mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with&#xD;
           unresectable MM treated with this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination therapy of gemcitabine at a dose of 250 mg/m2 infusion of 6 hrs applied on day 1&#xD;
      and 8 combined with cisplatin 35 mg/m2SC applied on day 1 of 3 weeks cycles is a treatment&#xD;
      that provides similar results in responses when compared with previous studies with the same&#xD;
      combination therapy, but with a conventional administration (gemcitabine 1,250 mg in 30&#xD;
      minutes on days 1, 8 and 15).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a rare disease, but with a high mortality. It usually&#xD;
      develops in people who were exposed to asbestos, with a latency period ranging from 20 to 40&#xD;
      years. Most of these patients present with advanced disease, which are considered&#xD;
      unresectable and combination chemotherapy is the treatment of choice. Currently the standard&#xD;
      treatment is the combination of pemetrexed with cispaltin, this treatment showed benefit in&#xD;
      overall survival and overall response rate in comparison with the treatment with cisplatin&#xD;
      alone. This standard chemotherapy in our country is difficult to access due to the costs of&#xD;
      the treatment and the poor economic situation of most of our patients. That's why determining&#xD;
      the effectiveness of other treatment options that have shown activity in this disease that&#xD;
      are less expensive, is of vital importance in our country. Phase I studies of gemcitabine&#xD;
      showed that the maximum tolerated dose varies with time of infusion, 250 mg/m2 is the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose when the infusion is carried out in 6 hours, as opposed to 1250 mg/m2 when&#xD;
      gemcitabine is administered in a conventional manner . A phase III study in NSCLC, which&#xD;
      compared the administration of gemcitabine infusion of 250 mg/m2 in 6 hours versus&#xD;
      conventional administration of 1,250 mg/m2 in 30 minutes showed that both treatments were&#xD;
      similar in efficacy and toxicity. The same group conducted a phase II study in unresectable&#xD;
      malignant pleural mesothelioma that was published recently with promising results. That is&#xD;
      why we decided to conduct a phase II study in patients with unresectable malignant pleural&#xD;
      mesothelioma with the idea of validating the results previously obtained and to study factors&#xD;
      and associated with resistance to chemotherapy as ERCC1, RPM1, thymidylate synthase.&#xD;
