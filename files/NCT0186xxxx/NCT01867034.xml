      It is hypothesized that patients with low pre-PCI serum levels of sRAGE should receive DES&#xD;
      implantation and/ or procedures taken to increase serum levels of sRAGE and/ or decrease the&#xD;
      serum levels of AGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this pilot study is to afford invasive cardiologists with additional evidenced&#xD;
      based information to guide their decision as to which patients should receive a BMS or DES&#xD;
      for coronary implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are to determine whether or not:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with low pre-PCI serum levels of sRAGE who receive bare metal stents develop&#xD;
           restenosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with high pre-PCI serum levels of sRAGE who receive bare metal stents will have&#xD;
           reduced risk of the development of restenosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with low pre-PCI serum levels of sRAGE who receive drug eluting stents will&#xD;
           have an increased risk of the development of restenosis&#xD;

      Advanced glycation end products (AGE) are irreversible adducts formed from the non-enzymatic&#xD;
      glycation and oxidation of proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. 1-4 AGE interacts with three&#xD;
      types of cell receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) namely full-length RAGE,&#xD;
      N-truncated and C-truncated soluble receptors for AGE (sRAGE). The interaction of full-length&#xD;
      RAGE with AGE increases the expression of adhesion molecules, including soluble vascular cell&#xD;
      adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) and the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF- α) activation of&#xD;
      nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) which in turn increases the expression of proinflammatory genes&#xD;
      for adhesion molecules and cytokines, and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).&#xD;
      The function of N-truncated RAGE is poorly understood. sRAGE is not membrane bound and&#xD;
      circulates in the plasma. Acting as a decoy for RAGE ligands (AGE), sRAGE competes with&#xD;
      full-length RAGE for ligand binding. Consequently, sRAGE plays a protective role by&#xD;
      preventing activation of full-length RAGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adhesion molecules, cytokines, and ROS are involved in the development and progression of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and lesion instability. The AGE and RAGE axis is involved in the development&#xD;
      atherosclerosis in diabetes. Balloon injury in carotid artery and endothelial denudation in&#xD;
      animal models increases the levels of RAGE and AGE in the arterial wall and produce&#xD;
      neointimal hyperplasia. Treatment with sRAGE in animal models reduces neointimal growth,&#xD;
      decreases smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, and expression of extracellular&#xD;
      matrix. sRAGE reduces the atherosclerotic lesions in Apo-E -/- mice and this effect is&#xD;
      associated with a decrease in aortic VCAM-1 and tissue factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, we have demonstrated that the levels of serum sRAGE are lower while the serum&#xD;
      levels of AGE, sVCAM-1 and TNF-α are higher in subjects with NSTEMI as compared to healthy&#xD;
      controls 31. Furthermore, we have shown that the NSTEMI patients, who underwent PCI with BMS&#xD;
      implantation and developed post-PCI restenosis after six-months, had lower serum levels of&#xD;
      sRAGE as compared to those who did not 30. In the proposed study we expect to find that all&#xD;
      patients with very low levels of serum sRAGE receiving either a BMS develop post-PCI&#xD;
      restenosis while patients with very low serum levels of sRAGE receiving DES will increased&#xD;
      rate of post-PCI restenosis. In addition, those patients with high levels of sRAGE who&#xD;
      receive either BMS or DES will have a reduced rate of restenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has clinical significance because in our previous study (McNair et al, 2010), we&#xD;
      demonstrated that low serum levels of sRAGE are associated with 100% restenosis following BMS&#xD;
      implantation. In these situations DES implantation will be highly beneficial.&#xD;
