      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Smoking is a difficult habit to quit, and some people find it more difficult to quit than&#xD;
      others do. Nicotine is the substance in cigarettes that makes smoking so addictive. Nicotine&#xD;
      changes some patterns of brain activity, and smokers have differences in brain activity when&#xD;
      compared to non-smokers. Some genes make it more likely that a person will become addicted to&#xD;
      smoking. Researchers want to study how nicotine interacts with genes and brain activity. This&#xD;
      may help develop better treatments to help people quit smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To develop a test of nicotine dependence, using brain activity and genetic analysis, which&#xD;
      may be useful in predicting success in smoking cessation and in the development of new&#xD;
      smoking cessation treatment targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Main group: Current smokers between 18 and 55 years of age who are seeking treatment to&#xD;
           quit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison group: Current smokers between 18 and 55 years of age who are not seeking to&#xD;
           quit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison group: Healthy former smokers between 18 and 55 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison group: Healthy nonsmoking volunteers between 18 and 55 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples&#xD;
           will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The three comparison groups will have one magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan session.&#xD;
           They will have tests of thinking, concentration, and memory both inside the scanner, and&#xD;
           while sitting in front of a computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current smokers who are trying to quit must be willing to undergo a course of nicotine&#xD;
           treatment that includes weekly counseling (for 12 weeks) and e-cigarettes. Participants&#xD;
           will attempt smoking abstinence and will have a total of 6 MRI scanning sessions. They&#xD;
           will do thinking, concentration, and memory tasks inside and outside of the scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For smokers, the first scanning session will take place before they attempt to quit.&#xD;
           This will be a baseline scan. The second scanning session will take place 48 hours after&#xD;
           having their last real cigarette. After this scan, they will use electronic cigarettes&#xD;
           to help quit their habit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After using e-cigarettes for two weeks, smokers will have a third scan session.. They&#xD;
           will then gradually taper their use of the electronic cigarettes over the course of&#xD;
           three weeks, at which point they will be nicotine abstinent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After about 5 weeks of abstinence, they will have the fourth scan. The fifth scan will&#xD;
           be approximately 6 months after start of the study, and the final scan will take place&#xD;
           at about 1 year from the study start.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smokers will continue to receive support on quitting smoking until the study ends at&#xD;
           about 1 year.&#xD;

      Objective: To develop a neuroimaging/genetic/epigenetic biomarker of nicotine dependence&#xD;
      severity that may be useful in predicting success in smoking cessation and in development of&#xD;
      new smoking cessation treatment targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Four groups will be studied: target group of treatment seeking smokers;&#xD;
      nontreatment seeking current smokers; never smokers and former smokers. We estimate that we&#xD;
      will need n=50/group completers to have sufficient power to develop the brain/genetics&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This study consists of a 4 group between/within subject design. The experimental&#xD;
      group will proceed in 4 phases: Baseline (scan 1), peak withdrawal (scan 2), stable on&#xD;
      e-cigarettes (scan 3), and complete abstinence (scans 4-6). Counseling will start after the&#xD;
      first scan session and will generally continue weekly until scan 4 (about 12 weeks). After&#xD;
      scan 4, therapeutic support will be provided at least monthly via phone until completion of&#xD;
      the protocol. The non-treatment seeking smoker comparison group will be scanned twice; at&#xD;
      baseline (scan 1) and at peak withdrawal (scan 2). Each of the non-smoking comparison groups&#xD;
      (non- and Ex-smokers) will be scanned only at baseline (scan 1). Genetic and epigenetic&#xD;
      markers will be obtained in all groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Network and multivariate pattern analysis, behavior on a decision making&#xD;
      task and task based and resting state blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activation in&#xD;
      neural circuits relevant to nicotine addiction during fMRI scanning. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      include BOLD response comparisons between e-cigarettes and smoking and genetic markers of&#xD;
      nicotine addiction and relapse susceptibility.&#xD;

Resting state MRI will be assessed between- and within- groups as a function of relapse status and time since last treatment visit at each of the follow-up time-points (4weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months). These data will be entered into the network and pattern classification models discussed above. This will allow us to address the following questions:i. What characteristics of rsFC are associated with treatment success (vs. failure)? ii. Are there characteristics of rsFC that vary as a function of time post-treatment in successfully abstinent individuals?</description>

        No preferences in participant recruitment will be made on the bases of gender, race, or&#xD;
        ethnic background. Efforts will be made to avoid participant distribution bias such that if&#xD;
        skewing is noted, subjects in the over-represented group may temporarily be excluded from&#xD;
        the study until additional participates from under-represented groups can be established.&#xD;
        Efforts will be made to include minorities in proportion to their presence in the local&#xD;
        population. The major metropolitan Baltimore area (Baltimore City, Baltimore County, Anne&#xD;
        Arundel County, Howard County) consists of 64% White, 32% Black or African American, 3%&#xD;
        Asian, 0.3% American Indian and Alaska Native, 0.04% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific&#xD;
        Islander and 0.8% some other race (http://www.census.gov/ ). Of this population (any race),&#xD;
        2% are Hispanic or Latino.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants must:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Be between the ages of 18-60. Be right-handed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Be in good health.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Be free of active DSM-IV abuse/dependence, or dependence in partial remission, on&#xD;
             alcohol or any drug except nicotine. Past active dependence is acceptable provided it&#xD;
             is at least five years in the past. Those with past dependence on substances other&#xD;
             than alcohol or marijuana may not have any current use (past 6 months) of the&#xD;
             substance on which they were dependent. Individuals with past dependence on either&#xD;
             alcohol or marijuana who report current use of the previously dependent substance may&#xD;
             be included, provided they do not currently meet any criteria for dependence, with the&#xD;
             exception of tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Be able to abstain from alcohol 24hrs before each of the imaging sessions and able to&#xD;
             abstain from caffeine 24hrs before each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. For the treatment and non-treatment seeking smoker groups, must have a urine cotinine&#xD;
             level corresponding to smoker status for the specific test being used, typically&#xD;
             corresponding to a urine cotinine above about 200 ng/ml and have been smoking&#xD;
             consistently for at least one year. For lighter smokers (less than 10 cpd), this is&#xD;
             defined as smoking at their current level or more for at least the past year&#xD;
             (excluding any quit attempts in the last year). For heavier smokers (more than 10&#xD;
             cpd), they must have been smoking at least an average of 10 cpd for at least the past&#xD;
             year (excluding quit attempts). Based on the correlation between self-reported&#xD;
             cpd/FTND and urine cotinine levels [85a, 85b], a single inclusion criterion will be&#xD;
             easier to manage and provide adequate characterization of dependent smokers. Urine&#xD;
             cotinine level provides a biomarker that does not rely on self-report/memory. Quit&#xD;
             attempts will be assessed via clinical interview and judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. For the treatment and non-treatment seeking smoker groups, must be willing to attempt&#xD;
             an acute abstinence period lasting approximately 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. For the treatment seeking group, be actively seeking treatment for smoking cessation&#xD;
             and willing to engage in 12-weeks of treatment involving weekly counseling sessions,&#xD;
             as well as follow-up imaging and behavioral assessments following treatment onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. For the ex-smoker group, must have smoked approximately 8 or more cigarettes per day&#xD;
             for at least 1 year, and have remained abstinent continuously for at least the last 12&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. For the non-smoking control group, less than 20 cigarettes lifetime, none in past year&#xD;
             and no history of daily smoking&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. are not suitable to undergo an fMRI experiment due to certain implanted devices&#xD;
             (cardiac pacemaker or neurostimulator, some artificial joints, metal pins, surgical&#xD;
             clips or other implanted metal parts), body morphology, or claustrophobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. have coagulopathies, history of, current superficial, or deep vein thrombosis,&#xD;
             musculoskeletal abnormalities restricting an individual s ability to lie flat for&#xD;
             extended periods of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. have HIV or Syphilis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. regularly use any prescription (e.g., antidepressants, benzodiazepines,&#xD;
             antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, barbiturates), over-the-counter (e.g., cold medicine)&#xD;
             or herbal medication (e.g., Kava, Gingko biloba, St. John s wort) that may alter CNS&#xD;
             function, cardiovascular function, or neuronal-vascular coupling.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. have any current neurological illnesses including, but not limited to, seizure&#xD;
             disorders, frequent migraines or on prophylaxis, multiple sclerosis, movement&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. have any current major psychiatric disorders to include, but not limited to, mood,&#xD;
             anxiety, psychotic disorders, or substance-induced psychiatric disorders, or any&#xD;
             current suicidal ideations or currently under antidepressant or antipsychotic&#xD;
             medication treatment. The MAI will reserve the right to exclude on the basis of&#xD;
             psychiatric history not explicitly described in this criterion.&#xD;
