  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to determine the feasibility of obtaining and molecularly characterizing&#xD;
      pre-treatment tumor biopsies, to determine the feasibility of obtaining and molecularly&#xD;
      characterizing archival and post-treatment tumor biopsies, to assess molecular expression&#xD;
      changes between archival and baseline tumor samples, and to assess molecular expression&#xD;
      changes between tumor samples obtained at baseline and at the time of disease progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This study will be a companion study to existing phase I clinical trial treatment studies. It&#xD;
      is being done to determine the feasibility of obtaining tumor tissue for genomic analysis.&#xD;
      Patient will be offered enrollment into this trial at the time that they are being considered&#xD;
      for participation in a phase I treatment trial. After consenting for this study, patients&#xD;
      will undergo a fresh tumor biopsy and collection of research blood samples. Archived tumor&#xD;
      specimens will also be obtained and analyzed. At the time of disease progression, fresh tumor&#xD;
      biopsies and blood samples will be collected in patients who have evaluable pre-biopsy&#xD;
      specimens and who are eligible to be screened for another study. This will be informative to&#xD;
      evaluate the mechanisms of resistance to that agent.&#xD;

        -  Patients with advanced solid or hematological malignancy that is resistant to standard&#xD;
             therapy or for which no standard therapy is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are considered for early phase clinical trials in which an&#xD;
             investigational agent is used either alone or in combination with chemotherapy or&#xD;
             radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a primary or metastatic tumor lesion that is amenable to biopsy or&#xD;
             resection&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an advanced solid or hematological malignancy that is resistant to standard&#xD;
             therapy or for which no standard therapy is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Being considered for early phase clinical trials in which an investigational agent is&#xD;
             used either alone or in combination with chemotherapy or radiation. Patients who&#xD;
             decline to enroll in this companion study will not be denied participation in the&#xD;
             primary treatment protocols. Patients who are participating in phase I-III clinical&#xD;
             treatment trials in which a tissue biopsy is already required, or patients who have&#xD;
             standard of care tumor biopsies or procedures planned, e.g. to confirm metastatic&#xD;
             recurrence or palliative resection of tumor, would also be eligible for participation&#xD;
             in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a primary or metastatic tumor lesion that is amenable to biopsy or resection.&#xD;
             Patients whose tumors cannot be safely biopsied by fine needle aspiration or core&#xD;
             needle biopsy are still eligible to participate in the aspects of the trial involving&#xD;
             collection of archival tumor and blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy &gt; 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min (applicable only if undergoing CT-guided biopsy that&#xD;
             requires IV contrast enhancement).&#xD;
&#xD;

             defined by an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,000/mm^3, platelet count ≥&#xD;
             50,000/mm^3, white blood cell count (WBC) ≥ 3,000/ mm^3, and hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  International normalized ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5. Patients on warfarin therapy must be able&#xD;
             to safely withhold warfarin or be bridged with low-molecular weight therapy and&#xD;
             demonstrate an INR ≤ 1.5 prior to the biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document,&#xD;
             agreeing to baseline and/or post-treatment tumor biopsies and/or blood collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who do not qualify for tumor biopsy due to laboratory abnormalities are still&#xD;
             eligible to participate in the aspects of the trial involving collection of blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a known or suspected bleeding disorder that in the investigator's opinion would&#xD;
             increase the risk of bleeding from a biopsy procedure. Patients who do not qualify for&#xD;
             tumor biopsy due to a known or suspected bleeding disorder are still eligible to&#xD;
             participate in the aspects of the trial involving collection of archival tumor and&#xD;
             blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be excluded if their participation in this study for pre-treatment&#xD;
             biopsy, in the investigator's opinion, will significantly delay enrollment and&#xD;
             treatment on clinical trial. Patients who are waiting for slot availability or who are&#xD;
             undergoing a required washout from prior therapy are eligible to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active uncontrolled bacterial, fungal or viral infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study&#xD;
             drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, or in&#xD;
             the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breast feeding.&#xD;
