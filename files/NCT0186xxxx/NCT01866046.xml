      A. Specific Aims More than one million Americans are living with HIV, with over 20% unaware&#xD;
      of their HIV status. Early detection of HIV status is crucial to prevent transmission to&#xD;
      others and to link those who are HIV positive to medical care and other clinical services.&#xD;
      Consistently, the National HIV/AIDS strategy has established a goal of increasing the&#xD;
      awareness of HIV status in Americans from 79% to 90% within the next four years. Thus, there&#xD;
      is a strong need for increased testing efforts, particularly among high risk, underserved&#xD;
      populations. To be effective, these testing efforts need to address many of the barriers to&#xD;
      testing and linkage to care faced by these underserved populations. Victims of intimate&#xD;
      partner violence (IPV) are one such underserved population who are at high risk for HIV&#xD;
      infection and face many barriers to testing and linkage to care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IPV is a pervasive public health problem with 25% of women reporting IPV in their lifetime. A&#xD;
      growing body of literature highlights the association between IPV and HIV risk. IPV victims&#xD;
      are more likely to engage in HIV risk behaviors, including unprotected sex, sex with risky&#xD;
      partners (e.g., HIV-positive, injection drug users), sex with more than one sex partner, and&#xD;
      trading sex, and are more likely to have a sexually transmitted disease (STI). Additionally,&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorder (SUD), highly prevalent in&#xD;
      IPV victims, are associated with high risk sexual behaviors. Furthermore, women with IPV&#xD;
      underutilize medical care and often encounter numerous barriers to health care (e.g.,&#xD;
      transportation, under or un-insured). Unfortunately, very few HIV prevention interventions&#xD;
      have been developed or tested for this vulnerable and underserved population of women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IPV Victims in domestic shelters are at significant risk for HIV (i.e., 69-87% report&#xD;
      unprotected sex and 33% report having an STI). Domestic violence shelters also present an&#xD;
      opportune setting for providing health care services for women. There are approximately 2,000&#xD;
      community-based shelter programs throughout the US, providing emergency shelter to&#xD;
      approximately 300,000 women and children each year. Considering the number of women who seek&#xD;
      help from these facilities and that IPV victims who seek shelter have already instituted a&#xD;
      change in their life, a prime time to intervene may be while these women are already seeking&#xD;
      help from these community based organizations. Further, domestic shelters provide a safe and&#xD;
      supportive environment which is ideal for HIV testing and prevention. Thus incorporating HIV&#xD;
      testing and prevention within domestic shelters will provide access to a significant&#xD;
      population of women with an overall high risk for HIV infection while significantly reducing&#xD;
      many of the barriers to testing and linkage to care faced by IPV victims. Rapid HIV testing&#xD;
      allows for provision of HIV testing, counseling, and test results in one visit, eliminating&#xD;
      the problem of clients not returning for test results. Thus, rapid testing offers an ideal&#xD;
      option for residents of domestic shelters, given their multiple competing demands and&#xD;
      barriers to traditional HIV testing and prevention. RESPECT is an evidence-based CDC&#xD;
      Diffusion of Effective Behavioral Interventions (DEBI), utilizing a client-focused,&#xD;
      interactive HIV risk reduction counseling model delivered in conjunction with HIV testing.&#xD;
      RESPECT-2, which has been adapted for use with rapid testing, is brief and easily adaptable&#xD;
      to many clinical settings. IPV victims, however, face distinct HIV risk factors, such as&#xD;
      difficulty in negotiating condom use and other preventative sexual behaviors, out of fear of&#xD;
      retaliation or being raped by their abusive partner. Hence, RESPECT-2 needs to be tailored to&#xD;
      meet the specific needs of our target population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Specific Aims of this R21 Exploratory/Developmental Research Proposal are to (a) expand&#xD;
      RESPECT-2 for our target population (i.e., RESPECT-IPV) and (b) to collect preliminary data&#xD;
      on RESPECT-IPV + rapid testing's feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy in&#xD;
      residents of domestic shelters. To facilitate sustainability and future dissemination of&#xD;
      RESPECT-IPV + rapid testing, the intervention will be delivered by trained personnel from&#xD;
      community-based CDC supported counseling, testing, and referral (CTC) sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development aim of this R21 proposal is to develop the manual for RESPECT-IPV,&#xD;
      incorporating information gathered from four focus groups with IPV victims and two focus&#xD;
      groups with shelter staff, the literature on IPV and HIV risk, and a pre-pilot open trial to&#xD;
      increase acceptability of RESPECT-IPV and to tailor the intervention to meet the unique needs&#xD;
      of our target population. The pilot study aims of this R21 proposal are to: (1) Assess the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of RESPECT-IPV + rapid testing in a sample of 100 high-risk&#xD;
      shelter women. Predictors of acceptability (e.g., PTSD symptoms, substance use, IPV severity,&#xD;
      prior testing history, HIV knowledge, HIV risk behavior, HIV anxiety, stage of change) will&#xD;
      also be explored. (2) Conduct an open trial of RESPECT-IPV + rapid testing in a sample of 100&#xD;
      high-risk shelter women and examine preliminary evidence for the hypotheses that RESPECT-IPV&#xD;
      will be associated with reduced unprotected vaginal or anal sex occasions (USOs) at 1-week&#xD;
      and 3-months after leaving shelter and fewer cases of vaginal trichomoniasis 3-months after&#xD;
      leaving shelter. Secondary outcomes include HIV knowledge, risk intentions, and other HIV&#xD;
      risk behaviors (e.g. multiple partners, substance use). As a result we will have created a&#xD;
      novel testing and counseling intervention for high-risk, underserved, shelter women,&#xD;
      providing the groundwork to test RESPECT-IPV's efficacy in future R01 clinical trials and&#xD;
      dissemination studies.&#xD;
