      Reducing Acute Kidney Injury in TAVI Patients (REDUCE trial)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Effect of the Forced Diuresis With Matched Hydration in Reducing Acute Kidney Injury&#xD;
      During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional Cardiology, Department of Cardiology Tel Aviv Medical Center Tel Aviv Sackler&#xD;
      Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: RenalGuard system will reduce the incidence of acute kidney injury in TAVI&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To assess the efficacy of treatment with the RenalGuard system compared to common&#xD;
      practice using infusion of normal saline and N-acetylcysteine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population Patients undergoing trans-femoral TAVI. Study design Randomized Placebo&#xD;
      controlled Single Blind Prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stages of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the informed consent, patients will undergo the following baseline assessment&#xD;
      Prestudy exam-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physical examination and medical interview&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cardiac echocardiogram assessing systolic and diastolic function as well as valvular&#xD;
           function&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Endothelial function using the EndoPat® system- a non invasive method for assessing&#xD;
           endothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Carotid artery ultrasound and Doppler including Intima Media Thickness calculations&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Cardiac Echo&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Blood tests- see below for description&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each Patient will provide 40cc of blood for the following blood tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Full chemistry including lipid levels, thyroid function, BNP, NT-BNP, HbA1c, uric acid,&#xD;
           and glucose levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood count&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Inflammatory biomarker (hs-CRP, fibrinogen, IL-6, IL-1, MMP, Lp-PLA2, procalcitonin,&#xD;
           IL-10, IL-35, TNFa, AchE, cholinergic status, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Renal function markers: Creatinine, NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin&#xD;
           ,FGF23, Cystatin-C. Urine albumin-Creatinine ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Endothelial function markers: I-CAM, V-CAM, superoxide dismutase ADMA, oxidized LDL, etc&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Serum samples for HPLC analysis of contrast media concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Serum samples will be frozen for future tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine samples will be taken for basic urinalysis, creatinine, albumin, microalbumin,&#xD;
      electrolytes and for HPLC analysis of contrast media.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catheterization procedures and subsequent medical therapy: All patients will undergo&#xD;
      trans-femoral aortic valve implantation as per standard clinical practice. Briefly, the&#xD;
      femoral artery will be accessed with the standard endovascular technique and it involves&#xD;
      advancing a large catheter (18 Fr) through the aortic arch, retrogradely crossing the aortic&#xD;
      valve, following by balloon valvuloplasty and stent-valve implantation. During the procedure,&#xD;
      the patients will receive analgesics and anxiolytics as per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post procedural pharmacotherapy, sheath removal, and deployment of hemostatic devices will be&#xD;
      left to the discretion of the attending physicians. Following treatment in the&#xD;
      catheterization laboratory, medical treatment throughout hospitalization and follow up&#xD;
      treatment will be left to the discretion of the treating physician managing patient care on&#xD;
      the hospital wards. Specific agents added or withdrawn will be made by treating physicians&#xD;
      and will not be influenced by the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be randomized to one of the following treatment strategies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1-Isotonic saline at a rate of 0.5- 1 mL/kg per hour will be administered beginning 12&#xD;
      hours prior to the procedure, and continue for 12 hours after contrast administration. In&#xD;
      addition, 1200 mg of N-acetyl-cysteine will be administered orally twice daily the day before&#xD;
      and the day of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be connected to the Renal Guard System that will not be activated (passive&#xD;
      mode) as described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A standard 18-22 gauge catheter will be inserted into a peripheral vein of the arm (as&#xD;
           performed routinely for all TAVI procedures).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A standard Foley catheter will be placed in the bladder for urine collection (as&#xD;
           performed routinely for all TAVI procedures).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The IV line and the urinary catheter will be connected to the RenalGuard System.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The RenalGuard System will be set to 0% match - i.e. the urine rate and volume will be&#xD;
           measured but it will not delivered matched IV normal saline. (Diagram A).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The system will be computed to deliver continues IV normal saline at a rate of 100 cc/hr&#xD;
           (100cc/hr is the routine average fluid infusion rate in TAVI procedure)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the procedure, additional IV fluids can be added as needed according to the&#xD;
           clinical decision of the anesthesiologist or the attending physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure (Diagram B):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine IV bolus of will not be given before the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine IV Furosemide will not be given before the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The urine and infusion volumes will be measured by the RenalGuard system throughout the&#xD;
           catheterization procedure and for 6 h after the last contrast dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the investigator will analyze the quantity and quality of urine during the duration of&#xD;
           the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2-Treatment as group 1 and in addition, the Renal Guard system will be activated as&#xD;
      described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A standard 18-22 gauge catheter will be inserted into a peripheral vein of the arm (as&#xD;
           performed routinely for all TAVI procedures).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A standard Foley catheter will be placed in the bladder for urine collection (as&#xD;
           performed routinely for all TAVI procedures).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The IV line and the urinary catheter will be connected to the RenalGuard System.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The RenalGuard System will be set to 100% match - i.e. the urine rate and volume will be&#xD;
           measured and the system will deliver volume of IV normal saline that is matched to the&#xD;
           volume of urine produced by the patient..(Diagram A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure (Diagram B):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ~90 min before the procedure, an initial IV bolus (250 ml) of normal saline over 30 min.&#xD;
           In patient in heart failure the volume of the bolus can be reduced to 150ml .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Furosemide will then administered as a single intravenous bolus of 0.25-0.5 mg/kg (up to&#xD;
           a maximum of 50 mg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When a urine output rate &gt;300 ml/h will be achieved, the patients will be sent to the&#xD;
           catheterization laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional doses of furosemide (up to a maximal cumulative dose of 2.0 mg/kg) will be&#xD;
           given in cases where the urine output is below 300 ml/h during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Matched hydration will continued throughout the catheterization procedure and for 6 h&#xD;
           after the last contrast dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the investigator will analyze the quantity and quality of urine during the duration of&#xD;
           the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagram A - The &quot;RenalGuard&quot; System&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of AKI. Serum creatinine level will be measured prior to TAVI and at 48-72 hr post&#xD;
      procedure. AKI will be defined as stage 1, 2 or 3 according to VARC-2 AKI classification16&#xD;
      (table 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1. - AKI post TAVI according to the VARC-2 classification Acute Kidney Injury post TAVI&#xD;

        -  In every sample -50 cc of urine will be drawn to measure: basic urinalysis, ,&#xD;
           electrolytes, protein and creatinine, and HPLC analysis of contrast media.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Reduction of acute kidney injury (stage 1 or above) at 48-72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;

&#xD;
        2. To determine which laboratory tests can predict AKI in this high risk population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether chronic statin treatment offers any clinical benefit in preventing&#xD;
           contrast induced nephropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine if carotid Doppler analysis can predict AKI occurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine the predictive value of different biomarkers in assessing the clinical&#xD;
           outcome in TAVI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Sample size 110 patients in each trial arm (220 total) Our center performs about 200&#xD;
      procedures annually. The anticipated recruitment rate is approximately 110 patients annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical justification of sample size Under the assumption that AKI is relatively common&#xD;
      (40%) after TAVI, and that the RenalGuard system has been shown to reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      AKI by 50%14, 15, the number of patients needed in each group to attain 80% power with an&#xD;
      alpha of 0.05, is 92. the investigator plan on recruiting 110 patients in each group in order&#xD;
      to assure achieving statistical power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned statistical analysis Standard statistical analyses will be used to compare the&#xD;
      aforementioned endpoints in both study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigator will compare the incidence of AKI and any clinical differences between the&#xD;
      groups. Between-group comparisons of clinical endpoints, biomarkers, and imaging data will be&#xD;
      performed using the Mann-Whitney U ,independent Student's t tests , or CHI square test&#xD;
      according to the distribution of variables. All values will be expressed as medians and&#xD;
      interquartile ranges for non-normally distributed continuous variables and as mean and&#xD;
      standard error of the mean (SEM) for normally distributed variables. Reported p values will&#xD;
      be two-sided, and p&lt;0.05 will be considered as statistically significant. All analyses will&#xD;
      be performed using SPSS statistical software.&#xD;
