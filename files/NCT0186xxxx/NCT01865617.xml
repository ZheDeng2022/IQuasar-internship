      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of laboratory treated T cells to&#xD;
      see how well they work in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin&#xD;
      lymphoma, or acute lymphoblastic leukemia that have come back or have not responded to&#xD;
      treatment. T cells that are treated in the laboratory before being given back to the patient&#xD;
      may make the body build an immune response to kill cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of adoptive T cell therapy using ex vivo expanded&#xD;
      autologous CD8 positive (+) and CD4+ CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells for&#xD;
      patients with advanced CD19+ B cell malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred T cells, and&#xD;
      the phenotype of persisting T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine if adoptively transferred T cells traffic to the bone marrow and function in&#xD;
      vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine if the adoptive transfer of CD19 CAR-T cells results in depletion of CD19+&#xD;
      B cells in vivo as a surrogate for functional activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine if the adoptive transfer of CD19 CAR-T cells has antitumor activity in&#xD;
      patients with measurable tumor burden prior to T cell transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine if the adoptive transfer of CD19 CAR-T cells is associated with tumor lysis&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of autologous CD19 CAR T-cells followed by&#xD;
      a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive anti-CD19-CAR lentiviral vector-transduced autologous T cells intravenously&#xD;
      (IV) over 20-30 minutes on day 0. Treatment may be repeated in no less than 21 days with or&#xD;
      without additional lymphodepleting chemotherapy if there is persistent disease in the absence&#xD;
      of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSE DENSE EXPANSION COHORT: An additional cohort will receive a second anti-CD19-CAR&#xD;
      lentiviral vector-transduced autologous T cell infusion without additional lymphodepleting&#xD;
      chemotherapy 10-21 days after the first infusion if adequate CD19 CAR-T cells can be produced&#xD;
      and appropriate criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 15 years.&#xD;
