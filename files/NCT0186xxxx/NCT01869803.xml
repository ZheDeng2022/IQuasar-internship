      This clinical trial studies gemtuzumab ozogamicin in treating patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory acute myeloid leukemia or acute promyelocytic leukemia. Monoclonal antibodies,&#xD;
      such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the&#xD;
      ability of cancer to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry&#xD;
      cancer-killing substances to them.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To provide patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute promyelocytic leukemia&#xD;
      (APL), who have relapsed or who are refractory to standard treatments, with access to&#xD;
      gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) when no other comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy&#xD;
      is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To carefully monitor safety and to report safety information from patients receiving&#xD;
      Mylotarg in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1 and 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every month for 1 year.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of relapsed or refractory AML and not candidate for standard consolidation&#xD;
             treatment after daunorubicin and cytosine arabinoside OR diagnosis of APL relapsed&#xD;
             after tretinoin (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide therapy or APL with persisting or rising&#xD;
             blasts, and no other comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy available&#xD;
             (including patients not eligible for, or who have access to, investigational therapies&#xD;
             via a clinical trial)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an initial diagnosis of AML, biphenotypic acute leukemia, or APL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have cluster of differentiation (CD)33 positivity of &gt; 30%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 3 / Karnofsky &gt; 60%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase&#xD;
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT])&#xD;
             =&lt; 2 x institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  It is deemed ethical to provide an experimental drug (e.g., Mylotarg) that is&#xD;
             associated with hepatotoxicity (veno-occlusive disease [VOD]) and myelosuppression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to receiving Mylotarg&#xD;
             and for the duration of treatment; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while receiving treatment with Mylotarg, she should inform her treating&#xD;
             physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written Institutional Review Board&#xD;
             (IRB)-approved informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not currently be receiving any other investigational agents for leukemia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known untreated hepatitis C&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to active liver disease,&#xD;

             requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if&#xD;
             the mother is treated with Mylotarg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy are ineligible; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving&#xD;
             combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to gemtuzumab ozogamicin or its parts:&#xD;
             recombinant humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal (hP67.6) antibody, calicheamicin&#xD;
             derivatives or other ingredients&#xD;
