  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke, head injury and other forms of brain injury are a major cause of physical,&#xD;
      psychological and social disability in the adult population. Psychological distress is common&#xD;
      following brain injury, but the evidence base for specific psychotherapeutic methods in this&#xD;
      population is limited, and standard treatment approaches may not be suitable. Recently there&#xD;
      has been a growing interest in positive psychology - the study of wellbeing, positive&#xD;
      emotions and characteristics, and personal growth. The investigators believe that positive&#xD;
      psychotherapy interventions may be beneficial after acquired brain injury, to reduce&#xD;
      psychological morbidity. Because such interventions have not previously been applied in this&#xD;
      population, the investigators propose to conduct a pilot randomised controlled trial to&#xD;
      examine the feasibility of a brief positive psychotherapy intervention in an out-patient&#xD;
      setting. This project will produce essential information to allow us to plan future&#xD;
      full-scale clinical trials in this area.&#xD;
