      More than half of the middle-aged population has radiologic evidence of cervical spondylosis&#xD;
      (Irvine 1965) and a subset of this population develops cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM),&#xD;
      a condition in which the spinal cord is impaired, either by direct mechanical compression or&#xD;
      indirectly by arterial deprivation and/or venous stasis. In this study we aim to test the&#xD;

      More than half of the middle-aged population has radiologic evidence of cervical spondylosis&#xD;
      and a subset of this population develops cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM), a condition&#xD;
      in which the spinal cord is impaired, either by direct mechanical compression or indirectly&#xD;
      by arterial deprivation and/or venous stasis. Although many operations are performed for&#xD;
      conditions related to CSM, no consensus exists regarding the timing of the surgical&#xD;
      intervention or how to select among the available surgical options for a given patient. Many&#xD;
      factors have been implicated in the propensity for CSM to develop including advanced age,&#xD;
      disability at presentation, cord diameter, cord area, altered cord signal on MRI (T2- and T1-&#xD;
      weighted images), increased cervical spinal mobility and a congenitally narrow spinal canal.&#xD;
      The same factors may also determine the response to surgery, either positively (increased&#xD;
      cervical mobility) or negatively (advanced age, congenitally narrow spinal canal). The&#xD;
      potential complications of surgical procedures are noteworthy. Although incapacitating&#xD;
      adverse effects are uncommon, their occurrence in a disease process with a potentially benign&#xD;
      course is of undoubted gravity. Finally, it should be noted that the radiologic criteria of&#xD;
      cervical root or cord compression on MRI are subjective and it is uncertain that they&#xD;
      correlate with the clinical symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is sensitive to the motion of water and is considered to be a&#xD;
      marker for axonal integrity in the brain. There has been much interest in applying the&#xD;
      technique to the spine and in particular to the evaluation of patients with CSM. In the brain&#xD;
      DTI is performed using a single shot echo planar imaging (SS-EPI) sequence which acquires all&#xD;
      of the data for a single slice following the application of a single excitation pulse and&#xD;
      diffusion gradients. While very efficient in terms of data collections there are several&#xD;
      problems with SS-EPI, notably that 1) It is best suited to the acquisition of relatively&#xD;
      small imaging matrices, resulting in either low spatial resolution or the use of additional&#xD;
      techniques to reduce the field of view (FOV). Increasing the number of echoes acquired to&#xD;
      increase the resolution does not produce an increase in the acquired resolution since the&#xD;
      decay of the signal during the longer echo train results in increased blurring of the image.&#xD;
      2) The images are distorted by susceptibility gradients in areas close to the interfaces&#xD;
      between tissue and bone or osseous structures. These factors have made applying DTI to&#xD;
      clinical studies of the spine problematic. Specifically:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The small size of the spinal cord means that high spatial resolution is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The susceptibility effects from the surrounding osseous structure result in image&#xD;
           distortion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The motion of the cord during the cardiac cycle leads to artifacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Readout segmented EPI (RESOLVE or RS-EPI) sequence has been shown to be capable of obtaining&#xD;
      images with higher spatial resolution and reduced distortion in the brain. We have recently&#xD;
      demonstrated that the RESOLVE sequence can also be used to obtain high quality DTI images of&#xD;
      the cervical spine of volunteers (see figure 1) and can provide clinically useful information&#xD;
      in subjects with metastases in the spine. The RESOLVE sequence breaks the data collection&#xD;
      into several segments, resulting in reduced distortion and the potential to obtain images&#xD;
      with higher resolution, but at the cost of either increased scan time or a reduced number of&#xD;
      directions for the diffusion gradients (i.e. reduced signal to noise ratio (SNR)). The&#xD;
      RESOLVE sequence also incorporates real-time assessment of the data, enabling data corrupted&#xD;
      by motion to be rejected and then reacquired. We now wish to optimize, and assess the&#xD;
      clinical utility of, the RESOLVE sequence in patients with CSM by applying it to a group of&#xD;
      CSM patients and a group of aged matched control subjects. The raw diffusion images are&#xD;
      post-processed to yield parametric images which characterize the diffusivity (mean,&#xD;
      longitudinal and radial) and anisotropy (directional dependence) of the diffusion. The&#xD;
      anisotropy of the diffusion data is typically quantified using the fractional anisotropy (FA)&#xD;
      index, however, we have recently shown that two other quantities, the mode and ellipsoidal&#xD;
      area ratio (EAR) of the diffusion tensor, provide useful supplementary information and we&#xD;
      propose to use all three parameters when analyzing the anisotropy of the diffusion data from&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the RESOLVE sequence address these first two of the &quot;bullet&quot; points listed above and we&#xD;
      found that in some subjects high quality DTI images of the spine can be obtained without the&#xD;
      use of cardiac gating, however, for a robust clinical sequence we, and other groups, have&#xD;
      found cardiac gating to be essential. Another issue to consider for DTI studies of the spine&#xD;
      is the orientation of the scan. Sagittal images provide coverage of the whole spine with&#xD;
      relatively few slices, which is particularly beneficial when cardiac gating is employed.&#xD;
      Axial slices have the advantage that the changes in the configuration of the spine in the&#xD;
      caudal-cranial direction are relatively slow, meaning that thicker slices can be used without&#xD;
      a significant loss of information. However, a relatively large number of slices are still&#xD;
      required to cover the entire C-spine resulting in a lengthy measurement time when cardiac&#xD;
      gating is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The investigators wish to try and answer the following questions for the C-spine:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What are the diffusion characteristic of the normal C-spine (spatial variation and age&#xD;
           dependence)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How do the RESOLVE and SS-EPI images of the spine compare in terms of image quality?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What is the effect of changing the number of segments for the RESOLVE sequence?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. When comparing SS-EPI and RESOLVE are there statistically significant differences in the&#xD;
           derived values of anisotropy or diffusivity?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Are the diffusion characteristics of the C-spine of subjects with CSM significantly&#xD;
           different from those of aged matched controls?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Can DTI of the spine be used to derive diagnostic information, either in terms of&#xD;
           prognostic information for individual CSM patients or the identification of sub-groups&#xD;
           of CSM patients? For the brain the question we would be addressing are:-&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) When comparing SS-EPI and RESOLVE are there statistically significant differences in the&#xD;
      derived values of anisotropy or diffusivity? 2) Is there a statistically significant&#xD;
      difference in the volume of the fiber tracts derived using the two sequences or between the&#xD;
      two groups? 3) Is the diffusion data from the brains of patients with CSM significantly&#xD;
      different from that of the controls?&#xD;
