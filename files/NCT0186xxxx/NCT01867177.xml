    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a cross-site evaluation of the Kaiser Permanente's&#xD;
      Community-based Interventions to Increase HIV Testing and HIV Care Utilization Program,&#xD;
      designed to support community-based interventions to reduce the number of new HIV cases and&#xD;
      to increase HIV care acquisition and maintenance in minority communities disproportionately&#xD;
      affected by the HIV epidemic. This effort builds on the President's National Strategy for HIV&#xD;
      Prevention and recent research documenting the importance and efficacy of &quot;test and treat&quot;&#xD;
      and &quot;treatment as prevention&quot; approaches. Hence, goals of this important and novel work will&#xD;
      focus on the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. identification of HIV infection among recently infected adolescents and adults&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. improved access to HIV care, particularly among newly diagnosed adolescents and adults&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve these objectives, the following outcomes are expected from grantee programs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. increased HIV testing among populations at risk for HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. improved health care utilization among HIV infected adults and adolescents&#xD;
&#xD;
      This initiative has been undertaken by Kaiser to affect HIV at a population level via&#xD;
      community approaches to prevention, intervention and care in minority communities most&#xD;
      affected by HIV (e.g. gay, African American, and Latino communities). The University of&#xD;
      California, San Diego has developed and will oversee a cross-site evaluation of Kaiser&#xD;
      grantee programs funded under this initiative. Each site will have a treatment and comparison&#xD;
      group, and will conduct follow up surveys with their participants three and six months after&#xD;
      their interventions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a cross-site evaluation of four projects in four states which all have&#xD;
      two-armed study designs (intervention and comparison groups), whether quasi-experimental or&#xD;
      Randomly controlled trials (RCTs) (depending on site preference). Therefore, some&#xD;
      participants will be randomly sampled and others convenience sampled depending on the site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uniform surveys are approved by each sites' local Institutional Review Boards (IRBs). Trained&#xD;
      site staff (not involved in the interventions) will administer the interview-led surveys to&#xD;
      the participants, using computerized surveys for real-time data analysis and extra data&#xD;
      security. Surveys will last approximately one hour, and will be administered in a private&#xD;
      location in each site city (e.g. at the site agency) where confidentiality will be respected&#xD;
      and where no one else can hear the interview. Survey measures include: Demographics; General&#xD;
      health; Access and barriers to care; Health literacy; Non-partner related physical and sexual&#xD;
      abuse history; Drug and alcohol use; HIV care and utilization and other utilization; HIV risk&#xD;
      behaviors; HIV risk perceptions and condom attitudes; HIV stigma; Sexually transmitted&#xD;
      infections and HCV2; Incarceration; Involvement with police; Social support; Intimate partner&#xD;
      violence; Mental health; Impulsivity; Neighborhood violence and gang activity; Experiences of&#xD;
      Racism; Sex and gender roles. The surveys will be administered at baseline, 3 months, and 6&#xD;
      months follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants working illegally or conducting illegal practices such as illicit sex or working&#xD;
      in establishments with illegal practices are not excluded from the study and will not be&#xD;
      reported to the authorities by the researchers. If ethical issues should arise, such as&#xD;
      danger to self or others, referrals will be made back to the site agencies and professional&#xD;
      social work staff for appropriate intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each site will track participation and retention rates. In addition, site staff will do their&#xD;
      own process evaluation, which will include the following: 1) Documenting recruitment and&#xD;
      follow-up of participants (participation and retention rate data), 2) Documenting program&#xD;
      delivery (program attendance data), 3) Monitoring high quality program delivery (program&#xD;
      observations- quarterly reports; oversight/supervision of program quarterly reports), 4)&#xD;
      Identifying impediments to high quality program delivery, planning to reduce or eliminate&#xD;
      impediments (program coordinator notes- quarterly reports), 5) Assessing response to program&#xD;
      from participants, staff, agencies (survey data; site level interview data may be useful as&#xD;
      well). The local IRBs will review and approve the full procedure, including the intervention&#xD;
      and evaluation plan at that site. The local staff will be hired by some sites after they are&#xD;
      funded. They will do local training on the evaluation protocol and ethical conduct of&#xD;
      research, as well as guidance by our UCSD evaluation staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will vary by study site and no subjects will be enrolled in UCSD. The first&#xD;
      cohort includes the following sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. John Wesley Community Health (JWCH) Institute, Los Angeles, California. will recruit&#xD;
           Black and Latino Men who have sex with Men, ages 18 and above from 3 bathhouses in&#xD;
           downtown Los Angeles and near Long Beach. Of 4,000 who are tested, 140 are expected to&#xD;
           be HIV-positive. These 140 will be randomly assigned to an Intervention group and&#xD;
           control group. The program's outreach team will visit these venues in person to recruit&#xD;
           participants and link them to an existing network of providers in the area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Public Health Institute, Oakland, California. Total of 224 clients (Transgender Women of&#xD;
           Color), will be served by Health Educators (HE) in Alameda and San Francisco Counties.&#xD;
           54 HIV+ enrolled (30 newly diagnosed, 24 known HIV cases); 170 HIV negatives. Outreach&#xD;
           will be conducted through community outreach, online outreach via project website and&#xD;
           social network sites, and networks of existing service providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fortune Society, New York: 70 People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) about to be released&#xD;
           from jail, plus 120 high-risk, formerly incarcerated individuals will be enrolled.&#xD;
           Individuals are male and female, with the majority being African American and Latino.&#xD;
           PLWHA will be reached by outreach staff during incarceration (detainees and inmates) in&#xD;
           Rikers Island facilities and post-discharge; Fortune continues working with clients&#xD;
           during discharge and upon their release into the community and 6 months post-discharge&#xD;
           via Fortune's main service center in Queens, NY.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Institute for Public Health Innovation, Prince George's County, Maryland. 105 PLWA&#xD;
           (HIV-positive African Americans, males and females, ages 18 and above) will be enrolled&#xD;
           in a peer based, client navigation model of an Integrated HIV/AIDS Early Intervention&#xD;
           Services (ARTAS) Community Health Worker (CHW) Program. The Institute will advertise&#xD;
           services and conduct outreach to HIV-positive African Americans through clinical&#xD;
           partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A second cohort has began recruitment as well:&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Action. Skills. Knowledge. 4 Care. (ASK 4Care), North Carolina. Duke University. A peer&#xD;
           driven retention in care program that promotes HIV knowledge, communication skills,&#xD;
           community building, and health prioritization among people living with HIV that have&#xD;
           been newly diagnosed, as well as among those who are accessing care but not optimizing&#xD;
           it. African Americans with low socioeconomic status are the target population. This&#xD;
           program assists those newly diagnosed with HIV to access medical care and supportive&#xD;
           peer programs with the intention of promoting lifelong adherence skills. ASK 4 Care&#xD;
           includes eight modules that help individuals become more active in their own health&#xD;
           care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. North Jersey Community Research Initiative (NJCRI), New Jersey. NJCRI's program consists&#xD;
           of innovative and targeted outreach and engagement, and retention in care, as well as&#xD;
           focus on expanding its referral network, evaluation, and dissemination of project&#xD;
           findings. Injecting drug users and especially men who have sex with men (MSM) are the&#xD;
           target population. The program consists of three components. First, NJCRI does targeted&#xD;
           outreach and HIV testing. Second, NJCRI alters the linkage to care by providing&#xD;
           HIV-positive clients with immediate entry into care. Third, NJCRI alters the utilization&#xD;
           of and retention in care by providing ongoing intensive case management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. 2nd CHANCE (Creating a Healthy And Nurturing Community Environment), California. WORLD.&#xD;
           2nd Chance implements a new, peer-based model that aims to significantly expand the&#xD;
           number of low-income, HIV-infected women of color in Alameda County that are effectively&#xD;
           engaged in HIV care and adherent to HIV medications. WORLD conducts street and community&#xD;
           outreach to identify, link, and help low-income, HIV-infected women of color that are&#xD;
           not currently in the HIV care system or receiving HIV primary care or medications, to&#xD;
           access and retain care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the research will be discussed upfront with the subjects, in addition to&#xD;
      revealing the sponsors of the research and how data will be reported. There will be no&#xD;
      deception used in the survey. The consent forms will also explain the voluntary nature of the&#xD;
      survey, the participant's right to withdraw from the interview at any time, and to opt out of&#xD;
      questions they are not comfortable answering. The confidential nature of the data and&#xD;
      identifying information as well as the limits to confidentiality (harm to self or another)&#xD;
      will be explained as part of the consent process. Availability of the researcher to answer&#xD;
      questions concerning the study at any time will be explained. Written informed consent will&#xD;
      be waived, upon approval of this IRB, due to the sensitive nature of asking questions related&#xD;
      to HIV testing and status. Verbal informed consent will be obtained instead and a copy of the&#xD;
      consent form given to each participant. Participants will be given the option to reject or&#xD;
      withdraw their participation in this survey research at any time. If they should not elect to&#xD;
      participate in the protocol, alternatives available include referral to standard care&#xD;
      services (such as regular workshops provided) and other community=based agencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are minimal potential risks associated with participation in this study. However,&#xD;
      participants may have an emotional reaction to discussing HIV-related issues and issues of a&#xD;
      personal nature. If participation in this study makes a participant feel uncomfortable or if&#xD;
      participants disclose information that requires further assistance by the law (child or elder&#xD;
      abuse, or intent to harm oneself or another person), a psychologist or social work or medical&#xD;
      professional may be contacted to meet with them to discuss their feelings and to determine if&#xD;
      any assistance is necessary. If so, a list of potential referrals will be provided and a&#xD;
      researcher will be in touch with them until assistance is found. Sites will vary in terms of&#xD;
      whether cash or non-monetary incentives are given. Also, referrals to services/ resource&#xD;
      lists and HIV prevention materials (e.g. condoms) will be provided by most sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data safety monitoring plan for this study includes: 1) Data is transported to UCSD via a&#xD;
      password-protected system 2) Only sites will have ID-identified data; the data we receive at&#xD;
      UCSD would be completely de-identified. 3) Data submitted will only be submitted with&#xD;
      de-identified data that is linked with identified data and contact information. 4) Sites will&#xD;
      be asked to maintain notes for reasons of discontinuation in the study/program. They will be&#xD;
      trained to review, and ultimately determine if there are patterns for heightened risk for&#xD;
      study/program participants. 5) If for any reason we find adverse events as a result of the&#xD;
      research studies (which we will check via quarterly progress reports), we will complete an&#xD;
      adverse event form and immediately notify IRB and our funders. Computerized data files will&#xD;
      only have unique identifying numbers (i.e. 10 digit id number), and names of participants&#xD;
      will not be removed from the community study sites. Should participants wish to withdraw from&#xD;
      the study, they can choose to have the data from both baseline and follow-up surveys removed&#xD;
      from the study records and destroyed. Therapeutic treatment may be provided including&#xD;
      referral to the community-based agency, social worker, or clinic/hospitals, as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study does not involve any investigational drugs or devices. The benefits outweigh the&#xD;
      risks because this research only gathers survey data on behavioral outcomes. Also, interviews&#xD;
      of participants in both intervention and comparison groups will help service providers&#xD;
      monitor the needs of the target population more closely in case they need services or are&#xD;
      experiencing barriers. The research can provide a feedback loop back to services if&#xD;
      participants request them.&#xD;
