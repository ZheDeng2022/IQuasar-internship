  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of giving the patient special cells made from&#xD;
      their own blood called &quot;Modified T-cells&quot;. The goal is to find a safe dose of modified&#xD;
      T-cells for patients whose leukemia has returned to the bone marrow.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I multicenter clinical trial for pediatric and young adult patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory CD19+ B-ALL. The T cell doses originally proposed in this study were&#xD;
      based on doses administered safely in prior T cell adoptive therapy trials, but the dose has&#xD;
      been modified based on the toxicities observed in adult patients with morphologic evidence of&#xD;
      relapsed B-ALL treated on MSKCC IRB 09-114.&#xD;

    <description>of gene-modified autologous T cells targeted to CD19 and infused into patients with relapsed/refractory B- ALL. Toxicities will be graded on a scale of 1 to 5 as described by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Adverse Events/Toxicities will be graded/attributed starting at time of T cell infusion and continue for up to 30 days or until modified T cells are no longer present.</description>

    <description>Gene-modified T cells will be measured as per Table II from peripheral blood, bone marrow and/or lymph nodes. The percentage of gene-modified T cells T cells will be calculated and summarized at each follow-up time point.

    <description>Patients with no morphologic evidence of disease at the time of T cell infusion, (&lt;5% blasts in the bone marrow) as assessed by morphology or flow cytometry. Participating site PI to determine cohort stratification in the event of morphology/flow cytometry blast count discrepancy.

During formulation of End of Production (EOP) T cells, under or over estimation of CAR modified T-cells may occur. Patients may receive an altered fractionation of the total doses (e.g. ½ on Day 0 and ½ on Day +1) or up to 35% over total cell dose with approval by the participating site PI. In both cohorts, patients will be allowed to receive a 2nd treatment of 19-28z+ T cells if they benefited from the first infusion and did not experience any non-hematologic grade 4 toxicities.</description>
