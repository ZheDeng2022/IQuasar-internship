      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - An earlier study on child development focused on the relationship between children and&#xD;
      their caregivers (usually mothers). It looked at how this relationship influenced children's&#xD;
      social and mental development. It also studied how these children related with family members&#xD;
      and friends. Researchers are now interested in expanding the study with the same group of&#xD;
      children. They want to look at these children, who are now young adults, and focus on their&#xD;
      current romantic relationships. This new study will look at how child development affects the&#xD;
      formation of stable, mature romantic relationships in young adulthood. Original child study&#xD;
      participants and their significant others will be included in the new study. Only&#xD;
      participants who are living together with a partner will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To look at romantic partnerships in a childhood study s original participants and their&#xD;
      significant others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants of the 88-CH-32 study who are at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant others of the study participants who are at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Original participants and significant others must be cohabiting (living together).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No screening tests will be required for this study. No study visits will be needed.&#xD;
           Samples will not be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Original study participants will fill out four online questionnaires. They will be on a&#xD;
           National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHHD) website. They will ask&#xD;
           personal questions about relationships with the current romantic partner and other&#xD;
           important people. The questions will take about 25 minutes to answer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant others will fill out 13 online questionnaires. They will be on a NICHHD&#xD;
           website. They will ask personal questions about the romantic partner and other important&#xD;
           people. The questions will take about 1.5 hours to answer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will receive a small amount of money for completing the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to expand our ongoing longitudinal study (study 88-CH-32) by&#xD;
      gathering information about romantic partnerships from both the longitudinal study s now&#xD;
      young adult target children, who were 5 months old when the study began and are now as old as&#xD;
      23 years of age, and their significant others. Because the target children are approaching&#xD;
      the age when they form lasting romantic relationships, we wish to track these partnerships as&#xD;
      they form. With these data, we will be uniquely suited to identify how key individual and&#xD;
      inter-personal factors at distinct points of development (i.e., childhood, adolescence, and&#xD;
      young adulthood) influence the formation of stable, emotionally intimate, mutually dependent&#xD;
      romantic relationships during young adulthood. In particular, we aim to disentangle the&#xD;
      influence of childhood and adolescent interpersonal experiences in other relational spheres&#xD;
      (i.e., relationships with parents and friends) from the influence of contemporary&#xD;
      characteristics of both members of the romantic dyad. As part of our examination, in addition&#xD;
      to relationship quality, we focus on the strength of each dyad member s attachment to his or&#xD;
      her parents as well as each other, thereby allowing for the examination of attachment&#xD;
      transfer, an important yet understudied characteristic of successful romantic relationship&#xD;
      formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only cohabiting (whether married or otherwise) young-adult romantic dyads that include a&#xD;
      target child from our existing longitudinal study (dyad N equals 250; 500 young adults&#xD;
      overall, all volunteers) will be eligible to participate in this new data collection. By&#xD;
      limiting eligibility in this way, we will have data extending back to infancy for one member&#xD;
      of each young-adult romantic dyad. All data collected will be collected via a secure,&#xD;
      password-protected website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of our on-going longitudinal study, we already collected (or will collect) individual&#xD;
      information from the young adult target children (mental health, attachment style, attachment&#xD;
      strength, personality, substance use). We propose here to collect complementary individual&#xD;
      information from the significant others of young adult target children as well as dyad-level&#xD;
      information (relationship satisfaction and household functioning) from both members of the&#xD;
      cohabiting romantic dyad. Combined with existing data from our longitudinal study, these new&#xD;
      data will enable us to move beyond most current research focused on the developmental&#xD;
      antecedents of successful young adult romantic relationships and examine how an individual s&#xD;
      past interpersonal experiences interplay with the contemporary characteristics of both&#xD;
      young-adult romantic dyad members to influence the state of the romantic dyad.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Among the young adult target children from study 88-CH-32 (N = 250), those with significant&#xD;
        others are eligible to participate in this study, as are their significant others. However&#xD;
        if a target child s significant other is a minor (i.e., under the age of 18), that&#xD;
        significant other will not be eligible to participate.&#xD;
