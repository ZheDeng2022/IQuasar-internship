  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study patients with moderate to severe chronic graft-versus-host disease will be&#xD;
      treated with a combination of prednisone and everolimus. Patients will be treated on the&#xD;
      study for a maximum of 12 months and followed up for another 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis of this study is that the addition of everolimus to prednisone&#xD;
      increases response rates without increasing treatment related mortality or mortality due to&#xD;
      relapse of underlying disease.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Chronic graft-versus-host disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) is the most common long-term complication of&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), with an incidence of up to&#xD;
      70% in recipients of peripheral blood stem cells. Chronic GvHD is associated with impaired&#xD;
      immunity, compromised functional status and quality of life and is besides relapse of&#xD;
      underlying malignancy still the leading cause of morbidity and mortality beyond day 100 after&#xD;
      allo-HSCT. The pathophysiology of cGvHD is still not well understood, however efforts made in&#xD;
      the last years indicate a role of persistent allo-reactive T cells, B cells that produce&#xD;
      auto- or allo-antibodies against the host antigens as well as donor antigen presenting cells&#xD;
      (APC) that replace host APCs thus leading to indirect antigen presentation of allo-antigens.&#xD;
      Persistent alloreactivity may be due to defective peripheral and central tolerance mechanisms&#xD;
      as a result of failure of control by regulatory T cells (Tregs) and/or impaired negative&#xD;
      selection of T cells in the thymus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corticosteroids have constituted the backbone of treatment of cGvHD over the past 4 decades.&#xD;
      Addition of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) to steroids in first-line therapy did not lead to&#xD;
      significant improvement of response or patient outcome. The expanding therapeutic arsenal of&#xD;
      cGvHD also includes many other agents which have been evaluated in second-line therapy such&#xD;
      as mTOR inhibitors, extracorporeal photopheresis, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab,&#xD;
      alemtuzumab, thalidomide, imatinib, pentostatin, low dose methotrexate amongst others. The&#xD;
      median duration of immunosuppression of 23 months and the high 3 year non-relapse mortality&#xD;
      of up to 40% emphasize the urgent need for new first line treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 Study rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome of patients with chronic GvHDcGvHD treated with corticosteroids alone or in&#xD;
      combination with CNI like CSA or tacrolimus is still very unsatisfactory with an increased&#xD;
      relative risk of non-relapse mortality of up to 7 times compared to patients without or only&#xD;
      mild cGvHD. While corticosteroids are generally accepted to be the backbone of systemic&#xD;
      therapy, the role of CNI remains questionable. There is thus urgent need for improvement of&#xD;
      first-line treatment of these patients. mTOR inhibitors like sirolimus (rapamycin) or&#xD;
      everolimus have been shown to be effective in second-line treatment of cGvHD. In the light of&#xD;
      these data and given the unmet medical need in the treatment of cGvHD, there is a rationale&#xD;
      to examine the efficacy of an mTOR inhibitor in first line treatment of these patients with&#xD;
      cGvHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 Hypothesis and study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis of this study is that the addition of everolimus to prednisone&#xD;
      increases response rates without increase ofincreasing non-relapse and relapse mortality. In&#xD;
      contrast to CNI, everolimus may also facilitate the development of tolerance and thereby&#xD;
      improve the durability of response, thus increasing the time to treatment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 General objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to investigate the clinical benefit of treatment with&#xD;
      prednisone and everolimus in patients with chronic GvHDcGvHD. Treatment change or time to&#xD;
      flare-up of cGvHD symptoms has been shown to correlate with survival of patients with cGvHD.&#xD;
      In this study the addition of secondary treatment will reflect treatment failure and serve as&#xD;
      a parameter for measuring clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3 Discussion of study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic GvHD occurs in about 50% of patients after allogeneic HSCT, more than 80% of whom&#xD;
      will have moderate or severe disease requiring systemic therapy. The participation of 6&#xD;
      centres enables the recruitment of 60 patients within 24 months. The follow-up period of 1&#xD;
      year is sufficient to evaluate time to progression, which has been shown to predict survival.&#xD;
      There is no control group. The findings of this study will be analysed and discussed in the&#xD;
      light of historical data and lay the groundwork for a possible randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The German-Swiss-Austrian GvHD-group will run a registry prospectively documenting cGvHD&#xD;
      cases, their treatment and outcome as from 2012. The control population will consist of&#xD;
      patients treated in the cGvHD registry within the same time period as in this study. A&#xD;
      comparison to the historical population treated in the placebo arm of the impact of Myfortic®&#xD;
      in first line treatment of cGvHD [Martin et al.,2009] will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.4 Sample size estimation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size estimation is based on data from the placebo arm of the randomized trial led&#xD;
      by Paul Martin evaluating the impact of additional MMF in the initial treatment of cGvHD&#xD;
      [data kindly provided by Paul Martin].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of treatment success at 6 months in the placebo arm of the study (standard treatment&#xD;
      with prednisone alone or prednisone plus a calcineurin inhibitor) was 62%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming a treatment success rate of 65% for patients receiving standard therapy (steroids&#xD;
      alone or steroids and calcineurin inhibitor) and testing whether the combination of&#xD;
      prednisone and everolimus would improve the rate of treatment success to 85%, with 80% power&#xD;
      and a one-sided type error (α) of 5%, then at least 57 patients will need to be recruited.&#xD;
      This study thus plans to recruit a total of 60 patients. This patient number will enable both&#xD;
      comparison with patients treated during the same period within the planed cGvHD registry as&#xD;
      well as a historic comparison with data from the above mentioned study led by Paul Martin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8 Diagnosis and grading of cGvHD&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.1 Overview&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis and grading of cGvHD will be according to NIH consensus-criteria. If diagnosis of&#xD;
      cGvHD depends on skin manifestations, an assessment of a biopsy should be organized by each&#xD;
      site itself according to local routine. A central review is recommended but not obligatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.2 Definition of high-risk cGvHD&#xD;
&#xD;
      High risk cGvHD is defined by one or more of the following criteria being fulfilled at time&#xD;
      of diagnosis of cGvHD:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &lt; 100,000/µl platelets&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  progressive onset of cGvHD (see 7.2.1 for definition)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  involvement of &gt; 50% of total body surface area&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  bilirubin &gt; 2 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  bronchiolitis obliterans&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.2.1 Definition of progressive onset cGvHD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progressive onset cGvHD is defined as acute GvHD preceding cGvHD whereby either&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. no complete response (CR) of acute GvHD is attained before onset of cGvHD or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the time between CR of aGvHD and onset of symptoms of cGvHD is less than 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.3 GvHD prophylaxis and acute GvHD therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.3.1 GvHD prophylaxis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any kind of GvHD prophylaxis may have been used, including mTOR-containing regimens. Type of&#xD;
      GvHD prophylaxis will be documented and included in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.3.2 Acute GvHD therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any kind of acute GvHD therapy may have been used, excluding mTOR inhibitors (everolimus or&#xD;
      sirolimus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.3.3 Conditioning regimen and stem cell source&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any kind of conditioning regimen (myeloablative or reduced intensity) may have been used&#xD;
           for transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stem cell source may have been bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells or cord blood&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Donors may have been related or unrelated, matched or mismatched Conditioning intensity,&#xD;
           stem cell source donor type and donor/recipient histocompatibility will be documented&#xD;
           and included in analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.6 Patients' evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.6.1 Assessment of pre-registration characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to enrolment in the study patients will be examined for inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. A comprehensive assessment of organ involvement shall be performed according to the&#xD;
      NIH consensus criteria. The time between this examination and the initiation of study&#xD;
      treatment should be maximum 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.7 Study monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.7.1 Clinical assessment visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular clinical assessment visits are planned to include patient's physical examination,&#xD;
      blood counts, blood chemistry and everolimus level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.7.2 Response assessment visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response to treatment will be assessed after 2 weeks, month 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 after&#xD;
      initiation of treatment, before introduction of secondary treatment and in case of premature&#xD;
      study withdrawal. Response assessment will be performed prospectively as described in the&#xD;
      publication by Martin et al. and retrospectively according to NIH consensus recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.7.3 End of study assessment visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients going off protocol regularly (after complete response or max. 1 year of treatment)&#xD;
      or prematurely will undergo response assessment as outlined in section 8.7.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11 Treatment plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.1 Overview&#xD;
&#xD;
      After diagnosis of cGvHD patients will receive prednisone 1 mg/kg BW orally and everolimus&#xD;
      (whole tablets or dispersible tablets) orally (targeted trough level 3-8 µg/l). Prednisone&#xD;
      may also be administered intravenously at 1 mg/kg if patients are unable to take the oral&#xD;
      formulation. Patients will be treated on the protocol for a maximum of 12 months. Patients&#xD;
      still responding can continue with treatment off protocol at the discretion of the local&#xD;
      physician. Patients will be followed-up for another 12 months after their end of protocol&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.2 Regular dosing and tapering of immunosuppressive drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.2.1 Stopping of prior calcineurin inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is on a calcineurin inhibitor at time of study inclusion, CNI should be&#xD;
      tapered and stopped within 1-3 weeks of initiation of study treatment, with an initial&#xD;
      reduction of 50% at initiation of everolimus. The CNI baseline level should be not higher&#xD;
      than 100 µg/ml for CSA and not higher than 6 µg/ml for tacrolimus after start of everolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.2.2 Stopping of prior mTOR inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is on sirolimus or everolimus prophylaxis at time of study inclusion,&#xD;
      everolimus will be continued; sirolimus will be switched to everolimus without tapering or&#xD;
      loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.2.3 Dosing and recommended tapering of steroids&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial dose of prednisone is 1 mg/kg BW given as a single dose in the morning. It is&#xD;
      recommended to maintain this dose for at least 2 weeks and then taper depending on the&#xD;
      patient's response (CR or PR), according to appendix 13.1 and 13.2. These tapering&#xD;
      recommendations are meant to guide tapering speed. Patients with progressive disease after 2&#xD;
      weeks (&gt; 25% in any organ) will be considered steroid-refractory and require secondary&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.2.4 Dosing and tapering of everolimus&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial dose of everolimus will be 0.75 mg twice daily. The dose shall be adjusted to a&#xD;
      targeted trough serum level of 3-8 µg/l, measured by HPLC or immunoassay 4 to 5 days after&#xD;
      the previous dose change. Initial dose reduction may be considered in the presence of a&#xD;
      co-medication interfering with metabolism of everolimus (see also 10.3.7.) Dose adjustments&#xD;
      shall be according to clinical judgement of the local physician taking into consideration&#xD;
      toxicity, serum levels and concomitant medication. Since CNI (particularly CSA) interact with&#xD;
      everolimus, trough levels of everolimus will need to be readjusted after stopping CNI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with abnormal liver function tests the initial dose of everolimus will be 0.25 mg&#xD;
      twice daily (see Appendix 13.5.5). Increment of daily dose should not surpass 0.5 mg within 1&#xD;
      week and initial monitoring of everolimus levels should be twice weekly until stable levels&#xD;
      are attained for 2 weeks. This close monitoring will be repeated in case of any further dose&#xD;
      modification. In patients who develop abnormal liver functions (as above) while already under&#xD;
      treatment with everolimus, serum levels of the drug also need to be monitored closely (twice&#xD;
      weekly), for at least 2 weeks after emergence of abnormal liver function to enable prompt&#xD;
      dose modification if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discontinuation of prednisone, patients should be monitored for at least 4 weeks for&#xD;
      possible recurrence of cGvHD symptoms. In the absence of cGvHD activity, everolimus will be&#xD;
      tapered off over a period of 12 to 24 weeks at the discretion of the local physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.2.5 Concomitant therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional treatment with topical immunosuppressants like steroids is not considered&#xD;
      treatment failure and can be given at the discretion of the local physician. Addition of&#xD;
      secondary systemic immunosuppressive therapy is considered treatment failure as outlined in&#xD;
      4.1. Prophylaxis of infections, red blood cell and platelet support and antithrombotic&#xD;
      prophylaxis will be given according to institutional practice. Monitoring for cytomegalovirus&#xD;
      reactivation and preemptive therapy with antiviral agents will be performed according to&#xD;
      centres' policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documentation of adverse events and concomitant medications for each patient will be&#xD;
      performed from the time a patient signs the informed consent form until the patient&#xD;
      completes, withdraws or is withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.3 Management of toxicity and dose modifications&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.3.1 Toxicity evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity will be monitored at least once every month. Monitoring will include physical&#xD;
      examination, laboratory liver and kidney function tests, blood lipids and blood counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.3.2 Management of hyperlipidaemia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with hyperlipidemia should be advised to maintain a diet. They should also receive&#xD;
      HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or fibrates. However caution must be taken and patients&#xD;
      monitored for development of rhabdomyolysis. Everolimus should be continued during the&#xD;
      treatment of hyperlipidaemia unless the lipid levels are uncontrollable with standard&#xD;
      therapy. Dose modifications of everolimus for hyperlipidaemia and after diet and appropriate&#xD;
      treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or fibrates should be according to appendix&#xD;
      13.5.3&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.3.3 Management of TMA&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMA shall be documented and reported immediately. In the event of TMA, everolimus shall be&#xD;
      discontinued. Plasmapheresis may be used at the discretion of the managing physician.&#xD;
      Prevention of TMA involves avoiding drug levels above target range. High drug levels should&#xD;
      prompt closer monitoring of hematocrit, platelets, LDH, BUN, creatinine and schistocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.3.4 Management of hematotoxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with severe cGvHD often have cytopenia. Cytopenia may also be caused by concomitant&#xD;
      medication like antiviral drugs or antibiotics or cGvHD itself. Dose modification of&#xD;
      everolimus will therefore take baseline platelet counts into consideration. Absolute&#xD;
      neutrophile count (ANC), hematocrit and platelet counts shall be monitored regularly. If&#xD;
      other causes of cytopenia have been ruled out, everolimus dose will be modified according to&#xD;
      appendix 13.5.4. GCSF, blood and platelet transfusions may be given at discretion of the&#xD;
      local physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.3.5 Management of non-infectious pneumonitis (NIP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms of NIP usually subside completely within one month after cessation of treatment.&#xD;
      This reversibility will enable differentiation from BOOP. The incidence and outcome of NIP&#xD;
      will be documented and assessed in this study. Treatment with everolimus will not be&#xD;
      restarted after diagnosis of NIP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.3.6 Management of other toxicities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also be monitored for other toxicities such as edema, arthralgias or aphthous&#xD;
      ulcers. Efforts will be made to rule out other causes. If other causes of toxicity have been&#xD;
      ruled out and toxicity is thought to be caused by everolimus and is significant, everolimus&#xD;
      dose will be decreased to 50%. If symptoms do not improve or resolve after 2 weeks,&#xD;
      everolimus will be held. If symptoms improve or resolve, everolimus will be restarted at 50%&#xD;
      and gradually increased to full dose as tolerated. Everolimus can be held for a maximum of 14&#xD;
      successive days with the patient remaining on study, longer treatment breaks will mean&#xD;
      premature termination of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.3.7 Other important considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum levels of everolimus are significantly influenced by food intake, thus everolimus&#xD;
      should be taken at consistent times of the day consistently with or without food to minimize&#xD;
      variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In appendix 13.5.1 and 13.5.2 drugs are listed which are known to interact with everolimus&#xD;
      and/or prednisone. During concomitant medication with these drugs, caution should be taken&#xD;
      and patients seen, at least once weekly to once every two weeks in order to closely monitor&#xD;
      drug levels and perform clinical examinations for toxicity. Concomitant treatment not&#xD;
      recommended should only be administered if deemed absolutely necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grapefruit juice or St. John's Wort must not be taken during treatment with everolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant treatment with voriconazole is not recommended and should be avoided. If use of&#xD;
      voriconazole is deemed absolutely clinically necessary, dose reduction of everolimus of up to&#xD;
      90% may be necessary. Concomitant treatment with other azoles like fluconazole or&#xD;
      posaconazole also requires caution including closer monitoring of everolimus serum levels and&#xD;
      dose adjustments. Concomitant treatment with atorvastatin, pravastatin or other HMG-CoA&#xD;
      reductase inhibitors or fibrates requires monitoring of patients for signs of rhabdomyolysis&#xD;
      and everolimus levels. Patients receiving Ciclosporin or tacrolimus will have these tapered&#xD;
      and stopped as described in chapter 10.2.1. Everolimus dose will be adjusted thereafter&#xD;
      according to serum levels.&#xD;
