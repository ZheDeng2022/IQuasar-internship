    <textblock>
      This pilot single arm, single site, open-labeled switch study seeks to enroll thirty (30) HIV&#xD;
      positive patients infected with CCR5 tropic virus that have achieved an undetectable viral&#xD;
      load on a non-Selzentry®-containing regimen [Protease Inhibitor (PI)/Non-Nucleoside Reverse&#xD;
      Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI)/Integrase Inhibitor plus 2 Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase&#xD;
      Inhibitor (NRTI)] and switch them to once-daily Selzentry® (600mg qd) plus the same 2 NRTIs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The objective of the study is to determine if regimen tolerability/toxicity can be maintained&#xD;
      or improved while maintaining virologic suppression following a switch to once-daily&#xD;
      Selzentry®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration is 48 weeks. Patients must have an HIV-1 RNA &lt;100 copies/mL for ≥3 months&#xD;
      on their first HIV treatment regimen. Prior regimen modifications for reasons other than&#xD;
      virologic failure are acceptable if any previously achieved virologic suppression has been&#xD;
      maintained. A Trofile® DNA will be used to document exclusive CCR5 tropism. Patients with&#xD;
      history of dual/mixed or CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 are excluded from participation. Patients with&#xD;
      prior exposure to Selzentry® are also excluded. Patients that qualify for participation will&#xD;
      discontinue the PI, NNRTI, or Integrase inhibitor portion of their regimen and begin&#xD;
      Selzentry® 600mg QD. Patients will continue the two (2) NRTIs from the previous treatment&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints is: the percentage of HIV positive patients with undetectable viral&#xD;
      load (HIV-1 RNA &lt;100 copies/mL) at Week 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are: the safety and tolerability of once-daily Selzentry® through Weeks&#xD;
      24 and 48(as measured by clinical and laboratory adverse events and regimen satisfaction&#xD;
      questionnaire), the percentage of HIV positive patients with undetectable viral load (HIV-1&#xD;
      RNA &lt; 100 copies/mL) at Week 48, the change from baseline in CD4+ T-cell counts at Weeks 24&#xD;
      and 48, the change from baseline in inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein) at Weeks 24 and&#xD;
      48, and assessment of resistance-associated mutations or viral tropism changes from baseline,&#xD;
      if any, emerging at virologic failure.&#xD;
