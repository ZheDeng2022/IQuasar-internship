  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cystectomy is the removal of the bladder and adjacent organs in patients with bladder&#xD;
      cancer. This often results in significant blood loss, and about 60% of patients will require&#xD;
      a blood transfusion during or up to 30 days after surgery. Significant blood loss may result&#xD;
      in cardiovascular morbidity, and the use of blood products are expensive and expose patients&#xD;
      to risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tranexamic acid reduces breakdown of hemostatic blood clots and it has therapeutic benefit&#xD;
      when used in other surgical procedures to reduce blood loss and the need for transfusion. The&#xD;
      current study will be the first to evaluate whether tranexamic acid is effective and safe to&#xD;
      use during radical cystectomy. The results of the study will have an immediate impact on&#xD;
      patient care.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Removal of the bladder and adjacent organs in patients with bladder cancer (radical&#xD;
      cystectomy) often results in significant blood loss, and approximately 60% of patients&#xD;
      require peri-operative blood transfusion. Reducing blood loss and the frequency of&#xD;
      transfusion offers several benefits, including donor blood conservation, health care cost&#xD;
      reduction, and avoidance of blood product exposure. Tranexamic acid is an amino acid lysine&#xD;
      derivative with strong antifibrinolytic clotting properties that can be administered&#xD;
      systemically. This medication has been used in a variety of operative procedures, notably in&#xD;
      high risk cardiac surgery, to decrease peri-operative blood loss, and it is associated with&#xD;
      an acceptable risk of adverse events. Systemic anti-hemorrhagics are infrequently used during&#xD;
      radical cystectomy, and to the investigators knowledge their effects have not been evaluated&#xD;
      in a clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall objective: To conduct a randomized controlled trial of systemic tranexamic acid&#xD;
      compared to placebo in reducing the number of blood transfusions in patients undergoing&#xD;
      radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Consenting patients 18 years of age and older undergoing a radical&#xD;
      cystectomy for bladder cancer, excluding those who: are unwilling to receive blood products&#xD;
      due to personal reasons, are pregnant, have active angina, have a known allergy to tranexamic&#xD;
      acid, or have a known personal history of deep venous thrombosis, atrial fibrillation,&#xD;
      coronary stent, sub-arachnoid hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, thrombotic stroke and / or&#xD;
      acquired disturbance of colour vision. The study will recruit 354 patients from Dalhousie&#xD;
      University, McGill University, Université de Montreal, Université Laval, University of&#xD;
      Ottawa, University of Western Ontario and University of Alberta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tranexamic Acid arm: Tranexamic acid will be administered as an intravenous infusion of 10&#xD;
      mg/kg within 10 minutes (loading dose) and before surgical incision, followed by 5 mg/kg/hour&#xD;
      continuous maintenance infusion for the length of surgery (typically 4 to 8 hours). For&#xD;
      example, an 80 kg patient would receive 800 mg prior to incision and a 400 mg/hour infusion&#xD;
      for the duration of surgery. For a 6 hour procedure, the total dose administered would be&#xD;
      3200 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo arm: As there is no standard of care concerning administration of antifibrinolytic&#xD;
      agents in cystectomy procedures, controls will follow the same dosing and schedule described&#xD;
      above, but with 0.9% saline infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The primary research objective is whether the use of systemic tranexamic acid&#xD;
      compared to placebo reduces the proportion of radical cystectomy patients requiring red blood&#xD;
      cell transfusion up to 30 days post-operative (from a 50% transfusion rate with placebo to&#xD;
      35% with tranexamic acid). Secondary questions are: Will use of systemic tranexamic acid&#xD;
      compared to placebo result in reductions in: i) intraoperative blood loss, ii) amounts of&#xD;
      transfused blood products, and iii) post-operative complications? The safety (thrombotic&#xD;
      events) of tranexamic acid will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of this study: If tranexamic acid reduces the number of blood transfusions, there&#xD;
      will be an immediate impact to cystectomy patients, and surgeons may consider the routine use&#xD;
      of systemic tranexamic acid during similar abdomino-pelvic procedures associated with&#xD;
      significant blood loss.&#xD;
