    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Cord blood is blood that is taken from the umbilical cord and placenta of healthy newborns&#xD;
      after childbirth. The cord blood collected from a baby is called a cord blood unit. Cord&#xD;
      blood units are stored frozen in public cord blood banks. About 10,000 cord blood transplants&#xD;
      have been performed in children and adults for blood cancers and other diseases in the world.&#xD;
      These transplants have helped save lives and improve treatments. However, not all available&#xD;
      units of cord blood have been collected, stored, and licensed according to specific&#xD;
      government requirements. These unlicensed units can still be used in transplant, but they can&#xD;
      only be given as part of specific research studies. This study will evaluate the safety of&#xD;
      giving these unlicensed units by recording any problems that may occur during and after&#xD;
      giving the cord blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety and effectiveness of unlicensed cord blood units in people who need stem&#xD;
      cell transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals who are scheduled to have a stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive the cord blood unit as part of their stem cell transplant&#xD;
           procedure. The transplant will be performed according to the current standard of care&#xD;
           for the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the transplant, participants will be monitored for up to 1 year. Any problems or&#xD;
           side effects from the transplant will be treated as necessary. All outcomes will be&#xD;
           reported to the National Cord Blood Program and to the Center for International Blood&#xD;
           and Marrow Transplant.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The requirement for licensure of human cell and blood products became part of the FDA&#xD;
           final rules for Human Cells, Tissues, and Tissue-Based Products (HCT/Ps) (March 29, 2004&#xD;
           and May 25, 2005) in an effort to prevent transmission of communicable disease, minimize&#xD;
           contamination and preserved integrity and function during processing, outline safety and&#xD;
           effectiveness requirements for cells from unrelated donors or when HCT/Ps are more than&#xD;
           minimally manipulated, assure labeling is clear accurate and not misleading and monitor&#xD;
           and communicate with industry via establishment registration. As of October 20, 2011,&#xD;
           those units of cord blood that do not meet the manufacturing requirements for licensure&#xD;
           can only be distributed for transplantation if the transplant will occur under an IND&#xD;
           research protocol. In addition to the licensure guidance, the FDA published a guidance&#xD;
           in August 2011 titled Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) for Minimally&#xD;
           Manipulated, Unrelated Allogeneic Placental/Umbilical Cord Blood Intended for&#xD;
           Hematopoietic Reconstitution for Specified Indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a multi-center study of unlicensed, investigational cryopreserved cord blood&#xD;
           units (CBUs) manufactured by the National Cord Blood Program (NCBP) which provides&#xD;
           access and distribution on an Investigational New Drug (IND) application #6637 to sites&#xD;
           with locally IRB-approved protocols for unrelated hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
           transplantation of pediatric and adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The primary objective of this study is to examine the safety of administration of the&#xD;
      unlicensed investigational NCBP HPC-CORD Blood products, evaluating prospectively the&#xD;
      incidence of serious adverse reactions as well as the incidence of all infusion related&#xD;
      reactions after administration of unlicensed, investigational NCBP CBU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients receiving a non-licensed NCBP CBU (HPC-CORD BLOOD):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess incidence of transmission of infections&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess incidence of graft rejection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess incidence of neutrophil engraftment &gt;500 /ul&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine 1 year survival after cord blood transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess cumulative incidence of acute graft vs. host disease (GVHD) grades II to IV and&#xD;
           grades III to IV&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine platelet engraftment of &gt;20,000/ul and &gt;50,000/ul&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine CBU-derived engraftment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients of any age or either gender with indications for receipt of investigational&#xD;
           HPC-CORD BLOOD who are participating in an NIH-IRB approved clinical trial for unrelated&#xD;
           hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signed informed consent (and assent when applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are receiving licensed CB products (only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are receiving unlicensed CB products from other CB banks (i.e. NMDP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a multi-NIH institute endeavor designed to allow NHLBI, NCI and NIAID&#xD;
      investigators access investigational HPC-CORD BLOOD for patients participating in NIH-IRB&#xD;
      approved clinical trials for unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Treatment,&#xD;
      including pre-treatment conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis will occur per the institute s&#xD;
      NIH-IRB approved clinical trial or the transplant center s specifications.&#xD;
