    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether metformin in combination with gefitinib are&#xD;
      effective in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic Non-Small-Cell Lung&#xD;
      cancer with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Primary Objectives: To determine the 1 year progression-free survival (PFS) of the&#xD;
      combination of metformin and gefitinib in patients who harbors EGFR-mutant with previously&#xD;
      untreated advanced or metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. To evaluate the response to therapy and overall survival of the combination of metformin&#xD;
      with gefitinib in patients who harbors EGFR-mutant with previously untreated advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. To acquire preliminary data regarding the effects of metformin on interleukin-6 (IL-6)&#xD;
      levels in tumor and serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. Metformin starting at a dose of 500 mg&#xD;
      twice a day, orally with meals. After one week, increase the dose of metformin to 1000 mg as&#xD;
      the first dose of the day and 500 mg as the second dose. After another week, increase to 1000&#xD;
      mg of metformin two times a day. Metformin treatment will be initiated one week before&#xD;
      beginning gefitinib, if possible, but gefitinib administration will not be delayed for&#xD;
      metformin loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gefitinib will be administered 250mg QD continuously. Metformin will be administered&#xD;
      continuously, beginning one week before beginning gefitinib, if possible, but tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitors (TKI) will not be delayed for metformin loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance Therapy Patients responding to this therapy will be maintained with metformin&#xD;
      (1000 mg twice daily) and gefitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue until one of&#xD;
      the following criteria applies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Disease progression,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Unacceptable adverse events(s),&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable&#xD;
           for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of hypertension must be well-controlled (&lt;150 systolic/&lt;100&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing&#xD;
             or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving chronic daily treatment with aspirin (&gt; 325 mg/day) or nonsteroidal&#xD;

             cilostazol (Pletal)is also not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation. Prophylactic anticoagulation of venous&#xD;
             access devices is allowed provided Section 3.10 is met. Caution should be taken on&#xD;
             treating patients with low dose heparin or low molecular weight heparin for DVT&#xD;
             prophylaxis during treatment with bevacizumab as there may be an increased risk of&#xD;
             bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior use of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving immunotherapy, hormonal-therapy and or radiotherapy within 2 weeks&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled brain metastasis. Note: Patients with brain metastases must&#xD;
             have stable neurologic status following local therapy (surgery or radiation) for at&#xD;
             least 2 weeks, and must be without neurologic dysfunction that would confound the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar&#xD;
             chemical or biologic composition to metformin and paclitaxel or other agents used in&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Women that are pregnant or breastfeeding Note: Pregnant women are excluded from this&#xD;
             study because the agents used in this study may be teratogenic to a fetus. Because&#xD;
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary&#xD;
             to treatment of the mother with paclitaxel, breastfeeding women are also excluded from&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that are HIV-positive on combination antiretroviral therapy due to the&#xD;
