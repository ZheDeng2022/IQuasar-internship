    <textblock>
      This study seeks to evaluate, whether patients suffering from cardiac arrest, that can be&#xD;
      successfully resuscitated, can be differentiated from those, that cannot be resuscitated,&#xD;
      using arterial blood pressure values.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in patients suffering from cardiac arrest out of&#xD;
      hospitals is based on strict clinical practice guidelines. However, the evidence base for&#xD;
      these treatment recommendation is insufficient in many respects. While knowledge about basic&#xD;
      interventions, that are capable of restoring spontaneous circulation and improving&#xD;
      neurologically intact survival - chest compressions, application of oxygen and early&#xD;
      defibrillation -, has increased over the last decade, advanced treatment options - advanced&#xD;
      airway management, vascular access, application of vasoactive drugs - are still recommended,&#xD;
      although clinical trials of varying quality failed to demonstrate any benefit in patient&#xD;
      related outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to establish hemodynamic threshold values that are able to discriminate&#xD;
      between patients that achieve return of spontaneous circulation (survivors) and those that&#xD;
      fail to do so (non-survivors). These cutoff values could act as targets for interventions&#xD;
      during CPR (i.e. application of vasoactive drugs, use of mechanical compression devices, …)&#xD;
      in further trials and may potentially influence clinical practice later on. Furthermore,&#xD;
      reliable cutoff values could act as additional prognostic factors during CPR, enabling&#xD;
      prehospital care providers to base their decisions to continue or terminate ongoing CPR&#xD;
      efforts on a more solid basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this goal, 22 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) treated by&#xD;
      physicians of the prehospital physician response system located at the Medical University of&#xD;
      Graz shall be included into this trial. All patients will receive Advanced Life Support (ALS)&#xD;
      interventions according to current guidelines issued by the European Resuscitation Council&#xD;
      (ERC). In addition, arterial lines will be placed and arterial blood pressure will be&#xD;
      measured continuously. This intervention is already considered standard of care at this&#xD;
      prehospital physician response system and performed routinely as part of the local ALS&#xD;
      algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant parameters - systolic arterial pressure (SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP),&#xD;
      mean arterial pressure (MAP) etc. - will be documented electronically using both the&#xD;
      electronic documentation system already used by the prehospital physician response system and&#xD;
      the monitor/defibrillator device. Median values will be compared between survivors and&#xD;
      non-survivors and possible threshold values will be calculated. Cutoff values that would be&#xD;
      best suited to act as targets in future research and clinical practice will be identified by&#xD;
      receiver operating characteristics (ROC).&#xD;

        compared are survivors (patients with sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in&#xD;
        the field who are transported to a hospital alive) and non-survivors (patients in whom CPR&#xD;
