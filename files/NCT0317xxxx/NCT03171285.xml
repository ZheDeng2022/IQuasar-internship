      Although the mortality rate among soccer players is low, it causes much impact on the entire&#xD;
      community and is a fascinating conundrum. The aim of this study was to evaluate the&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk of soccer referees, to describe the frequency of cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      considering age groups younger and older than 35 years old and to relate the Framingham and&#xD;
      PROCAM indices for the comparison of cardiovascular risk in soccer referees. 50 referees of&#xD;
      Paulista Soccer Federation were subjected to clinical and laboratory based evaluations at the&#xD;
      Center for Sports Health at the Faculty of Medicine of ABC, and divided into two groups:&#xD;
      lower and higher than 35 years of age.&#xD;

      This is a cross-sectional study performed in a non-probabilistic sample for convenience,&#xD;
      derived from information collected from medical records of the Medical Statistics Service.&#xD;
      Data were obtained through clinical evaluation information and subsidiary examinations of 50&#xD;
      high performance field soccer referees of the Paulista Soccer Federation (PFF), during a&#xD;
      pre-season training period of the 2009 Brazilian soccer championship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emphasis was especially placed on exposure to risk factors for coronary artery disease,&#xD;
      conceivably more responsible for sudden death, when congenital heart disease was excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects were acquiesced to clinical and laboratory evaluations at the Center for Health&#xD;
      in Sport of the Faculty of Medicine of ABC (FMABC). The referees were split into two age&#xD;
      groups, according to the median of their ages. One of the groups consisted of trained&#xD;
      individuals &lt; 35 years old while the other group was made up of referees &gt; 35 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family history: Occurrence of one or more relatives with disease or death from cardiac&#xD;
      disease aged less than 50 years; Report of cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, Marfan&#xD;
      syndrome or long QT syndrome, severe cardiac arrhythmias, or other cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal history: Syncope or pre-Syncope; Chest pain or discomfort; Lack of air or fatigue&#xD;
      disproportionate to the effort made; Palpitations or irregular heartbeat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination: Physical and/or ocular signs of Marfan Syndrome; Decreased femoral&#xD;
      artery pulses or &quot;tardus&quot;; meso- or telo- systolic murmurs; Second abnormal heart sound&#xD;
      (single or with fixed unfolding with breathing); Heart murmurs (grade 2/6 systolic or&#xD;
      diastolic of any intensity); Irregular heart rate; Bilateral blood pressure greater than&#xD;
      140/90 mmHg in more than one measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biochemical tests: High density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), very low&#xD;
      density lipoproteins (VLDL), triglycerides (TG) and fasting blood glucose levels (Glic) were&#xD;
      analyzed. The biochemical blood tests were processed by the Clinical Laboratory of FMABC,&#xD;
      certified by controlab and ANVISA. The reference standards were considered according to the&#xD;
      Guidelines of the Brazilian Society of Cardiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ergospirometry: The following parameters were analyzed: Ergospirometry (Ergo), Maximum heart&#xD;
      rate (HRmax), Maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) and Anaerobic threshold (LA). The&#xD;
      ergospirometric data were obtained through the Centurion 200 Treadmill and Micromed速 BRA ECG.&#xD;
      Protocol: start with 10 km/h - 1% inclination and increase of 1 km every minute. Gas&#xD;
      analyzer: Vmax, Encore 29 c, Sensormedics速, USA. Program 20-21. Gases in two torpedoes: (1) -&#xD;
      oxygen (O2); 26% and (2) - Carbon Dioxide (CO2): 4%, oxygen (O2) = 16% and Nitrogen (N2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiogram: Two-dimensional echocardiogram (ECO) with Doppler was obtained by Esaote速&#xD;
      model AV3 Partner with 2.5 MHz transducer with color flow mapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiogram: The electrocardiographic tracings were performed by the Ecafix速&#xD;
      CardioPerfect 5.0 device coupled to a microcomputer with compatible HD and a 1.4 MB drive 60&#xD;
      Hz filter. Approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the records were taken at&#xD;
      rest, on days when they had not performed exercises, and according to the best clinical&#xD;
      practice. The interpretation of the ECG abnormalities was completed by an experienced&#xD;
      specialist and according to the criteria established by Corrado et al., for which they were&#xD;
      classified into two categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: commonly observed in trained athletes (over 80%) sinus bradycardia,&#xD;
           first-degree AV block, V1 notch QRS or incomplete right bundle branch block, early&#xD;
           repolarization, LVH criteria according to voltage increase in V5 and V6 consistent with&#xD;
           the athlete's age, ethnicity and degree of physical fitness, and which does not require&#xD;
           additional testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: less common ECG changes (less than 5%) and need to be better evaluated to&#xD;
           exclude cardiovascular diseases: T-wave inversion, ST-segment depression, pathological&#xD;
           Q-waves, left atrial enlargement, QRS shift to the left, left/right anterolateral&#xD;
           hemiblock, right QRS deviation/left posterolateral lower hemiblock, right ventricular&#xD;
           hypertrophy, complete left or right bundle branch block, long or short QT interval,&#xD;
           early ventricular repolarization Brugada like, ventricular arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Framingham and PROCAM indexes The risk of developing cardiovascular disease is contingent on&#xD;
      multiple variables that interrelate with each other, increasing the probability of developing&#xD;
      atherosclerotic coronary disease. Each of the risk factors is assigned a value that reflects&#xD;
      greater or lesser potential impact on the development of cardiovascular disease and the&#xD;
      implementation of preventive measures, and likelihoods, when applied early, to avert the&#xD;
      onset of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Framingham risk index was constructed based on the Framingham study, a prospective&#xD;
      observational survey developed in the small northeastern city of the United States of&#xD;
      America. This study evaluated blood pressure, smoking, lipid profile and other&#xD;
      characteristics of 5,300 individuals of different ethnicities residing in Framingham, aged&#xD;
      between 30 and 74 years at the time of the initial observation, as well as their causes of&#xD;
      death and disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This index analyzes the cardiovascular risk in relation to the chance of developing stroke,&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death for the subsequent 10 years. The&#xD;
      Framingham cardiovascular risk index has the characteristic of categorizing the variables&#xD;
      into a smaller number of sections or sections without significant differentiation of body&#xD;
      mass, age, gender, total cholesterol, HDL, presence or absence of smoking and Diabetes&#xD;
      Mellitus, systolic and diastolic blood pressure values. Total points represent the percentage&#xD;
      of cardiovascular risk (acute myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death) in the&#xD;
      following 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PROCAM index is a cardiovascular risk index based on a European study that commenced in&#xD;
      1979 and was completed in 1985. A total of 5159 individuals, all males, aged 35 to 65 years.&#xD;
      The PROCAM index identified the following variables: age, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol,&#xD;
      Triglycerides (this is the only criterion that considers it directly), smoking, Diabetes&#xD;
      Mellitus, systolic blood pressure and family history (this variable is considered only by&#xD;
      this risk score). The total points represent the risk of cardiovascular disease (acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death) in the ensuing 10 years.&#xD;
