  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PIPAC is a procedure that involves the administration of intraperitoneal chemotherapy using&#xD;
      an innovative concept that enhances the efficacy by taking advantage of the physical&#xD;
      properties of gas and pressure. The chemotherapy drugs will be delivered in aerosolised form.&#xD;
      This results in a superior distribution and depth of penetration of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study serves to determine the safety profile and tolerability of PIPAC with&#xD;
      oxaliplatin. It may offer a novel and effective option of treatment for patients with&#xD;
      peritoneal carcinomatosis, who, at present have limited options involving the use of systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapy and who suffer from poor life expectancy and poor quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, most trials have used PIPAC cisplatin with doxorubicin, or oxaliplatin alone, and&#xD;
      more studies are on-going globally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous (IV) nivolumab has been approved for the treatment of progressive gastric cancer&#xD;
      after conventional chemotherapy. PIPAC in combination with nivolumab may have the potential&#xD;
      to improve immune activation and response to immune checkpoint inhibition for patients with&#xD;
      peritoneal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence we propose an amendment to our trial protocol for the addition of a second cohort&#xD;
      (Cohort 2) to investigate the safety and tolerability of the combination of PIPAC oxaliplatin&#xD;
      and IV nivolumab.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is the 5th most common cancer (1 million incidences per year) and the third&#xD;
      leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide (740,000 deaths per year). Unresectable&#xD;
      gastric cancer is associated with a poor 5-year survival rate (&lt; 30%) because of its late&#xD;
      presentation with approximately 50% of the patients diagnosed at advanced stage with a median&#xD;
      survival of about 12 months. The treatment for advanced gastric cancer patients relies mainly&#xD;
      on doublet or triplet chemotherapy, but results are often limited by severe side effects of&#xD;
      the aggressive regimens. Novel efficacious treatments with reduced adverse effects are highly&#xD;
      desirable to improve the clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peritoneal disease is notoriously difficult to treat. In patients with histologically proven&#xD;
      unresectable or recurrent gastric cancer limited to the peritoneum and/or cancer cells in&#xD;
      peritoneal cytology, the combination of intraperitoneal (IP) paclitaxel with systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapy seems promising. However, a phase III trial (PHOENIX-GC trial) comparing IP&#xD;
      regimen with systemic chemotherapy versus systemic therapy alone in Japan did not show any&#xD;
      superiority of the IP regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PIPAC is an innovative intraperitoneal chemotherapy concept that enhances the efficacy by&#xD;
      taking advantage of the physical properties of gas and pressure. This results in a superior&#xD;
      distribution and depth of penetration of the drug. A recent systematic review of 45 clinical&#xD;
      studies on 1810 PIPAC procedures showed response rates of 50-91% for gastric cancer (median&#xD;
      survival of 8 to 15 months), 71-86% for colorectal cancer (median survival of 16 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, most phase II trials utilising PIPAC involve the use of cisplatin and doxorubicin or&#xD;
      oxaliplatin. Oxaliplatin is an approved drug for systemic chemotherapy, with well documented&#xD;
      use intraperitoneally via hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) as well. This&#xD;
      makes is a favourable agent for PIPAC in early phase studies. The dose of oxaliplatin&#xD;
      utilised for PIPAC in the literature has thus far been arbitrarily set at 92 mg/m2, which is&#xD;
      approximately 80% of the drug concentration used in HIPEC. Furthermore, these studies were&#xD;
      performed on patients with a recent or concurrent administration of systemic chemotherapy,&#xD;
      which may make interpretation of the side effects and safety profile difficult to interpret.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cohort 1 of this study, we intend to determine the safety profile and tolerability of&#xD;
      PIPAC with oxaliplatin by assessment of dose limiting toxicities and the adverse event&#xD;
      profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitor has demonstrated clinical activities and&#xD;
      survival benefits as a monotherapy and in combination with other immunotherapies or&#xD;
      conventional chemotherapies in multiple cancer types. Nivolumab has been showed to have&#xD;
      overall survival benefit over placebo in the third line treatment of metastatic gastric&#xD;
      cancer with a response rate of 11%. In the CheckMate032 trial, nivolumab, with or without&#xD;
      ipilumumab, demonstrated durable responses and long-term survival. Nivolumab alone, dosed at&#xD;
      3mg/kg, had a response rate of 12%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that the delivery of PIPAC deep into the peritoneal tissue is likely to&#xD;
      affect the tumor microenvironment and potentially release neoantigens which would improve&#xD;
      clinical outcomes with immune checkpoint inhibition. Hence we propose an amendment to our&#xD;
      trial protocol for the addition of a second cohort (Cohort 2) to combine this Phase I&#xD;
      proof-of-concept study with nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to determine the determine the safety profile and tolerability of PIPAC&#xD;
      oxaliplatin by assessment of dose limiting toxicities and the adverse event profile. With&#xD;
      Cohort 2, the co-primary endpoints are the safety and efficacy of the combination of PIPAC&#xD;
      oxaliplatin and IV nivolumab. Safety will be evaluated in terms of adverse events, serious&#xD;
      adverse events, discontinuation of treatment due to toxicity. Efficacy will be evaluated in&#xD;
      terms of the percentage of patients with 6 months of time-to-treatment failure (TTF). TTF is&#xD;
      defined as the interval from treatment initiation to treatment discontinuation for disease&#xD;
      progression, treatment toxicity, and death. The secondary objective is to evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical and pathological response of PIPAC oxaliplatin as well as to identify the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profile of oxaliplatin administered via PIPAC. The clinical and pathological&#xD;
      response to combination treatment will also be determined. Quality of life will be evaluated.&#xD;

    <description>3+3 dose escalation of oxaliplatin&#xD;
This is a single arm phase I trial in a 3 + 3 dose escalation and cohort expansion design evaluating the safety and tolerability of PIPAC using oxaliplatin.&#xD;
The pre-planned dose levels of oxaliplatin are 45mg/m2 (Cohort 1), 60mg/m2 (Cohort 2), 90mg/m2 (Cohort 3),120mg/m2 (Cohort 4) and 150mg/m2 (Cohort 5) administered as PIPAC. Successive cohorts of patients (3 participants/cohort) will be enrolled and started on a fixed dose of oxaliplatin. The protocol specifies oxaliplatin 45mg/m2 once every 6 weeks for Cohort 1. Dose escalation continues until dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) are observed in one-third of participants. If no DLT occurs, the next cohort will be enrolled at the next planned dose level. If 1 DLT occurs in a cohort, another 3 patients will be treated with the same dose level.&#xD;
Oxaliplatin every 6 weeks with IV nivolumab every 2 weeks&#xD;
