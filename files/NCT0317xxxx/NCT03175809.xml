  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of trigger points in the pelvic floor musculature (PFM) is a frequent condition&#xD;
      in individuals with chronic pelvic pain (CPP) and is associated with higher levels of pain,&#xD;
      disability and functional decline. The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of&#xD;
      two interventions: pelvic floor muscle (PFM) training with biofeedback and PFM training with&#xD;
      the addition of trigger point dry needling applied over(Lumbar square, psoas, external&#xD;
      obliques, gluteus medius, piriformis and adductors) on pain and quality of life of women with&#xD;
      CPP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is characterized as non-cyclic pain located in the distal region of&#xD;
      the abdomen and pelvis, often refractory to conventional treatments, lasting more than six&#xD;
      months The presence of trigger points in the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) is a frequent&#xD;
      condition in individuals with CPP and is associated with higher levels of pain, disability&#xD;
      and functional decline. Secondary dysfunctions associated with the clinical picture of&#xD;
      chronic pelvic pain can be treated with muscle training through the use of biofeedback and&#xD;
      dry needling. The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of two interventions:&#xD;
      pelvic floor muscle (PFM) training with biofeedback and PFM training with the addition of&#xD;
      trigger point dry needling applied over(Lumbar square, psoas, external obliques, gluteus&#xD;
      medius, piriformis and adductors) on pain and quality of life of women with CPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit 44 women aged 18 to 60 years with CPP lasting for a minimum of six months. We&#xD;
      will exclude women with urinary incontinence, neurological conditions, malignancy, fractures,&#xD;
      pregnancy and those that did not agree to receive treatment with needles will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals will be randomized into two groups: PFM training with biofeedback and Dry&#xD;
      Needling Group and PFM training with biofeedback. Participants will receive a total of 4&#xD;
      sessions twice a week,,for two weeks. This investigation's primary outcome will be pain (NRS)&#xD;
      Immediately after the 4 visits. Quality of life, global impression of recovery and sexual&#xD;
      function evaluated at Immediately after the 4 visits will be secondary outcomes.&#xD;

    <description>The PFM training will be delivered with an electromyographic biofeedback (bEMG). In order to perform the muscular training, the Biotrainer software was used, the training protocol will follow a rationale of evolutionary complexity throughout each session. The training protocols will focus on both muscle relaxation and contraction training and coordination.The parameters for the biofeedback will be tailored to the participant's presentation and will be determined and adjusted between each session as needed by the treating therapist. The treatment parameters will be determined by the treating therapist based on the participant's assessment that will be conducted at each treatment session. The Maximum voluntary contraction will be assessed at the beginning of each training day.</description>

    <description>The dry needling technique will be applied to the abdominal muscles (external oblique, rectus abdominis), lumbar spine (lumbar multifidus and erector spinae) and hip muscles (piriformis, gluteus medius, psoas major and adductors). Both active of latent myofascial trigger points will be treated with sterile stainless steel needles (0.25x0.4 mm or 0.2x0,7mm, DongBang, Korea). After diagnosis of the area of muscle pain, the tight band of the muscle will be palpated and the needle will be introduced subcutaneously. The second insertion will be toward the muscle point until a local twitch response (LTR) is elicited. Then the needle will be removed and the area will be compressed for 30 seconds.</description>
