      Two hundred &amp; forty patients aged from 40 to 50 years complaining of heavy menstrual bleeding&#xD;
      (i.e. pictorial blood loss assessment chart score &gt;150) that is unresponsive to hormonal&#xD;
      lines of treatment &amp; requesting conservative surgical approach. Participants were randomized&#xD;
      into 3 groups; group A (Surgicel group) in which 80 patients underwent formal curettage&#xD;
      followed by insertion of 4 pieces of Surgicel inside the uterine cavity, group B (Thermal&#xD;
      balloon ablation group) in which 80 patients underwent thermal balloon ablation using bipolar&#xD;
      radiofrequency electrical energy (Novasure), group C (Endometrial resection group) in which&#xD;
      80 patients underwent transcervical Hysteroscopic endometrial resection. Randomization was&#xD;
      done using computer generated random numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria included uterine length &lt;12 cm, FSH level &gt; 40 IU/L, normal Pap smear &amp;&#xD;
      benign endometrial pathology. Exclusion criteria included active form of PID, uterine scars,&#xD;
      uterine malformation, uterine organic lesions (e.g., fibroids, polyps &amp; Adenomyosis) &amp;&#xD;
      previous history of endometrial ablation. In addition, patients seeking fertility&#xD;
      preservation, suffering coagulopathies or receiving anticoagulant treatments were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all patients, full history was taken followed by complete physical examination (with&#xD;
      emphasis on speculum examination to exclude cervical or vaginal wall lesions) &amp; laboratory&#xD;
      investigations (FSH, coagulation profile &amp; routine preoperative investigations). History of&#xD;
      Pap smear schedule was obtained and a Pap smear was scheduled if it was due. Transvaginal&#xD;
      ultrasound (TVUS) was done using a 7.5 MHz vaginal probe of the General Electric Voluson E8&#xD;
      ultrasound unit (GE Healthcare Austria GmbH, Seoul, Korea) to assess uterine size and to&#xD;
      exclude organic lesions of the uterus or ovaries. All participants were subjected to an&#xD;
      endometrial biopsy (either before the procedure or intraoperatively followed by a frozen&#xD;
      section). Patients, who were found to have atypical endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial&#xD;
      malignancy, were excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Surgicel group (group A), each SURGICEL® (oxidized regenerated cellulose - Ethicon US,&#xD;
      LLC.) knitted fabric (5 x 10 cm) was divided into four equal pieces. A formal cervical&#xD;
      dilatation &amp; curettage was done followed by packing the uterine cavity with the four&#xD;
      SURGICEL® strips to ensure that the SURGICEL® is in contact with the basal endometrium all&#xD;
      over the cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group B, Thermal balloon ablation was done using bipolar radiofrequency electrical energy&#xD;
      (Novasure). The cervix was grasped with a tenaculum then dilated to 6 mm. The disposable&#xD;
      device was inserted in the uterine cavity until the distal end of the sheath touches the&#xD;
      fundus then withdrawn backwards approximately 0.5 cm. The cervical collar was slided forward&#xD;
      until it forms a seal against the external cervical os. The ablation cycle starts&#xD;
      automatically, upon successful completion of the cavity integrity assessment (CIA), &amp; ends&#xD;
      automatically as well. In group C, Transcervical hysteroscopic endometrial resection was&#xD;
      done. Bipolar resectoscope is used &amp; endometrium is resected in successive passes under&#xD;
      direct hysteroscopic vision. Each pass of the U-shaped loop electrode removes a layer of&#xD;
      tissue of approximately 3-5 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were followed up over duration of 18 months following the procedure (at 3,6,12 &amp;&#xD;
      18 months). Primary outcome included amenorrhea rates &amp; secondary outcomes included&#xD;
      complication (intra- or post-operative), PBAC score (pictorial blood loss assessment chart&#xD;
      score), dysmenorrhea rates, patient satisfaction &amp; the need for re-intervention&#xD;
      (hysterectomy).&#xD;
