    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to characterize the prevalence of clinical or subclinical&#xD;
      polyvascular lesions and 4-year progression rate of plaque in intracranial and carotidal&#xD;
      arteries in a Chinese community population using vascular imaging techniques; to investigate&#xD;
      the both traditional and emerging genetic, metabolomic, and environmental risk factors of&#xD;
      presence and progression of intracranial and carotidal plaque; and to investigate the&#xD;
      association between polyvascular lesions and future risk of cognitive impairment,&#xD;
      cardio-/cerebrovascular events and death.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerosis is the most common cardiovascular disease and accounts for the greatest&#xD;
      number of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and death. Polyvascular lesions with&#xD;
      coexistent lesions (especially atherosclerosis) in multiple arterial territories (at least 2&#xD;
      of coronary, cerebral, lower extremity arteries), could be associated with higher risk of&#xD;
      future cardio-/cerebrovascular diseases. However, previous studies either roughly defined&#xD;
      polyvascular diseases according to established clinically recognized arterial diseases in&#xD;
      multiple arterial territories, or tested multiterritorial subclinical atherosclerosis without&#xD;
      tests of intracranial and peripheral arteries. Furthermore, recent research also showed that&#xD;
      cardiometabolic diseases and cardiovascular risk factors are associated with worse cognitive&#xD;
      abilities. A thorough evaluation of multiterritorial lesions in whole body used advanced&#xD;
      vascular imaging techniques is required to precisely assess the association of polyvascular&#xD;
      lesions with future cardio-/cerebrovascular events and cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, Asian population might have higher prevalence of intracranial atherosclerosis&#xD;
      than the Caucasian, and intracranial atherosclerosis is the most common cause of ischemic&#xD;
      stroke in Asia population. However, there are limited data about the prevalence and&#xD;
      progression of intracranial atherosclerosis in Chinese population. More and more studies have&#xD;
      shown that presence and progression of atherosclerotic plaque is not only related to the&#xD;
      degree of stenosis, but also with plaque characteristics such as rich lipid core, plaque&#xD;
      hemorrhage and inflammatory cell infiltration. High-resolution magnetic resonance (HR-MRI)&#xD;
      can not only show the degree of arterial stenosis, the size of atherosclerotic plaque, but&#xD;
      also can analyze the composition of the plaque to assess the stability of the plaque. HR-MRI&#xD;
      techniques enable early detection of atherosclerosis, characterization of the atherosclerotic&#xD;
      composition and burden. It is important to estimate the prevalence and progression rate of&#xD;
      intracranial atherosclerotic plaque based on HR-MRI and to estimate its traditional and&#xD;
      emerging determinants in Chinese population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, a total of 3000 subjects aged 50 to 75 years from 6 villages and 4 communities&#xD;
      in Lishui city, Zhejiang province, China, will be enrolled. All the eligible subjects in the&#xD;
      selected villages/community will be enrolled based on cluster sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the participants will be interviewed at baseline and followed up for 4 years. Data&#xD;
      collection at baseline will be performed through face-to-face interviews by trained&#xD;
      interviewers (neurologists from participating hospitals) with a standardized protocol.&#xD;
      Baseline data include demographics, medical history, cardiovascular risk factors, dietary&#xD;
      habits, physical activity, lifestyle, medication use, electrocardiogram, vascular imaging&#xD;
      tests and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Blood and urine samples will also be&#xD;
      collected at baseline to test genetic and metabolomic markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sequences of brain MRI included T1,T2, FLAIR, DWI,ADC,MRA,SWI,T2*,T1-VISTA,&#xD;
      SNAP,3D-T1,resting-state fMRI and DTI. Baseline vascular imaging tests include HR-MRI&#xD;
      sequences in intracranial and carotidal arteries, computed tomographic angiography (CTA) in&#xD;
      coronary, aorta, renal, hepatic, pancreatic and iliofemoral arteries, and fundus fluorescein&#xD;
      photography (retinal photography) in retinal vessel. All MRI scans were performed on 3.0 T&#xD;
      Philips scanners. CTA scans were performed on third-generation dual-source Siemens system&#xD;
      (SOMATOM Force). HR-MRI sequences were performed both at baseline and after 4 years to&#xD;
      identify intracranial and carotidal atherosclerotic stenosis and plaque and measure the&#xD;
      intracranial and carotidal vessel wall, lumen area, and plaque when present. Additionally,&#xD;
      heart function will be tested using color Doppler echocardiography, and ankle-brachial index&#xD;
      will be tested using Doppler ultrasound. All the imaging techniques will be conducted in a&#xD;
      fixed machine by fixed trained investigators based on a standardized protocol. These imaging&#xD;
      techniques enable early detection of intracranial and extracranial vascular lesions,&#xD;
      characterization of the atherosclerotic composition and burden, and monitoring of plaque&#xD;
      progression in intracranial and carotidal arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine follow-up will be performed each year to collect cardio-/cerebrovascular events and&#xD;
      death after enrollment. A further face-to-face interview will be performed at 2 years and 4&#xD;
      years to collect brain MRI scanning and cognitive impairment. At 2-year and 4-year follow-up&#xD;
      visits, standard clinical and neuropsychologic assessments will be performed, including MoCA,&#xD;
      Mini-Mental State Exam scores, Geriatric Depression Scale, Digit Span, Rey Auditory Verbal&#xD;
      Learning Test, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, Trail Making A and B, Stroop Task, Verbal&#xD;
      Fluency Test, Boston Naming Test, Clock Drawing Test, Symbol Digit Modalities Test,&#xD;
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory and Clinical Dementia Rating. Fasting blood and morning urine&#xD;
      samples will be collected at each follow-up visit following same protocol as that at&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol of this study was approved by the ethics committee of Beijing Tiantan Hospital&#xD;
      and Lishui Hospital of Zhejiang University. All participants provided written informed&#xD;
      consents before entering the study.&#xD;
