  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AVETUX is a single arm multicentric phase II investigator initiated trial conducted by the&#xD;
      Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internistische Onkologie (AIO) in 11 German sites in patients with&#xD;
      previously untreated RAS/BRAF wildtype mCRC independent of MSI status.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary clinical objective is to determine the efficacy of a standard 1st line regimen&#xD;
      (FOLFOX and cetuximab) in patients with RAS/v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B&#xD;
      (BRAF) wildtype, Microsatellite Instability (MSI) or icrosatellite Stability (MSS) MCRC with&#xD;
      avelumab in terms of progression free survival rate after 12 months (acc. to Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main secondary objective is to determine safety and tolerability, according to NCI Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.03) and to the obtained data on vital&#xD;
      signs, clinical parameters (oxygen saturation) and feasibility of the regimen. Further&#xD;
      secondary objectives are to determine the efficacy of the experimental regimen in terms of&#xD;
      objective response rate (acc. to RECIST v1.1 and irRECIST), and overall survival, to&#xD;
      correlate clonal dynamics (RAS/EGFR subclones) with immune response signature to determine&#xD;
      control of mutant subclones by the combination of anti-Epidermal growth factor receptor&#xD;
      (EGFR) with anti-PD-L1and PD-L1 staining (and MSI status) with efficacy.&#xD;
