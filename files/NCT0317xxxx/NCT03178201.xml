      The primary objective is to determine the overall response rate (ORR) of TGR-1202 in R/R FL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the genetic and other novel biological markers that may be predictive of&#xD;
           response or resistance to TGR-1202 in patients with relapsed or refractory FL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the Progression Free Survival (PFS), Duration of Response (DoR) after treatment&#xD;
           with TGR-1202.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the number of dose delays and dose reductions and other safety profile.&#xD;

      This is an open label, phase II study of TGR-1202 in patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      (R/R) Grade 1, 2, or 3A follicular lymphoma (FL). FL is the most common subtype of indolent&#xD;
      lymphoma. The prognosis of FL depends on the histologic grade, stage, treatment and age of&#xD;
      the patient. More recently, efforts have been made to find novel regimens for the treatment&#xD;
      of relapsed FL that do not contain non-specific cytotoxic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the important goals of this phase II study is to discover novel genetic, biochemical,&#xD;
      and immunological markers that are associated with the response and safety of TGR-1202 in&#xD;
      patients with FL. TGR-1202 blocks PI3K, a signal that is required for cancer to grow.&#xD;
