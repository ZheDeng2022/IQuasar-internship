  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need to improve the discharge process for patients with stroke, which has been&#xD;
      reported to be a particularly stressful time for patients. A Patient Oriented Discharge&#xD;
      Summary (PODS) meeting has been shown to be an effective approach for minimizing&#xD;
      discharge-related stress and fostering self-management skills in other patients being&#xD;
      discharged from rehabilitation into the community. The purpose of this study is to develop&#xD;
      and evaluate whether a PODS meeting can minimize stress around the discharge process and&#xD;
      improve patient satisfaction with this process. There are two main hypotheses regarding the&#xD;
      PODS program: 1) it will help in-patients with stroke understand key issues related to&#xD;
      knowledge required once discharged and 2) it will increase levels of self-efficacy in&#xD;
      in-patients with stroke. Potential subjects are encouraged to participate if they are a&#xD;
      Sunnybrook - St. John's Rehab admitted in-patient with a stroke diagnosis who are 18 years or&#xD;
      older and meet the following criteria: (a) fluent in English; (b) cognitively intact; and (c)&#xD;
      have minimal or no aphasia.The participant will be asked to answer some surveys 8-10 days&#xD;
      prior to discharge about their knowledge and confidence in managing their stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will then be asked to meet with a clinical staff member who will hold a&#xD;
      one-hour PODS meeting. In the meeting, a discharge plan will be created and given to the&#xD;
      patient that covers a number of topics that will be useful following their return to the&#xD;
      community. One day following the PODS meeting, the participant will be asked to answer the&#xD;
      same survey they completed prior to the PODS and again 3-5 days following discharge. If the&#xD;
      participant is interested they will be asked to undergo a brief interview to get their&#xD;
      feedback on the PODS Program. It is anticipated that about 20 people will participate in the&#xD;
      program with all 20 patients completing the surveys with 6 being asked to complete the brief&#xD;
      interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of the investigators knowledge, there is little risk associated with this study.&#xD;
      Participants may become uncomfortable during the interview while discussing their&#xD;
      experiences. By participating in this study, patients will be provided with a chance to&#xD;
      gather information and learn problem solving and self-management skills prior to discharge.&#xD;
      It is the hope of this project that it can lead to a more effective approach in supporting&#xD;
      the transition from the hospital to the community for patients with stroke&#xD;

    <description>Participants will undergo a Patient Oriented Discharge Summary (PODS). The PODS is a personalized summary of the discharge plan presented in an easy to understand worksheet that covers (1) medication instructions; (2) follow-up appointments with phone numbers; (3) normal expected symptoms, warning signs, and what to do if they experience a problem; (4) lifestyle changes and when to resume activities; and (5) information and resources to have handy. The meeting will take place one week prior to discharge.</description>
