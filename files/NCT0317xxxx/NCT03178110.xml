      The objectives of this pilot study are to determine the effectiveness of a manual therapy&#xD;
      (MT) protocol plus the use of a dynamic jaw opening device on the maximal interincisor&#xD;
      distance; on trismus symptoms; on pain-disability outcomes and on the quality of life,&#xD;
      anxiety, and depression in subjects with trismus. The proposed pilot study will comprise a&#xD;
      single subject design with multiple baseline measures and during treatment phases to&#xD;
      determine the effectiveness of the treatment protocol. A minimum sample of 10 subjects will&#xD;
      be recruited. The Health Research Ethics Board of Alberta Cancer Committee will approve this&#xD;
      study. Participants will receive a MT protocol plus exercises and the use of the DTS device&#xD;
      for 8 weeks. The first two weeks of treatment will involve only MT and opening&#xD;
      exercises.After this initial 2 weeks, the DTS will be introduced. The participants will&#xD;
      receive a session of 30-45 minutes of MT three/two times per week, for 8 weeks. All&#xD;
      participants will be instructed how to use the Dynasplint® Trismus System at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses: Visual analyses will be performed on participant before, during, and after the&#xD;
      intervention. The 2-standard deviation band method will be used to analyze the behavior of&#xD;
      each participant on the outcome of interest before, during, and after the treatment. The&#xD;
      minimally important difference levels in order to determine clinical relevance will be done.&#xD;
      Two effect size indexes will be used: the percentage of non-overlapping data, and the&#xD;
      percentage of improvement rate difference.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trismus is a common impairment following treatment for head and neck cancer. The prevalence&#xD;
      of trismus ranges from 25% to 46%, and may be the result of a tumour growth, infection,&#xD;
      surgery or radiation. Trismus can dramatically affect the quality of life of subjects with&#xD;
      cancer in a variety of ways, and may contribute to post treatment depression. Early&#xD;
      intervention is key to reduce the chances of complications. Multiple modalities have been&#xD;
      used in the treatment of trismus: Physical therapy, hyperbaric oxygen and pentoxifylline,&#xD;
      forced mouth opening under general anesthesia, surgical coronoidectomy, botulinum toxin&#xD;
      injection and jaw opening devices such as the TheraBite Jaw Motion Rehabilitation and the&#xD;
      Dynasplint® Trismus System. Manual therapy (MT) constitutes a wide variety of different&#xD;
      techniques which may be categorized into four major groups: manipulation, mobilization, and&#xD;
      muscle energy techniques. MT in the form of mobilization associated with exercises has been&#xD;
      frequently used to treat temporomandibular disorders (TMD) with promising results. The&#xD;
      Dynasplint® Trismus System (DTS) is a jaw opening device used as a self-management strategy&#xD;
      for trismus. The DTS provides low-torque, prolonged-duration stretching with the aim of&#xD;
      lengthening the affected connective tissue permanently.Positive effects of the use of DTS in&#xD;
      patients with trismus to increase mouth opening have been reported. To date, however, the&#xD;
      evidence is limited regarding the effectiveness of manual therapy alone or in combination&#xD;
      with exercises to treat specifically trismus in patients with head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of this project are: 1) To determine the feasibility and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of a manual therapy protocol plus the use of a dynamic jaw opening device (DTS) on&#xD;
      the maximal interincisor distance (MID) in subjects with trismus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) To determine the preliminary efficacy the manual therapy protocol plus the use of a&#xD;
      dynamic jaw opening device (DTS) on the Gothenburg Trismus Questionnaire (GTQ). 3) To&#xD;
      determine the preliminary efficacy of a manual therapy protocol plus the use of a dynamic jaw&#xD;
      opening device (DTS) on pain-disability outcomes in subjects with trismus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) To determine the preliminary efficacy of a manual therapy protocol plus the use of a&#xD;
      dynamic jaw opening device (DTS) on the quality of life, anxiety, and depression in subjects&#xD;
      with trismus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a pilot study and will follow the methodology of a single subject design&#xD;
      with multiple baseline measures and during treatment phases to determine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the treatment protocol. The single subject design was chosen because in addition to provide&#xD;
      sound research results, clinical significance of the results for a specific group of patients&#xD;
      can be derived. Thus, variables that are functionally important for treatment can become&#xD;
      evident. The multiple baseline measures will be used because it increases the potential&#xD;
      number of comparisons that can be made between and within data series, ultimately&#xD;
      strengthening the confidence with which conclusions are made from the data. A minimum sample&#xD;
      of 10 subjects who attend the Cross Cancer Institute (CCI) in Edmonton will be recruited for&#xD;
      this project. Subjects will be screened for eligibility and if they meet all eligibility&#xD;
      criteria, an information letter of the study will be provided and they will be asked to sign&#xD;
      a consent form according to the Health Research Ethics Board (HREB) - University of Alberta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with trismus will receive a manual therapy protocol plus exercises and the use&#xD;
      of the DTS device for a duration of 8 weeks twice per week. The first two weeks of treatment,&#xD;
      treatment will involve only manual therapy and opening exercises. After this initial 2 weeks,&#xD;
      the DTS will be introduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Therapy: The participants will receive a session of 30-45 minutes of manual therapy&#xD;
      three/two times per week, for eight weeks. Every sessions will be done and will be adapted&#xD;
      individually to the needs of each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home Exercises: All participants will be instructed how to use the Dynasplint® Trismus System&#xD;
      (DTS; Dynasplint Systems Inc, Severna Park, Md, USA) at home. Participants' initial&#xD;
      introduction to the DTS will include customized fitting (molded patient mouth pieces) and&#xD;
      training on donning and doffing of the devices. Verbal and written instructions will be&#xD;
      provided throughout the duration of the treatment for safety, general wear and care, and&#xD;
      tension setting goals, based on patient tolerance. Participants will start the use of the DTS&#xD;
      for 10-30 minutes three times per day, every day. If the exercises are well tolerated, the&#xD;
      tension will be increased every 2 weeks until maximum tolerance is reached. Participants will&#xD;
      use this device for the duration of the manual therapy and exercise protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: To analyse the data, visual analyses will be done. This kind of&#xD;
      analyses is really important for single subject design research to determine: whether&#xD;
      evidence of a relation between an independent variable and an outcome variable exists and the&#xD;
      strength or the magnitude of that relation. The visual analyses will show the behavior of&#xD;
      each participant before, during, and after the intervention. The 2-standard deviation band&#xD;
      method (2-SD) will be used to analyze the behavior of each participant on the outcome of&#xD;
      interest before, during, and after the treatment. Two effect size indexes will be used to&#xD;
      analyse the data. The first one will be the percentage of non-overlapping data (PND), that is&#xD;
      obtained by counting the number of data points in the intervention phase which do not overlap&#xD;
      with the highest or lowest data points in the baseline phase; this number then is divided by&#xD;
      the total number of data points in the treatment phase, multiplied by 100. The second effect&#xD;
      size index will be the percentage of improvement rate difference (IRD), that considers the&#xD;
      difference in successful performance between baseline and intervention phases. The main&#xD;
      purpose of using these two effect sizes is to explore the effects of treatment and to&#xD;
      describe the phase contrast and design context.&#xD;
