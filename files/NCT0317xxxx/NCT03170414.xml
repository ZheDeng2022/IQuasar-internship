  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of solid organ transplantation&#xD;
      using HIV-positive deceased donors (liver, kidney) and HIV-positive living donors (liver) in&#xD;
      HIV-positive recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-positive individuals who agree to accept and receive a solid organ transplant from and&#xD;
      HIV-positive donor will be followed to determine the safety and efficacy of this practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study of solid organ transplantation utilizing&#xD;
      HIV-positive donors in HIV-positive recipients. Stable HIV-infected adults in need of a solid&#xD;
      organ transplant (kidney, liver) who meet standard and study specified HIV criteria for organ&#xD;
      transplantation will be offered enrollment in the study. Deceased donors (kidney, liver) and&#xD;
      living donors (liver) will be utilized in this protocol. No living kidney donors will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate overall survival and graft survival. In addition the study will&#xD;
      assess potential complications of organ transplant using HIV+ donor organs, including but not&#xD;
      limited to: HIV disease progression, development of antiretroviral resistance mutations,&#xD;
      incidence of opportunistic infections, incidence of transplant complications, impacts of&#xD;
      liver regeneration, incidence of viral-related malignancies, and incidence of&#xD;
      HIV-superinfection.&#xD;

        RECIPIENT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA HIV-Positive Recipient Inclusion Criteria (liver, kidney)&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant is able to understand and provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant meets standard listing criteria for transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Documented HIV infection (by any licensed ELISA and confirmation by Western Blot,&#xD;
             positive HIV ab IFA, or documented history of detectable HIV-1 RNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant is ≥ 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. No evidence of active opportunistic complications of HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participant CD4+ T-cell count is &gt;/= 200/µL within 16 weeks prior to transplant for&#xD;
             kidney transplant recipients. For liver transplant recipient, CD4+ T-cell counts need&#xD;
             to be &gt;/= 100/ul (or &gt;/= 200/µL if history of opportunistic infection) within 16 weeks&#xD;
             prior to transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participant most recent HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL (by any FDA-approved assay performed&#xD;
             in CLIA-approved laboratory), in the 26 weeks prior to transplant. Participants unable&#xD;
             to tolerate ART due to organ failure or who have only recently started ART may have&#xD;
             detectable viral load and still be considered eligible if the study team is confident&#xD;
             there will be a safe, tolerable, and effective antiretroviral regimen once organ&#xD;
             function is restored after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Concurrence by the study team that based on medical history and ART, viral suppression&#xD;
             can be achieved in the recipient post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. No history of primary CNS lymphoma or progressive PML.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. On a stable antiretroviral regimen. Participants unable to tolerate ART due to organ&#xD;
             failure may still be considered eligible if the study team is confident there will be&#xD;
             a safe, tolerable, and effective antiretroviral regimen once organ function is&#xD;
             restored after transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIV-Positive Recipient Exclusion Criteria (liver, kidney)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participant has concomitant conditions that, in the judgment of the investigators, would&#xD;
        preclude transplantation or immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        DONOR ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA HIV-Positive Deceased Donor (liver, kidney)&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Must meet all clinical criteria for HIV-uninfected organ donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. No evidence of invasive opportunistic complications of HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pre-implant donor organ biopsy showing no disease process that would put the recipient&#xD;
             at increased risk of rapid progression to end-stage organ failure, to be stored for&#xD;
             the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Donor has documented HIV infection (by any licensed ELISA and confirmation by Western&#xD;
             Blot, positive HIV ab IFA, or history of detectable HIV-1 RNA) from a CLIA-approved&#xD;
             laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If known history of HIV infection and prior antiretroviral therapy, the study team&#xD;
             must describe the anticipated post-transplant antiretroviral regimen to be prescribed&#xD;
             for the recipient and justify its conclusion that the regimen will be safe, tolerable&#xD;
             and effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIV-Positive Living Donor (liver)&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Donor meets all clinical criteria to be a living liver donor other than being HIV&#xD;
             positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Donor has documented HIV infection (by any licensed ELISA and confirmation by Western&#xD;
             Blot, positive HIV ab IFA, or history of detectable HIV-1 RNA) from a CLIA-approved&#xD;
             laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No evidence of invasive opportunistic complications of HIV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Donor CD4+ T-cell count is &gt;/= 500/µL in the 26 weeks prior to donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The most recent HIV-1 RNA has been below 50 copies RNA/ml in the 26 weeks prior to&#xD;
             donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. On a stable antiretroviral regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must be evaluated by the HIV/Transplant Infectious Diseases team to verify resistance&#xD;
             history and current ART regimens. The potential for transmission of resistant strain&#xD;
             of HIV will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Pre-implant donor liver biopsy to be stored for the duration of the study showing no&#xD;
             evidence of a disease process that would put the donor at increased risk of&#xD;
             progressing to end-stage organ failure after donation, or that would present a risk of&#xD;
             poor graft function to the recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Must be evaluated by an independent HIV study living donor advocate separate from the&#xD;
             transplant service in addition to the living donor advocate seen by all living donors.&#xD;
