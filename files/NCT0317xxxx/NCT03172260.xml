  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study, to test the hypothesis that E Balance Pro Therapy&#xD;
      micro-current treatments, delivered with precision in amplitude, waveform and pulsing&#xD;
      pattern, adapted by other aspects of this device's technology could affect ion flow across&#xD;
      cells and tissues in a fashion that modifies or transforms a crucial pathophysiologic deficit&#xD;
      present in patients with diabetes. E Balance Pro Therapy can supplement standard treatment,&#xD;
      as an adjunct, and help patients better manage their diabetes. HbA1C is the primary endpoint&#xD;
      of this study. However, we expect to see changes in other symptoms (if present) associated&#xD;
      with diabetes such as: blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, neuropathic pain retinopathy and&#xD;
      wound healing.&#xD;
