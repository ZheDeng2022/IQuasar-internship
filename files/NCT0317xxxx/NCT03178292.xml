  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is a minimally invasive procedure for removal of large&#xD;
      volume upper urinary tract stones. Although PCNL is effective and yielding high stone-free&#xD;
      rates, complications rates range from 18.30% to 83% with sepsis has been reported in 0.3% to&#xD;
      7.6% of cases result in the most common cause of perioperative mortality in PCNL patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urosepsis after PNL is an important and potentially catastrophic complication. The overall&#xD;
      incidence of fever (25%), bacteremia (23%), endotoxemia (34%) and septicemic shock occurs in&#xD;
      0.3%-2.5% of patients. Urosepsis and shock result from the intravasation of bacteria or&#xD;
      endotoxins into bloodstream, which in turn increases with prolonged surgery, degree of&#xD;
      hydronephrosis, bacterial load in the renal pelvis, and presence of infected stones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Charton et al., concluded that without antibiotic prophylaxis 35% of patient suffered urinary&#xD;
      tract infection a post-PCNL, although preoperative urine showing no growth. In a prospective&#xD;
      but nonrandomized assessment of PCNL patients receiving oral ciprofloxacin, intravenous&#xD;
      ciprofloxacin, or no antimicrobial treatment found postoperative urinary tract infection to&#xD;
      occur in 17%, 0%, and 40% of patients, respectively. Mariappan et al., stated that midstream&#xD;
      urine (MSU) culture does not represent upper tract infection in patients with obstructing&#xD;
      stones. Also, stone and pelvic urine cultures are better predictors of upper tract infection&#xD;
      and urosepsis in such cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotic prophylaxis has been recommended (Level of evidence: IIb, III) for patients&#xD;
      subjected to PCNL to avert these infectious complications, as profiled in an American&#xD;
      Urological Association (AUA) Best Practice Policy Statement. They also recommend antibiotic&#xD;
      prophylaxis before shock wave lithotripsy and ureteroscopy with high level (Level of&#xD;
      evidence: Ia and Ib, respectively) due to presence of meta-analysis and large randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal timing, dosing, and duration of a prophylactic antibiotic regimen for PCNL&#xD;
      procedures has also been a point of discussion. The AUA best practice policy statement&#xD;
      currently recommends that a one-time dose on the day of the procedure is sufficient. The EAU&#xD;
      guidelines are less definitive in concluding that a short course is adequate but that the&#xD;
      &quot;length of time is to be determined.&quot; Mariappan and colleagues in a prospective&#xD;
      non-randomised trial found that 52 patients who had dilated collecting systems, stone burden&#xD;
      greater than 2 cm, and no confounding factors predisposing to UTIs who received a 1-week&#xD;
      course of ciprofloxacin before PCNL had a 3-fold lower risk of postoperative UTI and SIRS&#xD;
      than 46 patients who received standard perioperative antibiotics on the day of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bag and colleagues prospectively randomized 101 patients with greater than 2.5-cm kidney&#xD;
      stones and/or hydronephrosis with sterile preoperative urine cultures to a 7-day course of&#xD;
      nitrofurantoin versus no antibiotics before PCNL and found a statistically significant lower&#xD;
      rate of postoperative SIRS (19% vs 49%), endotoxemia (18% vs 42%), positive result on kidney&#xD;
      urine culture (0% vs 10%), and positive result on stone culture (8% vs 30%) in the arm&#xD;
      receiving nitrofurantoin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although these two small series support a week of preoperative antibiotics before PCNL,&#xD;
      larger, prospective, randomized studies are needed to better elucidate the risks and benefits&#xD;
      of empiric antibiotics&#xD;
