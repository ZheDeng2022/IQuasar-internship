  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will find out whether electrical stimulation of a nerve called the &quot;vagus&quot; nerve&#xD;
      is acceptable for patients undergoing physiotherapy for arm weakness after a stroke. 20&#xD;
      patients will be recruited if they had a stroke between 4 and 48 months previously and have&#xD;
      been left with reduced function in the affected arm. Patients will receive 3 sessions of&#xD;
      physiotherapy per week for 6 weeks. Each session will last 1 hour during which the patient&#xD;
      will be asked to perform specific movements e.g. shuffling cards, reaching for a shelf. With&#xD;
      each arm movement the therapist will turn on a stimulator which is worn clipped to the&#xD;
      patients ear. This will deliver a short burst of electricity creating a mild tingling&#xD;
      sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the session, the stimulator will be removed and the patient will be asked to&#xD;
      rate the level of any discomfort or fatigue they experienced as well as any other side&#xD;
      effects. The therapist will also record whether the stimulator device interfered with the&#xD;
      therapy in any way. A heart tracing will be performed at each visit to check the heart&#xD;
      rhythm. At the start and end of the 6 week course of physiotherapy, patients arm weakness and&#xD;
      level of arm function will be assessed, as well as their general levels of fatigue, mood and&#xD;
      quality of life. These will be reassessed at 1 month and 6 months after the course of&#xD;
      physiotherapy has ended. The investigators will also interview patients to establish how they&#xD;
      found the treatment itself. If the vagal nerve stimulation combined with physiotherapy is&#xD;
      acceptable to patients and therapists and there are no safety concerns, the investigators&#xD;
      will plan a larger trial of this treatment in stroke patients.&#xD;

      This study will find out whether electrical stimulation of a nerve called the &quot;vagus&quot; nerve&#xD;
      is acceptable for patients undergoing physiotherapy for arm weakness after a stroke. 20&#xD;
      patients will be recruited if they had a stroke between 4 and 48 months previously and have&#xD;
      been left with reduced function in the affected arm. Patients will receive 3 sessions of&#xD;
      physiotherapy per week for 6 weeks. Each session will last 1 hour during which the patient&#xD;
      will be asked to perform specific movements e.g. shuffling cards, reaching for a shelf. With&#xD;
      each arm movement the therapist will turn on a stimulator which is worn clipped to the&#xD;
      patients ear. This will deliver a short burst of electricity creating a mild tingling&#xD;
      sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit to the Clinical research Facility, the researcher will check that the&#xD;
      patient is still happy to take part. Then, some information about the patient e.g. age, sex,&#xD;
      date of stroke, risk factors for stroke will be recorded. Next, the therapist will assess how&#xD;
      much existing strength and function the patient has in the arm affected by their stroke using&#xD;
      a variety of rating scales. Some brief questionnaires will also be used to measure the&#xD;
      patients levels of depression, anxiety, fatigue, quality of life and levels of independence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These initial assessments will take approximately one hour and will be conducted at the first&#xD;
      visit, before the exercises commence. Next the research physiotherapist will clean the&#xD;
      patients ear using an alcohol wipe then apply the vagal nerve stimulator clip to part of the&#xD;
      ear. The stimulator will be set to deliver a burst of electricity which the patient will feel&#xD;
      as a tingling sensation that is not uncomfortable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise session will then commence with a five minute warmup consisting of whole arm&#xD;
      movements using equipment such as pedals and cylinders to facilitate activity. The patient&#xD;
      will then be asked to perform a range of practical tasks using their weak arm e.g.turning&#xD;
      cards, moving objects of various shapes and sizes, opening and closing bottles and bilateral&#xD;
      activities such as lifting objects with both hands. The exercise regime will aim to&#xD;
      incorporate 300- 400 such arm movements and will take approximately one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the exercises, the therapist will press a switch to trigger a run of vagal nerve&#xD;
      stimulation in time with the patient's activity. Patients will be videoed during the therapy&#xD;
      sessions to allow researchers to retrospectively count the number and type of repetitive&#xD;
      movements successfully performed. At the end of the exercises, the stimulator clip will be&#xD;
      removed from the patient's ear and cleaned with an alcohol disinfectant wipe ready for next&#xD;
      use. After each therapy session, patients will be asked to document on scale of 05 how much&#xD;
      they experienced skin reddening, irritation, nausea, dizziness, and headache. Patients will&#xD;
      be asked to rate their level of discomfort and fatigue arising from the session using a 05&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also be given a diary to take home to record details of any physiotherapy&#xD;
      sessions they undergo outside the study (including any exercise they do at home) and any new&#xD;
      symptoms that may arise. They will be asked to bring this diary to the remaining sessions.&#xD;
      The patient will undergo 3 of these exercise sessions per week for 6 weeks (i.e. 18 exercise&#xD;
      sessions altogether). The remaining 17 session will begin with application of the stimulator&#xD;
      clip and the warm up as detailed above. At the end of the final exercise session, the scales&#xD;
      used to measure arm strength and function, mood, fatigue and quality of life will be&#xD;
      repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then return to the Clinical Research Facility after 1 month and after 6 months&#xD;
      to have their arm function tests repeated and to reassess their mood, quality of life and&#xD;
      fatigue. No exercise will be performed at these last 2 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients who receive physiotherapy during October- December 2015 will be invited to take&#xD;
      part in a separate interview with the MSc student who has been delivering their&#xD;
      physiotherapy. This will take place at a mutually convenient time at the Clinical Research&#xD;
      Facility. During that interview, the patient will be asked how they found the treatment,&#xD;
      whether there were any problems and whether it was what they expected. These interviews will&#xD;
      be tape recorded so that the student can listen to the tapes and analyse what the patients&#xD;
      have said.&#xD;
