      This study will investigate and confirm the efficacy of two psychological treatments for&#xD;
      adults with autism spectrum disorder. Cognitive Enhancement Therapy (CET) is a cognitive&#xD;
      remediation intervention that aims to help adults with problems in thinking, planning, and&#xD;
      socialization. Enriched Supportive Therapy (EST) is an individual supportive therapy that&#xD;
      aims to help adults learn about their condition, manage their emotions and stress, improve&#xD;
      their social skills, and cope with everyday problems.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by marked impairments in social and&#xD;
      non-social cognitive ability that persist well into adulthood and contribute to significant&#xD;
      functional disability. The treatment of ASD has focused almost exclusively on children, and&#xD;
      few empirically supported interventions are available to address the core cognitive and&#xD;
      functional challenges individuals with ASD face as they transition to adulthood. This study&#xD;
      will investigate and confirm the efficacy of two psychological treatments for adults with&#xD;
      autism spectrum disorder. Cognitive Enhancement Therapy (CET) is a cognitive remediation&#xD;
      intervention that aims to help adults with problems in thinking, planning, and socialization.&#xD;
      Enriched Supportive Therapy (EST) is an individual supportive therapy that aims to help&#xD;
      adults learn about their condition, manage their emotions and stress, improve their social&#xD;
      skills, and cope with everyday problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last 30 months. Potential participants must be able to&#xD;
      attend weekly treatment sessions in Pittsburgh, PA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a 30-month (2.5 years) randomized-controlled confirmatory efficacy trial,&#xD;
      where eligible participants will be randomized to the CET or EST study treatments.&#xD;
      Participants will be treated with the study interventions for 18 months, and then followed&#xD;
      for 12 additional months to assess the lasting impact of the study interventions. All&#xD;
      participants will complete cognitive, clinical, and neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging)&#xD;
      assessments prior to starting the study treatments and then at specified intervals thereafter&#xD;
      to evaluate the impact of the study treatments on cognition, adaptive function, and the&#xD;
      brain.&#xD;

    <description>This research treatment aims to help with problems in thinking, planning, and socialization. Participants begin with cognitive training using computer software programs. They also participate in a small social-cognitive group to learn about their condition and how to act wisely in social situations by developing the abilities needed to understand another person's perspective, evaluate social contexts, and be foresightful.&#xD;

    <description>This research treatment uses individual supportive therapy to help adults learn about autism spectrum disorder, manage their emotions and stress, improve their social skills, and cope with everyday problems. Participants will learn about the impact of stress on their lives, and how to identify their own early cues of distress and apply effective coping strategies.&#xD;
