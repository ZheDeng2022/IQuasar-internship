  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years there has been increasing focus on the earlier detection of deterioration in&#xD;
      the clinical condition of hospital patients with the aim of instigating earlier treatment to&#xD;
      reverse this deterioration and prevent adverse outcomes. This is especially important in the&#xD;
      ED, a dynamic environment with large volumes of undifferentiated patients, which carries&#xD;
      inherent patient risk. SNAP40 is an innovative medical-grade device that can be worn on the&#xD;
      upper arm that continuously monitors patients' vital signs including relative changes in&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, movement, blood oxygen saturation and&#xD;
      temperature. It uses automated risk analysis to potentially allow clinical staff to easily&#xD;
      and quickly identify high-risk patients. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the&#xD;
      SNAP40 device is able to identify deterioration in the vital sign physiology of an ED patient&#xD;
      earlier than current standard monitoring and observation charting techniques.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As well as the potential of the SNAP40 device to improve patient safety, we believe that the&#xD;
      SNAP40 device will increase ED efficiency, improve and increase use of resources and enable&#xD;
      improved patient flow through the ED. Currently the only option for continuous monitoring or&#xD;
      regular observations in the ED is to connect the patient to a standard monitor. Whilst these&#xD;
      monitors can be portable they are not lightweight enough to allow the patient to be&#xD;
      ambulatory within the ED and therefore require the patient to have a bed and a bed space or&#xD;
      cubicle. This leads to lack of space within the ED, less cubicles (which allow privacy) free&#xD;
      for performing history taking, examination and procedures, difficulty accessing patients and&#xD;
      difficulty transporting them to areas where specialist tests can be performed (i.e. radiology&#xD;
      and ECG). SNAP40 may remove the need for patients to be confined to beds and bed spaces&#xD;
      (unless clinically required) freeing up space within the ED and allowing the ED care&#xD;
      processes to occur much more freely increasing efficiency and speed of patient processing.&#xD;
      This will undoubtedly lead to improved patient experiences around their ED and hospital&#xD;
      journey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SNAP40 device also has the potential to free up resources, which can be used to improve&#xD;
      patient care and experience in the ED. SNAP40 may reduce clinical staff time taken to record&#xD;
      observations enabling them to provide patients with other aspects of care (i.e. analgesia and&#xD;
      treatments) more regularly and in a timelier manner. Clinical staff may be able to spend more&#xD;
      time with patients allowing better quality communication with them and their relatives. There&#xD;
      will potentially be more time for traditional nursing care and personal care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst there are some other similar medical devices on the market (i.e. www.biovotion.com,&#xD;
      www.sensium-healthcare.com, www.vitalconnect.com, http://www.caretakermedical.net) using&#xD;
      wristbands, patches or finger cuff technology, currently none are being used in ED clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the SNAP40 device by comparing its performance to detect&#xD;
      physiological deterioration against standard observations taken by clinical staff (nurses,&#xD;
      doctors and clinical support workers) within the ED. The study will assess whether the device&#xD;
      is able to detect physiological derangement sooner that standard monitoring devices.&#xD;
