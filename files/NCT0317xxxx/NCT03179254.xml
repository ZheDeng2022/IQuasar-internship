  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients scheduled to undergo ambulatory surgery are usually made non per os (NPO) at&#xD;
      midnight on the day prior to surgery. In the case of patients with type 2 diabetic mellitus&#xD;
      (DM) on treatment with oral hypoglycemic agent (OHA), patients are instructed to temporarily&#xD;
      discontinue treatment on the day prior to surgery. This advice is based on the concern for&#xD;
      intraoperative and postoperative hypoglycemia in this group of patients. Metformin , a&#xD;
      dimethylbiguanide, is widely used as an oral antihyperglycemic drug in the long term&#xD;
      treatment of type 2 DM. This instruction to withhold treatment may be imprudent given that&#xD;
      metformin by virtue of its mechanism of action does not cause hypoglycemia. Another concern&#xD;
      often cited as a reason to withhold metformin is the reported adverse effect of lactic&#xD;
      acidosis. However, a recent metanalysis by the Cochrane group found no cases of fatal or&#xD;
      nonfatal lactic acidosis in 70,490 patient-years of metformin use, or in 55,451 patient-years&#xD;
      for those not on metformin. Furthermore, discontinuing OHA treatment can result in disruption&#xD;
      of established glycemic control and intraoperative and postoperative hyperglycemia all of&#xD;
      which can be deleterious to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that uninterrupted treatment with OHA in type 2 DM patients undergoing&#xD;
      ambulatory surgery will not result in intraoperative and postoperative hypoglycemia (defined&#xD;
      as blood glucose &lt; 60mg/dl) compared to patients withholding OHA treatment on the day of&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      Patients with established diagnosis of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) who are on OHA&#xD;
      monotherapy or combination OHA and are scheduled to undergo ambulatory surgery will be&#xD;
      identified. Informed consent will be obtained from 160 consecutive study participants.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into 2 groups - OHA treatment on day of surgery (Metformin&#xD;
      continue) (H1 group, n= 80) and patients not receiving OHA on day of surgery (OHA&#xD;
      discontinue) (H0, n=80) as prescribed by their provider. All patients will be processed&#xD;
      through the anesthesia preoperative clinic and instructions regarding preoperative medication&#xD;
      handling will be provided to study participants by the investigator. The instructions will be&#xD;
      reinforced by the clinic nursing staff in the usual fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the morning of the surgical procedure, the investigator will verify that medication&#xD;
      administration instructions provided to the study participant was adhered to. The patient&#xD;
      will be checked-in into the ambulatory surgery suite and usual surgical preparatory&#xD;
      procedures followed. Pre-anesthesia capillary blood glucose measurement will be performed and&#xD;
      recorded in the pre-surgical area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia will be induced and maintained in the usual fashion. Intraoperative capillary&#xD;
      blood glucose levels will be checked and recorded.The investigator will ensure that glucose&#xD;
      containing maintenance intravascular fluids are avoided throughout the anesthesia and surgery&#xD;
      unless specifically indicated for treatment. All patients will be awakened and extubated at&#xD;
      the end of surgery and transferred to the post anesthesia recovery (PAR) area as appropriate.&#xD;
      Capillary blood glucose will be measured after arrival in the PAR. The capillary glucose&#xD;
      tests obtained in this study is part of established and standard care and will be paid for by&#xD;
      the patient.&#xD;
