      Background In view of expected growth of the older population in Singapore in the next&#xD;
      decades, the volume and complexity of needs for health care services is expected to increase,&#xD;
      which amplifies stress on the current healthcare system. One approach to addressing this&#xD;
      challenge is to consider service utilization in relationship to needs based on &quot;population&#xD;
      segmentation&quot; and to plan and evaluate new services in light of unmet needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims and Hypotheses Primary Aim 1: To establish health and social service (HASS)&#xD;
      norms for population segments as defined by the Simple Segmentation Tool (SST) via a&#xD;
      modified-Delphi methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 2: To evaluate the concordance between the types of HASS that patients in each&#xD;
      population segment actually utilize versus the types of HASS normatively defined for each&#xD;
      population segment over a 3-month period from the point of hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: The concordance between the actual utilization of different types of HASS&#xD;
      versus normative HASS is not better than fair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim: To assess the association between concordance of normative HASS and incidence&#xD;
      of adverse outcomes which includes emergency department visits, unplanned hospital&#xD;
      readmissions, nursing home placement, and all-cause mortality over a 12-month period from&#xD;
      point of hospital discharge for all population segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis: Patients with disagreement between normative HASS and actual&#xD;
      utilization of HASS will have a higher incidence of adverse outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology The investigators will use a modified-Delphi methodology to develop HASS norms&#xD;
      and conduct a follow-up study of inpatients to evaluate the concordance between the types of&#xD;
      HASS utilized and norm HASS, and to evaluate the association between this concordance and&#xD;
      adverse outcomes in each population segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance to Health Services Delivery The transformation of the health care system to&#xD;
      effectively meet growing needs in a patient-centric way requires practical tools for&#xD;
      population planning and program development. The norms and evaluation approaches developed&#xD;
      here will guide clinical and public policy decision makers in prioritizing population needs,&#xD;
      and thus contribute to tangible improvements in health services delivery, patient care and&#xD;
      health outcomes for an aging Singapore population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background The Singaporean demographic transition has increased the proportion of older&#xD;
      individuals in the population and the prevalence of multiple chronic health conditions. 1 in&#xD;
      4 Singaporeans aged 40 years and above has at least 1 chronic disease. Worldwide urgency to&#xD;
      address chronic conditions is driven by the rapid rise in incidence and also by the&#xD;
      associated social and financial costs for the health sector and society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Often, patients with multiple chronic conditions require more services which are increasingly&#xD;
      recognized to include a coordinated mix of clinical and social care. A promising strategy for&#xD;
      planning and evaluation of services for an increasingly complex population is population&#xD;
      segmentation, where individuals are assigned into groups based on similar health and&#xD;
      health-related social needs. Understanding how people in various segments distribute across&#xD;
      points of service and in the community more broadly can be used to guide the efficient&#xD;
      provision of services. In addition to improved efficiency, meeting otherwise unmet needs&#xD;
      would reduce the progression to worse health states and associated high cost medical services&#xD;
      such as hospitalization. Through segmentation health care providers, regional health system&#xD;
      (RHS) planners, and policy makers will be enabled to develop more person-centric services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims and hypotheses of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 1: To establish norms for high value services for population segments as defined&#xD;
      by the SST via a modified-Delphi methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 2: To evaluate the concordance between the types of HASS that patients in each&#xD;
      population segment actually utilize versus the types of HASS normatively defined for each&#xD;
      population segment over a 3-month period from the point of hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: The concordance between the actual utilization of different types of HASS&#xD;
      versus normative HASS is not better than fair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim: To assess the association between concordance with norm HASS and incidence of&#xD;
      adverse outcomes, which includes emergency department, visits, unplanned hospital&#xD;
      readmissions and all-cause mortality over a 12-month period from point of hospital discharge&#xD;
      for all population segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis: Patients with low concordance with norm HASS in their segment will have&#xD;
      a higher incidence of adverse outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve the above aims, the study will be conducted in 3 corresponding phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: The modified-Delphi methodology will be applied to generate a set of normative HASS&#xD;
      for each population segment. This method involves a group of experts who provide individual&#xD;
      responses in the questionnaires and re-evaluate their responses subsequently in a group&#xD;
      discussion to establish the expert consensus. In addition, this method was chosen for its&#xD;
      flexibility in design and is amenable to follow-up interviews, leading to deeper&#xD;
      understanding of the research questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population segments will be defined based on the SST in terms of 6 health categories&#xD;
      corresponding to the nature of their clinical condition(s) plus a combination of 9&#xD;
      complicating factors which influence the difficulty in managing health conditions and tend to&#xD;
      require nursing and social services. Ten specific services based on the proficiency of skills&#xD;
      involved will be considered as potentially &quot;high value&quot; from each population segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar to the RAND approach, each segment will be an &quot;indication,&quot; which classifies&#xD;
      population in terms of their needs in deciding which services to recommend, and these&#xD;
      indications will be grouped for ease of evaluation into &quot;chapters.&quot; The research team will&#xD;
      identify potential experts from a distribution of relevant disciplines (4 doctors, 4&#xD;
      nurses/allied health professions, and 1 policy maker) in Singapore for the modified-Delphi&#xD;
      study. They will be contacted personally to establish their interest to participate in this&#xD;
      study, and the process will continue until the required number of panelists in the prescribed&#xD;
      distribution are met. Panelists will be provided with a brief description of the method and&#xD;
      how it will be applied to this study. The study will consist of an independent round of&#xD;
      rating and a group meeting to reconcile the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: A follow-up study will be conducted to evaluate the concordance between the types of&#xD;
      HASS that patients actually utilize 3 months post hospital discharge versus normative HASS&#xD;
      defined in Phase 1. Study participants will be recruited from inpatients in the Singapore&#xD;
      General Hospital Department of Internal Medicine (SGH DIM) and categorized based on their&#xD;
      health care needs using the SST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Research Coordinator (RC) will screen patients using the eligibility criteria before&#xD;
      inviting them to participate. An Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT) will be administered to&#xD;
      determine cognitive capacity to consent. If the patient is deemed unfit, a proxy will then be&#xD;
      required to provide informed consent on behalf of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From past data, approximately 56 patients discharged each day, and 75% are older than 55&#xD;
      years. Assuming a recruitment rate of 30% (12 patients per day), the enrolment period is&#xD;
      estimated to be 4 to 5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data collection: RCs will take the informed consent from the study participants and&#xD;
      interview them for socioeconomic and demographic status, health information and prescribed&#xD;
      health care services. Study participants will be given a diary to keep track of their health&#xD;
      care utilization for 3 months from time of discharge. Doctors who have managed study&#xD;
      participants fill out the SST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up (3-month) data collection: Study participants will be contacted for follow-up&#xD;
      interview by assessors who are blinded to SST categories 3 months after the baseline&#xD;
      interview. HASS utilization information over this 3 months period to be obtained by follow-up&#xD;
      face-to-face interview, EMR, diary, and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan The data for aim 2, based on both baseline and follow-up data, can&#xD;
      be summarized in a table with (k+1) rows and (k+1) columns. The total number of HASS is k&#xD;
      (k=10 for this study). An extra dummy column and an extra dummy row are added to the table to&#xD;
      incorporate scenarios where patients do not utilize any high value HASS or utilize HASS that&#xD;
      are not deemed high value. Cells in the (k+1)th column represent frequencies of patients who&#xD;
      are deemed to be appropriate for some HASS but do not use that service. Similarly, the&#xD;
      (k+1)th row represent the cell frequencies corresponding to the patients who use some HASS&#xD;
      not deemed high value. So the total number of HASS, for analysis purposes, becomes k+1. nij&#xD;
      (i,j=1,2, … k+1) represents the cell frequency (number of patients) corresponding to ith&#xD;
      normative HASS and jth actual service: number of patients who have been prescribed ith&#xD;
      normative HASS and have used jth actual service. Diagonal elements in the table, nii&#xD;
      represent frequencies corresponding to agreement between normative and actual utilization of&#xD;
      HASS. Cohen's kappa value is used as the measure concordance between the actual utilization&#xD;
      of different types of HASS versus normative HASS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, Cohen's kappa can be written as Ka = (p0 - pe)/ (1 - pe), where, overall&#xD;
      proportion of observed agreement p0 = (n11 + n22 + …. + nkk + nk+1k+1)/n, is the sum of&#xD;
      diagonal entries in the table divided by n; and, overall proportion of chance-expected&#xD;
      agreement pe = (n1. x n.1 + n2. x n.2 + … + nk. x n.k + nk+1. x n.k+1)/n2 is the sum of the&#xD;
      products of the marginal frequencies divided by n2 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the primary hypothesis: the concordance between the actual utilization of different&#xD;
      types of HASS versus normative HASS is not better than fair; the statistical hypothesis can&#xD;
      be written as H0: Ka = 0.41 against H1: Ka &lt; 0.41, where the kappa value of 0.41 denote the&#xD;
      lower boundary of the range of moderate concordance. The one sided hypothesis can be tested&#xD;
      using the test statistics z = ( K̂a - 0.4)/s.e(K̂a), where K̂a is the estimated value of&#xD;
      kappa from the data table and s.e(K̂a) = σ/√n where n is total sample size and s.e denote the&#xD;
      standard error. Note that, the statistics z has an asymptotic normal distribution. Based on&#xD;
      the data, the null hypothesis is rejected if z &lt; zα and conclude that corresponding&#xD;
      concordance is not better than fair, where zα is the (1-α)th quantile of a standard normal&#xD;
      distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of patients using the prescribed services for each of the 10 HASS will also be&#xD;
      considered. HASS specific proportion will indicate the measure of agreement within that&#xD;
      service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Using the above stated statistical hypothesis and asymptotic normality of the z&#xD;
      statistics in a one-sided test with effect size 0.06, σ value as 0.6, type I error as 0.05&#xD;
      and power set to be 0.9, the estimated sample size is 856. Considering 15% dropout during the&#xD;
      follow-up, the required sample is 856/0.85 = 1007. To calculate the effect size, the value of&#xD;
      kappa was taken to be 0.35 under alternative hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: The association between normative HASS concordance and incidence of adverse outcomes&#xD;
      at 12 months from the day of discharge in each population segment will be assessed by review&#xD;
      of information from EMR, National Death Registry, MOH and survey results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan In the analysis stage, the effect of the agreement between the&#xD;
      normative services and the actual services used by individual patient on the adverse outcomes&#xD;
      of that patient will be inferred at each population segment. Separate models for each of the&#xD;
      four adverse outcome variables will be considered. As A&amp;E visits and readmission are count&#xD;
      variables which can take values 0, 1, 2 …, there may be more patients with '0' value for&#xD;
      these two outcome variables. To address this zero-inflated outcome, zero-inflated Poisson&#xD;
      regression models will be considered, separately for each of these two outcomes, to see the&#xD;
      effect of the agreement between the normative services and the actual services used by&#xD;
      individual patient on the adverse outcomes of that patient. The other two adverse outcome&#xD;
      variables nursing home placement and death are binary variables 1: yes and 0: no. Two&#xD;
      logistic regression models will be used to find out the effect of above mentioned 'agreement'&#xD;
      on the two outcome variables separately. In all four regression models, the variable&#xD;
      selection procedure will be considered to choose appropriate covariates from the baseline and&#xD;
      follow-up data. In each of the four cases, p-values related to the coefficient of the&#xD;
      'agreement' corresponding to the two sided test with null hypothesis that value of the&#xD;
      coefficient is zero will be reported, together with confidence intervals of the coefficients.&#xD;
      A statistically significant negative value of a coefficient will indicate lower 'agreement'&#xD;
      may increase the adverse outcomes.&#xD;
