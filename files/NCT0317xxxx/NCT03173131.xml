    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled study that will involve fellowship-trained board certified&#xD;
      orthopaedic surgeons in four different subspecialties (hand surgery, sports surgery, shoulder&#xD;
      and elbow surgery, and foot and ankle surgery) within our practice group. Consenting patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to the treatment group (receiving preoperative counseling) or to the&#xD;
      control group (no preoperative counseling). The control limb will provide us with information&#xD;
      regarding average opioid consumption following common outpatient orthopedic procedures, and&#xD;
      the study limb will allow us to evaluate the effect of the pre-operative opioid counseling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past two decades in the United States, the opioid epidemic has escalated at a&#xD;
      startling rate and prescription opioids are a large contributor to this problem. Studies show&#xD;
      that there is an excessive amount of opioids being prescribed for orthopedic procedures. An&#xD;
      accurate understanding of opioid consumption following common outpatient orthopedic surgery&#xD;
      is imperative in order to treat pain appropriately relative to the surgery being performed&#xD;
      without leading to excess narcotic prescribing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is threefold: to better understand typical opioid consumption&#xD;
      following common outpatient orthopedic surgeries, to generate prescribing guidelines to&#xD;
      optimize opioid prescribing, and to understand the effect of pre-operative opioid counseling&#xD;
      on opioid consumption following these procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective randomized controlled study that will involve eight fellowship-trained&#xD;
      board certified orthopaedic surgeons in four different subspecialties (hand surgery, sports&#xD;
      surgery, shoulder and elbow surgery, and foot and ankle surgery). Consenting patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to the treatment group (receiving preoperative counseling) or to the control group&#xD;
      (no preoperative counseling). The control limb will provide us with information regarding&#xD;
      average opioid consumption following common outpatient orthopedic procedures, and the study&#xD;
      limb will allow us to evaluate the effect of the pre-operative counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic demographic and surgical data will be collected. Primary outcomes will be assessed at&#xD;
      the post-operative visit. These include the total number of opioid pills consumed, average&#xD;
      daily pain scores, and adverse effects. Secondary outcomes include the number of days the&#xD;
      medication was used, medication refill requests, and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
