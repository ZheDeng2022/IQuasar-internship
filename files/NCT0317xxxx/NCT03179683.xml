    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled split-mouth clinical trial study was designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of low-level laser therapy on bone healing in patients with bilateral sinus lifting&#xD;
      and simultaneous dental implant application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maxillary posterior partially edentulous or totally edentulous twelve patients who need&#xD;
      bilateral sinus bone augmentation were included in this study. Sinus bone augmentation and&#xD;
      dental implant surgeries were done simultaneously. Low level laser therapy (LLLT) was (λ=&#xD;
      630-660 nm, 25 mw / cm², 6 mins) applied for just one operation side at first, third, fifth&#xD;
      and seventh days. Treatment side were randomly selected by another surgeon who applied LLLT.&#xD;
      Panoramic radiographs were taken at the first, third and sixth months using aluminum&#xD;
      step-wedge technique. Optic Density analyses were performed using Cardinal Health Digital&#xD;
      Densitometer (Fluke Biomedical 07-443) with 1mm diameter. Digital densitometric results were&#xD;
      obtained as equivalent aluminum thickness for each radiograph. These data were used to&#xD;
      evaluate changes in optical bone densitometry and compare the LLLT applied side and control&#xD;
      side for each patient.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Twelve patients were included to this study who required a bilateral sinus floor augmentation&#xD;
      for implant-prosthetic rehabilitation. Nine patients were bilaterally free-end partial&#xD;
      edentulous and three patients were totally edentulous with residual alveolar height between&#xD;
      3-6 mm. All patients required bilateral sinus augmentation with simultaneous implant&#xD;
      placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have maxillary sinus pathology, previous history of chronic sinus infection,&#xD;
      smoking more than ten cigarettes per day, any systemic disease interfere with the surgical&#xD;
      procedure were excluded from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study protocol was conducted by Ankara University Dentistry Faculty Research Ethics&#xD;
      Committee. All patients were informed about the treatment procedure and all patients gave&#xD;
      written consent for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Protocol Bilateral sinus augmentation and simultaneous implant placement were&#xD;
      performed in one appointment with same surgical protocol. All surgical procedures performed&#xD;
      under local anesthesia (Ultracain D-S Forte; Sanofi-Aventis, Istanbul, Turkey). After&#xD;
      elevation of mucoperiosteal flap a hinge door osteotomy was performed on the lateral wall of&#xD;
      the maxillary sinus with a round diamond bur under saline solution irrigation. Schneiderian&#xD;
      membrane was carefully detached from inferior and lateral walls of the sinus until creating&#xD;
      enough space for placement of bone grafts. Implant osteotomies were performed and DBM putty&#xD;
      bone graft (DynaGraft bone putty, Keystone Dental, Burlington, Mass) were placed medial,&#xD;
      posterior and anterior side of implant sockets. Implants (Touareg S, Adin, Afula, Israel)&#xD;
      were inserted into the osteotomy site after sufficient grafting. Access window filled with&#xD;
      bone graft after implant placement. Membrane was not used over access window. 3/0 silk suture&#xD;
      were used for closure of the flap. Antibiotic (amoxicillin thrice per day), analgesic&#xD;
      (naproxen sodium, 2 twice per day) and mouthwash (isotonic saline twice per day) were&#xD;
      prescribed for postoperative management. The patients were advised to have a soft diet and to&#xD;
      avoid sneezing until two weeks. Sutures were removed one-week after surgery. No complications&#xD;
      occurred during surgery. All surgical wounds healed uneventfully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low Level Laser Therapy Protocol In this study, an 630-660 nm aluminum gallium indium&#xD;
      phosphide (AlGalnP) laser device (Scorpion Dental Optima Model 405-7A; Optica Laser, Sofia,&#xD;
      Bulgaria) was used immediately after surgery, third day, fifth day and seventh day only for&#xD;
      one operation side. Treatment side were randomly selected by another surgeon who applied&#xD;
      LLLT. Tissue was irradiated at 25mW power for total six minutes, two minutes for each point&#xD;
      (buccal, palatal, crestal). 72J /cm2 energy density was deposited in one session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiological Evaluation Aluminum Step-Wedge and Radiographic Assessment Aluminum step-wedge&#xD;
      was used as the reference material in densitometric evaluation of the conventional&#xD;
      radiographs. The aluminum wedges were prepared using 99,7% pure aluminum plates, the&#xD;
      dimensions of the plates were 1 mm in width and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 mm in length. Prepared six&#xD;
      aluminum plates were sticked in a row and a stair-like aluminum wedge had acquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prepared aluminum step-wedges were located in a fixed place (lower left corner) in the film&#xD;
      cassettes in order to maintain the calibration and standardization of the radiographs.&#xD;
      Special care was taken to avoid the superposition of the hyoid bone and other bony structures&#xD;
      with the step-wedge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research, all radiographic assessments were made using panoramic radiographs. The&#xD;
      radiographic assessments were done by the same radiology technician from the Oral Diagnosis&#xD;
      and Radiology department of Ankara University. Mediphot X-O/RP, sens: green, 15x30 panoramic&#xD;
      radiographs were used in this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All radiographs were taken with 80 kVp, 12 mA, 2.5 mm Al total filtrated &quot;PM 2002 CC Proline&quot;&#xD;
      panoramic radiography device using the same kV and mA values. Radiographic film processing&#xD;
      was made in automatic radiograph processing devices, Velopex and Extra-XE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four panoramic radiographs were taken from each patient, which were preoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative on first., third and sixth months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Densitometric Assessment Densitometrical analysis was performed on forty-eight radiographs&#xD;
      which were taken preoperatively and on postoperative first, third and sixth. Months in this&#xD;
      research. Densitometric assessments of the radiographs were made in Medical Physics&#xD;
      department of the Ankara University Nuclear Sciences Institute. Cardinal Health Digital&#xD;
      Densitometer (Fluke Biomedical 07-443) with 1 mm diameter used in optic density measurement.&#xD;
      Results were read and recorded immediately from the devices screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Densitometric measurement was repeated three times in each radiograph and an average was&#xD;
      acquired, the used spots were every step of the step-wedge and the augmented sinus areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aluminum equivalent thickness of the augmented sinus areas were identified. With this&#xD;
      information, the mineralization levels of the graft materials on the radiographs were&#xD;
      identified and acquired results were assessed statistically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Assessment The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine whether the data were&#xD;
      normally distributed. The Friedman test was used for four time points in two groups. In cases&#xD;
      of significant differences among measurements, the Bonferroni-adjusted Wilcoxon signed-rank&#xD;
      test was used as post hoc analysis. Additionally, the Bonferroni-adjusted Wilcoxon&#xD;
      signed-rank test (paired observations) was used to compare the two groups in the same time&#xD;
      points. All tests were performed using statistical software (SPSS Inc., version 19.0,&#xD;
      Chicago, IL, USA). The median with min-max values were calculated for each parameter as the&#xD;
      statistical unit. P &lt; 0.05 was statistically significant.&#xD;
