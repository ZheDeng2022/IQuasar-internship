  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tens of thousands of Veterans have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF),&#xD;
      and suffer poor quality of life, frequent hospitalizations, and high death rates. Older&#xD;
      Veterans and those with high blood pressure, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome (abnormal&#xD;
      cholesterol and resistance to insulin's effects) are particularly at risk for HFpEF. However,&#xD;
      it is not clear why only some Veterans in this risk group eventually develop HFpEF. Extensive&#xD;
      information from experimental animal models and some human studies suggests that dietary&#xD;
      patterns in vulnerable 'salt-sensitive' people could contribute to the risk for HFpEF.&#xD;
      Reducing salt intake and increasing overall dietary quality in at-risk Veterans could prevent&#xD;
      heart and blood vessel damage that ultimately leads to HFpEF. Reducing the development of&#xD;
      HFpEF, which currently has no definitive treatment, is highly relevant to the VA's mission to&#xD;
      emphasize prevention of disease and population health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 in-person visit hold has been removed- screening and actively enrolling. We are not&#xD;
      currently performing sublingual darkfield microscopy because of the need for close&#xD;
      face-to-face contact with an open-mouthed patient for several minutes in the setting of&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with heart failure (HF) account for over 1,200,000 VA outpatient visits per year,&#xD;
      and HF remains the most common cause for hospital admission in the VA. Approximately 1/3 of&#xD;
      Veterans with HF have 'preserved' ejection fraction (HFpEF), or relatively normal contractile&#xD;
      function of the heart; such patients suffer functional decline and poor quality of life, and&#xD;
      half die within 5 years after diagnosis. Risk factors for developing HFpEF are more common in&#xD;
      Veterans than the general population, and the burden of HFpEF to the VA system will rise in&#xD;
      the years ahead as these Veterans age. Preventive efforts are critical, but are hampered by&#xD;
      gaps in knowledge related to HFpEF pathophysiology. The long term goal of this proposal is to&#xD;
      prevent the onset of HFpEF in at-risk Veterans. Hypertension (HTN) confers the highest&#xD;
      population-attributable risk for HFpEF, particularly when accompanied by the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome, a constellation of obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Animal models of&#xD;
      HTN and metabolic syndrome develop HFpEF due to microvascular oxidative stress and&#xD;
      inflammation induced by high sodium intake. Recent data from cardiac biopsies confirm similar&#xD;
      mechanisms in human HFpEF. Dietary sodium restriction is widely recommended to prevent&#xD;
      HTN-associated heart disease in humans, but this advice is now controversial. Few studies&#xD;
      have examined how individual differences in response to sodium intake affect risk.&#xD;
      &quot;Salt-sensitive&quot; persons have blood pressure (BP) that changes in parallel with sodium&#xD;
      intake, and commonly develop cardiovascular abnormalities associated with HFpEF. The overall&#xD;
      objective of this proposal is to evaluate salt-sensitivity as a novel, diet-responsive risk&#xD;
      factor for incident HFpEF in Veterans with HTN and metabolic syndrome. The central hypothesis&#xD;
      is that the sodium-restricted Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH/SRD) eating&#xD;
      pattern will improve cardiovascular functional and structural risk factors for HFpEF in&#xD;
      Veterans with the salt-sensitive phenotype. Guided by findings in experimental models, cohort&#xD;
      studies, and strong preliminary evidence from the investigators' research group, this&#xD;
      hypothesis will be tested in a two-phase study and by pursuing three specific aims: 1)&#xD;
      Determine effects of DASH/SRD on functional and structural cardiovascular HFpEF risk factors&#xD;
      in salt-sensitive vs. salt-resistant Veterans, 2) measure the effect of an&#xD;
      electronically-delivered tailored-messaging intervention on DASH/SRD adherence, and 3)&#xD;
      determine effects of DASH/SRD intervention and adoption on microvascular function and assess&#xD;
      the endothelial glycocalyx as a biomarker of cardiovascular response to DASH/SRD. Phase 1 of&#xD;
      the study is a crossover-randomized comparison of DASH/SRD vs. control diet for two weeks&#xD;
      each, and Phase 2 a 6-month extension to promote DASH/SRD adherence. The salt-sensitive&#xD;
      phenotype will be defined by between-diet changes in 24-hour mean BP during Phase 1. In Phase&#xD;
      2, the efficacy of motivational interviewing-based counseling and the Women's and Men's&#xD;
      Hypertension Experiences and Emerging Lifestyles Intervention (WHEELS-I), a tailored&#xD;
      messaging program, to sustain DASH/SRD adherence, will be compared. Echocardiography and&#xD;
      arterial tonometry will be used to assess HFpEF-related cardiovascular parameters during&#xD;
      short- and longer-term dietary modification and their interaction with salt-sensitivity. In&#xD;
      vivo microscopy and novel blood testing will assess microvascular function and the integrity&#xD;
      of the endothelial glycocalyx, a blood vessel lining that is sodium-responsive and may&#xD;
      mediate the adverse effects of salt-sensitivity. This proposal is innovative because it&#xD;
      represents the first study to examine salt-sensitivity as a factor promoting HFpEF in&#xD;
      Veterans with HTN and metabolic syndrome, the highest risk group for incident HFpEF.&#xD;
      Moreover, it aims to link microvascular dysfunction, an important pathway in human HFpEF,&#xD;
      with endothelial glycocalyx damage, a potential biomarker for sodium-mediated vascular risk.&#xD;
      The proposed research is significant because it will vertically advance the investigators'&#xD;
      understanding of how dietary factors contribute to the pathophysiology of HFpEF, a major and&#xD;
      growing health threat to Veterans.&#xD;
