  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes has disproportionately affected the Latino population. TExT-MED (Trial to Examine&#xD;
      Text Message for Emergency Department Patients with Diabetes) is a locally designed,&#xD;
      successful mobile health (mHealth) intervention for low income Latinos with diabetes. Social&#xD;
      support interventions have likewise been successful at improving patient self-efficacy and&#xD;
      disease management but are limited in scale due to two key obstacles: 1) requirements of&#xD;
      in-person training of family and friends to be supporters and 2) the need to coordinate&#xD;
      schedules and physical location between the patient and their supporter. mHealth can overcome&#xD;
      these obstacles by allowing supporters to be trained remotely via a mobile platform and by&#xD;
      allowing communication between a patient and supporter to occur at any time or place. The&#xD;
      proposed intervention leverages the success of TExT-MED by augmenting the program with a&#xD;
      social supporter that each patient can select from his or her own social support system&#xD;
      (Family And friend Network Supporters (FANS)), creating TExT-MED+FANS. This is a 12 month,&#xD;
      randomized study of this intervention. At the completion of the trial, we will evaluate the&#xD;
      user experience with TExT-MED+FANS, and the impact of TExT-MED+FANS on patient motivation,&#xD;
      self-efficacy and behaviors through a qualitative analysis of semi-structured individual&#xD;
      interviews.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Glycemic control is measured by hemoglobin A1C collected at point-of-care from an Afinion AS100 capillary point of care machine. The Afinion machine has excellent point of care correlation with laboratory values. As a surrogate for average glycemic control over the previous 3 months and with correlation with clinical outcomes, hemoglobin A1c is a marker of overall clinical disease management. Change is baseline value minus follow up value.</description>

          <description>Summary of Diabetes Self-care Activities (Toobert, Hampson, Glasgow, &amp; RE, 2000). The Summary consists of 6 subscales representing different domains of diabetes related healthy behaviors and self-care. It has been validated in over 10 studies, with the results published in two manuscripts: one with three studies (Toobert &amp; Glasgow, 1994), and one with seven studies(Toobert et al., 2000). Each measure ranges from Each range from 0-7, indicating number of days per week patient reports engaging in these behaviors.</description>

          <title>Wilson 3 Item Scale</title>
          <description>Medication adherence(Wilson et al.,2014). The 3item medication adherence scale is a self-report measure that assessing no. of days medication missed in prior month, days taken medication as advised &amp; self-rated medication adherence. Developed in HIV research, it has been validated for non-HIV medications (Wilson, et al,2016). Each component contributes 33% of the scale. Total score ranges from 0-100. It is the combination of 3 sub-scores, (days missed dose(negative scored), self-rating, days taking medications as indicated). Higher scores indicate better medication adherence.</description>

          <description>Self-efficacy (Diabetes Empowerment Scale Short Form) (Anderson, Fitzgerald, Gruppen, Funnell, &amp; Oh, 2003), is a measure of a patient's overall diabetes related self-efficacy, shortened by the original from 37 to an 8 item scale. It has reliability of alpha=0.84; and has been shown to be sensitive to change in multiple populations and is correlated with improved glycemic control measured by A1C (Anderson et al., 2003). It ranges from 8-40 points; higher score indicates higher self-efficacy.</description>

          <title>Diabetes Distress Scale</title>
          <description>(Diabetes Distress Scale) (Polonsky et al., 2005), is a 17 item scale measuring distress related to emotional burden, physician-related distress, regimen-related distress, and diabetes-related interpersonal issues. It has a Cronbach's alpha of 0.88-0.93 in various studies. Higher scores are negatively correlated with several healthy behaviors. Each question is a Likert scale ranking of how serious a particular issue is from 1-6, 6 indicating a more significant problem. The scores are then averaged across all item, with final scores ranging from 1-6, with 6 indicating higher levels of distress.</description>

The Cronbach's alpha ranges from 0.86-0.89, and it has been validated in multiple languages. Depression is worse with higher scores. Score ranges from 0 to 27. Higher levels of depression are associated with fewer healthy behaviors and worse glycemic control.</description>

          <description>Quality of life (World Health Organization WHO-5 Well Being Index) (Topp, Ostergaard, Sondergaard, &amp; Bech, 2015) is a widely used measure of quality life, validated in many languages and consists of only 5 items. Each self-reported item is scored between 0 and 5, summed together and then multiplied by 4. The total range is from 0 to 100, with 0 being the lowest quality of life.</description>

          <description>Supporter diabetes-related distress is measured by the Partner Distress Scale (Polonsky, Fisher, Hessler, &amp;Johnson, 2016). The self-report scale consists of 21 items in 4 domains: &quot;my partner's diabetes management&quot;, &quot;how best to help&quot;, &quot;diabetes &amp; me&quot;, &amp; &quot;hypoglycemia&quot;. Domains are summed together. Each item is score from 0 to 4, lower scores indicate less distress. The total score is an average of the 21 items. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.76 for total scores. Greater partner distress is correlated with higher A1C among patients, worse self-care &amp; lower satisfaction with relationship</description>

        <title>Change in HBA1c From 6 Months to 12 Months</title>
        <description>Glycemic control is measured by hemoglobin A1C collected at point-of-care from an Afinion AS100 capillary point of care machine. The Afinion machine has excellent point of care correlation with laboratory values. As a surrogate for average glycemic control over the previous 3 months and with correlation with clinical outcomes, hemoglobin A1c is a marker of overall clinical disease management. Change is 6 month value minus 12 month value.</description>

Diabetes Empowerment Scale Short Form (Anderson, Fitzgerald, Gruppen, Funnell, &amp; Oh, 2003), is a measure of a patient's overall diabetes related self-efficacy, shortened by the original from 37 to an 8 item scale. It has reliability of alpha=0.84; and has been shown to be sensitive to change in multiple populations and is correlated with improved glycemic control measured by A1C (Anderson et al., 2003).

        <title>Change in Diabetes Distress Scale From Baseline</title>
        <description>Diabetes related distress (Diabetes Distress Scale) (Polonsky et al., 2005), is a 17 item scale measuring distress related to emotional burden, physician-related distress, regimen-related distress, and diabetes-related interpersonal issues. It has a Cronbach's alpha of 0.88-0.93 in various studies. Higher scores are negatively correlated with several healthy behaviors. Each question is a Likert scale ranking of how serious a particular issue is from 1-6, 6 indicating a more significant problem. The scores are then averaged across all item, with final scores ranging from 1-6, with 6 indicating higher levels of distress</description>

          <description>Diabetes related distress (Diabetes Distress Scale) (Polonsky et al., 2005), is a 17 item scale measuring distress related to emotional burden, physician-related distress, regimen-related distress, and diabetes-related interpersonal issues. It has a Cronbach's alpha of 0.88-0.93 in various studies. Higher scores are negatively correlated with several healthy behaviors. Each question is a Likert scale ranking of how serious a particular issue is from 1-6, 6 indicating a more significant problem. The scores are then averaged across all item, with final scores ranging from 1-6, with 6 indicating higher levels of distress</description>

        <title>Change in Partner Distress Scale From Baseline</title>
        <description>Supporter diabetes-related distress is measured by the Partner Distress Scale (Polonsky, Fisher, Hessler, &amp;Johnson, 2016). The self-report scale consists of 21 items in 4 domains: &quot;my partner's diabetes management&quot;, &quot;how best to help&quot;, &quot;diabetes &amp; me&quot;, &amp; &quot;hypoglycemia&quot;. Domains are summed together. Each item is score from 0 to 4, lower scores indicate less distress. The total score is an average of the 21 items. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.76 for total scores. Greater partner distress is correlated with higher A1C among patients, worse self-care &amp; lower satisfaction with relationship</description>
