      The primary study objective is to evaluate improvement of symptoms from benign prostatic&#xD;
      hyperplasia (BPH) as assessed by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at 12 months&#xD;
      post prostatic artery embolization (PAE) with bland microspheres.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single center, prospective, single arm, investigational study to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of prostate artery embolization (PAE) for treatment of severe lower&#xD;
      urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) related to BPH in patients with prostate size greater than 40&#xD;
      grams that either refuse surgical treatment or are considered poor candidates for traditional&#xD;
      surgical therapy. Two hundred patients will be enrolled in the single treatment arm with&#xD;
      follow-up for no less than 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve a screening period in which patient eligibility will be determined.&#xD;
      Once eligibility is confirmed, patients will receive PAE with bland microspheres within 4&#xD;
      weeks of screening baseline imaging. After treatment, patients will return for follow-up&#xD;
      visits at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post PAE. At each of these visits,&#xD;
      patients will complete IPSS and IIEF questionnaires, undergo a physical exam, laboratory&#xD;
      assessment (including PSA) and perform a medication review. Repeat TRUS and uroflowmetry will&#xD;
      be performed at the 3, 6, and 12 month post PAE follow-up visits. MRI or CT will be conducted&#xD;
      at the 3 and 12 month visit. Cystoscopy and proctoscopy will be performed if medically&#xD;
      indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be improvement of BPH symptoms as assessed by the IPSS at 12 months&#xD;
      post PAE. Patients will continue to be followed according to the institutional standard of&#xD;
      care follow-up schedule after they complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be evaluated throughout the initial 12 months of the study by assessing adverse&#xD;
      events and findings on physical examination. Concomitant medication usage will be assessed.&#xD;
