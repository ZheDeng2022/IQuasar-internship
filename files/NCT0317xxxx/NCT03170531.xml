    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the image quality improvement provided by a custom MR&#xD;
      spine coil in comparison with the FDA approved coil when used for radiotherapy treatment&#xD;
      planning.&#xD;

    <description>Optimize performance of custom-designed spine coil in RT configuration on participants. This objective focuses on the technology of the custom designed spine coil and does not require any statistical analysis.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare the signal-to-noise ratio of a custom spine coil with the existing FDA approved posterior coil array used for spine imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>Day of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>To quantify image quality obtained from the custom spine coil and the existing coil, SNR will be calculated (see Section 4.1 for details) for both coils. If, for a volunteer, the SNR from the custom coil is larger than 105% of that from the existing coil (we insist a 5% improvement margin due to anticipated uncertainty and variability), then we will classify this sample point as a &quot;success&quot;. We will combine the 15 volunteers from the three cohorts (cervical-spine, thoracic-spine and lumbar-spine) and impose the following decision rule: If at least 12 out of the total 15 volunteers are success, then we declare the custom designed spine coil promising and worthy of further investigation.</description>

    <description>During the participant's MR scan, the FDA spine coil will be placed between the participant and the immobilization mold. image parameters will be optimized for spine anatomy for the pulse sequences which are standard for MR imaging. Volunteers may receive up to 3 scans to allow for comparisons of changes to the calibration files as we continue to test the coil and improve its performance.</description>

        Enrollment in this study will be open to all MSKCC employees to act as healthy volunteers&#xD;
        provided they meet the eligibility criteria for the protocol. Employees who provide consent&#xD;
        willfully and voluntarily may participate as a healthy volunteer once. Employees who are&#xD;
        under direct supervision of any investigators on the study will not be eligible to&#xD;
        participate. An IRB approved flyer with pertinent contact information will be distributed&#xD;
        throughout the institution to inform all MSKCC employees of the possibility of&#xD;
        participating in this study. No preferences will be given by race or gender for the&#xD;
        selection of participants.&#xD;
