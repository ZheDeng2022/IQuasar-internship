  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A window of opportunity study which would allow brief treatment of HPV negative SCCHN with a&#xD;
      CDK4/6 inhibitor, in the pre-operative setting, with biomarker analyses of pre and post&#xD;
      treatment tissue. Given that the standard treatment for this population is surgical&#xD;
      resection, this would not impact or alter standard therapy for this population. The goal will&#xD;
      be to learn more about the alterations in pRB1 levels, as well as other signaling markers, in&#xD;
      order to be able to eventually plan a biomarker driven treatment study.&#xD;
