    <textblock>
      The purpose of the pilot is to test the feasibility of developing and implementing the&#xD;
      Williams LifeSkills Cancer Care (WLSCC) and examining its preliminary impact on caregiver&#xD;
      well-being and patient well-being. The study is a two-arm randomized intervention pilot&#xD;
      (WLSCC vs. Usual Care [UC]) with data collection at baseline, immediately after training, and&#xD;
      2 weeks after completing the training. Study setting is at the breast and thoracic cancer&#xD;
      clinics at the Duke Cancer Clinic. A total of 40 cancer patients (20 breast cancer patients&#xD;
      and 20 lung cancer patients) and their caregivers (for a total N of 80) will be recruited for&#xD;
      the pilot. The WLSCC will involve six 30-minute phone sessions and will encompass the&#xD;
      application of 10 psychosocial skills within the context of cancer caregiving. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics will be used to detail recruitment/retention rate, fidelity rate, and the baseline&#xD;
      demographic and clinical characteristics for the total sample and each group. Plots of the&#xD;
      individual trajectories (within-person scores over time) will be used to identify the&#xD;
      pattern(s) of change over time, and assess between-person variability in baseline values&#xD;
      (intercepts) and trajectories (slopes). This study carries minimal risk to study&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;

      The pilot's specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test the feasibility of (a) recruiting lung and breast cancer patients and their&#xD;
           caregivers (hereafter, &quot;dyads) at the Duke Cancer Center (DCC) outpatient clinic; (b)&#xD;
           training interventionists to deliver the WLSCC protocol; (c) delivering the WLSCC&#xD;
           protocol by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine the immediate and two-week impact of the WLSCC on caregiver quality of life,&#xD;
           anxiety and depression, caregiving preparedness, and social support as well as patient's&#xD;
           well-being (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Procedures The pilot is two-arm randomized intervention pilot (WLSCC vs. Usual&#xD;
      Care [UC]) with data collection at baseline (T1), immediately after training (T2), and 2&#xD;
      weeks after completing the training (T3). Caregivers will have an option to receive the WLCCC&#xD;
      protocol, should they wish, after the data collection period. A stratified randomization will&#xD;
      be conducted with stratifying variable being type of cancer and the block size will be 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot setting is at the breast and thoracic cancer clinics at the DCC, Durham, NC. The&#xD;
      WLSCC will involve approximately six 30-minute phone sessions between the caregiver and&#xD;
      interventionist. The six calls will be delivered within three weeks of consent and will use&#xD;
      intervention scripts for standardization of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training will use the WLS format to assess issues and discuss strategies for cancer care&#xD;
      including caregiver stress management. The context of discussion will be tailored by using&#xD;
      the cancer issues endorsed by the cancer patient at baseline data collection. In delivering&#xD;
      the interactive WLSCC training, the interventionist will preface each session by stating that&#xD;
      the protocol is designed to enable them to cope more effectively with demanding caregiving&#xD;
      situations and stressful life situations, to improve their relationships with others, and to&#xD;
      increase the proportion of positive thoughts and feelings in their daily lives. The&#xD;
      interventionist will frequently prompt the caregiver to raise questions that pertain to their&#xD;
      situation (using cancer symptoms endorsed by cancer patient at baseline survey). At the end&#xD;
      of each telephone session, the interventionist will request for the caregiver to complete log&#xD;
      entries to provide an opportunity to reflect or put into action the WLSCC psychosocial skills&#xD;
      taught in each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Recruitment &amp; Compensation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will review every week the list of adult patients who are scheduled for an&#xD;
      outpatient visit at DCC Breast Cancer Clinic and Thoracic Clinic. For those who initially&#xD;
      meet the criteria of aged 18 years and above and with primary breast or thoracic cancer&#xD;
      diagnosed less than a year of the scheduled visit, the team will send an invite letter by&#xD;
      mail to describe the study and invite their participation. A number will be provided that the&#xD;
      patient or caregiver can call to decline participation. If no phone call or voice message is&#xD;
      received on the opt-out number after 2 weeks of mailing the letter, the study staff will make&#xD;
      plans to approach patient and family/friend during the visit to determine further eligibility&#xD;
      for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study staff will visit the Duke Breast and Thoracic cancer clinic at least three times a&#xD;
      week. She/he will approach patients who have not opted out of the study to determine if the&#xD;
      family/friend accompanying the patient meets the definition of a caregiver for this study. If&#xD;
      yes, the study staff will explain the study including the possibility that the dyad maybe&#xD;
      assigned to either the WLSCC or UC group. If a working telephone number is assured and the&#xD;
      dyads show interest in study participation, consent will be obtained from the dyad. After&#xD;
      consent is obtained, baseline data (T1) for measures will be obtained. Using a laptop, the&#xD;
      study staff will access study database and measures using the secure Duke server. He/she will&#xD;
      ask questions in the baseline measures and responses will be directly entered to the study&#xD;
      database. Thereafter, the study staff will assign the dyad a number that is randomly&#xD;
      determined by a computer program. Each number from 1-40 will be assigned as either WLSCC or&#xD;
      UC. The interventionist will call the caregiver at the scheduled first session. Before the&#xD;
      first call ends, schedules for calls 2 to 6 will be established with the caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All follow-up data will be collected by phone. Follow-up data collection for T2 will be on&#xD;
      the date of the last phone call for the WLSCC group and 3 weeks after consent was obtained in&#xD;
      the UC group. T3 data will be collected two weeks after T2 data were collected in the WLSCC&#xD;
      group and five weeks after consent in the UC group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis &amp; Statistical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to detail recruitment/retention rate, fidelity rate, and&#xD;
      the baseline demographic and clinical characteristics for the total sample and each group.&#xD;
      For each caregiver and patient outcome measure, descriptive statistics will be calculated at&#xD;
      baseline and at each follow-up. Plots of the individual trajectories (within-person scores&#xD;
      over time) will be used to identify the pattern(s) of change over time, and assess&#xD;
      between-person variability in baseline values (intercepts) and trajectories&#xD;
      (slopes).Hierarchical mixed-effects models will be used to delineate and summarize trends and&#xD;
      relationships in the data while nesting for dyads. This pilot study will focus on estimating&#xD;
      effective size for WLSCC rather than statistical significance testing dues to the exploratory&#xD;
      nature of the pilot study. When statistical testing is conducted, non-directional tests will&#xD;
      be performed with level of significance set at 0.10.&#xD;
