  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Measles is a preventable infectious viral disease. Since 1985, India has been administering a&#xD;
      single dose of measles vaccine to all infants at 9 months of age. This age was chosen to&#xD;
      balance the disappearance of maternal (transplacental) antibodies with the increasing risk of&#xD;
      developing measles. Thus infants are expected to get protection against measles by acquired&#xD;
      maternal measles antibodies derived trans-placentally from the mother for the first 9 months&#xD;
      of life. Thereafter vaccine-induced antibodies are expected to protect infants.&#xD;
      Seroconversion after measles vaccination does not take place as long as maternal measles&#xD;
      antibodies persist in the infant. However, it is widely recognized that a substantial&#xD;
      proportion of measles infection (10 to 15%) can occur among infants before the age of measles&#xD;
      vaccination. Further, two small cohort studies done in our institution confirm that the&#xD;
      majority of infants lose maternal antibodies by six months of age, making them susceptible to&#xD;
      measles.This argues strongly for anticipating measles vaccination to an earlier age. However,&#xD;
      such early vaccination has the risk that residual maternal antibodies (even if insufficient&#xD;
      to protect infants) can neutralize the antigen in the vaccine, rendering vaccination&#xD;
      ineffective. Therefore, a careful balance has to be chosen so that low levels of circulating&#xD;
      maternal antibodies do not interfere with infants' response to vaccination. However, there is&#xD;
      no prospective study in Indian infants to determine the seroconversion and sero-protection&#xD;
      rate of earlier vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has following aims and objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the level of measles specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in a cohort of&#xD;
           term infants followed from birth to 9 months of age; and the pattern of antibody decline&#xD;
           in them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the levels of antibodies in infants at these time points and correlate the&#xD;
           levels with the antibody level in the respective mothers at the time of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the efficacy and safety of three different measles vaccination schedules in a&#xD;
           cohort of term infants viz (i) vaccination at 9 months of age (current practice), (ii)&#xD;
           vaccination at 7.5 months and 9 months of age, and (iii) vaccination at 6 months and 9&#xD;
           months of age.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two design components viz.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prospective enrollment of a cohort of term infants at birth; and 3 monthly follow-up at&#xD;
           the ages of 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization at 6 months of age to three intervention groups viz (i) measles&#xD;
           vaccination at 9 months of age (as per current practice), (ii) vaccination at 7.5 months&#xD;
           and 9 months of age, and (iii) vaccination at 6 months and 9 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women awaiting delivery in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology will be&#xD;
      screened for eligibility (as per the Inclusion and Exclusion criteria). Women whose infants&#xD;
      are likely to be eligible for participation in the study will be explained about the nature&#xD;
      and purpose of the study prior to delivery. They will be informed about the study protocol&#xD;
      and invited to participate. After delivery, mothers and their respective newborn babies, will&#xD;
      be enrolled with written, informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A brief interview will be conducted to determine history of exanthematous illness suffered in&#xD;
      the past by the mother, family history of similar illness and vaccinations received by her.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At delivery, approximately 1 ml of cord blood from the infant's side will be collected in a&#xD;
      sterile plastic screw-capped container, labeled and transported to the laboratory. Similarly&#xD;
      1 ml of venous blood will be obtained from the mother in a sterile plastic screw-capped&#xD;
      container, labeled and transported to the laboratory. Serum will be separated from these&#xD;
      samples by centrifugation and deep frozen at minus 20 degree C until analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The infants will be followed-up and undergo venipuncture under aseptic precautions to&#xD;
      withdraw 0.8-1.0 ml blood at five further visits viz. 3 months±2 weeks [corresponding to a&#xD;
      visit for 2nd/3rd dose of diphtheria- pertussis- tetanus (DPT) vaccine and live oral&#xD;
      poliovirus vaccine(OPV)], 6 months±2 weeks (corresponding to visit for 3rd dose of Hepatitis&#xD;
      B at 6 months of age), 7.5 months ±2 weeks, at 9 months ±2 weeks (corresponding to visit for&#xD;
      measles vaccine as per the current schedule), and at 12 ± 2 weeks months of age&#xD;
      (corresponding to visit for routine follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the follow-up visit at 6 months of age, infants will be randomized (as described&#xD;
      below) to one of three groups viz: Group A: vaccination at 6 months and 9 months of age;&#xD;
      Group B: vaccination at 7.5 months and 9 months of age; and Group C: vaccination at 9 months&#xD;
      of age (current practice).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generation of random sequence: A computer programme will be used to generate a random number&#xD;
      sequence to allocate participants into three groups in a ratio of 1:1:1, as per the Groups&#xD;
      described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation concealment: The allocation of each infant will be placed in sealed, opaque&#xD;
      envelopes. For each infant presenting at six months of age, one envelope will be marked with&#xD;
      the infant's name and then opened. At this stage, the sealed envelopes will contain one of&#xD;
      two options viz (i) Vaccination at 6 months or (ii) No vaccination at 6 months. Those who&#xD;
      receive the former will follow the protocol for Group A described below. Those who receive&#xD;
      the latter will be followed-up at 7.5 months of age; at which stage a second set of sealed&#xD;
      enveloped will be accessed. One envelope will be marked with the infant's name and then&#xD;
      opened. At this stage, the sealed envelopes will contain one of two options viz (i)&#xD;
      Vaccination at 7.5 months or (ii) Vaccination at 9 months. Those who receive the former will&#xD;
      follow the protocol for Group B described below; and those who receive the latter will follow&#xD;
      the protocol for Group C described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: In this randomized trial design, no attempt will be made to blind the infants being&#xD;
      randomized, or their parents (in order to avoid unnecessary injections through a double dummy&#xD;
      design). The investigator involved in randomizing the infants will also not be blinded.&#xD;
      However, the laboratory personnel performing the antibody level measurements will be blinded&#xD;
      by sending the samples with only a four digit code that does not reveal the intervention&#xD;
      received.Samples during any visit will be withdrawn prior to administration of vaccine(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measles vaccine will be administered as per the protocol described above by trained personnel&#xD;
      in the Immunization Room of the Advanced Pediatrics Center. A standard dose of the available&#xD;
      preparation will be administered in the dosage of 0.5 ml through the subcutaneous route.&#xD;
      Standard post-vaccination precaution viz observation of the infant for 30 minutes after&#xD;
      vaccination will be done to observe for any adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit history will be elicited to detect clinical features compatible with measles in&#xD;
      the baby or any other member of the family in the household contact. This includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any person in whom a clinician suspects measles infection, or Any person with fever and&#xD;
      maculopapular rash (i.e. non-vesicular) and cough, coryza (i.e. runny nose) or conjunctivitis&#xD;
      (i.e. red eyes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigator will make a monthly telephone call to the family of enrolled&#xD;
      infants asking for specific history compatible with the World Health Organization (WHO) case&#xD;
      definition for measles, in the infant or any household member. In case such history is&#xD;
      elicited, the infant and affected individual will be invited for clinical examination and a&#xD;
      sample of blood will be obtained. Serum will be separated as described and immunoglobulin M&#xD;
      (IgM) anti-measles antibody will be measured using commercially available ELISA kits as&#xD;
      described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each vaccination, parents of vaccinated infants will be requested to complete a Diary&#xD;
      for three days, containing a daily record of (i) excessive crying, (ii) poor feeding, (iii)&#xD;
      fever, (iv) redness at injection site, (v) swelling at injection site (vi)&#xD;
      tenderness/apparent pain at injection site, and (vii) any other unusual behavior/appearance&#xD;
      in the infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory processing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clotted blood samples will be centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes to obtain serum which&#xD;
      will be frozen at -20 degree Celsius till tested. Serum will be processed in batches of 30-40&#xD;
      and measles specific IgG antibodies will be quantified by micro-ELISA (enzyme linked&#xD;
      immunosorbent assay) using commercially available quantitative measles IgG kits of high&#xD;
      sensitivity (98-100%) and specificity (100%). IgM antibody assay will be done to confirm the&#xD;
      diagnosis of measles only in those infants suspected to have measles; using commercially&#xD;
      available quantitative measles IgG kits of high sensitivity (98-100%) and specificity (100%).&#xD;
      Sera from subjects, calibrators, positive and negative controls will be diluted in serum&#xD;
      diluents and test will be performed as recommended by the manufacturers. The obtained optical&#xD;
      density value for each sample will be converted into measles antibody titre in units/ml with&#xD;
      help of calibrator values in a standard log graph paper and these units/ml will then be&#xD;
      interpreted as International Units/ml taking the recommendation in the kit.&#xD;
