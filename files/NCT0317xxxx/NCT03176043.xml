  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether participants who are dictating their own&#xD;
      administration of IV fluid boluses in response to thirst, receive better protection from&#xD;
      hypovolaemia and volume overload than those who undergo routine fluid management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirst is prominent in critically ill patients and is related to dehydration. In a recent&#xD;
      study of the symptoms experience in ITU patients at high risk of dying, the sensation of&#xD;
      thirst was reported in 70.8% of assessments made and was considered to be one of the most&#xD;
      intense stressors. Thirst and dehydration can be combated in an ITU setting by consuming oral&#xD;
      fluids and through administration of intravenous fluids. However, in older adults, frailty&#xD;
      and dysphagia reduces patients' capability to access fluid and results in thirst. In&#xD;
      addition, the administration of IV fluids is determined by the attending physician and is&#xD;
      often only re-evaluated on a daily or twice-daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Quench machine has been designed to allow the patient to have more control over their&#xD;
      oral and IV fluid administration protocol. This may help reduce the sensation of thirst and&#xD;
      dehydration in patients. The machinery is an automated fluid delivery system that will&#xD;
      administer a given bolus of IV fluid in response to a trigger provided by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current study is to examine the physiological basis for the functional&#xD;
      benefit of this Quench system by investigating the effectiveness of the thirst response in&#xD;
      healthy humans as a guide for administration of intravenous fluid boluses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore this, the investigators have designed a randomised, cross-over study. On one visit&#xD;
      IV fluid boluses will be administered as per the participants' request in response to thirst.&#xD;
      In the second arm of the study participants will be administered routine IV fluid maintenance&#xD;
      as per NICE guidelines. Body mass at the end of a 4 hour fluid administration intervention&#xD;
      will be our primary research outcome and will be compared between the two arms of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From this comparison the investigators hope to show that a patient would be able to&#xD;
      accurately manage their level of hydration, both in terms of correcting dehydration and&#xD;
      avoiding fluid overload. It is thought that avoiding states of fluid imbalance can reduce&#xD;
      post surgical recovery times, reduce the incidence of post operative complications and avoid&#xD;
      critical complications of fluid imbalance, such as acute kidney injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether participant dictated fluid bolus&#xD;
      administration in response to their symptom of experienced thirst is a viable basis to guide&#xD;
      a clinical practice of fluid maintenance and correction of hydration status. To this end the&#xD;
      experiment will compare the implementation of this fluid maintenance mechanism on volume&#xD;
      depleted healthy participants to a program of routine fluid maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis is that the hydration state of the participants, as measured by change in&#xD;
      body weight and plasma osmolality, will be no better corrected and managed by a thirst&#xD;
      dictated management system than by routine maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a cross-over design, used to ensure differences in hydration status, or lack&#xD;
      there of, can be attributed to the methods of fluid administration in question, without&#xD;
      differences between individuals confounding the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be required to attend the laboratory on two occasions for approximately&#xD;
      5 hours each visit, for arm A and B of the study. The two visits will be separated by 7 to 14&#xD;
      days. On each visit standard IV fluids will be administered The evening before each visit&#xD;
      participants will be required to take 40mg of the water tablet called furosemide and refrain&#xD;
      from drinking fluids. This is used in order to dehydrate the participant and reduce body mass&#xD;
      by between 2 - 4%. The participant needs to be dehydrated in order to promote a thirst&#xD;
      response so that the interventions can be studied in a cohort of participants representative&#xD;
      of hypovolemic patients post surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      On both visits an indwelling cannula will be placed into a vein in the participants' arm, to&#xD;
      administer IV fluid on the participants' non dominant side. Before fluid administration this&#xD;
      will be used to draw a blood sample for plasma osmolality measurements. A second blood sample&#xD;
      with be drawn from a vein on the opposite arm following the fluid infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For arm A: the participant will request the administration of 200ml boluses of IV fluid at&#xD;
      any point that they experience thirst. This administration will be limited to one bolus every&#xD;
      15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For arm B: participants will receive routine fluid maintenance as dictated by the NICE&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During both trials, low intensity exercise will be permitted (walking, standing, sitting)&#xD;
      although high intensity exercise is not allowed. Entertainment in the form of a computer with&#xD;
      internet access and DVDs will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The arm of the study the patient will undergo in the first week will be determined according&#xD;
      to a randomised list. However, due to the nature of the investigation the arm of the study be&#xD;
      undergone by the patient can not be blinded from the researchers or participant. All&#xD;
      measurements, except the perception of thirst questioning, are objective measures, such as&#xD;
      weight, plasma osmolality, haematocrit and blood sodium levels. This will minimise any&#xD;
      researcher bias.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects who are self administering fluid will be instructed when (at any point in the experiment) they are experiencing thirst to request a fluid bolus with an electronic trigger. In response to this trigger the researcher will then deliver a 200ml bolus of IV fluid. After delivery of the fluid bolus, a lockout period is set for 15mins within which the researcher will not deliver another bolus in response to the trigger.</description>
