  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the last two years, the United States has witnessed enormous change concerning the&#xD;
      acceptance of marijuana. The number of persons with MS (PwMS) using cannabis to treat their&#xD;
      symptoms is expected to rise, and it is important to provide clinicians and PwMS with&#xD;
      evidence based information on the safety and effectiveness of marijuana. In addition,&#xD;
      scientists need to identify the effects of medical marijuana as the compound action of&#xD;
      different cannabinoids, specifically tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). The&#xD;
      ratio of CBD to THC may have an important impact on the effects of the marijuana, which in&#xD;
      turn may have important implications for the medical benefits. The overarching goal of this&#xD;
      study is to advance a better understanding of the potential positive and negative effects&#xD;
      associated with different strains of marijuana, using an interventional design. The&#xD;
      investigators will examine three strains that differ markedly on THC potency (A. THC &lt;1%, CBD&#xD;
      &gt; 10%; B. THC &gt;10%, CBD &lt; 1%; C. THC 510%, CBD 510%) to determine whether the level of THC is&#xD;
      associated with differences in motor and cognitive functions in PwMS. One hundred PwMS will&#xD;
      be recruited for this project and followed for 3 months following designation to one of three&#xD;
      strains of marijuana with different ratios of CBD to THC or a placebo marijuana (THC 0%, CBD&#xD;
      0%). It is hypothesized that the strains with a high CBD to THC ratios will demonstrate the&#xD;
      most benefits on measures of motor and cognitive function.&#xD;

      Prospective participants will be recruited from the Integrative Neurophysiology Laboratory's&#xD;
      (INPL) participant database, the clinical practice of Dr. William Shaffer, Banner Health,&#xD;
      Greeley Colorado, through advertisements in the Colorado and Wyoming Chapter of the National&#xD;
      MS Society newsletters, and via the Rocky Mountain MS Newsletter. All experimental procedures&#xD;
      will be performed in the INPL (Director: Thorsten Rudroff, PhD, FACSM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interested individuals will perform an initial screening via an online questionnaire, hosted&#xD;
      by Qualtrics, which has a contract with the College of Health and Human Sciences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contact information for the prospective participants will be accessible only to the research&#xD;
      staff according to HIPAA regulations. After completion of the online screening form, INPL&#xD;
      personnel will contact eligible participants via phone and establish 100 total participants.&#xD;
      After participants have been identified, INPL staff will schedule the participants' first&#xD;
      visit. Eligibility requirements for this study are: medically diagnosed with MS, 21-74 years&#xD;
      of age, and moderate disability (Patient Determined Disease Steps score 2-6). The&#xD;
      investigators will recruit people with MS who are planning to use medical marijuana for the&#xD;
      first time for the treatment of their symptoms. All participants must have a medical (red)&#xD;
      card for medical marijuana use to treat their MS symptoms (such as neuropathic pain and&#xD;
      spasticity), or currently be in the process of applying for a red card and be able to provide&#xD;
      the prescription from their doctor. Marijuana and placebo cigarettes will be ordered from the&#xD;
      NIDA (National Institute on Drug Abuse) Drug Supply Program and stored at a designated room&#xD;
      in the Department of Health and Exercise Science (HES) at Colorado State University (CSU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental protocol for this study consists of one testing session that will be&#xD;
      performed four times:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once before the assignment of marijuana product and then once a month during this 3 month&#xD;
      longitudinal study. All experiments will be conducted by research personnel (outcome&#xD;
      assessors) who are blinded to product assignment. Prior to each session the clinical trial&#xD;
      administrator (CTA) will perform an urine analysis assessment for Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol&#xD;
      (THC) to confirm compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival to the Integrative Neurophysiology Lab (INPL) at CSU the investigators will&#xD;
      explain the protocol procedures and receive signed informed consent from the participants.&#xD;
      All eligible participants will be randomized to a coded treatment group by the CTA. After the&#xD;
      urine analysis assessment, they will be given one of the four coded cannabis products. All&#xD;
      participants will be asked to smoke one single 1- gram marijuana or placebo cigarette per day&#xD;
      (Hart et al. 2010). Because these are newly marijuana users, they will be informed about the&#xD;
      practical and legal limitations, including barriers to travelling with the medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to return to the lab biweekly for their next set of dosages of&#xD;
      coded intervention, as coded and dispensed by the CTA. By providing the participants with&#xD;
      additional intervention doses intervention compliance can be determined at the biweekly&#xD;
      visits by the CTA. Participants will also be given a log to track their cannabis product use.&#xD;
      It is expected that the testing session (once / month) will last between 2-3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MONTHLY ASSESSMENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood draw with sodium heparin at the beginning of the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Questionnaires: Participants will complete several questionnaires: Fatigue Severity&#xD;
           Scale (FSS), Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI), the MS Quality of Life (MSQOL)-54&#xD;
           Instrument, and the MOS Pain Effects Scale (PES).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The next task will be a Dual Task (walking task and cognitive task) (Etemadi, 2016).&#xD;
           Subjects will continuously walk for 60 seconds at a preferred speed along a 10 m walk&#xD;
           way. The walking velocity will be calculated. During the walking task the participants&#xD;
           will be required to make mathematical subtractions of 7 from random numbers between 200&#xD;
           to100. Responses will be recorded using a voice recorder. The score will be calculated&#xD;
           as: correct response rate (CRR) = response rate per second × % of correct responses. The&#xD;
           CRR had acceptable reliability (ICC = 0.61-0.75) in patients with multiple sclerosis&#xD;
           (Ghanavati et al. 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Participants will perform the MS Functional Composite (MSFC) which consists of a 25 foot&#xD;
           walk test (25FWT), the 9 hole peg test (9HPT), and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition&#xD;
           Test (PASAT). For the 25FWT participants will be asked to walk 25 feet as quickly, but&#xD;
           as safely as possible. This will be performed in an isolated hallway with the length&#xD;
           clearly marked. Participants will begin after a short count down and the time it takes&#xD;
           to walk 25 feet will be measured with a handheld stop watch. Two trials of the 25FWT&#xD;
           will be performed and INPL staff will walk alongside the participants to minimize the&#xD;
           risk of falling. Next, the 9HPT will be performed. Participants will begin with their&#xD;
           dominant hand and quickly move 9 cylindrical plastic pegs from a concave dish into 9&#xD;
           holes. Pegs will be placed in the holes 1 at a time and once all pegs are in a hole the&#xD;
           participants will remove the pegs and return them to the dish. Each hand will be tested&#xD;
           twice and the time of completion will be recorded with a handheld stop watch. The PASAT&#xD;
           will be performed after the 9HPT to test cognitive function. This test consists of the&#xD;
           playback of a series of pre-recorded numbers spoken on a computer. The participants are&#xD;
           asked to add the last two spoken numbers which occur every three seconds for a 3 minute&#xD;
           period of time. The number of correct answers is recorded by the test moderator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Next the Isometric Strength of the knee extensors, knee flexors, plantar flexors, and&#xD;
           dorsi-flexors will be measured. The participants will perform the strength tests from a&#xD;
           seated position with the knee and hip joints at 90 degrees flexion. When testing ankle&#xD;
           strength, the ankle will be at 90 degrees. Once participants are in the proper position&#xD;
           they will be attached to a linear force transducer. Participants will slowly increase&#xD;
           the force of the muscle group being tested for 3 sec from 0 to maximum. They will be&#xD;
           instructed to produce maximum force for 3 seconds and then relax. Each muscle group will&#xD;
           be tested at minimum 3 times. Testing will end when either there is a decrease in force&#xD;
           between the last 2 trials performed or the force produced is less than 5% of the&#xD;
           previous trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Once a month the investigators will visit each participant at their home. Prior to the&#xD;
           visit, the participant will inform the investigators about the timing of their smoking&#xD;
           to ensure that the blood draw with sodium heparin will occur no later than 15 min after&#xD;
           smoking to ensure measurable THC, THC metabolites, CBD and CBN (cannabinol) levels.&#xD;
           Blood THC, CBD and CBN content, along with THC phase I metabolites 11-OH-THC (active&#xD;
           11-hydroxy-THC) and THC-COOH (inactive 11-nor-9- carboxy-THC) will be determined using&#xD;
           liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in the Department of Chemistry under the&#xD;
           direction of Dr. Denef. These values will inform on the participant's blood cannabinoid&#xD;
           profile and the relative contents of non-psychoactive CBD and CBN versus psychoactive&#xD;
           THC and its metabolites. Importantly, at each home session, participants will be asked&#xD;
           about adverse effects and allergies related to marijuana.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRE-POST ASSESSMENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry scan will be performed to assess body composition before&#xD;
      and during the last month of the 3-month intervention for a total of 2 scans. Furthermore,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to wear an ActiGraph accelerometer for 7 days to measure physical&#xD;
      activity before and during the last month of the intervention. During non-wear times,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to write any activities performed in a log.&#xD;
