  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of escalating&#xD;
      doses of Basis following twice daily oral administration in patients with acute kidney injury&#xD;
      (AKI). Basis is a commercially available nutritional supplement consisting of nicotinamide&#xD;
      riboside (NR) and pterostilbene that acts to increase sirtuin activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common, growing in incidence, and associated with significant&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Sirtuins are anti-aging enzymes that play a diverse role in cellular&#xD;
      energy metabolism and gene regulation. Mice deficient in SIRT1 are more susceptible to&#xD;
      developing AKI and sirtuin activation is a potential treatment for AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, stepwise study of escalating doses of&#xD;
      Basis (NR/pterostilbene) in patients with AKI. The study will potentially comprise up to four&#xD;
      Steps. The purpose of the stepwise approach is to identify the dose of Basis that achieves at&#xD;
      least a 50% and up to 100% increase in white blood cell (WBC) content of nicotinamide adenine&#xD;
      dinucleotide (NAD+) without side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each Step, Basis (5 patients) or placebo (1 patient) will be given twice a day for 2&#xD;
      days. Patients will have frequent blood sampling performed for a 24 hour period following&#xD;
      dosing on Day 1 and then at 48 hr. The measurements in blood will include NR/pterostilbene&#xD;
      blood concentrations and NAD+ and NAAD (nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide) concentrations&#xD;
      in WBCs.&#xD;
