  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well bevacizumab and atezolizumab with or without cobimetinib&#xD;
      work in treating patients with untreated melanoma that has spread to the brain (brain&#xD;
      metastases). Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab and atezolizumab, may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Cobimetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells&#xD;
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known if giving&#xD;
      bevacizumab and atezolizumab with or without cobimetinib will work better in treating&#xD;
      patients with melanoma brain metastases.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the objective intracranial response rate of the combination of bevacizumab&#xD;
      and atezolizumab in patients with active melanoma brain metastases (MBM) as measured by a&#xD;
      modified immunotherapy Response Assessment in Neuro-oncology (iRANO) criteria measured by&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of the triplet combination&#xD;
      of atezolizumab (Tencentriq), bevacizumab (Avastin), and cobimetinib (Cotellic). (TACo)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Safety and tolerability of bevacizumab + atezolizumab. II. Safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
      combination of atezolizumab + bevacizumab + cobimetinib in patients with BRAFV600 wild-type&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma to the brain who've experienced prior progression on anti-PD1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Overall response rates (intracranial + extracranial) using a modified version of iRANO&#xD;
      and compared to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1&#xD;
      and Response Assessment in Neuro-oncology - Brain Metastases (RANO-BM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Duration of response intracranially and extracranially. V. Progression-free survival. VI.&#xD;
      Overall survival. VII. Immune modulation. VIII. Changes in circulating cell free&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) as determinants of response and markers of early progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. Changes in relative apparent diffusion coefficient as measured by MRI as early predictor&#xD;
      of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. Changes in neurocognitive function and health-related quality of life. XI. Molecular and&#xD;
      immunological changes demonstrated in extracranial lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes and bevacizumab IV&#xD;
      over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes and bevacizumab IV over 30-90&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Cycles with atezolizumab and bevacizumab repeat every 14 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive cobimetinib&#xD;
      orally (PO) thrice daily (TID) on days 1-21. Cycles with cobimetinib repeat every 28 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 90 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months thereafter.&#xD;
