      A randomized phase II study comparing the sequential use of abiraterone followed after&#xD;
      progression by apalutamide with alternating cycles of abiraterone and apalutamide&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized phase II study to investigate the feasibility of&#xD;
      alternating cycles of treatment with abiraterone plus prednisone and apalutamide compared to&#xD;
      sequential treatment of abiratereone plus prednisone followed by apalutamide. 7 centers in&#xD;
      Greece will participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population consists of adult patients (over 18 years old) with histologically&#xD;
      confirmed metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma who have disease progression - as defined by&#xD;
      PCWG2 criteria - despite androgen deprivation therapy and who have not received prior therapy&#xD;
      for their castration resistant disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to determine the progression free survival, feasibility and&#xD;
      safety profile of the experimental arm compared to standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the experimental arm alternating treatment will consist of repeating cycles of 24 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment consisting of 12 weeks of abiraterone acetate 1000mg orally qd and prednisone 5mg&#xD;
      orally bid, followed by 12 weeks of apalutamide 240 mg per day. There will be no wash out&#xD;
      period between cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparative arm will be the standard regimen of abiraterone 1000mg orally qd plus&#xD;
      prednisone 5mg orally bid until progression, followed thereafter by apalutamide 240mg orally&#xD;
      qd until progression.&#xD;
