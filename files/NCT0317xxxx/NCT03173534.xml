      To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the left atrial appendage occlusion with WATCHMAN&#xD;
      Device in prevention of stroke and bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF)&#xD;
      undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).&#xD;

      WATCH-TAVR is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial. Only centers with&#xD;
      approval for commercial WATCHMAN implantation will be included in this trial. Subjects will&#xD;
      be enrolled at up to 32 centers in the United States. There will be up to 350 subjects&#xD;
      enrolled, with 175 patients randomized to TAVR + medical therapy and 175 patients randomized&#xD;
      to simultaneous TAVR+WATCHMAN to accumulate the necessary 191 primary events. Enrollment is&#xD;
      expected to occur over the course of 18 months. Patients will be followed for a total of 2&#xD;
      years. Patients with non-valvular AF undergoing standard of care commercial TAVR will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who receive the WATCHMAN device, plan of care will follow WATCHMAN&#xD;
      labeling.Patients randomized to receive the WATCHMAN device will receive anticoagulation with&#xD;
      warfarin and aspirin for 6 weeks after the procedure. After 6 weeks, the plan of care will&#xD;
      follow WATCHMAN labeling. Patients randomized to the TAVR + medical therapy arm will be&#xD;
      treated in accordance with standard of care with either warfarin, other&#xD;
      anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy, or no anticoagulation at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      physician. All patients will continue to receive routine post-TAVR follow-up and&#xD;
      care.Patients will be monitored for primary and secondary endpoints as outlined. Baseline&#xD;
      information and laboratory data will be collected as described in the protocol.&#xD;

    <description>Change from baseline in quality of life (QoL) as measured using the KCCQ-12 score. Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ-12) is a validated tool used to assess heart failure and how it affects the participant's life. Four domain scores and one summary score are generated from the KCCQ-12: Physical Limitation Score, Symptom Frequency Score, Quality of Life Score, Social Limitation Score and a Summary Score. Scale ranges for each question 1 to 6 (Extremely limited 1, Quite a bit limited 2, Moderately limited 3, Slightly limited 4, Not at all limited 5, Limited for other reasons or did not do the activity 6. The Summary score represents an integration of the patient's physical limitation, symptom frequency, quality of life and social limitation. The score is calculated as the average. Scores are scaled 0-100, where 0 denotes the lowest reportable health status and 100 the highest</description>
