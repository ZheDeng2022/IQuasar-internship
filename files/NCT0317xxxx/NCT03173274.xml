  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of a mobile-phone based&#xD;
      contingency management (CM) intervention for smoking in low-SES women. The CM intervention&#xD;
      will be combined with a Brief Motivational Interviewing (BMI) counseling component. This&#xD;
      study will examine the following research aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim: To compare the effects of a Brief Motivational Intervention (BMI) + mobile&#xD;
      phone-based CM on tobacco use when compared to BMI with a non-contingent control condition in&#xD;
      a small feasibility trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators expect women in the BMI + CM condition to have more smoke free&#xD;
      days than women in the BMI + NC condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim: To examine alcohol use as a moderator of cessation outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, accounting&#xD;
      for one out of every five deaths (CDC, 2012). In particular, smoking prevalence rates are&#xD;
      high among socioeconomically-disadvantaged women; for example, over 40% of women with less&#xD;
      than 12 yrs education smoke, compared to 28% and 16% among those with some college and&#xD;
      undergraduate degrees (SAMHSA, 2010). Smoking cessation rates are particularly low among&#xD;
      low-SES women with co-occurring alcohol use disorders, and these substances are frequently&#xD;
      used together (Kahler et al., 2010; Businelle et al., 2013). Therefore, interventions that&#xD;
      reduce both alcohol and smoking among heavy alcohol-using women are vitally needed to reduce&#xD;
      rates of smoking-related morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Counseling approaches that incorporate problem solving, skills training and social support&#xD;
      are effective for reducing smoking in the general population (Fiore et al., 2008). However,&#xD;
      given the high rates of smoking among alcohol-using women, they may be inadequate for in this&#xD;
      population. Contingency management (CM) interventions, which provide tangible reinforcers&#xD;
      contingent upon smoking abstinence or reduction to a criterion level, are highly-efficacious&#xD;
      interventions for reducing cigarette smoking and other drug use in low-SES women (Higgins et&#xD;
      al., 2012). Within the theoretical framework of operant conditioning, increasing the&#xD;
      availability of an alternative reinforcer weakens the amount of control that the drug has&#xD;
      over the user's behavior, especially when obtaining the alternative reinforcer is contingent&#xD;
      on behaviors incompatible with drug use (Higgins, 1997). The tenets of CM interventions&#xD;
      include (1) arranging the environment such that the target behavior can be readily and&#xD;
      objectively detected, (2) providing a tangible reinforcer when the target behavior occurs,&#xD;
      and (3) withholding reinforcement when the target behavior does not occur (Higgins et al.,&#xD;
      1994).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although CM interventions clearly are effective at promoting smoking reductions, there are&#xD;
      several challenges associated with translating CM into an effective clinical treatment for&#xD;
      smoking. Perhaps the most significant challenge is the frequent monitoring necessary to&#xD;
      objectively verify smoking abstinence using breath carbon monoxide (CO), the most convenient&#xD;
      objective measure of smoking status. Because of the short half-life of CO (5-6 hours), CO&#xD;
      levels must be measured at least twice per day in order to verify continuous abstinence.&#xD;
      Recent CM-smoking studies have addressed this feasibility challenge by providing study&#xD;
      participants with breath CO monitors and laptop computers or smartphones to use in their own&#xD;
      natural environments (e.g., Dallery, Raiff &amp; Grabinski, 2013). Participants are taught how to&#xD;
      use their smartphones to text videos of themselves providing a breath CO level to a research&#xD;
      staff member, twice per day. After the study staff has determined that the breath CO sample&#xD;
      meets the abstinence criterion, participants are informed of the amount that they have earned&#xD;
      for that sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the high rates of smoking in low-SES women, investigating the additive impact of an&#xD;
      in-person brief counseling intervention and a phone-based CM intervention is an important&#xD;
      next step in examining effective methods to reduce the impact of smoking in this population.&#xD;
