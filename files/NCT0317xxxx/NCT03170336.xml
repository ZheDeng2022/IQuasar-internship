  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in China is about 10.8%,and nearly&#xD;
      120 million people suffer from CKD, which has become a serious public health problem in&#xD;
      China. Study confirmed that proteinuria is an independent risk factor for the continuous&#xD;
      deterioration of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in patients with CKD. So it is of great&#xD;
      significance to explore the strategy of reducing proteinuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to our previous study, Amiloride can inhibit the expression of uPAR in podocytes&#xD;
      and reduce proteinuria, This clinical trial aims to evaluate the effect and safety of&#xD;
      Amiloride in decreasing proteinuria for patients with Chronic Kidney Disease.&#xD;

      Amiloride is a Na+ channel blocker and has been used as a diuretic. It mainly inhibits the&#xD;
      exchange of Na+-K+ and Na+-H+ in the distal tubule and collecting duct of the kidney, thus&#xD;
      increasing the excretion of Na+ and water, reducing the excretion of K+ and H+. Recent&#xD;
      studies have found a significant increase in urine uPA in patients with massive&#xD;
      proteinuria.Urine uPA concentration were positively correlated with urinary protein and&#xD;
      decreased with remission of proteinuria. In children and adults with nephrotic syndrome,as&#xD;
      well as rat with proteinuria induced by puromycin amino-nucleoside, amiloride can inhibit uPA&#xD;
      concentration in urine, which may be one of the mechanisms of amiloride in reducing&#xD;
      proteinuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective , crossover, open-Label study. All patients need to be on an&#xD;
      angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) daily&#xD;
      at least four weeks prior to the study. The baseline data would be recorded. Patients&#xD;
      enrolled will receive either amiloride or hydrochlorothiazide first for 8&#xD;
      weeks.Hydrochlorothiazide, a similar diuretic as amiloride, but not inhibiting urokinase&#xD;
      plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), will be used as a control. Then the patients will&#xD;
      discontinue amiloride or hydrochlorothiazide for a washout for 4 weeks, but continue with the&#xD;
      ACE inhibitor or ARB. After that patients will cross over to receive another medication for&#xD;
      another 8 weeks. We aim to evaluate the effect and safety of Amiloride in decreasing&#xD;
      proteinuria for patients with chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
