  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate changes in biomarkers of exposure (BOE) to&#xD;
      tobacco smoke constituents after smokers switch from combustible cigarettes to use of one of&#xD;
      the three electronic cigarettes or abstinence.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a two-center, randomized, controlled, switching, open-label, parallel cohort&#xD;
      study. The study will compare biomarkers of tobacco exposure from subjects at baseline levels&#xD;
      of biomarkers of tobacco exposure after they have switched to one of three electronic&#xD;
      cigarettes or abstinence for 5 days.&#xD;
