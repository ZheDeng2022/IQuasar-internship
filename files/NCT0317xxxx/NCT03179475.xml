  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be investigating the effectiveness of oxycodone-naloxone (brand name Targin®)&#xD;
      at treating chronic pain in individuals with spinal cord injury. The goal of the study is to&#xD;
      compare the effectiveness of Targin® at treating chronic pain in individuals with sub-acute&#xD;
      and chronic spinal cord injury compared to opioid medication that is not compounded with&#xD;
      naloxone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, open-label prospective cohort study investigating Targin® for treating&#xD;
      chronic pain in individuals with sub-acute and chronic spinal cord injuries. Targin® is&#xD;
      currently approved for use by Health Canada for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic&#xD;
      pain and will be investigated here for the management of moderate-to-severe chronic pain&#xD;
      following spinal cord injury. The effectiveness and safety of opioid use for individuals with&#xD;
      spinal cord injury has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Additionally, individuals with&#xD;
      spinal cord injury using opioids may have the superimposed effect of neurogenic bowel and&#xD;
      opioid induced constipation, which may cause increased frequency and severity of autonomic&#xD;
      dysreflexia episodes, reduced quality of life, depressive symptoms, and discontinuation of&#xD;
      opioid medication. Targin® has the potential to ameliorate these symptoms and improve&#xD;
      treatment adherence in individuals with spinal cord injury.&#xD;

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation and assessment of changes in neurogenic bowel and opioid-induced constipation is a secondary objective. Neurogenic bowel dysfunction, including constipation will be assessed using the evaluation tools &quot;Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction (NBD) score&quot;, the &quot;Patient Assessment of Constipation-Symptoms (PAC-SYM)&quot; score, and the &quot;Patient Assessment of Constipation- Quality of Life (PAC-QOL)&quot; score.&#xD;

Global autonomic function will be assessed with the neurological classification of spinal cord injury autonomic assessment form evaluation tool &quot;International Standards on documentation of remaining Autonomic Function after Spinal Cord Injury (ISAFSCI)&quot;.&#xD;
The secondary outcome measure is a change from baseline in ISAFSCI score at 8 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline of quality of life.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation and assessment of changes in quality of life is a secondary objective. Quality of life will be assessed with the evaluation tool &quot;Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)&quot;.&#xD;
The secondary outcome measure is a change from baseline in SF-36 QOL score at 8 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in depressive symptoms.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation and assessment of depressive symptoms is a secondary objective. Depressive symptoms will be assessed with the evaluation tool &quot;Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)&quot;.&#xD;
The secondary outcome measure is a change from baseline in PHQ-9 score at 8 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline of opioid side effects.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation and assessment of opioid side effects is a secondary objective. The measure will be incidence of side effect in those treated with the study drug.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline of opioid side effect cognitive function.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation and assessment of opioid side effects is a secondary objective. Cognitive function is of special interest to us; we will evaluate cognitive function using the evaluation tool &quot;Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale&quot;.&#xD;
The secondary outcome measure is a change from baseline in MoCA score at 8 weeks.</description>
