  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Its main purpose is to&#xD;
      investigate the effects and neural mechanism of Naoan dripping pills on migraine patients by&#xD;
      utilizing fMRI and DTI method, as well as headache evaluation measures such as responder&#xD;
      rate, headache duration, PRO scale, etc.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Naoan dripping pills, which is a Chinese patent medicine proved effectively in treating&#xD;
      migraine on clinic, but its neural mechanism remains unknown. This study is expected to&#xD;
      validate the effectiveness and explore its neural mechanism by fMRI and DTI so as to provide&#xD;
      evidence for physicians to promote the appropriate use of Naoan dripping pills treatment for&#xD;
      migraine patients. Patients will be randomly assigned to either Naoan dripping pills group or&#xD;
      placebo group, they will receive Naoan dripping pills/Placebo treatment for 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Clinical evaluation will be performed at baseline, every 4 weeks during treatment and the&#xD;
      follow-up week(16 weeks) . MRI scans are performed at baseline, and 12 weeks later. Responder&#xD;
      rate (defined as the percentage of subjects in a treatment group with 50 % or greater&#xD;
      reduction in attack frequency during treatment compared with the baseline period) and fMRI&#xD;
      and DTI imaging changes after treatment are defined as primary outcome. In addition, 10&#xD;
      healthy controls will also undergo MRI scanning at baseline to determine abnormal brain&#xD;
      activity and structure in migraine patients.&#xD;
