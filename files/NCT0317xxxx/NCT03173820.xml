  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is the most appropriated treatment in end stage renal failure patients&#xD;
      in order to improve quality of life. However, patients have to take immunosuppressive drugs&#xD;
      to prevent graft rejection. Tacrolimus is the most common immunosuppressive drug used now.&#xD;
      However, tacrolimus has narrow therapeutic level and needs regularly therapeutic monitor&#xD;
      because of inter-individual variation in dosage regimen. Not only age, body weight and drug&#xD;
      interaction but also genetic factor in metabolic pathway of tacrolimus plays an important&#xD;
      role in tacrolimus blood level. Previous data showed CYP3A5 genetic polymorphism was&#xD;
      significant effect tacrolimus blood level. From previous study showed the mean dose of&#xD;
      tacrolimus required for the induction phase was significantly higher (P= 0.006) in the&#xD;
      CYP3A5*1/*1 group at 0.142±0.050 mg/kg/day than that required by patients who carried either&#xD;
      the CYP3A5*1/*3 group of 0.097±0.040 mg/kg/day or the CYP3A5*3/*3 group of 0.077±0.020&#xD;
      mg/kg/day. Tacrolimus maintenance dose required for CYP3A5*1/*1 group of 0.12±0.03 mg/kg/day&#xD;
      was 1.3 times higher (P&lt;0.0001) than used for the CYP3A5*1/*3 at 0.09±0.03 mg/kg/day and 2.4&#xD;
      times higher than the CYP3A5*3/*3 group of 0.05±0.02 mg/kg/day. Therefore, the investigators&#xD;
      plan to investigate a prospective study to determine the clinical outcome of tacrolimus&#xD;
      treatment in kidney transplant recipients between genotype guided dosage regimen group and&#xD;
      conventional group.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the clinical outcome of tacrolimus treatment in kidney transplant&#xD;
           recipients between genotype guided dosage regimen group and conventional group&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the influence of CYP3A5 polymorphism on clinical outcome of kidney&#xD;
           transplantation recipients Review article Kidney transplantation is the most&#xD;
           appropriated treatment in end stage renal failure patients in order to improve quality&#xD;
           of life. National health security office of Thailand estimates the cost of kidney&#xD;
           transplantation around 250,000 to 400,000 baht per patient. However, patients have to&#xD;
           take immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, azathioprine,&#xD;
           mycophenolate, prednisolone etc. to prevent graft rejection. Tacrolimus is a common&#xD;
           immunosuppressive drug used worldwide. However, tacrolimus has narrow therapeutic level&#xD;
           and needs regularly therapeutic monitor because of inter-individual variation in dosage&#xD;
           regimen. Achieving and maintaining target concentration of tacrolimus are related to&#xD;
           tacrolimus toxicity and graft rejection. Not only age, body weight and drug interaction&#xD;
           but also genetic factor in metabolic pathway of tacrolimus plays an important role in&#xD;
           tacrolimus blood level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and CYP3A5 are the main enzyme responsible for metabolism of&#xD;
      tacrolimus. Unlike CYP3A4, CYP3A5 is more polymorphic and expression of enzyme is controlled&#xD;
      by CYP3A5 gene variants. CYP3A5*3, an A to G transition (A6986G) within intron 3 results in&#xD;
      the production of a truncated protein, is the most common allele variant. From previous study&#xD;
      of our group, the allele frequency of CYP3A5*3 was 66% which is lower than those reported in&#xD;
      the Caucasian population (85%). Prevalence of CYP3A5*1/*1, CYP3A5*1/*3, CYP3A5*3/*3 in 400&#xD;
      healthy Thai volunteers are 13.75%, 42.75% and 43.50%, respectively (unpublished data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who carried CYP3A5*1/*1 or CYP3A5*1/*3 allele showed tacrolimus clearance higher&#xD;
      than CYP3A5*3/*3 patients (0.679 ± 0.195 vs 0.355 ± 0.091 L/h/kg). Therefore, CYP3A5*3/*3&#xD;
      patients received 48% lower dose of tacrolimus than CYP3A5*1/*1 or CYP3A5*1/*3 patients in&#xD;
      order to achieve the same therapeutic range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From our previous study showed the mean dose of tacrolimus required for the induction phase&#xD;
      was significantly higher (P= 0.006) in the CYP3A5*1/*1 group at 0.142±0.050 mg/kg/day than&#xD;
      that required by patients who carried either the CYP3A5*1/*3 group of 0.097±0.040 mg/kg/day&#xD;
      or the CYP3A5*3/*3 group of 0.077±0.020 mg/kg/day. Tacrolimus maintenance dose required for&#xD;
      CYP3A5*1/*1 group of 0.12±0.03 mg/kg/day was 1.3 times higher (P&lt;0.0001) than used for the&#xD;
      CYP3A5*1/*3 at 0.09±0.03 mg/kg/day and 2.4 times higher than the CYP3A5*3/*3 group of&#xD;
      0.05±0.02 mg/kg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous prospective randomized study showed higher proportion of patients who received&#xD;
      genotype guided tacrolimus dosage regimen had achieved the target blood level at day 3 after&#xD;
      started tacrolimus than control group. This study did not show difference clinical outcome&#xD;
      between two groups and follow period was short, only three months. This study investigated&#xD;
      only in induction phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because most of studies investigated only in induction phase and follow up period was short.&#xD;
      The present study will conduct a randomized prospective study to evaluate whether adaption of&#xD;
      tacrolimus dosing according to CYP3A5 genotype in both induction and maintenance phase after&#xD;
      transplantation can achieve target concentration than control group. Moreover, the present&#xD;
      study will investigate the influence of CYP3A5 polymorphism on kidney transplant outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This prospective, open label, randomized study will conduct at Nephrology Unit,&#xD;
      Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand. This&#xD;
      study was approved by Khon Kaen University Research Ethics Committee for Human Research, Khon&#xD;
      Kaen University, Thailand (HE551389)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will randomly assigned to receive tacrolimus at either a fixed dosage&#xD;
      (conventional group) or genotype guided dosage group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Induction Phase (0-4 weeks) Patients who will be assigned in conventional group will&#xD;
           receive tacrolimus 0.1 mg/kg /day. Patients who will be in genotype guided group, will&#xD;
           receive tacrolimus depend on CYP3A5 genotype. CYP3A5*1/*1 patients will receive&#xD;
           tacrolimus 0.125 mg/kg/day. CYP3A5*1/*3 patients will receive tacrolimus 0.1 mg/kg/day.&#xD;
           CYP3A5*3/*3 patients will receive tacrolimus 0.08 mg/kg/day. Tacrolimus target level for&#xD;
           this phase will be 5-8 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Maintenance Phase (5-24 weeks) Patients who will be in conventional group, will receive&#xD;
           tacrolimus 0.08 mg/kg/day. Patients who will be in genotype guided group, will receive&#xD;
           tacrolimus depend on CYP3A5 genotype. CYP3A5*1/*1 patients will receive tacrolimus 0.12&#xD;
           mg/kg/day. CYP3A5*1/*3 patients will receive tacrolimus 0.08 mg/kg/day. CYP3A5*3/*3&#xD;
           patients will receive tacrolimus 0.04 mg/kg/day. Tacrolimus target level for this phase&#xD;
           will be 3-5 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Patients who perform kidney transplantation and enrolled to this study will randomly assign&#xD;
      in equal number to receive tacrolimus doses as in table 1, one hour before transplantation&#xD;
      and after transplantation. Tacrolimus blood level, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine (Cr),&#xD;
      will regularly perform on day 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 14 and 28 during induction phase (1st-4th week&#xD;
      after kidney transplantation). Moreover, urine 24 hour for Cr, protein will perform in day 7,&#xD;
      14, 28 after transplantation. The physicians will modify the daily dose of tacrolimus&#xD;
      according to their practice in order to achieve target range of trough concentration (5-8&#xD;
      ng/ml). Patients will receive other immunosuppressive such as corticosteroid, mycophenolate&#xD;
      mofetil as general practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During maintenance phase (5th-24th week after kidney transplantation) tacrolimus doses will&#xD;
