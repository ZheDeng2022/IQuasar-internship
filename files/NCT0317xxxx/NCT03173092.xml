  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the progression-free survival (PFS) at 2 years for&#xD;
      MM participants previously receiving a bortezomib-based induction regimen to IRD.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Ixazomib. Ixazomib is being tested to treat&#xD;
      people who have MM. This study will look at the effectiveness and safety in participants who&#xD;
      take ixazomib in addition to lenalidomide and dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 160 participants. Participants will initially receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Ixazomib 4 mg + lenalidomide 25 mg + dexamethasone 40 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants include MM participants who have received 3 cycles of a bortezomib-based&#xD;
      induction regimen (as defined by current National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN]&#xD;
      guidelines) and have no evidence of PD following initial first-line therapy. All participants&#xD;
      will be asked to take ixazomib 4 mg on Days 1, 8 and 15 and lenalidomide 25 mg from Day 1&#xD;
      through 21 and dexamethasone 40 mg on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 in 28 day cycles until disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity for up to 3 years. Dose modifications of ixazomib,&#xD;
      and/or lenalidomide and/or dexamethasone are allowed at the discretion of the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in United States. It is anticipated that the&#xD;
      treatment phase of this study will last up to 78 months, including 42 months for enrollment,&#xD;
      and a 36-month IRD treatment period (39 cycles) with ixazomib and/or lenalidomide and/or&#xD;
      dexamethasone for the last participant enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic as per their standard of care, and will&#xD;
      be followed for PFS. After disease progression, participants will be followed-up for overall&#xD;
      survival every 6 months until death or termination of the study by the sponsor.&#xD;

             cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inducers (rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin, carbamazepine,&#xD;
             phenytoin, phenobarbital), or use of Ginkgo biloba or St. John's wort.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Ongoing or active systemic infection, active hepatitis B or C virus infection, or&#xD;
