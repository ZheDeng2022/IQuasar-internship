      Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) of the knee is a high prevalence in the population of people&#xD;
      aged 60 years and over, when in some cases does not cause any discomfort or pain, and&#xD;
      therefore not diagnosed. In addition, Radio graphic findings of the knee not fully compatible&#xD;
      with the patient's symptoms, which resulted in errors in the interpretation and diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients who suffer from two knees or unilateral pain, will take part.&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a clinical examination, including evaluation of symptoms by an&#xD;
      orthopedist and an X-ray imaging, which are part of the currently accepted medical diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will perform PET-MRI test in order to assess whether PET MRI is a more efficient&#xD;
      tool for active knee osteoarthritis diagnosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knee Osteoarthritis has high incidence in the population over 60 years reaching a rate of 10%&#xD;
      in several studies. However, not all arthritic knee joints are actively causing patient&#xD;
      discomfort or pain. There is only a limited correlation between patient radio graphs and&#xD;
      symptoms leading to high rates of false positive and false negative of knee OA. Consequently,&#xD;
      patients may have bilateral knee arthritis when the more arthritic knee per x-ray is less&#xD;
      symptomatic. On the other hand knee MRI and bone scan maybe oversensitive for diagnosis knee&#xD;
      arthritis with a high rate of false positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to examine the value of PET MRI as a tool for accurate diagnosis&#xD;
      of active knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that using PET MRI of both knees may correlate better than radio graphs or&#xD;
      MRI by themselves to patient symptoms .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 150 patients with bilateral or unilateral knee pain with one of the&#xD;
      knees having more symptoms than the other. The study physicians who perform the PET MRI will&#xD;
      be blinded to the patient symptoms and will record their findings and which knee is more&#xD;
      symptomatic and along which pattern&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients that are sent for knee MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients over the age of 50 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will sign an informed consent for the study prior to the PET MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unilateral or Bilateral knee pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients were ambulatory preoperative, using no more then a single cane&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients had prior Weight Bearing AP x-rays and Lateral radiography The patients&#xD;
           will be fill in SF-36 and WOMAC and VAS scores along prior to their examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have an orthopedic assessment of their symptoms prior to their PET MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will carry out a PET-MR imaging. PET involves injecting FDG (glucose labeled&#xD;
      isotope of fluorine) intravenously at a dose of 2.5 mci . After a wait of about 40 minutes&#xD;
      will be performed PET MR lasting up to 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All findings will be evaluated.&#xD;
