    <textblock>
      The purpose of this China Phase I bridging study is to to evaluate the safety, tolerability&#xD;
      and pharmacokinetic profile of telatinib in China patients with advanced solid tumor&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, nonrandomized, phase I, escalating dose study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of telatinib. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is comprised of two stages. The 1st stage follows the traditional 3+3&#xD;
      dose-escalation design. Telatinib mesylate tablets will be administrated orally to patient&#xD;
      twice daily at a starting dose of 600 mg bid. Patients will be successively enrolled into&#xD;
      three cohorts from low-dose to high-dose (600 mg bid, 900 mg bid, and 1200 mg bid). For each&#xD;
      cohort, patient will be first enrolled for single-dose PK and safety observation. After&#xD;
      one-day interval, patient will then be resumed for a 21-day continuous treatment to assess&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and PK profile with multiple dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period will be 23 days, starting from the first&#xD;
      day of single dosing till the end of the 21-day continuous treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If first 3 subjects at a dose level complete a cohort without experiencing any DLT, subjects&#xD;
      for the next higher cohort will be recruited. If 1 of the first 3 subjects experiences DLT,&#xD;
      then up to three additional subjects (total up to six subjects) will enrolled at that dose&#xD;
      level. If more than 2 patients at a dose level experienced DLT, dose escalation will be&#xD;
      halted. And the dose level will be declared the toxic dose. The MTD is defined as the&#xD;
      previous (lower dose) dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If MTD is not observed even at 1200 mg bid, dose-escalation will not be continued.&#xD;
