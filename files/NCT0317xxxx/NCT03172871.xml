  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, active-controlled trial to assess the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of aripiprazole Intramuscular Depot in the acute treatment of adults with&#xD;
      schizophrenia. The trial will include a 13-day screening phase and a 12-week acute treatment&#xD;
      phase with a 14(±2)-day safety follow-up.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Screening Phase: The screening phase will begin when informed consent is signed and be a&#xD;
      maximum of 13 days. The investigators will assess the subjects who meet all eligibility&#xD;
      criteria and collect the characteristic information of the subjects, such as demographic,&#xD;
      medical history, etc. If subjects have been exposed to aripiprazole in the past (ie,&#xD;
      tolerability has been established), then subjects will enter a washout period for 3～7 days&#xD;
      from prior antipsychotic medications and other prohibited concomitant medications. If the&#xD;
      investigator may reasonably verify that subject has been off antipsychotics for at least 3～7&#xD;
      days and has a history of tolerating aripiprazole, then the subject may have a screening&#xD;
      phase of &lt; 7 days as long as the subject has had at least a 3～7-day washout phase from other&#xD;
      antipsychotic medications. Subjects are required to be hospitalized during the entire&#xD;
      screening phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12-week Acute Treatment Phase: At baseline, eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to either aripiprazole IM depot or aripiprazole tablet. For 14 days beginning with the&#xD;
      first injection, subjects randomized aripiprazole IM depot will receive concomitant oral&#xD;
      aripiprazole and subjects randomized to aripiprazole tablet will receive 12 weeks concomitant&#xD;
      injection placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Follow-up Phase: All subjects will be followed-up for safety via telephone contact&#xD;
      14(±2) days after the last trial visit.&#xD;

    <description>The primary efficacy outcome variable is mean change from baseline to endpoint (Week 10) in PANSS Total Score. The objective of the primary analysis is to compare the efficacy of aripiprazole IM depot (400 mg or 300 mg) with that of placebo with regard to mean change from baseline to endpoint (Week 10) in PANSS Total Score.</description>
