      60 Patients were randomly allocated into three equal groups, after induction of general&#xD;
      anesthesia one of the three airways included in the study (Modified Williams, Modified&#xD;
      Gudle's and LMA MADgic airway) was used as a conduit for endotracheal tube placement using&#xD;
      fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Airway insertion time, ease of insertion, adaptation to oral cavity&#xD;
      and intubation time was recorded.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study was conducted in Kasr Alainy hospital, faculty of medicine, Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After approval of ethical committee and informed written consent from each patient, 60&#xD;
      patient aging above 18 years, ASA I-II , with Ganzouri airway score &lt;4 and undergoing&#xD;
      elective surgeries under general anesthesia were included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly allocated into three equal groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group M (GM) (n=20 patients): patient was intubated using LMA MADgic airway. Group W (GW)&#xD;
      (n=20 patients): patient was intubated using modified Williams airway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group G (GG) (n=20 patients): patient was intubated using modified Guedel's airway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was performed by random computer allocation with numbered closed opaque&#xD;
      envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was performed by expert anesthesiologist in FOB intubation. In the preparation&#xD;
      room, all patients was cannulated with a 20 gauge venous cannula and 0.02mg/kg Midazolam was&#xD;
      given. Patient transferred to the operating room and was monitored with non-invasive blood&#xD;
      pressure, pulse oximetry and ECG. After preoxygenation using a facemask for 5 min, induction&#xD;
      of anesthesia was done with 2mg/kg propofol, 1 Î¼g/kg of fentanyl and 0.6 mg/kg of atracurium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After loss of consciousness the selected airway according to group randomization was inserted&#xD;
      into the mouth (size selection and technique of insertion according to manufacturer&#xD;
      instruction). Time of insertion defined as the time, in seconds, from touching the patients'&#xD;
      mouth with the airway until capnographic confirmation of ventilation by facemask. The ease of&#xD;
      insertion was determined by number of attempts of airway insertion. Adaptation of the airway&#xD;
      was determined by adequacy of ventilation, fitness to the oral cavity and appearance of&#xD;
      successive ETco2 waves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manual positive-pressure ventilation was then started with 100% oxygen and 1-1.5% isoflurane&#xD;
      through the facemask for 3 min until complete muscle relaxation was confirmed (when&#xD;
      train-of-four count becomes zero).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loaded FOB was inserted for intubation through the airway, laryngeal view grade was recorded&#xD;
      (LVG) using Brimacomb and Berry scale; thereafter, the fiberscope was advanced into the&#xD;
      trachea to a level just above the carina and the tracheal tube was railroaded over it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tracheal intubation could be facilitated by tube rotation, jaw thrust, neck extension or&#xD;
      flexion and adjustment of the airway was allawed and was recorded. The intubation time was&#xD;
      recorded ; that is, the time from cessation of manual ventilation using a facemask until&#xD;
      restarting of ventilation through the tracheal tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The airway was removed except the LMA MADgic airway which was removed before ETT insertion.&#xD;
      The ease of airway removal was evaluated by the anesthesiologist.&#xD;
