  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will use leukapheresis to collect lymphocytes to study immune responses&#xD;
      following vaccination with BCG in BCG-naïve participants. These studies will include, but not&#xD;
      necessarily be limited to: anti-T-cell and anti-Natural Killer (NK) T-cell responses,&#xD;
      anti-lipid responses, and antibody responses to BCG following re-vaccination. These responses&#xD;
      will provide a detailed framework characterizing the immune responses that are induced and&#xD;
      responses that are not induced in humans by BCG, a partially protective TB vaccine. This&#xD;
      framework will allow new hypotheses to be formulated and tested regarding what new and more&#xD;
      effective TB vaccines should target for optimal protective immunity.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label protocol in up to 15 healthy adults who are BCG-naïve. All participants&#xD;
      will receive a total of two doses of BCG, by intradermal injection, approximately 6 months&#xD;
      apart. Participants will be followed by a combination of visits and telephone contacts&#xD;
      through Study Day 264. Participants will undergo TST testing 3 months after the second BCG&#xD;
      vaccination and QuantiFERON TB Gold in-Tube (QTBGT), or the equivalent, if necessary. Two BCG&#xD;
      vaccinations given 6 months apart were chosen for this study to give optimal T cell and&#xD;
      antibody responses for future study. Leukapheresis will be conducted prior to the first BCG&#xD;
      vaccination and at 56 days after the second BCG vaccination (Hoft, 2002; Brown, 2003; de&#xD;
      Valliere, 2005). The final leukapheresis timing was selected based on results from functional&#xD;
      biological assays, which suggest analysis of samples at this time point may provide insight&#xD;
      into the protective immune responses elicited by BCG, and on results of prior clinical trials&#xD;
      describing the peak immune responses to BCG (Hoft, 2002; Brown, 2003; de Valliere, 2005). The&#xD;
      study will be conducted at a single site in the US (Saint Louis University [SLU]).&#xD;
