  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will pilot a strengthening intervention targeted to muscles found to be important&#xD;
      to gait in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Previous studies that have tried to&#xD;
      strengthen leg and trunk muscles in people with MS have failed to improve walking ability&#xD;
      consistently. The investigators think that is because strengthening exercises were not&#xD;
      targeted to the correct muscle groups. For this study the investigators propose targeting&#xD;
      muscle groups that they have found to be strong contributors to walking in a prior study.&#xD;
      This is the first study to target these muscles, so the investigators propose doing a small&#xD;
      trial to first evaluate the feasibility of the strength program and the outcomes. The&#xD;
      investigators will measure strength and walking measures twice before and once after an&#xD;
      8-week strengthening intervention in a single group of 10 people with MS who are able to walk&#xD;
      independently. The results of this study will help inform future, larger trials that could&#xD;
      change the way strength training is conducted in people with MS.&#xD;

    <description>Strength exercises for ankle PF, hip abduction, and trunk muscles. Exercises will be done in three standard positions of supine, sidelying, prone, seated, and standing. Exercises during the initial 4 weeks will be completed 2x week with supervision of a physical therapist and 2x week at home, for a total of 4x week. For the final 4 weeks of the intervention will be completed 1x week with supervision and 3x week at home.</description>
