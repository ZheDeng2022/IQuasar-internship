  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential of DFD-06 to suppress the&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis when applied twice daily for 15 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a 15-day, single arm, multicenter, multi-dose, open-label, two stage, sequential&#xD;
      study. In the first stage, subjects who are at least 12 years of age and not more than 16.9&#xD;
      years (16 years and 11 months) of age with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis will be&#xD;
      treated with DFD-06 (at least 20 completed subjects). In the second stage subjects who are at&#xD;
      least 6 years of age and not more than 11.9 years (11 years and 11 months) of age with&#xD;
      moderate to severe plaque psoriasis will be treated with DFD-06 (at least 20 completed&#xD;
      subjects). An attempt will be made to enroll subjects throughout the age range of each cohort&#xD;
      including the lower age range. DFD-06 will be applied twice daily to all affected areas on&#xD;
      the body excluding face, scalp, groin, axillae and other intertriginous areas. Subjects must&#xD;
      have ≥10% Body Surface Area (BSA) treated to achieve maximal use exposure.&#xD;

             health information collected for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be at least 6 years and not more than 16.9 years of age, with body&#xD;
             weight greater than or equal to 45 pounds at Screening.&#xD;

          -  Subjects must present with a clinical diagnosis of stable (at least 3 months) plaque&#xD;
             psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with psoriasis involving ≥10% Body Surface Area (BSA), not including the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject has a current diagnosis of unstable forms of psoriasis including guttate,&#xD;
             erythrodermic, exfoliative or pustular psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a history of organ transplant requiring immunosuppression, HIV, or other&#xD;
             immunocompromised state.&#xD;
