  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase Ib, multi-center, open-label study to characterize the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary antitumor activity of MIW815(ADU-S100) in&#xD;
      combination with the PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor PDR001. Two different schedules were explored&#xD;
      in two dose escalation groups in accessible cutaneous or subcutaneous lesions. The optional&#xD;
      dose confirmation group exploring intratumoral injection of viscerally located lesions was&#xD;
      not opened due to the program's early termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A included patients with accessible solid tumors and lymphomas. This group received a&#xD;
      fixed dose of PDR001 i.v. on day 1 of every 28 day cycle and intratumoral injections of&#xD;
      MIW815 (ADU-S100) on days 1, 8 and 15 of every 28 day cycle. Group B included patients with&#xD;
      accessible solid tumors and lymphomas. This group received a fixed dose of PDR001 i.v. on day&#xD;
      1 of every 28 day cycle and an intratumoral injection of MIW815 (ADU-S100) on day 1 of every&#xD;
      28 day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the dose and dose schedule had been confirmed, the plan was to open the dose expansion&#xD;
      part of the study. However, the expansion phase of the study was not opened to enrollment due&#xD;
      to the program's early termination.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study was comprised of two treatment arms.&#xD;
Group A included patients with accessible solid tumors and lymphomas. This group received a fixed dose of PDR001 intravenous on day 1 of every 28 day cycle and intratumoral injections of MIW815 (ADU-S100) on days 1, 8 and 15 of every 28 day cycle.&#xD;
Group B included patients with accessible solid tumors and lymphomas. This group received a fixed dose of PDR001 intravenous on day 1 of every 28 day cycle and an intratumoral injection of MIW815 (ADU-S100) on day 1 of every 28 day cycle.&#xD;
Once the maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended dose for expansion had been determined, the plan was to open the expansion part of the study. However, the dose expansion phase of the study was not opened to enrollment due to the program's early termination.</intervention_model_description>
