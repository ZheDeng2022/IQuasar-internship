  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of escalating doses of quavonlimab when used in combination with pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      participants with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After screening, participants will be assigned to the Dose Escalation, Dose Confirmation,&#xD;
      Efficacy Expansion, or Coformulation Phase. The Dose Escalation Phase will evaluate available&#xD;
      PK and safety data including dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). The Dose Confirmation Phase&#xD;
      will gather additional safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy data of quavonlimab&#xD;
      in combination with pembrolizumab, and will include first-line advanced/metastatic non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and second line (and beyond) advanced/metastatic small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (SCLC). The purpose of the Efficacy Expansion Phase is to gather preliminary&#xD;
      anti-tumor efficacy data for quavonlimab in combination with pembrolizumab as well as for&#xD;
      quavonlimab monotherapy in the specific target population of programmed cell death protein 1&#xD;
      (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) refractory melanoma. The Coformulation Phase&#xD;
      will evaluate the safety and PK of a coformulated product of pembrolizumab/quavonlimab&#xD;
      (MK-1308A) in comparison to that of the single, co-administered products given at the same&#xD;
      dose and schedule, and include participants with advanced solid tumors, PD-1/L1 refractory&#xD;
      advanced melanoma, and participants from mainland China.&#xD;

    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population whose best overall response (BOR) is confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by BICR and based on imaging per adjusted RECIST 1.1.

According to adjusted RECIST 1.1, CR is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR according to adjusted RECIST 1.1 is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions as assessed by the investigator, taking as reference the baseline SOD.</description>
