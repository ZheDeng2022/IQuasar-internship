    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well FASN inhibitor TVB-2640, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab&#xD;
      work in treating patients with HER2 positive breast cancer that has spread to other places in&#xD;
      the body (metastatic). FASN inhibitor TVB-2640 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Trastuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because&#xD;
      it attaches itself to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as&#xD;
      HER2 receptors. When trastuzumab attaches to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells&#xD;
      to grow are blocked and the cancer cell may be marked for destruction by the body's immune&#xD;
      system. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Drugs&#xD;
      used in endocrine therapy either lower the amount of estrogen made by the body or blocks the&#xD;
      use of estrogen by the tumor cells. This may help stop the growth of tumor cells that need&#xD;
      estrogen to grow. Giving FASN inhibitor TVB-2640 and trastuzumab in combination with&#xD;
      paclitaxel or endocrine therapy may help control the disease in patients with HER2 positive&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the overall tumor response rate (ORR i.e. complete response [CR]+partial&#xD;
      response [PR]) of the combination of FASN inhibitor TVB-2640 [TVB-2640] with paclitaxel and&#xD;
      trastuzumab in patients with taxane and trastuzumab-resistant, advanced HER2-positive breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the ORR of the combination of TVB-2640 with paclitaxel and trastuzumab in&#xD;
      patients with endocrine and trastuzumab-resistant, advanced HER2-positive breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. For each patient cohort, to evaluate the safety profile of the combination of TVB-2640&#xD;
      with paclitaxel and trastuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. For each patient cohort, to assess the clinical benefit rate (CBR), duration of response,&#xD;
      and progression free survival of the combination of TVB-2640 with paclitaxel and trastuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To obtain a point and interval estimate of the difference in RR as well as the&#xD;
      difference in CBR between cohort A and cohort B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. For each patient cohort, to assess the changes in FASN, phosphorylation (p)AKT, and pS6&#xD;
      expression in tumor tissue after the first cycle of the combination of TVB-2640 with&#xD;
      paclitaxel and trastuzumab from pre-treatment levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. For each patient cohort, to assess the changes in levels of cellular apoptosis in tumor&#xD;
      tissue after the first cycle of the combination of TVB-2640 with paclitaxel and trastuzumab&#xD;
      from pre-treatment levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. For each patient cohort, to assess the changes in serum FASN after the first cycle of&#xD;
      the combination of TVB-2640 with paclitaxel and trastuzumab from pre-treatment levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT A: Patients receive FASN inhibitor TVB-2640 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28,&#xD;
      paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1-96 hours on days 1, 8, and 15, and trastuzumab IV over&#xD;
      30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unexpected toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT B: Patients receive FASN inhibitor TVB-2640 PO QD on days 1-28 and trastuzumab IV over&#xD;
      30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients also continue endocrine therapy of either&#xD;
      anastrozole PO QD, exemestane PO QD, fulvestrant intramuscularly (IM) on days 1 and 14 of&#xD;
      cycle 1 and day 1 of subsequent cycles, or letrozole PO QD. Cycles repeat every 28 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unexpected toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 3&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

    <description>Will be defined as the number of patients whose disease meets the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria for a partial or complete response on two consecutive evaluations at least 8 weeks apart divided by the total number of patients in that cohort who started protocol treatment. For each cohort, a two-stage Simon minimax design with a safety run-in period will be used to test the null hypothesis that the true tumor response rate is at most 5% against the alternative it is at least 20%.</description>

    <description>Will be defined as the time from the first radiologic finding of a partial response or complete response to disease progression among those patients whose disease meets the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria for complete response or partial response on 2 consecutive evaluations approximately 8 weeks apart. A point and interval estimate of the response rate as well as the clinical benefit rate will be constructed using the Duffy-Santner approach to take into account the sequential nature of the study design.

    <description>Will be defined as time from randomization to the first of these disease events: local/regional or distant breast recurrence, ductal breast carcinoma in situ or invasive breast disease in contralateral breast, non-breast second primary, or death due to any cause. A point and interval estimate of the response rate as well as the clinical benefit rate will be constructed using the Duffy-Santner approach to take into account the sequential nature of the study design.

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The changes in H score FASN, pAKT, and pS6 expression and levels of cellular apoptosis in tumor tissue will be examined graphically by plotting the difference in pre and post levels against pre-levels of the biomarker, with patients who derived clinical benefit represented by dashed line and those who did not by solid line.
