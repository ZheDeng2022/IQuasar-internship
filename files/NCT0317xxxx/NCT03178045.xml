    <measure>Interaction in Participants Anxiety Measured by 3 Items on the Patient Reported Outcome Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Survey (PRO-CTCAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>This analysis utilized 3 anxiety items from the PRO-CTCAE survey. The responses were defined on a scale of 0-4 with higher scores representing stronger agreement with the item (higher anxiety). The 3 items were summed to generate an overall score ranging from 0-12. 139 patients responded to only some of the 3 items and were counted as a missing value for the overall sum score. As the surveys were repeated daily, longitudinal mixed effects regression was used to test the association between the anxiety sum score and randomization arm after adjusting for time, randomization strata, and an interaction between randomization arm and time with a random intercept for patient.</description>

    <measure>Differences in Patient Engagement Between Cohorts at 14 Days Post-Operatively Utilizing the Patient Activation Measure (PAM) and Adjusting for Strata and Pre-Operative PAM Score</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the difference in patient engagement between each study arm at 14 days post-operatively adjusting for strata and preoperative PAM overall score. The survey consists of 10 items with five response options: strongly disagree, disagree, undecided, agree and strongly agree defined on a scale of 1-5 with higher scores representing stronger agreement with the item. The items in the PAM survey were combined to generate an overall mean score at each timepoint - a theoretical score of 0-100. A higher score indicates stronger patient engagement. If a patient is missing a response to an item(s), the overall score is considered missing for that patient/timepoint. Participants who answered the survey were included in this analysis. 560 patients were analyzed in the Team Monitoring Arm and 541 were analyzed in the Enhanced Feedback Arm.</description>

    <time_frame>60 days post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the difference in patient engagement between each study arm 60 days post-operatively adjusting for strata and preoperative PAM overall score. The survey consists of 10 items with five response options: strongly disagree, disagree, undecided, agree and strongly agree defined on a scale of 1-5 with higher scores representing stronger agreement with the item. The items in the PAM survey were combined to generate an overall mean score at each timepoint - a theoretical score of 0-100. A higher score indicates stronger patient engagement. If a patient is missing a response to an item(s), the overall score is considered missing for that patient/timepoint. 465 participants form the Team Monitoring Arm and 460 participants from the Enhanced Feedback arm were analyzed who answered the Patient Activation Measure at POD 60.</description>

    <measure>Differences in Caregiver Burden Between Team Monitoring and Enhanced Feedback Cohorts Utilizing the Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA).</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the difference in caregiver burden between each study arm at two timepoints: 14 days post-operatively. Scoring information for the CRA: The Caregiver Reaction Assessment involved 24 items given at 14 days and repeated at 60 days with the following potential responses: strongly disagree, disagree, undecided, agree, and strongly agree which we defined on a scale of 1-5 with higher scores representing stronger agreement with the item. These items are combined into 5 subscales: health problems, financial problems, lack of family support, disrupted schedule, and self-esteem. For each subscale, a total score was computed as the average of the subsequent item scores, with a range between 1 and 5. A higher score represented a stronger agreement with the attribute.</description>

    <description>In this cohort, the electronic system will provide advanced informatics support for push notifications to the care team based on the severity of the symptoms reported. This platform promotes early detection and intervention. The care team is alerted when patients experience symptoms out of the expected range or if symptoms are worsening. Nurses receive secure message notifications and will contact the patient by phone depending on symptom severity. If a patient responds with a moderate-severe answer, the office team gets an alert and calls the patient during business hours.</description>

    <description>In this cohort, the electronic system will provide tailored normative data visualizations that offer context and education to patients regarding expected symptom severity. The information provided to patients in the Enhanced Feedback group will be procedure specific and based on continuously updated PRO-CTCAE data from previous patients. Patients are thus able to see their own recovery trajectory relative to that of patients who have undergone the same procedure. Care is patient activated in that patients will use the information about expected symptoms to decide whether they should call the care team (e.g., if they are experiencing symptoms that are more severe or more prolonged than expected). If a patient reports severe symptoms, they are instructed to immediately contact their physician's office or seek medical attention.</description>

          <title>Team Monitoring</title>
          <description>Team monitoring is the current standard of care for patients at the Josie Robertson Surgical Center (JRSC) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). Patients report their symptoms via an electronic questionnaire called the Recovery Tracker, delivered through an in-house informatics platform known as the ambulatory cancer care electronic symptom self-reporting (ACCESS) system. The healthcare team receives portal-secure message alerts if patients report symptoms above a specified threshold and contact the patient by phone during business hours. Given the need for real-time feedback for some symptoms, patients who report very severe symptoms receive a bold red alert instructing them to immediately contact their care team or seek medical attention.</description>

            <description>Team monitoring is the current standard of care for patients at the Josie Robertson Surgical Center (JRSC) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). Patients report their symptoms via an electronic questionnaire called the Recovery Tracker, delivered through an in-house informatics platform known as the ambulatory cancer care electronic symptom self-reporting (ACCESS) system. The healthcare team receives portal-secure message alerts if patients report symptoms above a specified threshold and contact the patient by phone during business hours. Given the need for real-time feedback for some symptoms, patients who report very severe symptoms receive a bold red alert instructing them to immediately contact their care team or seek medical attention.</description>

            <title>Enhanced Feedback</title>
            <description>In the enhanced feedback cohort, the ACCESS system provides tailored normative data visualizations that offer context and education to patients regarding expected symptom severity. The feedback report consists of periodically updated PRO data from previous patients that are stratified by surgical procedure and postoperative date. As a result, patients can see their recovery trajectories relative to others who have undergone the same procedure. Care is 'patient-activated', in that patients use the information about expected symptoms to decide whether they should call the care team, for instance, if they experience symptoms that are more severe or more prolonged than expected. Similar to the team monitoring cohort, patients who report very severe symptoms are instructed to immediately contact their physician's office, and the care team receives an alert.</description>

            <description>Team monitoring is the current standard of care for patients at the Josie Robertson Surgical Center (JRSC) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). Patients report their symptoms via an electronic questionnaire called the Recovery Tracker, delivered through an in-house informatics platform known as the ambulatory cancer care electronic symptom self-reporting (ACCESS) system. The healthcare team receives portal-secure message alerts if patients report symptoms above a specified threshold and contact the patient by phone during business hours. Given the need for real-time feedback for some symptoms, patients who report very severe symptoms receive a bold red alert instructing them to immediately contact their care team or seek medical attention.</description>

            <title>Enhanced Feedback</title>
            <description>In the enhanced feedback cohort, the ACCESS system provides tailored normative data visualizations that offer context and education to patients regarding expected symptom severity. The feedback report consists of periodically updated PRO data from previous patients that are stratified by surgical procedure and postoperative date. As a result, patients can see their recovery trajectories relative to others who have undergone the same procedure. Care is 'patient-activated', in that patients use the information about expected symptoms to decide whether they should call the care team, for instance, if they experience symptoms that are more severe or more prolonged than expected. Similar to the team monitoring cohort, patients who report very severe symptoms are instructed to immediately contact their physician's office, and the care team receives an alert.</description>

        <title>Interaction in Participants Anxiety Measured by 3 Items on the Patient Reported Outcome Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Survey (PRO-CTCAE)</title>
        <description>This analysis utilized 3 anxiety items from the PRO-CTCAE survey. The responses were defined on a scale of 0-4 with higher scores representing stronger agreement with the item (higher anxiety). The 3 items were summed to generate an overall score ranging from 0-12. 139 patients responded to only some of the 3 items and were counted as a missing value for the overall sum score. As the surveys were repeated daily, longitudinal mixed effects regression was used to test the association between the anxiety sum score and randomization arm after adjusting for time, randomization strata, and an interaction between randomization arm and time with a random intercept for patient.</description>

        <title>Differences in Patient Engagement Between Cohorts at 14 Days Post-Operatively Utilizing the Patient Activation Measure (PAM) and Adjusting for Strata and Pre-Operative PAM Score</title>
        <description>To evaluate the difference in patient engagement between each study arm at 14 days post-operatively adjusting for strata and preoperative PAM overall score. The survey consists of 10 items with five response options: strongly disagree, disagree, undecided, agree and strongly agree defined on a scale of 1-5 with higher scores representing stronger agreement with the item. The items in the PAM survey were combined to generate an overall mean score at each timepoint - a theoretical score of 0-100. A higher score indicates stronger patient engagement. If a patient is missing a response to an item(s), the overall score is considered missing for that patient/timepoint. Participants who answered the survey were included in this analysis. 560 patients were analyzed in the Team Monitoring Arm and 541 were analyzed in the Enhanced Feedback Arm.</description>

            <description>Team monitoring is the current standard of care for patients at the Josie Robertson Surgical Center (JRSC) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). Patients report their symptoms via an electronic questionnaire called the Recovery Tracker, delivered through an in-house informatics platform known as the ambulatory cancer care electronic symptom self-reporting (ACCESS) system. The healthcare team receives portal-secure message alerts if patients report symptoms above a specified threshold and contact the patient by phone during business hours. Given the need for real-time feedback for some symptoms, patients who report very severe symptoms receive a bold red alert instructing them to immediately contact their care team or seek medical attention.</description>

            <description>In the enhanced feedback cohort, the ACCESS system provides tailored normative data visualizations that offer context and education to patients regarding expected symptom severity. The feedback report consists of periodically updated PRO data from previous patients that are stratified by surgical procedure and postoperative date. As a result, patients can see their recovery trajectories relative to others who have undergone the same procedure. Care is 'patient-activated', in that patients use the information about expected symptoms to decide whether they should call the care team, for instance, if they experience symptoms that are more severe or more prolonged than expected. Similar to the team monitoring cohort, patients who report very severe symptoms are instructed to immediately contact their physician's office, and the care team receives an alert.</description>

These items are combined into 5 subscales: health problems, financial problems, lack of family support, disrupted schedule, and self-esteem. For each subscale, a total score was computed as the average of the subsequent item scores, with a range between 1 and 5. A higher score represented a stronger agreement with the attribute.</description>

          <title>Team Monitoring</title>
          <description>Team monitoring is the current standard of care for patients at the Josie Robertson Surgical Center (JRSC) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). Patients report their symptoms via an electronic questionnaire called the Recovery Tracker, delivered through an in-house informatics platform known as the ambulatory cancer care electronic symptom self-reporting (ACCESS) system. The healthcare team receives portal-secure message alerts if patients report symptoms above a specified threshold and contact the patient by phone during business hours. Given the need for real-time feedback for some symptoms, patients who report very severe symptoms receive a bold red alert instructing them to immediately contact their care team or seek medical attention.</description>

          <title>Enhanced Feedback</title>
          <description>In the enhanced feedback cohort, the ACCESS system provides tailored normative data visualizations that offer context and education to patients regarding expected symptom severity. The feedback report consists of periodically updated PRO data from previous patients that are stratified by surgical procedure and postoperative date. As a result, patients can see their recovery trajectories relative to others who have undergone the same procedure. Care is 'patient-activated', in that patients use the information about expected symptoms to decide whether they should call the care team, for instance, if they experience symptoms that are more severe or more prolonged than expected. Similar to the team monitoring cohort, patients who report very severe symptoms are instructed to immediately contact their physician's office, and the care team receives an alert.</description>
