      Research question: The primary aim of this study is to compare the prevalence of motor&#xD;
      impairment from birth to five years of age between children born &lt;30 weeks and term-born&#xD;
      controls, and to determine whether persistent abnormal motor assessments in the newborn&#xD;
      period in those born &lt;30 weeks predict abnormal motor functioning at age five years.&#xD;
      Secondary aims for both children born&lt;30 weeks and term children are i) to determine whether&#xD;
      novel early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - based structural or functional biomarkers are&#xD;
      detectable in the neonatal period that can predict motor impairments at five years, ii) to&#xD;
      investigate the association between motor impairments and concurrent deficits in body&#xD;
      structure and function at five years of age, and iii) to explore how motor impairments at&#xD;
      five years, including abnormalities of gait, postural control and strength, are associated&#xD;
      with concurrent functional outcomes including physical activity, cognitive and learning&#xD;
      ability, behavioural and emotional problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Prospective longitudinal cohort study. Participants and Setting: 150 preterm children&#xD;
      (born &lt;30 weeks) and 151 term-born children (born &gt;36 completed weeks' gestation and&#xD;
      weighing&gt;2499 g) admitted to the Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne, were recruited at birth&#xD;
      and will be invited to participate in a five-year follow-up study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: This study will examine previously collected data (from birth to two years) that&#xD;
      comprises the following: detailed motor assessments and structural and functional brain MRI&#xD;
      images. At five years, preterm and term children will be examined using comprehensive motor&#xD;
      assessments including the Movement Assessment Battery for Children - 2nd edition and measures&#xD;
      of gait function through spatiotemporal (assessed with the GAITRiteÂ® Walkway), dynamic&#xD;
      postural control (assessed with Microsoft Kinect) variables and hand grip strength (assessed&#xD;
      with a dynamometer); and measures of physical activity (assessed using accelerometry),&#xD;
      cognitive development (assessed with Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence)&#xD;
      and emotional and behavioural status (assessed with the Strengths and Difficulties&#xD;
      Questionnaire and the Developmental and Wellbeing Assessment). Caregivers will be asked to&#xD;
      complete questionnaires on demographics, physical activity, activities of daily living and&#xD;
      motor function (assessed with Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory, Pediatric Quality&#xD;
      of Life Questionnaire, the Little Developmental Co-ordination Questionnaire and an activity&#xD;
      diary) at the 5 year assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: For the primary aim the prevalence of motor impairment from birth to 5 years will&#xD;
      be compared between children born &lt;30 weeks and term-born peers using the proportion of&#xD;
      children classified as abnormal at each of the time points (term age, one, two and five&#xD;
      years). Persistent motor impairments during the neonatal period will be assessed as a&#xD;
      predictor of severity of motor impairment at 5 years of age in children born &lt;30 weeks using&#xD;
      linear regression. Models will be fitted using generalised estimating equations with results&#xD;
      reported using robust standard errors, to allow for the clustering of multiple births.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion/Significance: Understanding the developmental precursors of motor impairment in&#xD;
      children born &lt;30 weeks is essential to limit disruption to skill development, and potential&#xD;
      secondary impacts on physical activity, participation, academic achievement, self-esteem and&#xD;
      associated outcomes, such as obesity, poor physical fitness and social isolation. Better&#xD;
      understanding of motor skill development will enable targeting of intervention and&#xD;
      streamlining of services to the individuals who are at highest risk of motor impairments.&#xD;

    <description>A small Axivity AX3 tri-axial accelerometer-based activity monitor will be worn on the ankle over a consecutive seven day period to obtain information about the number of steps taken per day and sedentary behaviour patterns. The child and caregiver will be educated on wearing the device, and the child will wear it 24 hours a day for seven days before returning it in a pre-paid envelope.</description>

    <description>The PEDI-CAT (Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory)25 is a questionnaire that will be used to assess abilities in three functional domains: Daily Activities (e.g. dressing, feeding), Mobility (e.g. transfers, steps and inclines, running and playing) and Social/Cognitive (e.g. interaction, communication, self-management). It provides standard and scaled scores based on normative and disability samples, and is validated for children with a range of physical and behavioural conditions, including children who use mobility devices. Caregivers will complete the PEDI-CAT on an iPad during their child's assessment.</description>

    <description>The Little Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire (Little DCD)27 is a parent-completed measure which is designed to identify subtle motor problems in children. This questionnaire has been revised to be appropriate for use by parents of children aged five to seven years of age and its concurrent validity has been established with the MABC-2.28</description>

    <measure>General Cognitive Function</measure>

    <description>General cognitive function will be assessed using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (Fourth Edition, Australian and New Zealand Standardised Edition; WPPSI-IV).29 The WPPSI-IV has Australasian norms and is the gold standard measure for assessing general intellectual ability. It provides measures of key cognitive domains: full-scale IQ, verbal comprehension, visual-spatial reasoning, fluid reasoning, working memory, and processing speed.</description>
