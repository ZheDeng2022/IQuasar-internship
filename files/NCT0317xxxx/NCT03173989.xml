    <textblock>
      Introduction: Osteoarthritis is a disabling disease that can affect 6% to 12% of the adult&#xD;
      population and more than a third of people over 65 years of age. Considering osteoarthritis&#xD;
      of hands, existing research about the therapeutic treatment advocates actions such as (1)&#xD;
      joint protection, (2) assistive technology and (3) exercises, however, doubts persist as to&#xD;
      their effects. Objective: To verify the functional and analgesic effect of joint protection&#xD;
      and energy conservation techniques, assistive technology (orthotics and adaptations) and&#xD;
      exercises in the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis of the hands. Method: An&#xD;
      epidemiological study in which a total sample of patients with knee osteoarthritis will&#xD;
      receive joint protection and energy conservation guidelines. Subsequently, the sample will be&#xD;
      divided into two groups, group 1 with radiological signs that suggest osteoarthritis of the&#xD;
      hands and 2 with patients with radiological signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the&#xD;
      hands, who present greater functional limitations in the daily life, being eligible for&#xD;
      treatment of Rehabilitation, in which will be used orthosis aiming at the relief of pain,&#xD;
      stabilization of the affected joints and the prevention of grievance of deformities and&#xD;
      orientations of exercises to maintain muscle strength. Participants will be followed up for&#xD;
      two years, evaluated with the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire&#xD;
      (DASH), Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), palmar grip strength measured with&#xD;
      Jamar dynamometer, key pinch strength, three point pinch strength and pulp pinch strength&#xD;
      measured with B &amp; L Pinch-gauge dynamometer. The groups will be divided between 1 and 2, the&#xD;
      group 1 will be composed of patients who will only perform the orientations informed in the&#xD;
      theoretical and practical classes, while the group 2, besides the orientations will receive&#xD;
      orthoses with models such as volar hand rest splints, short thumb stabilization splints, and&#xD;
      volar finger splints with nocturnal support, aiming at the relief of the pain, stabilization&#xD;
      of the affected joints and the prevention of the appearance / aggravation of deformities.&#xD;
      Exercise guidelines for maintenance of muscle strength for thumb and fingers will be&#xD;
      performed on patients who present significant improvement of pain.&#xD;

      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Were included 200 patients in the group of Bone Metabolic Diseases of the Institute of&#xD;
      Orthopedics and Traumatology of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of S達o Paulo&#xD;
      (FMUSP). Were included patients aged between 40 and 80 years, with involvement of&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (OA) in the knees and of these, a sample of patients with involvement of the&#xD;
      first carpometacarpal, metacarpophalangeal or interphalangeal joint of the thumb and the&#xD;
      proximal or distal interphalangeal joint of fingers with from I to III degrees of&#xD;
      classification of Kelgreen and Lawrence (KL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the calculation of the sample size, a pilot test was performed with 15 subjects and&#xD;
      assumed: alpha of 5%, beta of 20% (power = 80%) and difference between the groups of 10%&#xD;
      referring to the scores at each scale . With these data, a minimum of 200 individuals was&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are patients in an OA treatment program in the Bone Metabolic Diseases group of&#xD;
      the Orthopedics and Traumatology Institute of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of&#xD;
      S達o Paulo (FMUSP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients were evaluated for their ability to perform functional activities and&#xD;
      anthropometric parameters of upper limbs. The Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand&#xD;
      (DASH), the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), questionnaires were applied, as&#xD;
      well as grip strength measured with Jamar速 dynamometer, key pinch, three point pinch, and a&#xD;
      pulp pinch measured with B &amp; L Pinch-gauge速 dynamometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The force was established after arithmetic average of 3 trials. The tests were performed&#xD;
      bilaterally. The presence of deformities has also been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total sample was divided into two groups. Both received guidelines on joint protection&#xD;
      and energy conservation, including theoretical and practical classes aimed at protecting all&#xD;
      joints that may be affected by OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theoretical classes were carried out through slide presentation with concepts of joint&#xD;
      protection, conservation of energy, organization of time, organization of the home and work&#xD;
      environment and organization of daily routine. Printed information material was also&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The practical classes were carried out in a simulated house, mounted in two rooms of&#xD;
      infirmary, suggesting all the environments of a conventional house. Adaptations made by&#xD;
      therapists and commercials and conventional objects used in daily living activities were used&#xD;
      for the guidelines described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The groups were divided between 1 and 2, which was group 1 with patients who presented&#xD;
      osteoarthritis in the knees, without specific complaints of hand, but with radiographic&#xD;
      findings and group 2 was characterized by patients with radiographic signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      hands that presented larger functional limitations in the daily routine or that were eligible&#xD;
      for rehabilitation treatment using orthosis models such as resting hand volar splints, thumb&#xD;
      stabilization splints or finger volar splints with nocturnal support, aiming at the relief of&#xD;
      the pain, stabilization of the affected joints and the prevention of the&#xD;
      appearance/aggravation of deformities. Exercise guidelines for maintenance of muscle strength&#xD;
      for thumb and fingers were performed in patients who presented significant improvement of&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients returned for reevaluation at 12 and 24 months after the initial evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, analytical, experimental, case control study with mixed data collection&#xD;
      (prospective and retrospective).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following variables were considered as dependent variables: HAQ, DASH (general questions,&#xD;
      symptons and functions in athletes, performing artists and workers) and dynamometry (manual&#xD;
      grip, key pinch, three point pinch and pulp pinch strenght) for the right and left hands. The&#xD;
      dependent variables were submitted to ANOVA with factor 2 (Intervention: ortesis, exercises&#xD;
      and orientation; orientation) by 8 (group of orientation: 8 different groups of orientation)&#xD;
      by 3 (Moment of evaluation: 1- first evaluation [initial], 2- second evaluation [after 1&#xD;
      year], 3- third evaluation [after 2 years]) with repeated measures in the last factor. In&#xD;
      order to compare the pain scores in the evaluation moments, the Friedman test was used for&#xD;
      the three questions of the DASH's pain module, in a separated moment. Post-hoc comparisons&#xD;
      were carried out using Tukey-HSD test (p&lt;0.05).&#xD;
