    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, randomized, double blind trial enrolling patients who will&#xD;
      undergo major liver resection. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either&#xD;
      octreotide or placebo in the postoperative period. The patients will receive octreotide&#xD;
      intravenously continuously for five days after operation. During this period the patients'&#xD;
      health will be monitored by performing blood tests including complete metabolic profile,&#xD;
      Complete Blood Count (CBC) with/diff., INR and PTT. The functioning of heart will also be&#xD;
      monitored post-operatively by EKG. Up to 80 participants will be accrued over a 2 year&#xD;
      period. Volumetric CT scans will be performed prior to hepatectomy, 1 week after hepatectomy&#xD;
      and 3 months after hepatectomy to evaluate liver regeneration.&#xD;
