  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well radical-dose image guided radiation therapy works in&#xD;
      treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      who are undergoing immunotherapy. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor&#xD;
      cells and shrink tumors. Giving radical-dose image guided radiation therapy to patients with&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer may help to improve response to immunotherapy anti-cancer&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine if progression-free survival at 24 weeks with this treatment combination is&#xD;
      improved compared to historical controls who received immunotherapy without radiation&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess acute (0-6 months) and late (&gt; 6 months) grade 3-5 toxicity. II. Assess overall&#xD;
      survival. III. Correlate circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ratio of&#xD;
      post-radiation therapy [RT] to pre-RT level) with radiographic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Correlate immune markers in peripheral blood with radiographic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Analyze progression-free survival with immune-related response criteria. II. Measure time&#xD;
      to discontinuation of study immunotherapy agent. III. Assess patterns of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo radical-dose image guided radiation therapy daily for up to 10 days&#xD;
      (within 2 weeks) while undergoing standard of care immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm II: Patients who decline to undergo radiation therapy receive standard of care&#xD;
      immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 6 months&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;

Plasma biomarkers (e.g. cell free deoxyribonucleic acid level) will be summarized using medians and interquartile ranges; changes in biomarkers will be assessed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.

             metastatic recurrence&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age â‰¥ 18&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has been receiving anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy for at least four weeks&#xD;
             (refer to section 4.2.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has had restaging imaging after initiation of immunotherapy, at least 4 weeks after&#xD;
             pre-immunotherapy baseline imaging. CT or PET/CT of at least chest/upper abdomen must&#xD;
             be performed within 4 weeks prior to registration. For patients with history of brain&#xD;
             metastases, brain MRI or CT is required within 4 weeks of registration; for other&#xD;
             patients brain MRI or CT is required within 12 weeks of registration. Diagnostic&#xD;
             PET/CT performed as part of radiation simulation can be used as the restaging imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Most recent imaging shows measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Evaluation by a Stanford medical oncologist must show:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. The patient is expected to continue on immunotherapy for at least three more&#xD;
                  months&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Imaging must show response, stable disease, or modest progression&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. If there is modest progression, the patient must be clinically stable in terms of&#xD;
                  performance status and overall disease-related symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has at least one extracranial tumor safely treatable with radical-dose radiation&#xD;
             therapy and that has not been previously treated with radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. ECOG performance status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
             document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Untreated brain metastases, if not planned to be treated in this course of radiation&#xD;
             therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential not willing/able to use contraception&#xD;
             during protocol treatment&#xD;
