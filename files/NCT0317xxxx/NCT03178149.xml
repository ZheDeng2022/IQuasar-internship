  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for adults 50 years or older who are losing their clear, sharp central vision.&#xD;
      Central vision is needed to be able to read and drive a car. They have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      dry age-related macular degeneration (called dry AMD). The macula is the center part of the&#xD;
      back of the eye that allows you to see fine detail. In an advanced stage of this disease,&#xD;
      areas of the macula die (atrophy), resulting in vision loss. This is called geographic&#xD;
      atrophy. This study is looking at a new treatment called ASP7317. It is for slowing or&#xD;
      reversing atrophy in dry AMD. ASP7317 is a specially created type of cells derived from human&#xD;
      stem cells. ASP7317 cells are injected into the macula of the eye while the person is under&#xD;
      anesthesia (local or general). An immunosuppressive medicine (tacrolimus) is also taken&#xD;
      around the time of injection of the cells to prevent the body from rejecting them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study looks at how safe ASP7317 is at 3 different dose levels. Researchers want to learn&#xD;
      if the different dose levels of ASP7317 work without causing unwanted medical problems. Each&#xD;
      of the 3 doses will be given to 2 groups of people. The first group will be those who have&#xD;
      severe vision loss. The second group will be those who have moderate vision loss. The doses&#xD;
      are low, medium and high numbers of cells. Tacrolimus will be taken by mouth for 33 days,&#xD;
      starting around the time of the injection of ASP7317. In addition, medicines to prevent&#xD;
      infection will be taken by mouth for up to 4 weeks starting around the time ASP7317 cells are&#xD;
      injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each week for the first 4 weeks after the ASP7317 cells have been injected, people taking&#xD;
      part in the study will visit the clinic so the researchers can make assessments. Then they&#xD;
      will visit again, at weeks 6, 8, 12, 16, 26, and 52 (last week of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A substudy will be available at some clinics. These clinics will use a special camera that&#xD;
      will allow researchers to look at images of the macular atrophy over time.&#xD;

    <description>Group 1 will consist of participants with Severe Vision Impairment. Successive cohorts of participants (3 participants/ cohort) will be treated in each escalating dose cohort (cohort 1: low cells/dose; cohort 2: medium cells/dose; cohort 3: high cells/dose). Sentinel dosing will be required for each dose level. After the first participant in Group 1 dose cohort is dosed and followed for 3 weeks, the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review the 3-week safety data and recommend if the second and third participants in Group 1 dose cohort may be treated. The DSMB recommendation to progress to the next dosing cohort will be based on 3-week follow-up safety review of the second and third participants in the preceding dose cohort. Participants will receive tacrolimus twice daily starting at baseline through week 4.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Participant has a history of previous laser photocoagulation for choroidal&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participant has an abnormality of vitreoretinal interface (e.g., tractional epiretinal&#xD;
             membrane), which can interfere with measurement of macular thickness or with the&#xD;
             potential for macular structural damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a history of cystoid macular edema, retinal vascular occlusion,&#xD;
             central serous chorioretinopathy, macular hole or retinoschisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has active or history of intraocular inflammation such as uveitis,&#xD;
             chorioretinitis and optic neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has presence of an ocular toxoplasmosis scar.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has nevus of Ota (oculodermal melanocytosis), a pigmented choroidal lesion&#xD;
             showing characteristics associated with high risk of malignancy (e.g., elevated&#xD;
             lesion) or a choroidal nevus in the macula.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has pathologic myopia defined as a spherical equivalent of &gt; 8.00 diopters&#xD;
             or axial length &gt; 28 mm at the screening visit, or myopic macular degeneration or&#xD;
             posterior staphyloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has glaucoma with uncontrolled intraocular pressure (IOP) (defined as IOP&#xD;
             &gt; 30 mmHg despite treatment with anti-glaucoma medication) or is using more than 2&#xD;
             agents to control IOP or a history of glaucoma-filtering surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a history of corneal transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has monocular vision; no light perception in the fellow eye or&#xD;
             anophthalmic in the fellow eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a contraindication to pupil dilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has any other ocular condition that can interfere with the assessment of&#xD;
             imaging data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ADAPTIVE OPTICS RETINAL IMAGING SUBSTUDY ONLY: Either eye with GA area &gt;/=7 DA, or has&#xD;
             photosensitivity, or is at high risk for light hazard, or has a multifocal intraocular&#xD;
             lens, or has an optical zone &lt; 5 mm in diameter, or has capsulorhexis smaller than 5&#xD;
             mm. Note: this is not an exclusion criterion for the participant from the study, but&#xD;
             only an exclusion of the participant's eye(s) from Adaptive Optics Retinal Imaging&#xD;
             substudy.&#xD;
