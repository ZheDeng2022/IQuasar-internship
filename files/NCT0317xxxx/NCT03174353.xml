    <textblock>
      This is a single arm investigator-initiated study designed to test the feasibility and&#xD;
      potential efficacy of preoperative lanreotide to reduce the risk of postoperative abscess or&#xD;
      pancreatic leak and fistula. All consenting patients undergoing planned elective&#xD;
      pancreaticoduodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy for malignancy or suspected malignancy will&#xD;
      be treated with a single deep subcutaneous dose of lanreotide prior to planned resection on&#xD;
      the day of surgery. Following this intervention, care will be based on standard treatment&#xD;
      protocols. Sixty-day mortality and morbidity will be collected for all patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients enrolled in this study will receive SOMATULINE DEPOT 120 mg immediately prior to&#xD;
      planned pancreatic resection. The pharmacist will dispense loaded syringes of the study drug.&#xD;
      The single preoperative dose will be given in the pre-surgical center at the University of&#xD;
      Washington by a trained health care professional. The study drug will be injected via the&#xD;
      deep subcutaneous route in the superior external quadrant of the buttock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and efficacy will be assessed throughout the study period. Assessment for pancreatic&#xD;
      and non-pancreatic complications will be made at the time of discharge and in follow-up by&#xD;
      the attending surgeon. Patients will be evaluated in clinic postoperatively within 21 days of&#xD;
      discharge for evaluation of the primary endpoint. The research team will perform long term&#xD;
      follow-up by phone or in person with patients at 30 and 60 days (+/- 10 days at each time&#xD;
      point).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREENING AND ENROLLMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects undergoing planned elective pancreaticoduodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy for&#xD;
      malignancy or suspected malignancy will be identified and screened for eligibility. Eligible&#xD;
      patients who agree to participate will sign a written consent form at this time. At the&#xD;
      initial visit, eligibility will be confirmed and documented in the study record. Informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained prior to enrollment utilizing the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening Visit (Day -60 to -1) Eligible patients will be identified at the Seattle&#xD;
           Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA) and the University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC)&#xD;
           surgical oncology clinics. At the screening visit, the Research Coordinator (RC) or one&#xD;
           of the investigators will obtain signed informed consent. This will take place prior to&#xD;
           any procedures being performed. Subjects will not receive any compensation for&#xD;
           participation in the study. In addition, subjects will not incur any additional costs as&#xD;
           a result of participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Obtain and document consent from potential subject on study consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Review medical history to determine eligibility based on inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Review medications history to determine eligibility based on inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
           criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Perform physical examination: vital signs, weight, height&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Collect, or obtain from routine care records, the following laboratory studies within&#xD;
           30 days prior to treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Complete blood count with white blood cell differential and platelet counts;&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Comprehensive profile; prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time&#xD;
           (PT&amp;PTT)&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
           pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to study drug administration. If the urine test is&#xD;
           positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Preoperative Baseline (Day 0) The baseline visit will take place on the day of surgery,&#xD;
           prior to the patient's operation and administration of the study drug. Some subjects&#xD;
           initially consented into the study may be deemed ineligible on the day of surgery prior&#xD;
           to drug administration. The study team will assess inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to&#xD;
           drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Verify inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Obtain demographic information, medical history/current condition, medication list&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Collect serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential prior to drug&#xD;
           administration, unless testing negative within prior 72 hours (for example, if testing&#xD;
           was performed at Screening Visit within the previous 3 days), or testing has been&#xD;
           performed for routine clinical care&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Draw blood for correlative research (2 light green top tubes (10 ml)) prior to study&#xD;
           drug administration (optional)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Preoperative Drug Administration (Day 0) The study drug will be administered and other&#xD;
           study procedures performed after baseline procedures are conducted; prior to the&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Administer the study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Administer Symptoms Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assess vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Record results of pain on visual analog scale from chart&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Intraoperative&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Draw blood for correlative research (2 light green top tubes (10 ml)) intraoperatively&#xD;
           immediately following resection (optional)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Postoperative Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.a Hospital Stay (Postoperative Days 0-7) Subjects who receive the study drug but do not&#xD;
      have a clinical resection performed during their surgery, will have no additional study&#xD;
      procedures performed. The study team will review adverse events related to the study drug&#xD;
      during the immediate postoperative hospital stay only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who receive the study drug and have a clinical resection will be followed&#xD;
      postoperatively for 60 days. The initial postoperative assessment will occur during the&#xD;
      subject's hospital stay. Hospital stays will vary widely by patient, but are expected to&#xD;
      range from 3-7 days. The study team will periodically review the patient chart for safety and&#xD;
      outcomes as available for individual subjects during this timeframe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record adverse events as reported by subject or observed by clinical team and/or&#xD;
           investigator. See section 10.2 for list of information to be reviewed for adverse event&#xD;
           monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain medical history/current condition, medication list on the day of discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record results of physical examination on the day of discharge&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Comprehensive profile; prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time&#xD;
                (PT&amp;PTT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record results of pain on visual analog scale from chart&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administer Symptoms Questionnaire on the day of discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record drain amylase levels from chart, as available&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record drain output in ml from chart, as available&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate for day of drain removal from chart, as available&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.b Clinic Follow-up Visit (Post discharge Days 1-21) Subjects will typically have a&#xD;
           clinical follow-up appointment with their University of Washington (UW) Medicine&#xD;
           surgical provider or an external provider within 1 - 21 days following discharge. There&#xD;
           may be more than one clinical appointment during this timeframe. The study team will&#xD;
           review patient charts and collect information on individual subjects as available from&#xD;
           their clinical care. Subjects who are seen at UW Medicine will receive an in-person&#xD;
           symptoms questionnaire to complete. Subjects who have their follow-up care performed&#xD;
           external to UW Medicine will receive a phone call from the research coordinator (RC)&#xD;
           between 1 and 21 after discharge to complete the symptoms questionnaire by phone.&#xD;
           Records from external institutions will be obtained and reviewed for the time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record adverse events as reported by subject or observed by clinical team and/or&#xD;
           investigator&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Administer Symptoms Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
           6. Long Term Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
           6.a Follow-up Phone Call (Postoperative Days 30 &amp; 60) The RC will follow-up with all&#xD;
           subjects by phone at approximately 30 and 60 days postoperative to identify missed&#xD;
           complications. If the RC identifies a missed complication by phone, the investigator or&#xD;
           co-investigator will then contact the subject with a second phone call to discuss the&#xD;
           reported complications in more detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient charts will be reviewed throughout 60 days postoperative. Some subjects may receive&#xD;
      their follow-up care outside of UW Medicine. In this case, records from external institutions&#xD;
      will be obtained and reviewed for the timeframe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record adverse events as reported by subject or observed by investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain medical history/current condition, medication list&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administer Symptoms Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review clinical charts for complications, as available&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT WITHDRAWAL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may voluntarily withdraw from the study or be dropped from it at the discretion of&#xD;
      the investigator at any time. Patients may be withdrawn from the study if any of the&#xD;
      following occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy discovered after enrollment, but prior to study drug treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Protocol violation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject withdrawal of consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lost to follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do not have clinical resection performed post drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Replacement of Subjects Subjects withdrawn from the study prior to administration&#xD;
                of the study drug will be replaced. Subjects withdrawn from the study after&#xD;
                administration of the study drug and who do not have a clinical resection performed&#xD;
                will not be replaced. Other subjects withdrawn prior to complete 60-day follow up&#xD;
                will not be replaced. If subjects do not respond to phone follow-up at 30 or 60&#xD;
                days, three repeated attempts will be made over the 10 days following each of these&#xD;
                time points. Subjects who have incomplete follow up will be included with limited&#xD;
                follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOSTATISTICS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sample Size and Power&#xD;
&#xD;
           We estimate the final target sample size will be 98 patients. We aim to screen 154&#xD;
           patients and enroll n=123 patients into this single-arm study to test whether treatment&#xD;
           with lanreotide reduces the risk of postoperative pancreatic fistula. Based upon a 20%&#xD;
           probability of not proceeding with surgical resection after drug treatment due to&#xD;
           findings of metastatic or unresectable disease at surgery, we anticipate that 123&#xD;
           treated patients will yield 98 evaluable patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analysis Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a primary method analysis, we will use a one-sample t-test to compare the rate of&#xD;
      postoperative pancreatic fistula among the n=98 patients who were treated with lanreotide and&#xD;
      underwent surgical resection against a published rate of 21% for patients treated with a&#xD;
      placebo in another study, while 9% of patients treated with pasireotide experienced&#xD;
      postoperative pancreatic fistula. The present study has 80% power (one-sided alpha = 0.05) to&#xD;
      detect pancreatic fistula rates smaller than 11.5%, the approximate upper estimate of an 80%&#xD;
      confidence interval of the pancreatic fistula rate of 9% in the study of pasireotide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a secondary exploratory analysis, we will use McNemar's test to compare the pancreatic&#xD;
      fistula rate in the present study to that of historical controls at the same institution&#xD;
      matched on pancreatic firmness and duct size.&#xD;
