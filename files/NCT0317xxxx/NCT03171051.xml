    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the ability of a light emitting diode (LED) study&#xD;
      device's ability to raise the temperatures on flank tissue to a similar level compared to an&#xD;
      approved laser device (SculpSure by Cynosure). Laser treatments have been shown to reduce fat&#xD;
      in the flanks by heating the fat cells and causing them to burst. The contents of the cells&#xD;
      are then cleared naturally by the body.&#xD;

      This is an open-label, feasibility study comparing the tissue temperature profile of a 950 nm&#xD;
      LED device and a 1060 nm diode laser for non-invasive lipolysis of the flanks. The study will&#xD;
      enroll up to 10 subjects requesting non-invasive lipolysis of the flanks. Each subject will&#xD;
      receive a single treatment with each device on opposite flanks. Tissue temperatures in the&#xD;
      treated areas will be recorded at various tissue depths and compared. Subjects will be asked&#xD;
      to assess their discomfort and pain of the study treatment using a 10 cm visual analog scale&#xD;
      (VAS). In addition, the safety (number of treatment related adverse events) of the LED device&#xD;
      will be compared to the reference device at the time of treatment and one week later.&#xD;
