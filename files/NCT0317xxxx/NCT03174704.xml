  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death, affects&#xD;
      over 24 million people in the US and is the leading cause of disability with projected&#xD;
      healthcare costs at almost $50 billion. The goal of this study is to identify novel and&#xD;
      potentially powerful targets for behavioral interventions in COPD which has been understudied&#xD;
      despite its tremendous detrimental impact on overall public health.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has specifically targeted COPD hospital&#xD;
      readmissions as a meaningful quality outcome that could result in financial penalties&#xD;
      highlighting the significant impact of COPD on our overall health system. The growing&#xD;
      availability of efficacious medication, stands in stark contrast to the poor health outcomes&#xD;
      experienced by COPD patients. One possible explanation for this gap is low rates of&#xD;
      medication adherence; some studies report that only 25% of COPD patients take at least 80% of&#xD;
      their prescribed medications. Pharmacy refill records indicate that adherence to COPD&#xD;
      medications is significantly lower than adherence rates seen in other chronic illnesses&#xD;
      including hypertension, diabetes, and congestive heart failure. Significant negative long&#xD;
      term health outcomes may be magnified by non-adherence to prescribed medications in COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to systematically identify modifiable determinants of adherence in COPD&#xD;
      based on the Theory of Self-Regulation in 360 patients with COPD. A novel and significant&#xD;
      innovation of this study is the use of mobile health (mhealth) technology to objectively&#xD;
      assess medication use. No previous study of self-regulation theory has utilized objective&#xD;
      measure of adherence. A further innovation of the study is the use of ecological momentary&#xD;
      assessment (EMA) of patient reported symptoms and beliefs to evaluate longitudinal&#xD;
      associations between observation (patient symptoms) judgements (medication use to relieve&#xD;
      symptoms), and reactions (self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, and medication beliefs) in real&#xD;
      time. This study will be the first to objectively evaluate the application of the&#xD;
      Self-Regulation Theory in COPD and to examine the long-term longitudinal impact of medication&#xD;
      adherence on disease progression in a diverse sample.&#xD;
