  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A deep neuromuscular block (NMB) is often associated with improved surgical conditions&#xD;
      especially in laparoscopic surgery. We previously showed that deep NMB is superior to a&#xD;
      moderate NMB under propofol anesthesia. However, this may not apply to sevoflurane anesthesia&#xD;
      and sevoflurane by itself produces some degree of muscle relaxation. We therefore plan to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of deep NMB on surgical conditions under sevoflurane anesthesia&#xD;
      maintenance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are routinely administered during general anaesthesia&#xD;
      to facilitate endotracheal intubation and to optimize surgical conditions. Increasing data&#xD;
      suggest superiority of a deep neuromuscular block (defined by a post-tetanic count of 1-2&#xD;
      twitches) in creating optimal working conditions for the surgical team. However, it is&#xD;
      unknown whether other aspects of the anaesthetic technique, most notably the choice of&#xD;
      anaesthetic (for example, total intravenous versus inhalational anaesthesia), influence the&#xD;
      relationship between the depth of the neuromuscular block and surgical conditions,&#xD;
      particularly in laparoscopic surgery. Volatile anaesthetics are known for their ability to&#xD;
      potentiate neuromuscular blocking agents an effect that is less existent with propofol. We&#xD;
      previously showed that surgical working conditions in laparoscopic surgery during propofol&#xD;
      anaesthesia are highly reliant on the depth of the neuromuscular block. Whether such a&#xD;
      relationship also exists for inhalational anaesthetics, is unknown. To investigate this, we&#xD;
      conducted a prospective, randomized, double blind study in which patients scheduled for&#xD;
      laparoscopic renal surgery were randomized to receive either a moderate or a deep&#xD;
      neuromuscular block during sevoflurane anaesthesia. The primary outcome was the&#xD;
      intraoperative surgical condition assessed by a surgeon using the validated Leiden-Surgical&#xD;
      Rating Scale. We hypothesized that the use of an inhalational anaesthetic would obviate the&#xD;
      need for a deep NMB due to its intrinsic muscle relaxant potentiating properties to produce&#xD;
      optimal working conditions.&#xD;

The nociception level index consist of Ta multiparameter nonlinear combination of heart rate, heart rate variability, amplitude of the finger photoplethysmogram, skin conductance level, fluctuations in skin conductance, and their time derivatives, derived from random forest regression. Random forest is an algorithmic modeling approach that enables combining multiple parameters of different origin and discovering their complex nonlinear interactions. Normal range is between 10-20; 0 indicates no nociceptive events (in example, pain stimuli), 100 indicates severe painful stimuli.</description>

          <description>Moderate neuromuscular block. In patients that were randomized to receive a moderate neuromuscular block, a bolus dose of rocuronium 0.5 mg kg-1 was administered, followed by intermittent injections of rocuronium 10-20 mg, aimed at keeping the train-of-four count at 1-2 twitches. At the end of the procedure, reversal of the neuromuscular block was by administration of sugammadex (2 mg kg-1).

In case the surgeon scored Leiden-Surgical Rating Scale 1 or 2 (extremely poor or poor conditions), a bolus of rocuronium 10 mg could be administered.

            <title>Moderate Neuromuscular Block</title>
            <description>Moderate neuromuscular block. In patients that were randomized to receive a moderate neuromuscular block, a bolus dose of rocuronium 0.5 mg kg-1 was administered, followed by intermittent injections of rocuronium 10-20 mg, aimed at keeping the train-of-four count at 1-2 twitches. At the end of the procedure, reversal of the neuromuscular block was by administration of sugammadex (2 mg kg-1). Patients were extubated when the train-of-four ratio reached 1.0, were breathing spontaneously and were awake.</description>

            <description>In patients that were randomized to receive a deep neuromuscular block, a bolus dose of rocuronium 1.0 mg kg-1 was administered, followed by a continuous rocuronium infusion. The infusion rate was started at 0.3 mg kg-1 h-1 and titrated to keep the post-tetanic count at 1-2 twitches throughout the procedure. In case the surgeon scored Leiden-Surgical Rating Scale 1 or 2 (extremely poor or poor conditions), a bolus of rocuronium 10 mg could be administered. At the end of the procedure, reversal of the neuromuscular block was achieved with the administration of sugammadex 2-4 mg kg-1. Patients were extubated when the train-of-four ratio reached 1.0.</description>

        <title>Intraoperative Nociception Level</title>
        <description>The median and full range of the average nociception level index will be reported.&#xD;
The nociception level index consist of Ta multiparameter nonlinear combination of heart rate, heart rate variability, amplitude of the finger photoplethysmogram, skin conductance level, fluctuations in skin conductance, and their time derivatives, derived from random forest regression. Random forest is an algorithmic modeling approach that enables combining multiple parameters of different origin and discovering their complex nonlinear interactions. Normal range is between 10-20; 0 indicates no nociceptive events (in example, pain stimuli), 100 indicates severe painful stimuli.</description>
