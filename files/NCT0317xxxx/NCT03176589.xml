  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Positive expiratory pressure( PEP) is routinely given to patients after surgery in order to&#xD;
      improve lung function and oxygen saturation. There is, however, no evidence of effect on lung&#xD;
      function, postoperative pneumonia or any other outcome (Guimarães MMF, Tyson AF). The&#xD;
      investigators aim to test the immediate effects of PEP therapy on oxygen saturation and&#xD;
      carbon dioxide after abdominal surgery. 80 patients will be investigated in RCT design with&#xD;
      expiration using PEP or with expiration to a sham-PEP, a tube without resistance. At the end&#xD;
      of the study we will also measure the effect of 10x3 deep breathing maneuvers without PEP or&#xD;
      shamPEP. Primary outcome: Maximum and minimum levels of continuously measured oxygen&#xD;
      saturation from pulse oximetry and transcutaneous carbon dioxide partial pressure during the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

      Background Hypoxia, reduced lung function and atelectais are common after abdominal surgery&#xD;
      and can be hazardous in patients with chronic hypoxia. Positive expiratory pressure (PEP)&#xD;
      therapy or incentive spirometry are routinely given to patients after abdominal surgery to&#xD;
      counteract atelectasis and improve oxygen saturation. Patients are instructed by a&#xD;
      physiotherapist to take deep inspiratory breaths and expire in a PEP-device or PEP bottle.&#xD;
      The method is used routinely in Swedish hospital and the patient breathes against 10-15 cm&#xD;
      water resistance. This is repeated 10x3 ie 10 deep breaths and exhalation towards PEP then&#xD;
      rest, breath, rest and another 10 breaths. This procedure should be done once an hour after&#xD;
      surgery. The idea is that this will widen alveoli and abolish atelectasis, thus increasing&#xD;
      the oxygen uptake and reducing the risk of postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no evidence of effect of PEP and incentive spirometry on postoperative pulmonary&#xD;
      complications after abdominal surgery (Guimarães MMF, Tyson AF). Nevertheless, PEP therapy is&#xD;
      used in Sweden and internationally. There were no studies found reporting the immediate&#xD;
      effect of PEP on continuous oxygen saturation and carbon dioxide partial pressure after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      What effect does PEP have on oxygen saturation and carbon dioxide partial pressure? What is&#xD;
      the effect of deep breathing maneuvers on oxygen saturation and carbon dioxide partial&#xD;
      pressure?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion: 80 adult patients over 18 years of age who have undergone open or laparoscopic&#xD;
      abdominal surgery. Patients receiving postoperative PEP are asked to participate in the study&#xD;
      at one or two days after after abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion: Patients who cannot participate in using PEP or who do not agree to participate in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation:.It was estimated that 34 patients were needed to detect a mean (SD)&#xD;
      difference in oxygen saturation of 1% (2%) and to detect a difference in transcutaneous PCO2&#xD;
      of 0.5 kPa (1 kPa) with a significance of p &lt; 0.05 and a power of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design / Randomization: RCT study with cross-over design. Patients are randomized using&#xD;
      computer programs, handled by a person outside the study, to either start with either PEP&#xD;
      breathing 10x3 or sham-PEP breathing 10x3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Starting with lung function assessment to determine PEF (Mini Wright Clement Clarke).&#xD;
      Then, application of continuous transcutaneous PCO2 / SaO2 (SenTec Digital Monitoring System,&#xD;
      ResMed) and a respiratory belt around the chest detecting the respiratory rate. Data is&#xD;
      recorded with computer equipment (Noxturnal T3, ResMed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are randomized to initiate with either 10x3 breaths using PEP therapy or 10x3&#xD;
      breaths using Sham PEP. After a rest period, patients switch to the second treatment&#xD;
      (cross-over). At the end of the trial, all patients take 10X3 deep breaths without PEP or&#xD;
      sham PEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of the study, baseline level for SaO2 and TcPCO2 is recorded, and an arterial&#xD;
      blood gas is recorded to calibrate the transcutaneous PCO2 measurement. Thereafter, the&#xD;
      registration continues during breathing / blowing until the patient returns to its baseline&#xD;
      values. New PEF examination is made after each study arm.&#xD;
