  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study builds upon the success of our research program (STU00017005:&#xD;
      Interventions to teach melanoma patients skin self-examination and the continuation&#xD;
      STU0201983) designed to increase early detection of melanomas before they metastasize. This&#xD;
      study seeks to expand the use of our efficacious skin self-examination (SSE) training program&#xD;
      to first-degree relatives with automated support with reminders and the dermatologist&#xD;
      coaching about pictures of moles submitted by user. In 2015 there are more than 1 million&#xD;
      living melanoma patients in the United States (US), and almost 500,000 were age 40-60 years.&#xD;
      If each melanoma patient has 2.79 first-degree relatives (children, and siblings of melanoma&#xD;
      patients), then there are 2.79 million first-degree relatives and 1 million melanoma patients&#xD;
      or 3.79 million people at-risk to develop melanoma, who are predominantly non-Hispanic White.&#xD;
      A first-degree relative (FDR) is the parent, sibling or child of a melanoma patient. In 2015,&#xD;
      approximately 73,870 individuals in the US will be diagnosed with invasive melanoma and about&#xD;
      9,940 will die from the disease. People with a history of melanoma have 10 times greater risk&#xD;
      of developing a second new melanoma relative to the general population. A first-degree&#xD;
      relative of a melanoma patient (parent, child, sibling) has an 8 times greater chance of&#xD;
      developing melanoma. Early detection with surgical excision at an early stage when treatment&#xD;
      is usually more effective is the only proven curative strategy. Thus, enhanced surveillance&#xD;
      for melanoma patients and screening for their first-degree relatives, who have the same skin&#xD;
      type (skin that easily sunburns) and melanoma-risk habits (sunny vacations) as the melanoma&#xD;
      survivor, has the potential to detect melanomas in the early stages where treatment prognosis&#xD;
      is optimal. Indeed, several societies recommend routine screening by a physician for persons&#xD;
      with a family history of melanoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The melanoma diagnosis represents a patchwork of transitions for the family with the&#xD;
      opportunity to promote early detection in the first-degree relatives of melanoma patients.&#xD;
      While family communication is a promising way to promote risk awareness and provide skills&#xD;
      training in skin self-examination (SSE), knowing about a family member with a history of&#xD;
      melanoma is no guarantee that a relative will accept their risk or act to minimize their risk&#xD;
      by performing SSE. Indeed performance of SSE by people at-risk to develop melanoma ranges&#xD;
      from 39% to 50%. Family separation by distance can now be overcome with technology (Skype,&#xD;
      Facetime), but support for melanoma patients, who frame the risk of developing melanoma for&#xD;
      their relatives, does not exist. The melanoma patient needs to be a) confident in their&#xD;
      ability to communicate with at-risk relatives, b) able to reassure their loved one(s) that&#xD;
      they can learn to do a skin check and perform it well, and c) supported in their decisions&#xD;
      about pigmented lesions (moles) by ready access to a physician. The tools to learn how to&#xD;
      check for melanoma with the assistance of a partner to see locations that are difficult for a&#xD;
      person to see on their own body, e.g. the back and tops of the ears have been developed and&#xD;
      validated by Robinson et al. Now, we will use of informatics technology of the proven&#xD;
      physician-to-physician consultation of the Vibrent Mobile Telederm system to provide&#xD;
      first-degree relatives of melanoma patients with education about their risk of developing&#xD;
      melanoma and the importance of early detection, teach the skills to perform SSE, provide&#xD;
      diaries for home use and access to a dermatologist. The first-degree relative will download&#xD;
      the Eviderma Smart Phone Teledermatology Application (Eviderma), learn how to perform SSE,&#xD;
      and self-report their adherence to their care plan by reporting their SSE results, and send&#xD;
      the dermatologist a picture of one pigmented lesion (mole) each month with scores of the&#xD;
      features and a decision about whether it is concerning, and the dermatologist will recommend&#xD;
      next steps. The first-degree relative will benefit from automated self-service supported via&#xD;
      tailored content and evidence-based health literacy and educational content. This program&#xD;
      gives the first-degree relative of the melanoma patient the right information at the right&#xD;
      time to learn the skills needed to detect concerning lesions without unnecessary visits to&#xD;
      the doctor, thus, saving cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To expand the uptake of an efficacious evidence-based SSE training program to&#xD;
           first-degree relatives with the Eviderma program.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Eviderma develops materials for the first-degree relatives of melanoma patients,&#xD;
                and improves their education and awareness of the risk of developing melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assess engagement of first-degree relatives within the Eviderma program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the efficacy of the Eviderma program for melanoma patients' first-degree&#xD;
           relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A randomized controlled trial with the first-degree relatives of melanoma patients&#xD;
                diagnosed with Stage 0-IIIA within the last five years&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assess change from baseline to 4 months in: a) knowledge about melanoma b)&#xD;
                perception of risk of developing melanoma and importance of early detection b) SSE&#xD;
                skills c) SSE performance, d) physician visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine for whom the Eviderma program works best/least by assessing baseline&#xD;
           perceived risk, importance of melanoma and its early detection, SSE self-efficacy and&#xD;
           sex moderate SSE performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assess health care expenditures of first-degree relatives using the Eviderma program in&#xD;
           comparison with controls for the cost of visits with the primary care physician and&#xD;
           dermatologist, including biopsy of lesions and their pathology&#xD;
