    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and how well atezolizumab works in combination&#xD;
      with temozolomide and radiation therapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      glioblastoma. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the&#xD;
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,&#xD;
      or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy beams to kill tumor&#xD;
      cells and shrink tumors. It is not yet known how well atezolizumab works in combination with&#xD;
      temozolomide and radiation therapy in treating patients with glioblastoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety of atezolizumab in combination with radiation and temozolomide&#xD;
      during the concurrent stage and in combination with temozolomide during the adjuvant stage.&#xD;
      (Phase I) II. To evaluate the overall survival (OS) of atezolizumab in combination with&#xD;
      radiation and temozolomide and in combination with temozolomide at onset of treatment. (Phase&#xD;
      II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR), duration of response, and progression free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) of atezolizumab in combination with radiation and temozolomide during the&#xD;
      treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Profiling tumor immune cell populations (example: immunohistochemistry [IHC] analyses of&#xD;
      CD4, CD8, programmed death-1 [PD-1], programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1], and PD-L2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Profiling of tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA),&#xD;
      microRNA and epigenetic profiling (DNA methylation) and evaluation of whole exome sequencing,&#xD;
      RNA sequencing, microRNA sequencing and cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Peripheral blood collection for evaluation of circulating chemokines/cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I study followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE I (CONCURRENT PHASE): Patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) daily on days 1-42 and&#xD;
      atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1, 15, 29, and 42. Patients undergo&#xD;
      radiation therapy (RT) 5 days per week (Monday-Friday) for 6 weeks in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE II (ADJUVANT PHASE): Patients receive temozolomide PO on days 1-5 and atezolizumab IV&#xD;
      over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
