          1. Men or women of at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Osteoarthritis (OA) of knee or hip diagnosed since at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Affiliated with national welfare.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Reliable and willing to make themselves available for the duration of the study and&#xD;
             are willing to follow study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have given written informed consent approved by the relevant Ethics Committee&#xD;
             governing the study sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pain scores reported during the baseline period preceding randomization with a mean&#xD;
             APS on the last 14 reported values before Visit 2 between 3.6 and 8.4 inclusive and to&#xD;
             have completed at least 2/3 of each pain score in their diary between Visit 1 and&#xD;
             Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient with a unilateral or bilateral OA of the knee or hip diagnosed according to&#xD;
             the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria based on clinical and radiographic&#xD;
             evidence (Altman et al., 1986) (in case of bilateral OA or OA of both knee and hip,&#xD;
             the joint to consider should be the most affected one). The clinical diagnosis of OA&#xD;
             will be confirmed by the ACR clinical criteria and medical imaging criteria for&#xD;
             classification of OA of the knee or hip based upon the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Knee or hip pain as an average at least half of the time for the last 3 months&#xD;
                  before screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. OA of the knee, at least 1 of the following 3 conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. age &gt; 50, ii. morning stiffness &lt;30 minutes, iii. crepitus on active motion and&#xD;
             osteophytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             OA of the hip, at least 2 of the following 3 conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. erythrocyte sedimentation rate &lt; 20mm/hour, ii. femoral and/or acetabular&#xD;
             osteophytes, iii. joint space narrowing (superior, axial, and/or medial). c. Kellgren&#xD;
             and Lawrence grade &gt; 1 as assessed by a recent medical imaging of the referred joint&#xD;
             to confirm the diagnosis. If no imaging available, a new anterior- posterior view will&#xD;
             be obtained and reviewed by Investigator or his/her delegate(s) to verify that the&#xD;
             patient meets the disease diagnostic criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Change in the &quot; regular analgesic therapy &quot; or introduction of a &quot; regular analgesic&#xD;
             therapy &quot; (if none beforehand) for OA in the last 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 or during&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Invariable pain scores reported between Visit 1 and Visit 2 (systematically the same&#xD;
             minimum score reported all along, the same mean score reported all along and the same&#xD;
             maximum score reported all along).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Have initiated (or plan to initiate) a program (or modify an existing program in&#xD;
             frequency and/or intensity) of physiotherapy or behavioral therapy such as pain&#xD;
             self-management, hypnosis, sophrology, meditation program within 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
             Visit 1 or during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Pregnant, breastfeeding, or willing to be pregnant during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients with a current or recent history, as determined by the Investigator, of&#xD;
             severe, progressive, and/or uncontrolled renal, hepatic, hematological,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurological, or cerebral disease&#xD;
             which would interfere with the patient's participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Uncontrolled epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Any current primary psychiatric condition, including depression or personality&#xD;

             phencyclidine).&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Any other relevant medical disorder/acute disease state/pain condition like&#xD;
             fibromyalgia, lumbalgia, generalized OA judged by the Investigator as likely to&#xD;
             interfere with the trial or represent a risk for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Any close relationship with the Investigators or the Sponsor (i.e. belonging to&#xD;
             immediate family or subordination link).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Under legal protection, according to the national law.&#xD;

&#xD;
         20. Patient currently enrolled in a clinical trial involving use of an investigational&#xD;
             drug or device, or concurrently enrolled in any other type of medical research judged&#xD;
             not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study, or in an exclusion&#xD;
             period according to the national law.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Have planned total knee or hip replacement intervention of the referred joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Reduced mobility due to OA (use of lower extremity assistive devices other than a cane&#xD;
             or a knee sleeve such as crutches or walker or a knee brace or a &quot;shoe lift&quot; in&#xD;
             relation to OA is not allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;

             study; Intra-muscular corticosteroid injections or Intra-articular injection of&#xD;
             steroids into the referred knee/hip within 3 months before Visit 1 or during the&#xD;
             study; Intra-articular injection of corticosteroids into any other sites than the&#xD;
             referred knee/hip within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 or during the study (corticosteroids&#xD;
             in topical use are allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Have used viscosupplementation or intra articular injection of hyaluronic acid in the&#xD;
             referred joint within 3 months prior to Visit 1 or plan to use during the study.&#xD;
