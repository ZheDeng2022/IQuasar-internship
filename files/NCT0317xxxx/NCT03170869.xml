  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will be to prospectively evaluate the outcomes of patients with&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who undergo DEB-TACE (drug-eluting bead trans-arterial&#xD;
      chemoembolization) with the Surefire Precision Infusion System for intentional effect of&#xD;
      down-staging patients to OLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with HCC and who are considered candidates for liver transplantation but outside&#xD;
      Milancriteria and meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the prospective single&#xD;
      arm study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the prospective cohort will be compared to matched historical control patients who&#xD;
      were previously treated with DEB-TACE, delivered with standard endhole catheters. This&#xD;
      includes all patients treated at the University of Colorado since 2009 treated with 100-300&#xD;
      micron beads for whom follow-up is available.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institution prospective clinical trial with historical matched controls.&#xD;
      This protocol standardizes DEB-TACE delivery with the Surefire Precision Infusion System.&#xD;
      This protocol does not change patient therapy. All patient safety monitoring, treatment&#xD;
      procedures and follow-up procedures will be performed in accordance with standard clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty (50) subjects will be enrolled in the prospective arm. Data from one hundred (100)&#xD;
      historical randomly sampled control subjects (1:2 ratio) will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, then every 3 months, following the&#xD;
      initial DEB-TACE procedure until the subject receives a liver transplant or death. The study&#xD;
      will be concluded upon completion of enrollment and follow-up of the 50 patients. It is&#xD;
      estimated that the time to complete patient enrollment and follow-up is 24 months. The&#xD;
      estimated date for study completion (complete primary analyses) is June 2018. This is based&#xD;
      on the average survival vs. time to transplant at this center. If there are individual&#xD;
      patients that extend beyond this period the time may be slightly extended.&#xD;

    <description>The study duration for each patient is 24 months and includes a baseline visit, procedure visit and follow-up visits at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and every 3 months until liver transplant or death.&#xD;
The following evaluations/activities will be performed at baseline: Informed consent, history, physical exam, data collection of CT/ MRI within 1 month of the visit date, data collection of lab values and quality of life questionnaire.&#xD;
The treatment visit includes the DEB-TACE procedure with the Surefire Precision Infusion System. After the procedure, a Cone Beam CT of the liver will be performed to determine distribution and density of the beads in the tumor and adverse events monitoring.&#xD;
The following evaluations / activities will be performed during the follow-up period: physical exam, data collection of contrast enhanced CT/MRI to evaluate tumor response, data collection of lab values, adverse event monitoring and quality of life questionnaire.</description>

    <description>All patients enrolled in this protocol will receive DEB-TACE, which is the standard of care prescribed by their physician. Standard 5 Fr and 3 Fr catheters will be used to perform diagnostic angiography to map the hepatic vasculature to the tumor. Using standard technique, the target vessel feeding the tumor will be catheterized and DEB-TACE administered using the Surefire Precision catheter. The Doxorubicin dosing used in the DEB-TACE will be based upon tumor volume. DEB-TACE will be administered until the first of the following endpoints are reached: Achievement of target dose with stasis, leeching of contrast through the expandable tip and development of distal intrahepatic collaterals.</description>
