  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a metabolic disorder that has gradually become a prevalent public health problem&#xD;
      and is becoming one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. The most&#xD;
      efficacious therapy for morbid obesity today is bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery&#xD;
      increases life expectancy by correcting the comorbidities associated with obesity, improves&#xD;
      the quality of life, and is associated with reduced morbidity and mortality. There is an&#xD;
      increase application of laparoscopic procedures as it is considered to cause less pain than&#xD;
      traditional open surgery, smaller incision, reduced blood loss and shorter postoperative&#xD;
      stay, which cuts down on hospital cost. However, postoperative pain still exists causing&#xD;
      unpleasant experience for the patient and at times causes a delayed discharge. Pain after&#xD;
      bariatric surgery is a result of many mechanisms such as tissue injury, abdominal distention,&#xD;
      local trauma of the stomach, chemical irritation of the peritoneum, and the pneumoperitoneum&#xD;
      and this pain potentially can prolong hospital stay and lead to increased morbidity, and&#xD;
      bariatric surgeons are striving to minimize the morbidity of current procedures to improve&#xD;
      patient outcomes and this gave rise to the use of intraperitoneal local anesthetics (LA). It&#xD;
      was found that the use of intraperitoneal LA in laparoscopic cholecystectomy is safe, and it&#xD;
      results in a statistically significant reduction in early postoperative abdominal pain. Many&#xD;
      studies were done to evaluate the efficacy of intraperitoneal LA in laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy, gynecologic procedures and appendectomy but to date there are limited&#xD;
      studies done to evaluate the role of intraperitoneal LA in bariatric surgery. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the effectiveness of intraperitoneal instillation of local ropivacaine&#xD;
      on postoperative abdominal pain after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). We hypothesized&#xD;
      that the administration of intraperitoneal instillation of local ropivacaine would help&#xD;
      reduce postoperative pain.&#xD;

      Recruitment will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized study in patients age 18&#xD;
      and above going for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). The study will involve two groups&#xD;
      with equal allocation of patients in the test group (local anaesthesia) and control group&#xD;
      (normal saline) by randomization. All patient will need to be evaluated by our&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team before randomization. Each patient going for an elective LSG will be&#xD;
      informed regarding this research study, and the final decision will solely be made based on&#xD;
      patients' willingness. All patients who agree to participate in this study will be randomized&#xD;
      into one of the study groups. The patients will also be made aware that this is an&#xD;
      experimental trial and both verbal and written informed consent will be taken before&#xD;
      treatment. In addition, the patients will be informed regarding the use of the clinical and&#xD;
      analytical data for publication purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will not be given access to the study data however they will be informed regarding&#xD;
      their progress during every follow-up visit. All research data will be kept in our hard disk&#xD;
      as well as our web-based storage (i-cloud and i-drive) for two years. Study data will be held&#xD;
      even after the study period as there will still be a continuous follow-up with the patients&#xD;
      for life. However, all patients' information obtained from this study will be kept and&#xD;
      handled in a confidential manner, by applicable laws and regulations. When publishing or&#xD;
      presenting the study results, the identity of patients will not be revealed without patient's&#xD;
      expressed consent. Participants will also be covered under clinical trial insurance from the&#xD;
      institution during the study period. In the case of emergency, all patients will be given the&#xD;
      contact number of the investigator as the investigator are contactable throughout the day.&#xD;
      This study will begin after receiving the approval of Medical Research &amp; Ethics Committee,&#xD;
      Ministry of Health Malaysia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer generated randomization will be done using Interactive Web Response Technology.&#xD;
      There will be equal chances for patients to be assigned to either one of the study groups.&#xD;
      The result of the randomization will be kept in envelopes and viewed by the research&#xD;
      assistant who did not otherwise participate in this study, were unknown to the investigators&#xD;
      and the patients, and the answer will be contained in a set of sealed envelopes. After&#xD;
      admitting the patient into the operating room and just before the surgery was done, the&#xD;
      numbered envelope will be opened by the operating theater nurse and the card inside&#xD;
      determined which group the patient would be placed. The operating theater nurse will then&#xD;
      prepare either 20mL of 150mg ropivacaine in 180mL normal saline (for test group) or 200mL&#xD;
      normal saline (for control group) using a standard syringe and the syringe will be given to&#xD;
      the surgeon who then injects the solution through a catheter along the greater curvature and&#xD;
      left subdiaphragmatic region of the stomach. The general anesthetic used for all patients&#xD;
      will be a combination of 1gm IV Paracetamol, 40mg IV Parecoxib and IV Fentamyl prepared&#xD;
      according to patient's adjusted body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will need to be admitted to the hospital one day before the scheduled surgery date.&#xD;
      Participating patients that are allergic to local anesthetic ropivacaine will be excluded&#xD;
      from this study. However, if patients have allergy due to the medication after surgery,&#xD;
      anti-allergic medication will be administered to the patients upon investigation. After the&#xD;
      surgery, the medical doctors or nurses in the ward that is not otherwise involved in this&#xD;
      research will assess and record the pain score using visual analog scale (VAS) (0-10). A&#xD;
      score of 0 means no pain, whereas a score of 10 equals the worst pain ever experienced.&#xD;
      Post-operative pain will be rated on a VAS at rest and cough. The time of arrival in the&#xD;
      postoperative recovery room will be defined as zero hours postoperatively. The patients will&#xD;
      be asked about the location of pain, whether at the shoulder, incision sites, and/or inside&#xD;
      the abdomen by the medical doctors or nurses. The abdomen and shoulder tip pain intensity&#xD;
      will be rated at two, four, six, eight, 24 and 48 hours postoperatively. The analgesic&#xD;
      requirement during the 48 hours after the surgery will also be noted by the medical doctor or&#xD;
      nurses in the ward. The duration of patients' participation in the study will only be for two&#xD;
      days postoperative. However, patients still need to come for follow-up after surgery. The&#xD;
      standard follow-up includes a visit to the outpatient clinic at 1, 2, 3, 4 weeks after&#xD;
      surgery, then 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 months and after that, a life-long annual visit. Adverse&#xD;
      events (eg. post-operative bleeding and stapler leak) will be monitored closely at 1, 2, 3,&#xD;
      and 4 weeks after surgery. In any occurrence of an adverse event, it will be documented and&#xD;
      reported within 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Estimation The sample size was estimated with the help of PS software (power and&#xD;
      sample size calculation software) 3.0.43 with a power of 80% and a significant level of 0.05.&#xD;
      The estimation was based on Visual Analog Score (VAS) with assuming 50% of difference in mean&#xD;
      postoperative pain score. The total estimated sample size is 22 patients in each arm for our&#xD;
      study. However, with the inclusion of 20% drop out rate, the total number of patients needed&#xD;
      for this study is 27 patients in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Statistical calculations will be performed using the standard statistical&#xD;
      software package, IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp. All&#xD;
      data will be expressed as mean values and standard deviation, with the exception of rescue&#xD;
      analgesic treatment and the occurrence of shoulder tip pain that will be in percentages (%).&#xD;
      Median and interquartile range (IQR) will be calculated for all not normally distributed&#xD;
      continuous variables. Non-parametric tests such as Mann-Whitney U test and/orKruskall-Wallis&#xD;
      test will be used for non-normal distribution of variables. Associations between qualitative&#xD;
      variables will be determined by Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and SAS Exact&#xD;
      Contingency Table. In all statistical analyses, p-value of &lt; 0.05 (95% confidence interval)&#xD;
      was considered to be statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Ethics Ethical clearance will be obtained from the Medical Research Ethic Committee of&#xD;
      the Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Putra Malaysia and Kuala Lumpur General Hospital. This&#xD;
      study will be submitted for National Medical Research Register (NMRR). Respondent consent&#xD;
      will be obtained from each participant of study.&#xD;
