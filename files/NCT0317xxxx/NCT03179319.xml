  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is testing the acceptability and feasibility of MyChoices, a mobile application&#xD;
      (app), to promote HIV testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake among young men who&#xD;
      have sex with men (YMSM).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &quot;MyChoices&quot;, an app adapted from HealthMindr and developed using iterative feedback from&#xD;
      youth, is being refined to to maximize acceptability among YMSM. &quot;MyChoices&quot; was guided by&#xD;
      the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) model and includes three major functions that are designed&#xD;
      to promote self-efficacy, self-regulation, goal-setting and environmental influences in order&#xD;
      to impact behavior change. (1) Tracking and Self-Monitoring HIV Risk: In order to target&#xD;
      self-regulation, brief surveys within the app are used to assess behavioral patterns of YMSM,&#xD;
      particularly around sexual relationships, which are then used to help customize the app for&#xD;
      each user. (2) HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) Prevention Information: In order&#xD;
      to improve self-efficacy for HIV testing and HIV prevention overall, quizzes and infographics&#xD;
      that appeal to YMSM have been incorporated into the app, focusing on promotion of HIV&#xD;
      prevention and regular HIV testing. The app also allows users to order OraQuick HIV home&#xD;
      testing kits and STI home collection kits (for rectal and urethral gonorrhea and Chlamydia&#xD;
      and syphilis). Additionally, the app includes information on testing sites and local PrEP&#xD;
      clinics (e.g., telephone, address, hours of testing, etc), and external links to specific&#xD;
      site webpages that are near the user (determined using GPS technology). (3) HIV Testing Plan:&#xD;
      Acknowledging the central role of goal setting and environmental influences on health&#xD;
      behavior, the app allows users to create a HIV testing plan by allowing them to compare and&#xD;
      choose different screening options (e.g., home self-testing, antigen, rapid). Questions about&#xD;
      HIV transmission behaviors and testing history are then asked to create a tailored testing&#xD;
      plan. After a HIV testing plan is developed, users have the option to customize reminders for&#xD;
      the timeframe selected (e.g., user is pinged every 3 months as a reminder to get tested).&#xD;
      Users are able to select from a list of phrases or create their own to ensure privacy.&#xD;
      Moreover, geofencing technology allows users to be notified when in the vicinity of testing&#xD;
      locations, based on the Geo Positioning System (GPS) location, during the testing timeframe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is part of the iTech NIH U19, which has an overall goal to develop innovative&#xD;
      technology-focused interventions addressing the HIV prevention and care continuum for youth.&#xD;

    <description>System Usability Scale: a validated scale that assesses subjective usability of a system, or, in this case, an app. The System Usability Scale consists of a 10 item questionnaire with five response options; from Strongly agree to Strongly disagree. The items scores are converted into a score from 0 (negative) to 100 (positive). A score of ≥50 indicates that the app is acceptable, and a score above 68 is considered above average.</description>

    <ipd_description>Raw data will be available to outside individuals through contacting the multiple principal investigators (MPIs) at two different times. The first will be after all of the baseline data is collected. The investigators will institute a concept plan process where internal study staff first have the availability to write primary papers or give presentations on particular topics. After this, if outside individuals wish to analyze data, the investigators will welcome this collaboration. A similar process will happen for outcome data; however this will not be possible until the publication and release of the outcome paper(s). Information regarding the availability of data for analysis will be listed on the MPIs' web pages. Contact information for the MPIs will be listed in all manuscripts and publications as another means to access data.</ipd_description>

        <title>Acceptability: System Usability Scale</title>
        <description>System Usability Scale: a validated scale that assesses subjective usability of a system, or, in this case, an app. The System Usability Scale consists of a 10 item questionnaire with five response options; from Strongly agree to Strongly disagree. The items scores are converted into a score from 0 (negative) to 100 (positive). A score of ≥50 indicates that the app is acceptable, and a score above 68 is considered above average.</description>

        <population>Given that this measure is directly related to the MyChoices app, only those who were randomized to the MyChoices app arm were eligible to respond to this outcome; One person had missing data for this item.</population>
