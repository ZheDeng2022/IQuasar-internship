      This is a 5 year Phase II study to evaluate the safety of non-operative management (NOM) in&#xD;
      patients with low rectal cancer (LRC) who achieve a complete clinical response (cCR)&#xD;
      following chemoradiotherapy (CRT). The safety of NOM will be evaluated by assessing (i) rate&#xD;
      of local re-growth and (ii) rate of macroscopically positive resection margin (R2) when&#xD;
      surgery is required due to local re-growth. NOM will be considered safe or as effective as&#xD;
      surgery to achieve local control if the rate of local re-growth is equal to or less than 30%&#xD;
      and the rate of a macroscopically positive margin is 0%.&#xD;

      Background: The standard treatment for low rectal cancer (LRC) involving the anal sphincter&#xD;
      involves combined, pre-operative chemotherapy and radiotherapy (CRT) followed by surgery.&#xD;
      Surgery involves removal of the rectum and anus and creation of a permanent colostomy and has&#xD;
      significant long term effects on bowel and sexual function and body image. Because of the&#xD;
      high morbidity of surgery, there has been increasing interest in non-operative management&#xD;
      (NOM) for LRC. The NOM approach involves deferral of surgery and active surveillance of all&#xD;
      patients with LRC who have achieved a complete clinical response (i.e., have no residual&#xD;
      tumour) following completion CRT which occurs in approximately 30% of patients. To date,&#xD;
      while there have been a few, prospective single institution studies that have shown&#xD;
      favourable results with NOM, this approach has not been adopted into clinical practice due to&#xD;
      concerns from physicians about the safety of NOM based on the limited evidence available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Therefore, the objective of this study is to conduct a pan-Canadian Phase II&#xD;
      trial to assess the safety of NOM for LRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: All patients with LRC requiring surgery and a permanent colostomy being treated at&#xD;
      the participating centres will be assessed for complete clinical response (cCR) eight to ten&#xD;
      weeks following the completion of CRT by the treating surgeon. For the study, a cCR will be&#xD;
      defined as (i) no palpable tumour on digital rectal exam, (ii) no residual tumour defined as&#xD;
      white-yellow, flat scar on endoscopy, (iii) no residual tumour on MRI, (iv) no suspicious&#xD;
      mesorectal or extramesorectal lymph nodes on MRI and (v) normal CEA level. Patients who meet&#xD;
      all of these criteria for cCR will be invited to participate in the study. Patients who&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study will undergo active surveillance that will include DRE,&#xD;
      endoscopy and pelvic MRI every 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months; CEA levels every 3, 6, 9, 12,&#xD;
      15, 18, 21, 24 months and CT chest/abdomen and pelvis every 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. The&#xD;
      primary outcome for the study will be the rate of local re-growth 2 years following the&#xD;
      completion of CRT. Local re-growth will be defined as failure to meet the cCR criteria at any&#xD;
      time point. NOM will be considered safe, if the rate of local re-growth is less than 30% two&#xD;
      years after the completion of CRT. The secondary outcomes for the study will be the rate of&#xD;
      distant recurrence, disease free and overall survival at 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The results of this study will be highly clinically relevant since it is&#xD;
      expected that NOM for LRC will be safe and will have significant potential to change clinical&#xD;
      practice in Canada and North America since approximately 30% of patients with LRC would be&#xD;
      able to safely avoid surgery and a permanent colostomy and have improved bowel and sexual&#xD;
      function and body image. Furthermore, widespread adoption of NOM has the potential to&#xD;
      increase health care capacity and decrease treatment costs by reducing the number of&#xD;
      surgeries, hospital admissions and costs associated with both surgery and long term surgical&#xD;
      morbidity.&#xD;
