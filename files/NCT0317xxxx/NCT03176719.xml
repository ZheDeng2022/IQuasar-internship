  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has long been recognized that the positive effects of vaccination on childhood mortality&#xD;
      cannot be solely attributed to a decline in the disease targeted by the vaccine. These&#xD;
      so-called non-specific effects of vaccination have so far mostly been linked to mortality.&#xD;
      However, it has been suggested that non-specific effects may also effect morbidity and&#xD;
      nutritional status. This study aims to further explore the correlation between vaccination,&#xD;
      susceptibility to infectious diseases (particularly malaria and bacterial infections),&#xD;
      nutritional status and immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this prospective cross sectional study among healthy individuals in rural west-Africa we&#xD;
      aim to address several research questions at the same time. This study will assess the&#xD;
      influence of (time-point of) vaccination on morbidity, mortality and immune status among&#xD;
      healthy individuals in a rural sub-Saharan African setting. Secondly, to explore the&#xD;
      prevalence of subclinical malaria, iron deficiency anemia, sickle cell anemia and thallasemia&#xD;
      among a healthy rural sub-Saharan African population. And finally to assess normal&#xD;
      hemocytometry values among a healthy rural sub-Saharan African population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A cross sectional study among healthy participants randomly selected from the population&#xD;
      living in the Nanoro HDSS cohort to (a) study the relation between vaccination and morbidity&#xD;
      (including hemoglobin levels, subclinical malaria and stunting) (b) perform hemocytometry in&#xD;
      order to determine reference values for that population and estimate the prevalence and&#xD;
      causes of anemia, using reference values from other Sub-Sahara Africa countries and&#xD;
      industrialized countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a cross sectional study among a healthy population in the Nanoro HDSS cohort,&#xD;
      hemocytometry will be performed in order to define normal values for that population. In&#xD;
      addition, hemoglobin levels can be related to the presence of iron deficiency, thalassemia&#xD;
      and malaria and be corrected for important confounding factors, such as the family income,&#xD;
      family composition, distance to a healthcare center and vaccination status. This study will&#xD;
      allow to assess simultaneously the normal range of hemoglobin values, the prevalence of&#xD;
      (different causes of) anemia, the prevalence of subclinical malaria parasitemia, as well as&#xD;
      the influence of (timepoint of) vaccination on all these issues. It is hypothized that early&#xD;
      vaccination with live attenuated vaccines has a protective effect against malaria and other&#xD;
      severe infectious diseases and will result in a better nutritional status, a higher&#xD;
      hemoglobin level and a higher threshold of subclinical parasitemia. The protective effect of&#xD;
      early vaccination with live attenuated vaccines may be due to the long-term modulation of the&#xD;
      immune system through epigenetic changes causing a right balance between the pro- and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory responses. Such balance can be determined by ex-vivo stimulation of whole&#xD;
      blood by a variety of stimuli, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and lipopolysaccharide&#xD;
      from Escherichia coli, followed by measurement of ex vivo cytokine production. Previous&#xD;
      studies among healthy volunteers in the Netherlands have shown that BCG is indeed capable to&#xD;
      induce epigenetic changes and influence immune response by influencing various pathways&#xD;
      including through genetic variations in mTOR, HK2, PFKP, GLS, and GLUD1/2 (ref).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new Sysmex analysers are not only capable to determine hemocytometry, but are at the same&#xD;
      time capable to detect malaria parasites directly. Interestingly, not only the asexual stages&#xD;
      of the parasites are detected but the gametocytes as well. This may be very important as&#xD;
      gametocyte carriers are known to play a crucial role in malaria transmission. Gametocytes are&#xD;
      presently detected by light microscopy or by PCR, however these techniques are limited; the&#xD;
      sensitivity of light microscopy is relatively low and PCR is too complex to perform in most&#xD;
      rural sub-Saharan African settings. The new Sysmex hematology analysers are easy to operate&#xD;
      at low costs and may as such become an important tool for malaria elimination programs. No&#xD;
      data are presently available about gametocyte density in Burkina Faso in a large population,&#xD;
      nor is the lower level of detection of gametocytes using the sysmex analyzers known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research has four main objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To perform hemocytometry among a healthy rural Burkina Faso population selected from the&#xD;
           Nanoro HDSS cohort, in order to determine reference values for that population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To perform hemocytometry among a healthy rural Burkina Faso population selected from the&#xD;
           Nanoro HDSS cohort, in order to estimate the prevalence and causes of anemia, using&#xD;
           reference values from other Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA) countries and industrialized&#xD;
           countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study the relation between (timepoint of) vaccination and morbidity (including&#xD;
           hemoglobin levels, subclinical malaria, bacterial infection and stunting) among a&#xD;
           healthy rural Burkina Faso population selected from the Nanoro HDSS cohort. For this&#xD;
           objective the population will be stratified by birth cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To perform ex-vivo whole blood stimulation to assess differences in immune response&#xD;
           between patientgroups with a different vaccination status, within a healthy rural&#xD;
           Burkina Faso population selected from the Nanoro HDSS cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
           Seondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess the detection limit of gametocyte carriages for the new series Sysmex&#xD;
           hematology analyzers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To assess if Salmonella resides in blood as a reservoir for invasive infection among a&#xD;
           rural Burkina Faso population selected from the Nanoro HDSS cohort.&#xD;

        A total of 5 groups will be selected. Each age group will consist of 220 participant&#xD;
        (including 20% for potential non response). The survey will be conducted among 24 villages.&#xD;
        Demographic age distribution is comparable for each of the villages. In order to prevent&#xD;
        bias, a proportionate number of participants will be selected from each village based on&#xD;
        its total population. Participants will then be randomly selected from each sample stratum&#xD;
