  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 300,000 people die each year in France from a disease that may require palliative&#xD;
      care. Nevertheless, only a small proportion of these patients are able to access this care,&#xD;
      in particular because of a too late identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While several factors may hinder access to specialized palliative care resources, one of the&#xD;
      major barriers to the initiation of palliative care, and particularly to the implementation&#xD;
      of quality end-of-life care, Remains the failure to recognize that patients with advanced&#xD;
      chronic illness are actually approaching the end of their lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it is now clearly established that early integration of palliative care in the care&#xD;
      of people living with a serious, incurable and progressive disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  has an impact on the quality (and sometimes the expectation) of life of these people,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  avoids aggressive treatments and unplanned hospitalizations,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is associated with lower health costs than other end-of-life patients. Primary health&#xD;
           care providers have a major role to play in facilitating access to palliative care, but&#xD;
           their practice has been hampered in our country by the fragmented and poorly coordinated&#xD;
           nature of primary care and Negligible in terms of training. However, they remain the&#xD;
           first contact of the patients with the system of care, and are also structuring for the&#xD;
           continuation of the patient's journey within the health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first hypothesis is that the work of genuine interprofessional primary care teams in&#xD;
      multi-professional health centers (MSPs), coupled with adequate training in the use of simple&#xD;
      tools, can contribute to the early identification of patients approaching End of life, to&#xD;
      meet their palliative care needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, various European programs (Gold Standards Framework in the UK, NECPAL in Catalonia,&#xD;
      RADPAC in the Netherlands) have shown that identification alone is not enough to increase&#xD;
      access to specialized palliative care. The second hypothesis is that it must be articulated&#xD;
      for this with a training of the professionals to carry out conversations of anticipated&#xD;
      planning of the care with their patients.&#xD;
