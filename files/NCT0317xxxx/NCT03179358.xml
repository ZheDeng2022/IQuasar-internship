  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In colorectal surgery, hand suturing and stapling are routine methods for performing&#xD;
      intestinal anastomoses, and these methods appear to be similar in terms of clinical safety.&#xD;
      Despite several years of experience with surgical procedures as well as improvements to the&#xD;
      medical devices, problems with disturbed anastomotic healing leading to leakage and stenosis&#xD;
      after colorectal surgery remain a significant challenge for surgeons. In addition,&#xD;
      preoperative radiotherapy has been shown to increase the risk of anastomotic leakage even&#xD;
      further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methods that are used today to detect leakages are unfortunately inaccurately and limited&#xD;
      to monitoring symptoms, temperature, CRP (C-reactive protein)-levels, and performing&#xD;
      abdominal examinations and CT-scans. These clinical signs and parameters usually become&#xD;
      apparent several days after onset of the leakage, which leads to a delayed diagnosis.&#xD;
      Anastomotic leakage is not only a significant cause of increased morbidity of complications&#xD;
      and mortality in patients, but also associated with increased risk of local recurrence and&#xD;
      poor prognosis. Moreover, when reoperation is required to fix the leakage, a permanent stoma&#xD;
      may be made at the level of the sigmoid colon and this procedure impacts quality of life&#xD;
      negatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above considerations, a novel, adaptive anastomotic method has been developed by&#xD;
      CarpoNovum to achieve a safer anastomosis. The method's working name is C-REX Ring-locking&#xD;
      Procedure (C-REX is referred to our Colorectal anastomotic rings for Re-join the intestinal&#xD;
      ends and validate the anastomosis, with function of Extract samples for analysis and conduct&#xD;
      X-ray through connected catheters).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The novel adaptive anastomotic medical devices, C-REX LapAid and C-REX DMH/DMHC are easy to&#xD;
      use, with unique possibility to control the anastomosis during and after surgery. The&#xD;
      previous successful preclinical study encourages a clinical verification in patients&#xD;
      undergoing colonic resection to evaluate the safety and performance of C-REX Ring-locking&#xD;
      Procedure by use of C-REX LapAid and C-REX DMH/DMHC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OVERALL DESIGN The study is a prospective, multicenter, single arm study Possible study&#xD;
      candidates are patients requiring resection of the left colon (descending colon and sigmoid)&#xD;
      or the upper rectum (15cm above the anal rim) due to malign or benign disease. After physical&#xD;
      examination, checking of inclusion/exclusion criteria, and after informed consent has been&#xD;
      achieved, potential subjects will be enrolled in the study, and the investigational surgery&#xD;
      will be performed during hospitalization. The devices, i.e. C-REX LapAid and C-REX DMH/DMHC&#xD;
      (dual male handle/dual male catheter handle), included in C-REX Ring-locking Procedure are&#xD;
      applied to the inside of the intestine and connected to catheters that allow monitoring of&#xD;
      the anastomosis (if DMC is applied).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The healing period is expected to be approximately 10 ± 2 days. The short-term implant, i.e.&#xD;
      the anastomotic ring, detaches via necrosis on the inner part of the intestinal surface and&#xD;
      is expelled the natural way during hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject can be discharged from the hospital when the short-term implant has been&#xD;
      evacuated, and the subject has begun to eat and has normal bowel movements. The observation&#xD;
      period lasts until 30 days after surgery. The subject then continues follow-up according to&#xD;
      local routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUALITY CONTROL Authorization to perform C-REX Ring-locking Procedure According to&#xD;
      CarpoNovum's regulation (Document 0041: Procedure, Accreditation of Surgeons for Clinical&#xD;
      Studies), clinical investigators must be authorized to conduct the C-REX Ring-locking&#xD;
      Procedure with C-REX LapAid and C-REX DMH/DMHC by performing at least one surgery on pigs and&#xD;
      at least one train-in surgery on patients with the person in charge of the study (Dr. Anders&#xD;
      Grönberg). When the clinical investigator is authorized to perform the C-REX Ring-locking&#xD;
      Procedure with C-REX LapAid System, he or she receives a certificate. This certificate could&#xD;
      also admit the clinical investigator the right to authorize other surgeons to perform C-REX&#xD;
      Ring-locking Procedure with C-REX LapAid and C-REX DMH/DMHC (i.e. to perform at least one&#xD;
      operations on pigs and at least one train-in operations on patients with the authorized&#xD;
      clinical investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring To ensure that the study is appropriately conducted, a monitor appointed by the&#xD;
      sponsor will visit the investigation site regularly and oversee the investigator's compliance&#xD;
      with the CIP, perform source-data verification and report to the sponsor on the progress of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each investigation site and clinical investigator in the study will be monitored. On all&#xD;
      occasions, the responsible monitor and/or the person in charge of the study will secure for&#xD;
      example that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compliance with CIP (clinical investigation plan) is maintained and any deviation from&#xD;
           CIP is discussed with the clinical investigators, documented and reported to the&#xD;
           sponsor; if the changes are significant, the competent authority and the ethical&#xD;
           committee will be informed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The device is being used according to CIP, IB (investigator's brochure) and IFU&#xD;
           (instructions for use), and if modifications are required either to the device or its&#xD;
           method of use or to the CIP, this need shall be reported to the sponsor;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Signed and dated informed consent forms have been obtained from each subject at the time&#xD;
           of enrollment and before any study-related procedures are undertaken;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The data in CRFs (case report forms) are complete, are recorded in a timely manner and&#xD;
           are consistent with the source data;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Traceability and device accountability of the investigational device are properly&#xD;
           maintained;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Maintenance and calibration of equipment relevant for assessment of the study is&#xD;
           performed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Possible adverse events or device deficiencies have been properly documented and&#xD;
           reported;&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Subjects withdrawal and/or non-compliance is documented and discussed with the clinical&#xD;
           investigator and reported to the sponsor;&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Clinical investigators have and continue to have staff and facilities to conduct the&#xD;
           study safely and effectively;&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Clinical investigators have and continue to have access to an adequate number of&#xD;
           subjects and the investigational device to complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The responsible monitor will write a report after each visit to the medical institutions. The&#xD;
      reports will be sent to the sponsor and the principal clinical investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Documentation and data processing Medical record of subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information should be clearly documented in medical record of subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That the subject is informed about the study and that the subject has signed the&#xD;
           informed consent forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  That the subject is participating in the study; the identification code for the subject,&#xD;
           the name of the study, and the study number (i.e., CREX-003).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which treatment the study refers to (i.e., C-REX Ring-locking Procedure with use of&#xD;
           C-REX LapAid and C-REX DMH/DMHC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Name of the principal clinical investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All AEs (adverse events) and device deficiencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Document and data control Prior to commencement of the study, clinical investigators and&#xD;
      their staff will be informed about CIP, CRFs and other study documents and procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each subject enrolled, regardless of medical device initiation, a CRF must be completed&#xD;
      and signed by corresponding investigation personnel. This applies to those subjects who fail&#xD;
      to complete the study. If a subject withdraws from the study, the reason must be noted on&#xD;
      CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and information of subjects derived from the study are considered as source data. To&#xD;
      ensure that all data are complete and correct, source data verification (SDV) will be&#xD;
      confirmed by the monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comments in CRF should be made with a ballpoint pen with permanent ink. If comments are&#xD;
      missing in CRF, reasons for this must be stated. No questions, squares, fields or similar&#xD;
      should be left without comments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRF entries and corrections will only be performed by investigational personnel, authorized&#xD;
      by the principle clinical investigator. Errors should be crossed out but not obliterated, the&#xD;
      correction inserted, and the change initialed and dated by the clinical investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then entries will be checked by the monitor and any errors or inconsistencies will be checked&#xD;
      and corrected immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The responsible clinical investigator is obliged to keep the subject identification lists&#xD;
      with the subject's identification code and identity in a safe place at the investigation site&#xD;
      (hospital), accessible only to the investigation personnel. These source data and subject&#xD;
      identification lists will be saved for 10 years after the close of the study at the medical&#xD;
      institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NUMBER OF SUBJECTS The aim of this study is to verify the novel device in clinical practise&#xD;
      and for CE (Conformité Européenne) marking later. Since no control group is included, there&#xD;
      is no need for power determinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering that similar anastomotic devices have been used in clinic for decades, 20&#xD;
      subjects will be included in The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF VARIABLES Descriptive methods are used to analyze the data collected&#xD;
      in the study. The incidences of anastomotic leakage and other AEs/device deficiencies are&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
