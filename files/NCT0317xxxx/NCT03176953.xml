      Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently co-occur, and&#xD;
      having both disorders is associated with greater psychological and functional impairment than&#xD;
      having either disorder alone. The most effective PTSD treatment, prolonged exposure (PE) is&#xD;
      sometimes less effective when individuals also have AUD. Anti-relapse medication appears&#xD;
      promising to improve the effectiveness of PE to help individuals reduce alcohol use and PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms and improve functioning. This study compares PE with and without topiramate, a&#xD;
      medication shown to both reduce drinking and PTSD symptoms, with the hypothesis that combined&#xD;
      PE and topiramate will be more effective than PE and placebo. The aim of this grant is to&#xD;
      improve treatment outcomes for Veterans with AUD and PTSD.&#xD;

      Objectives. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently&#xD;
      co-occur, and having one condition worsens the course of the other. Individuals with both&#xD;
      disorders exhibit worse functioning across a number of domains than individuals with either&#xD;
      disorder alone. Prolonged exposure therapy (PE) is among the most effective treatments for&#xD;
      PTSD. PE has been rated as a frontline treatment by multiple guidelines and reviews including&#xD;
      the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines for the treatment of PTSD. However, in studies of&#xD;
      individuals with PTSD and AUD, changes in alcohol use are only slightly better than in&#xD;
      control or standard care conditions, reductions in PTSD symptoms are sometimes modest&#xD;
      relative to studies of PE in PTSD patients without AUD, and rates of drop out from treatment&#xD;
      are high. Combining PE with medication to curb drinking shows promise to improve upon the&#xD;
      effectiveness of PE for individuals with comorbid AUD and PTSD, although thus far few studies&#xD;
      have examined combining psychotherapy and medication. Topiramate is the single medication&#xD;
      that has shown effectiveness for both AUD and PTSD and shows promise for reducing drinking&#xD;
      among individuals with AUD and PTSD. However, the effect of adding topiramate to PE to treat&#xD;
      comorbid AUD/PTSD has yet to be examined. The critical next step is to test a best practice&#xD;
      PTSD treatment, PE, together with a promising pharmacological agent, topiramate, which has&#xD;
      been found to be effective for both AUD and PTSD. Innovation: This application seeks to shift&#xD;
      current clinical practice paradigms. A refinement to existing interventions is proposed&#xD;
      through integration of two evidence based treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology. The investigators propose to use a randomized, controlled, double blind study&#xD;
      design to examine the effect of adding topiramate (TOP) to a best practice treatment for&#xD;
      PTSD, PE. Participants will be 120 male and female Veterans from all services with AUD and&#xD;
      PTSD. The investigators' primary aims are to determine the relative efficacy of&#xD;
      PE+topiramate, as compared to PE+placebo, in reducing problematic drinking, reducing PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms, and improving functioning and quality of life among Veterans with comorbid AUD/PTSD&#xD;
      at post-treatment and 3- and 6-month post-treatment follow-up. The investigators will explore&#xD;
      the extent to which decreases in drinking and PTSD symptoms lead to improvement in&#xD;
      functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study has the potential to improve functional and psychological recovery for a&#xD;
      highly prevalent and highly impaired population of Veterans. This study will test a novel and&#xD;
      innovative combination of psychotherapy and medication with the goal of improving the care of&#xD;
      Veterans. The successful completion of this project will help change the practices that drive&#xD;
      treatment for Veterans who have both AUD and PTSD. The fundamental rationale for this study&#xD;
      is to improve the evidence base that informs how patients with AUD and PTSD can attain&#xD;
      sustained recovery from both of these disorders. The investigators will also explore whether&#xD;
      changes in PTSD symptoms in the PE+TOP condition are partially explained by reductions in&#xD;
      alcohol cravings.&#xD;
