      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 130 primary tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) have been identified. Most&#xD;
      affect less than 1,000 people in the United States each year. Because these tumors are so&#xD;
      rare, there are few proven therapies. This study will test whether the immunotherapy drug&#xD;
      nivolumab is an effective treatment for people with rare CNS tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if stimulating the immune system using the drug nivolumab can shrink tumors in&#xD;
      people with rare CNS (brain or spine) tumors or increase the time it takes for these tumors&#xD;
      to grow or spread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults whose rare CNS tumor has returned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart and blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical and neurological exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatitis tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI. They will lay in a machine that takes pictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor tissue sample. This can be from a previous procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of the study, participants will have blood tests. They will answer questions&#xD;
      about their symptoms and their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get nivolumab in a vein every 2 weeks for up to 64 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have monthly blood tests. Every other month they will have an MRI and a&#xD;
      neurologic function test. They will also answer questions about their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic tests will be done on participants' tumor tissue. Participants will be contacted if&#xD;
      any clinically important results are found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment ends, participants will be monitored for up to 5 years. They will have a&#xD;
      series of MRIs and neurological function tests. They will be asked to report any symptoms&#xD;
      they experience....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are more than 130 identified primary tumors of the central nervous system (CNS).&#xD;
           Most have an annual incidence of less than 1000 in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Given the rarity of each of the tumors listed above, there is a paucity of proven&#xD;
           therapies. Most of these neoplasms are treated with maximum surgical resection followed&#xD;
           by treatment with external beam radiotherapy. With few exceptions (medulloblastoma,&#xD;
           adult ependymoma), there are no effective systemic regimens and even in chemotherapy&#xD;
           sensitive disease, most patients with recurrence eventually have no remaining salvage&#xD;
           treatments available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the setting of this unmet need, we propose to create a basket protocol that will&#xD;
           evaluate the efficacy of the PD-1 inhibitor, nivolumab, in patients with refractory rare&#xD;
           central nervous system neoplasms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study seeks to establish effective therapies at recurrence in patients with rare&#xD;
           CNS tumors. We hypothesize that this therapy will improve progression free survival&#xD;
           and/or objective responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It will be important to determine whether any determined survival benefit is associated&#xD;
           with improvements in symptoms or does a worsening of symptoms offset the increase in&#xD;
           survival. Precedence exists for measuring non-therapeutic endpoints in oncology&#xD;
           research, and specifically in studies evaluating therapeutic benefit in patients with&#xD;
           CNS tumors. There have been efforts in neuro-oncology to evaluate secondary endpoints&#xD;
           using validated instruments as an additional indicator of benefit. The M.D. Anderson&#xD;
           Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor Module (MDASI-BT) and Spine Tumor Module (MDASI-SP) allow&#xD;
           for the self-reporting of symptom severity and interference with daily activities for&#xD;
           patients with either brain or spinal cord tumors. The availability of validated&#xD;
           instruments provides an opportunity to prospectively assess the impact of treatment,&#xD;
           both positive and negative, on patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the efficacy of nivolumab in a variety of recurrent, refractory primary central&#xD;
      nervous system tumors as measured by disease control rate (confirmed CR/PR or durable SD for&#xD;
      at least 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Documented recurrent or progressive disease that corresponds to one of the tumors&#xD;
           eligible for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Karnofsky Performance greater than or equal to 70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor tissue available for review to confirm morphologic diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor tissue or slides available for molecular and immune profiling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is an open label phase II clinical trial. Patients will be treated with the immune&#xD;
           checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab, at a standard dose of 240 mg intravenously every 2&#xD;
           weeks (+/- 3 days) for cycles 1 through 2, then doses of 480 mg every 4 weeks for a&#xD;
           total of 14 additional doses (cycles). A maximum of 18 treatments will be given (64&#xD;
           weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A cycle will be defined as 4 weeks and patients will undergo efficacy assessments using&#xD;
           MR imaging every 2 cycles. Toxicity assessments will occur before the initiation of each&#xD;
           cycle and patient outcomes measures (PROs) will be completed at the time of each&#xD;
&#xD;
      imaging study (every 2 cycles) but prior to the patient being informed of the imaging&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -After completion of the planned treatment course or if treatment was stopped because of&#xD;
      toxicity, patients will undergo imaging evaluations and PRO measurements every 8 weeks (or 2&#xD;
      months) for one year, then every 3 months for the next year, then every 4&#xD;
&#xD;
      months for the next year and then every 6 months while the patient remains on the protocol.&#xD;
      Patients off treatment because of disease progression will not undergo future imaging or PRO&#xD;
      assessments on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bayesian Optimal Phase 2 design (BOP2), will be used to conduct this phase II trial in&#xD;
           patients with a variety of recurrent, refractory primary central nervous system tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be comprised of 2 disease cohorts: heavily pretreated (defined as having&#xD;
           received 3 or more prior therapies due to relapse) and non-heavily pretreated (defined&#xD;
           as having received up to 2 prior therapies due to relapse). Each cohort will be&#xD;
           evaluated&#xD;
&#xD;
      independently for efficacy.&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.7 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Adequate hepatic function within 14 days prior to Step 2 registration defined as&#xD;

                       Hepatitis B Surface antigen and Hepatitis B core antibody must be negative.&#xD;
                       This has been routinely incorporated into immunotherapy trials with&#xD;
                       checkpoint inhibitors because of concerns that the risk of treatment-induced&#xD;
                       hepatic injury is increased in the setting of active viral hepatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. The patient must not be on a corticosteroid dose greater than physiologic&#xD;

                  Durable Power of Attorney or Next of Kin can provide initial consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. The effects of nivolumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
                  reason, women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use appropriate method(s) of&#xD;
                  contraception. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 5&#xD;
                  months (30 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives)&#xD;
                  after the last dose of investigational drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a failure&#xD;
        rate of less than 1% per year. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with&#xD;
        WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7 months after the last&#xD;
        dose of investigational product. Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are&#xD;
        postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men do not require&#xD;
        contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;

             the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;
             investigational regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Severe, active co-morbidity defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Unstable angina within the last 6 months prior to Step 2 registration&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months prior to Step 2&#xD;
                  registration&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Evidence of recent myocardial infarction or ischemia by the findings of S-T&#xD;
                  elevations of greater than or equal to 2 mm using the analysis of an EKG&#xD;
                  performed within 14 days prior to Step 2 registration&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm, history of aortic&#xD;
                  dissection) or clinically significant peripheral vascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serious or non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture or history of abdominal&#xD;

                  definition; note, however, that HIV testing is not required for entry into this&#xD;
                  protocol. The need to exclude patients with AIDS is based on the lack of&#xD;
                  information regarding the safety of nivolumab in patients with active HIV&#xD;
                  infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Active connective tissue disorders, such as lupus or scleroderma, which in the&#xD;
                  opinion of the treating physician may put the patient at high risk for&#xD;
                  immunologic toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might&#xD;
             recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment&#xD;
             including systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded. These include but are not&#xD;
             limited to patients with a history of immune related neurologic disease, multiple&#xD;
             sclerosis, autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome or CIDP,&#xD;
             myasthenia gravis; systemic autoimmune disease such as SLE, connective tissue&#xD;
             diseases, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn s, ulcerative colitis,&#xD;
             hepatitis; and patients with a history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN),&#xD;
             Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or phospholipid syndrome should be excluded because of the&#xD;
             risk of recurrence or exacerbation of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             --Of note, patients with vitiligo, endocrine deficiencies including thyroiditis&#xD;
             managed with replacement hormones including physiologic corticosteroids are eligible.&#xD;
             Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthropathies, Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s&#xD;
             syndrome and psoriasis controlled with topical medication and patients with positive&#xD;
             serology, such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-thyroid antibodies should be&#xD;
             evaluated for the presence of target organ involvement and potential need for systemic&#xD;
             treatment but should otherwise be eligible. However, patients with vitiligo, diabetes&#xD;
             mellitus, and Hashimoto thyroiditis on appropriate replacement therapy may be&#xD;
             enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any other major medical illnesses or psychiatric impairments that in the&#xD;
             investigator's opinion will prevent administration or completion of protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Allergies and Adverse Drug Reaction: History of allergy to study drug components&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Pregnancy or lactating females due to possible adverse effects on the developing fetus&#xD;
             or infant due to study drug. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative&#xD;
             serum pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within&#xD;
             24 hours prior to Step 2 registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
