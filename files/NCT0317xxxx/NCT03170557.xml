  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is one of the most common problems in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) and&#xD;
      persistent pain (that can be of different origin: nociceptive, neuropathic or mixed) is often&#xD;
      poorly responsive to pharmacological therapy. Attention has been paid to the use of&#xD;
      non-pharmacological therapies and interventional techniques in treating pain in other&#xD;
      clinical conditions, and acupuncture has been the treatment most used and appreciated for its&#xD;
      effectiveness. However, only few studies are available on the use of acupuncture in SCI&#xD;
      patients. The present randomized, comparative trial aims to clarify the efficacy of&#xD;
      traditional acupuncture vs. aspecific needle skin stimulation in treating persistent pain in&#xD;
      subjects with spinal cord injury, by overcoming the biases reported in previous studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 67% of patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) experience painful symptoms in the course&#xD;
      of life after injury and a third evaluates the pain as &quot;severe&quot;, with a significant impact on&#xD;
      quality of life, due to limitations in daily activities and autonomy. Persistent pain can be&#xD;
      of different origin and may be nociceptive, neuropathic or mixed. However, it is often poorly&#xD;
      responsive to pharmacological therapy. For some years, attention has been paid to the use of&#xD;
      non-pharmacological therapies and interventional techniques in treating pain, and acupuncture&#xD;
      has been the treatment most used and appreciated for its effectiveness. Only two studies on&#xD;
      the use of acupuncture in SCI patients were included in the only Cochrane review available,&#xD;
      dated 2014. Such studies, focusing on the painful shoulder syndrome and, therefore, on&#xD;
      skeletal muscle pain, show a &quot;non-superiority&quot; of acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture&#xD;
      treatment or Trager approach. However, the review does not come to any clear conclusions on&#xD;
      the effectiveness of intervention because of the small number of cases and high risk of bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A more recent primary, randomized, controlled trial on SCI patients, although focusing on&#xD;
      chronic pain and on a single acupuncture technique, uses a questionable study design&#xD;
      (cross-over) to demonstrate treatment efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present randomized, comparative trial aims to clarify the efficacy of traditional&#xD;
      acupuncture vs. aspecific needle skin stimulation in treating persistent pain in subjects&#xD;
      with spinal cord injury, by overcoming the biases reported in previous studies. Because of&#xD;
      the intrinsic effects of sham acupuncture and, generally, of skin stimulation, a&#xD;
      statistically significant change in the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) measurements is expected&#xD;
      even in the comparison group. To minimize this bias, which cannot be avoided, and to maintain&#xD;
      the blindness of the patient as much as possible, the comparison group is treated by the&#xD;
      insertion of needles in skin areas outside the metamer(s) affected by pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the efficacy of traditional acupuncture vs. aspecific needle skin stimulation&#xD;
      for persistent pain in subjects with spinal cord injury, at the end of treatment and at the 3&#xD;
      week follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction of drug intake, at the end of treatment and at the subsequent follow-up;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction of anxiety/depression, at the end of treatment and at the subsequent&#xD;
           follow-up;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement of quality of life, at the end of treatment and at the subsequent follow-up;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persistence of the effect of acupuncture 9 weeks after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data concerning any adverse events, related to both experimental treatments of the trial,&#xD;
      will also be collected.&#xD;
