      Gait disorders and balance impairments are one of the most incapacitating symptoms of&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD). Gait impairment in Parkinson's disease exists despite the use of&#xD;
      dopinergic therapy. Motor phenotype associated with postural instability and ambulatory&#xD;
      dysfunction is related to greater risk of motor decline and may be influenced by&#xD;
      non-dopinergic pathology (Galna et al., 2015). Galna et al. (2015) conducted a study to&#xD;
      document the progression of gait impairment over 18 months in individuals with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease with regard to phenotype and medication. Gait characteristics were measured in 121 PD&#xD;
      and 184 controls, and 18 months later in 108 PD participants (Galna, 2015). Sixteen gait&#xD;
      characteristics were examined with respect to five broad domains for PD and motor phenotype.&#xD;
      Correlations between change in levodopa (l-dopa) equivalent daily dose and gait were used to&#xD;
      identify dopa-responsive and nonresponsive characteristics (Galna, 2015). Pace and rhythm&#xD;
      deteriorated over 18 months in people with PD, with other gait domains remaining stable.&#xD;
      People with a postural instability and gait difficulty phenotype had more impaired gait at&#xD;
      baseline compared with a tremor-dominant phenotype, which was most evident in temporal&#xD;
      characteristics (Galna, 2015). In contrast, pace and variability deteriorated over the&#xD;
      subsequent 18 months in the tremor-dominant phenotype only (Galna, 2015). Weak but&#xD;
      statistically significant correlations were found between increased l-dopa medication and&#xD;
      less deterioration in pace and asymmetry. Significant gait impairment is evident in very&#xD;
      early disease despite optimal medication (Galna, 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For people with Parkinson's disease, there are fall risk factors specific to PD. These&#xD;
      include changes in posture, postural instability, freezing of gait, dyskinesias, gait&#xD;
      changes, medication side effects, and decreased ability to react automatically to a loss of&#xD;
      balance. Health and cognitive factors such as cognitive decline and depression can also&#xD;
      greatly increase the risk of falling. Contreras and Grandas (2012) conducted a study in Spain&#xD;
      that included 160 people with Parkinson's disease who were being seen at a movement disorders&#xD;
      clinic in Madrid. It was found that that fallers were older and had longer disease duration&#xD;
      (Contreras &amp; Grandas, 2012). Subjects also had increased disease severity according to the&#xD;
      UPDRS (part III) and the Hoehn and Yahr scale, and lower scores on the Schwab and England ADL&#xD;
      test (Contreras &amp; Grandas, 2012). In addition, fallers scored worse in the Mini-Mental State&#xD;
      Examination and experienced a higher frequency of motor fluctuations, dyskinesia, and&#xD;
      freezing of gait (Contreras &amp; Grandas, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among people with PD, recurrent falls are more frequent, with one study reporting that more&#xD;
      than 50% of the study participants fell recurrently. In another study involving a survey of&#xD;
      100 people with PD, 13% reported falling more than once a week, with most of these people&#xD;
      falling multiple times a day (Allen et al., 2013). Several risk factors for falls have been&#xD;
      found to be more strongly associated with recurrent falls than single falls. Some of these&#xD;
      factors are potentially modifiable, including cognitive impairment, freezing of gait, fear of&#xD;
      falling, reduced mobility, reduced physical activity, and balance impairments (Allen et al.,&#xD;
      2013). There is substantial variability in the falling rates reported in various studies,&#xD;
      with the proportion of fallers (single and recurrent) ranging from 35% to 95%. Differences in&#xD;
      the method of monitoring falls could contribute to this variability (Allen et al., 2013).&#xD;
      Despite the fact that recurrent falls are a substantial problem for people with PD, the scope&#xD;
      of, and risk factors for, recurrent falls in PD are not clearly understood (Allen et al.,&#xD;
      2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elbers et al. (2012) investigated the predictive value of gait speed for community walking in&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease. A total of 153 patients with Parkinson's disease were included in this&#xD;
      study. Community walking was evaluated using the mobility domain of the Nottingham Extended&#xD;
      Activities of Daily Living Index (NEAI). Patients who scored 3 points on item 1 (&quot;Did you&#xD;
      walk around outside?&quot;) and item 5 (&quot;Did you cross roads?&quot;) were considered community walkers&#xD;
      (Elbers et al., 2012). Gait speed was measured with the 6-m or 10-m timed walking test. Age,&#xD;
      gender, marital status, disease duration, disease severity, motor impairment, balance,&#xD;
      freezing of gait, fear of falling, previous falls, cognitive function, executive function,&#xD;
      fatigue, anxiety and depression were investigated for their contribution to the multivariate&#xD;
      model (Elbers et al., 2012). Results indicated seventy patients (46%) were classified as&#xD;
      community walkers. A gait speed of 0.88 m/s correctly predicted 70% of patients as community&#xD;
      walkers (Elbers et al., 2012). A multivariate model, including gait speed and fear of&#xD;
      falling, correctly predicted 78% of patients as community walkers (Elbers et al., 2012).&#xD;
      Elbers et al. concluded timed walking tests are valid measurements to predict community&#xD;
      walking in Parkinson's disease. However, evaluation of community walking should include an&#xD;
      assessment of fear of falling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combs et al. (2013) conducted a study to determine test-retest reliability and responsiveness&#xD;
      of short-distance walking speed tests for persons with Parkinson disease (PD). Discriminant&#xD;
      and convergent validity of walking speed tests were also examined. Eighty-eight participants&#xD;
      with PD (mean age, 66 years) with mild to moderate severity (stages 1-4 on the Hoehn and Yahr&#xD;
      Scale) were tested on medications. Measures of activity included the comfortable and fast&#xD;
      10-m walk tests (CWT, FWT), 6-min walk test (6MWT), mini balance evaluations systems test&#xD;
      (mini-BEST Test), fear of falling (FoF), and the Activity-Specific Balance Confidence Scale&#xD;
      (ABC). The mobility subsection of the PD quality of life-39 (PDQ39-M) served as a&#xD;
      participation-based measure (Combs et al., 2013). Results indicated test-retest reliability&#xD;
      was high for both walking speed measures (CWT, ICC(2,1) = 0.98; FWT, ICC(2,1) = 0.99) (Combs&#xD;
      et al., 2013). Minimal detectable change (MDC(95)) for the CWT and FWT was 0.09 m/s and 0.13&#xD;
      m/s respectively (Combs et al., 2013). Participants at Hoehn &amp; Yahr levels 3/4 demonstrated&#xD;
      significantly slower walking speed with the CWT and FWT than participants at Hoehn &amp; Yahr&#xD;
      levels 1 and 2 (P &lt; .01). The CWT and FWT were both significantly (P ≤ .002) correlated with&#xD;
      all activity and participation-based measures (Combs et al., 2013). In conclusion,&#xD;
      short-distance walking speed tests are clinically useful measures for persons with PD (Combs&#xD;
      et al., 2013). The CWT and FWT are highly reliable and responsive to change in persons with&#xD;
      PD (Combs et al., 2013). Short distance walking speed can be used to discriminate differences&#xD;
      in gait function between persons with mild and moderate PD severity (Combs et al., 2013). The&#xD;
      CWT and FWT had moderate to strong associations with other activity and participation based&#xD;
      measures demonstrating convergent validity (Combs et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) or atypical parkinsonism often present with abnormal&#xD;
      posture. A retrospective observational study conducted by Doherty et al. (2011) showed that a&#xD;
      third of patients with PD had a deformity of their limbs, neck, or trunk. The most recognized&#xD;
      type of deformity is the classic stooped simian appearance, with flexion of the hips and&#xD;
      knees, and rounding of the shoulders (Doherty et al., 2011). Severe postural deformities&#xD;
      include kyphosis, camptocormia, antecollis, Pisa syndrome, and scoliosis. The underlying&#xD;
      pathophysiology of these deformities is largely unknown, and their management remains&#xD;
      difficult (Doherty et al., 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thoracic hyperkyphosis is one of the most common postural abnormalities. It is defined as&#xD;
      increased thoracic curvature in the sagittal plan of the vertebral column. Normal kyphosis&#xD;
      may range from 20º to 50º according to Cobb's radiographic method. The radiographic method is&#xD;
      the most popular kyphosis measuring method, but because it is an expensive method and it&#xD;
      exposes the individual to radiation, it is not the most appropriate method for periodic&#xD;
      patient follow-up. Routine clinical examinations such as physiotherapeutic evaluation of&#xD;
      thoracic kyphosis need to be valid, reliable, sensitive, practical and cheap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study by Teixeira and Carvalho (2007) assessed the reliability and validity of thoracic&#xD;
      kyphosis measurements using the flexicurve method. A cross-sectional study analyzed the&#xD;
      thoracic kyphosis of 56 people from sagittal radiography of the thoracic column using Cobb's&#xD;
      method and by means of the flexicurve method, by two evaluators. Results indicated he&#xD;
      intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) between the measurements from the Cobb and&#xD;
      flexicurve methods was 0.906 (Teixeira &amp; Carvalho, 2007). For diagnosing thoracic&#xD;
      hyperkyphosis, the sensitivity was 85% and the specificity was 97% (Teixeira &amp; Carvalho,&#xD;
      2007). In conclusion, the flexicurve method was shown to be a suitable quantitative clinical&#xD;
      method for measuring the curvature of thoracic kyphosis (Teixeira &amp; Carvalho, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Get Up and Go test, the predecessor of the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), was developed by&#xD;
      Mathias and Nayak as a tool to screen for balance problems, primarily in the frail elderly.&#xD;
      The test measures how long it takes for a person to rise from a chair, walk 3 meters (about&#xD;
      10 feet) to a line on the floor, and return to the chair. The test correlates well with the&#xD;
      Berg Balance Scale, the Barthel Index of activities of daily living, and gait speed tests.&#xD;
      The Timed Up and Go modified the earlier version of the test by adding a timing component. An&#xD;
      adult who is independent in balance and mobility can perform the TUG in less than 10 seconds&#xD;
      (Shumway-Cook &amp; Woollacott, 2007). In a study of older adults with a range of neurologic&#xD;
      pathologies, people taking 30 seconds or more to complete the TUG were more likely to need an&#xD;
      assistive device, walk too slowly for community ambulation, and score lower on the Berg&#xD;
      Balance scale. In contrast, a person completing the test in less than 20 seconds was more&#xD;
      likely to be independent in daily living activities, score higher on the Berg Balance scale,&#xD;
      and walk at a speed sufficient for community mobility (Podsiadlo &amp; Richardson, 1991).&#xD;
      Shumway-Cook and Woollacott (2012) noted that the TUG can be used to predict the risk of&#xD;
      falls in older adults. In a study, 30 community-dwelling frail elderly adults were tested&#xD;
      using the TUG, and researchers found that those taking longer than 14 seconds to complete the&#xD;
      task were at high risk for falls. In the same study, the TUG was modified by adding a&#xD;
      cognitive task (counting backward by threes) and a manual task (carrying a full cup of&#xD;
      water). The addition of a secondary task increased the time need to complete the TUG by 22%&#xD;
      to 25% (Shumway-Cook &amp; Woollacott, 2012).&#xD;
