  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a non-medication intervention can increase motivation&#xD;
      and reward processing to non-drug reward cues (for example, a picture of one's favorite food)&#xD;
      in individuals with and without nicotine dependence by observing brain activity using&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG) and/or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that learning to increase brain activity to non-drug cues may&#xD;
      improve reward responses and motivation to non-drug cues, and for individuals who smoke, may&#xD;
      eventually result in improved smoking cessation outcomes.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the ability of adults with and without nicotine dependence (ND) to activate&#xD;
           reward-related brain regions (e.g., ventral tegmental area (VTA), striatum, prefrontal&#xD;
           cortex).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate whether fMRI and/or EEG neurofeedback improves the ability to increase&#xD;
           reward-related brain activation in individuals with and without ND.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine the relationship between activation of reward-related regions via neurofeedback&#xD;
           and dopamine availability (as assessed genetically).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Examine the effects of neurofeedback on clinically relevant outcomes, including reward&#xD;
           responsivity and smoking related behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to coming to a screening visit, all potential participants will undergo a phone&#xD;
      pre-screening using an IRB approved phone script to pre-identify potentially eligible&#xD;
      participants and to potentially decrease screen fail rate. These interested potential&#xD;
      participants call or email the site in response to advertisements. The pre-screening will&#xD;
      take place via phone. Participants who pass the pre-screening will complete some or all of&#xD;
      the following visits: Screening, Camera Return Visit, Real-Time Neurofeedback Visit,&#xD;
      Follow-up Phone Call/Debriefing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with nicotine dependence who pass the pre-screen will come to the lab at Duke to&#xD;
      complete additional screening. All participants will undergo informed consent and those with&#xD;
      ND will complete a urine drug screen. Participants who pass the urine drug screen (results&#xD;
      are provided immediately) will complete questionnaires assessing mood, reward processing, and&#xD;
      smoking behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants may also be given a camera to use to capture pictures of personalized&#xD;
      rewarding objects (e.g., picture of their pet, favorite book, favorite food). Participants&#xD;
      may be loaned the camera for a period of 1-2 weeks to capture pictures of rewarding objects.&#xD;
      We will instruct participants that the camera is to be used exclusively for capturing&#xD;
      pictures for the study and not for personal use. Some participants may not be asked to take&#xD;
      their own pictures for the study protocol and may simply be shown neutral or positive&#xD;
      pictures/images/objects provided by the experimenters (e.g., shapes, pictures, etc.). Note,&#xD;
      no aversive images will be shown to participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Camera Return Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who were loaned a camera will be asked to come to the lab at Duke to return the&#xD;
      camera. The experimenters will ensure that enough pictures have been acquired to use during&#xD;
      the experiment. Participants will be given guidelines about what types of pictures are&#xD;
      required for the study. Participants are also free to provide photos they already have by&#xD;
      uploading them to a secure website or brining them in on a device (e.g., thumbdrive).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may also be asked to view and rate the pictures they provide along with neutral&#xD;
      and positive images we provide (e.g., puppy, flower) on dimensions such as valence and&#xD;
      arousal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real-Time Neurofeedback Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be scheduled for an fMRI and/or EEG session to assess and measure&#xD;
      the ability to self-activate reward-related regions. The fMRI session will be conducted at&#xD;
      the Duke Brain Imaging and Analysis Center (BIAC) and/or the UNC Biomedical Research Imaging&#xD;
      Center (BRIC). Female participants will have a urine pregnancy test prior to fMRI scanning;&#xD;
      the test will be verified to be negative in order to proceed with the scanning session. The&#xD;
      EEG sessions will take place in private testing space in the Levine Science Research Center&#xD;
      or the BIAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may complete some or all of the following tasks: Reward Activation Task, Passive&#xD;
      Viewing Task, and Reward Learning Task. All of these tasks aim to assess how adults can learn&#xD;
      to interact with neurofeedback provided from an fMRI or EEG system. The tasks vary slightly&#xD;
      from each other in terms of stimuli used (personalized pictures, images provided by the&#xD;
      experimenters, feedback display, etc.). It may be possible that we will not be able to get a&#xD;
      good EEG signal for some participants, based on equipment error or head size. If this occurs,&#xD;
      participants will be debriefed and paid for their time. We will be sure to emphasize there&#xD;
      was no error on the participant's part, and that sometime the signal is difficult to acquire&#xD;
      for a variety of reasons.&#xD;
