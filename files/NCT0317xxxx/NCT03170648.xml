      This research study is evaluating ear acupuncture as a possible treatment to reduce symptoms&#xD;
      related to receiving chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy drugs used to treat cancer can cause many symptoms. Some of the most common&#xD;
      symptoms of receiving chemotherapy are nausea, vomiting, and anxiety. These symptoms can&#xD;
      affect the quality of life of cancer patients. Medications can help ease these, but many&#xD;
      patients continue to experience symptoms despite these treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupuncture has been studied in clinical trials in cancer patients and has been shown to be&#xD;
      helpful for management of pain, nerve damage from chemotherapy, and nausea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ear acupuncture is a type of acupuncture that involves the stimulation of points on the&#xD;
      external ear. A few studies have suggested that ear acupuncture may help to reduce symptoms&#xD;
      of nausea and anxiety during chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being done to evaluate the potential benefits of using ear acupuncture to&#xD;
      reduce symptoms like nausea and anxiety for women receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer.&#xD;
