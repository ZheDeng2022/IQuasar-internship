  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Making sure the heart rate and or the blood pressure [called hemodynamic instability] during&#xD;
      surgery is stable, setting up for a rapid postoperative recovery, and ensuring that patients&#xD;
      have adequate pain relief are some of the important goals of neurosurgical anesthesia. Scalp&#xD;
      block anesthesia [injection of a numbing agent into the area of the scalp where the incision&#xD;
      will be] together with general anesthesia is used to achieve these goals. There has been some&#xD;
      research on whether or not scalp block improves patient recovery and pain management, but the&#xD;
      studies have not be large enough to say for certain. This is true even though scalp block is&#xD;
      used with almost every patient that is having brain surgery. The investigators propose to&#xD;
      determine if scalp block in combination with asleep anesthesia is better than asleep&#xD;
      anesthesia alone in patients who are having brain surgery for tumors in the cerebral area of&#xD;
      the brain.&#xD;

      Avoidance of hemodynamic fluctuations in the heart rate and or the blood pressure&#xD;
      perioperatively, rapid postoperative recovery, and adequate postoperative pain relief are&#xD;
      some of the important goals of neurosurgical anesthesia. Scalp block in association with&#xD;
      general anesthesia is used to achieve these goals. Previous studies have been published&#xD;
      related to the effect of scalp block on the perioperative outcomes on the craniotomy&#xD;
      patients. The results reported so far are controversial and one cannot at this point define a&#xD;
      positive effect for post-operative pain relief. This disparity in results may be the&#xD;
      consequences of the size of the patient population. However scalp block is an accepted&#xD;
      practice in the craniotomy patients. The investigators believe this is the first study which&#xD;
      assesses the effectiveness of scalp block for asleep craniotomy with the largest sample size&#xD;
      study so far conducted in the literature related to this topic. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness of scalp block for the perioperative comfort of the craniotomy&#xD;
      patients undergoing resection for supratentorial tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the consent for the participation and enrollment in the study is done, patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to two groups, a study group will receive a scalp block with a mixture of 2%&#xD;
      lidocaine and 0.5% bupivacaine while the control group will receive the scalp block with&#xD;
      saline. Intraoperatively, all patients will be preoxygenated, fentanyl (1-2mcg/kg) will be&#xD;
      given and anesthesia will be induced with propofol (1-2mg/kg) and lidocaine (1-1.5mg/kg).&#xD;
      Tracheal intubation will be facilitated by using either rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) or&#xD;
      succinylcholine (1-1.5mg/kg) intravenously. The lungs will be ventilated with a fresh gas&#xD;
      flow of oxygen for 2 minutes before tracheal intubation with cuffed oral endotracheal tube.&#xD;
      Anesthesia will be maintained with inhalational anesthetic Isoflurane, Sevoflurane or&#xD;
      Desflurane (0.8-1 MAC) and fentanyl infusion (1-2mcg/kg) with the dose adjusted according to&#xD;
      the patient's hemodynamics. Bilateral BIS or EEG to maintain an adequate level of depth of&#xD;
      anesthesia will be used whenever feasible. After intubation, a scalp block will be performed.&#xD;
      The randomization of the scalp block syringes will be provided by the pharmacy and neither&#xD;
      the scalp block performer nor the attending will be aware of the syringe content. To&#xD;
      standardize the block, a pain specialist is involved. Response to the pinning will be&#xD;
      assessed using the hemodynamic parameters and rescue analgesics (fentanyl bolus 50 - 100 mcg)&#xD;
      and/or propofol bolus 50 - 100 mg will be given as a bolus if significant response is noted.&#xD;
      Significant response being a rise in the patient's heart rate and/or the blood pressure more&#xD;
      than 20% from the patient's baseline heart rate and/or the blood pressure just before&#xD;
      pinning. Similarly, response to the surgical incision will be noted and rescue analgesics&#xD;
      will be given if needed. Intraoperative propofol requirement and opioid requirements will be&#xD;
      recorded. The post-operative orders for pain control will be standardized for all the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
