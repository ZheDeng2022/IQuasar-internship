      The overall goal of this exploratory proof-of-concept study is to determine whether, in&#xD;
      participants with pulmonary tuberculosis caused by M. tuberculosis (MTB) with or without&#xD;
      rifampin resistance-conferring rpoB-gene mutations, the combination of meropenem and&#xD;
      amoxicillin/clavulanate with rifampin has greater early bactericidal activity (EBA) than the&#xD;
      combination of meropenem and amoxicillin/clavulanate without rifampin. Funding Source- FDA&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof-of-concept study to determine whether, in humans infected with M.&#xD;
      tuberculosis that is resistant or susceptible to rifampin based on conventional drug&#xD;
      susceptibility testing, the combination of meropenem, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and rifampin&#xD;
      has activity that is sufficiently promising to proceed with further drug development along&#xD;
      these lines. Rifampin has an incompletely understood but critical role in eradication of M.&#xD;
      tuberculosis persisters and consequently the shortening of the duration of treatment for&#xD;
      'rifampin susceptible' tuberculosis (TB). For Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) / Extensively Drug&#xD;
      Tuberculosis (XDR) TB, the ability to recoup rifampin's antituberculosis activity through&#xD;
      rational combination with a carbapenem and a β-lactamase inhibitor with or without&#xD;
      amoxicillin could transform the treatment of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proof-of-concept study is designed such that a negative outcome would refute the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the combination of a carbapenem and amoxicillin/clavulanate with rifampin&#xD;
      will have greater activity than either component alone against M. tuberculosis strains having&#xD;
      Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) in the range considered resistant to rifampin. A&#xD;
      positive study outcome would catalyze further research to identify optimal dosing strategies&#xD;
      for all regimen components as well as development of carbapenems optimized for TB treatment&#xD;
      with respect to targets of activity, stability against hydrolysis, and oral formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis cannot be tested satisfactorily in traditional animal models of&#xD;
      tuberculosis chemotherapy due to the rapid inactivation of carbapenems (as well as other&#xD;
      beta-lactams) by dehydropeptidases that are expressed at high levels in mouse, rabbit, and&#xD;
      guinea pig tissues. However, all of the study drugs are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      -approved for various infectious disease indications, are in routine clinical use, and have&#xD;
      good safety profiles, such that proceeding with the proposed clinical trial based on in vitro&#xD;
      data is justified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also characterize the relationship between meropenem exposure (in combination&#xD;
      with amoxicillin/clavulanate) and early bactericidal activity in order to identify the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic drivers of activity and pharmacokinetic targets for desired effects. This&#xD;
      will inform the identification of more feasible meropenem dosing strategies in the near term,&#xD;
      as well as the dose selection for novel oral carbapenems that may be available for&#xD;
      tuberculosis treatment in the future. The proportion of the dosing interval for which free&#xD;
      drug concentrations exceed MIC (T&gt;MIC) is the pharmacokinetic (PK) / pharmacodynamic(PD)&#xD;
      parameter most closely correlated with efficacy of carbapenems against common fast-growing&#xD;
      bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae that cause infections for which meropenem is currently&#xD;
      approved. A commonly accepted target for efficacy in these infections is 40% T&gt;MIC, which&#xD;
      requires multiple daily doses to achieve. Whether this PK/PD parameter and target value is&#xD;
      optimal for carbapenem treatment of infections with M. tuberculosis, which has a much longer&#xD;
      doubling time, is unknown. In the trial by Diacon et al, meropenem 2 grams thrice daily plus&#xD;
      amoxicillin/clavulanate resulted in a median T&gt;MIC of 76% [90% Confidence Interval (CI):&#xD;
      66-93] whereas faropenem sodium 600 mg thrice daily plus amoxicillin/clavulanate resulted in&#xD;
      T&gt;MIC of 13% (90% CI: 0-33), indicating that if T&gt;MIC is the single parameter most strongly&#xD;
      linked to efficacy in tuberculosis, then the target for bactericidal effect is between 13%&#xD;
      and 76%, and lower and/or less frequent doses (or use of oral carbapenems with lower&#xD;
      bioavailability) may still have significant efficacy. If T&gt;MIC is not the efficacy-linked&#xD;
      PK/PD parameter, less frequent administration of the same total dose is likely to remain&#xD;
      equally effective.&#xD;
