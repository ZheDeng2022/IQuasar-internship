    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to characterize the psychophysiological demand in different&#xD;
      Capoeira performances in male experienced individuals. Eleven men healthy and experienced in&#xD;
      Capoeira. Participants were invited to five visits in different days: 1) anamnesis and&#xD;
      anthropometric assessment; 2) aerobic performance assessment; 3 to 5) performance of 90s in&#xD;
      three Capoeira styles (Angola, Benguela and São Bento). Main Outcome Measure(s): The&#xD;
      physiological demand through the heart rate (HR), R-R interval (RRi), blood pressure (BP),&#xD;
      blood lactate ([Lac]), and glucose ([Gluc]) and rating perceived effort (RPE), feeling scale&#xD;
      (FS) and perceived activation (PA) were assessed after 10min of rest and during recovery (1,&#xD;
      3, 5, 7 and 9min) of each performance. HR and RRi records also occurred during each&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;

      The present study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee from the Federal University&#xD;
      of Vale do São Francisco - UNIVASF under number 1.687.330. The study had as inclusion&#xD;
      criteria: (i) to be male between 18 and 40 years; (ii) a Capoeira practitioner for at least 2&#xD;
      years; and (iii) mastering the technique of the three rhythms of performance investigated&#xD;
      (Angola, Benguela and São Bento). As exclusion criteria: (i) to be hypertensive, diabetic or&#xD;
      obese; (ii) a smoker; (iii) alcohol addicted and (iv) have some cardiovascular dysfunction or&#xD;
      musculoskeletal problem. The participants volunteered and signed a written informed consent&#xD;
      in accordance with resolution 466/12 from the National Health Council of Brazil and&#xD;
      principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Finally, the sample was composed of 11 male&#xD;
      individuals with experience in the three rhythms of Capoeira performance selected for the&#xD;
      study. For the evaluation of aerobic fitness was a Maximal Aerobic Incremental Test (MAIT) in&#xD;
      the cyclergometer was performed (Biotec 2100, Cefise). MAIT began with one minute warm-up&#xD;
      without load, with 50 watts or power followed by increments of 25 watts of power to each&#xD;
      stage of one minute. The participants were instructed to maintain a frequency of 50 rpm's&#xD;
      during the entire test, until voluntary exhaustion or not maintaining the pre-established&#xD;
      rotation. The last stage of the test was considered valid when the individual remained at&#xD;
      least 50% of the stage time duration in exercise. During the MAIT, measures of aerobic power,&#xD;
      RPE and HR were obtained. The Capoeira performance experimental sessions were performed based&#xD;
      on three distinct rhythms, namely: 1) Angola; 2) Benguela and; 3) São Bento. The choice of&#xD;
      these performance rhythms is justified because they are the most practiced in the Capoeira&#xD;
      world and the literature has reported possible differences in technical standards of physical&#xD;
      requirement between them. The performance rhythms were performed in different days and&#xD;
      separated by an interval of 48 hours. All the performance rhythms were accompanied by&#xD;
      standardized percussion instruments, with three berimbaus, one with severe intonation&#xD;
      (berimbau gunga), another intermediate (medium berimbau) and the last with acute intonation&#xD;
      (berimbau viola), an atabaque and two tambourines. The musical instruments were played by&#xD;
      experienced individuals and the songs were also sung in a standardized way for each&#xD;
      performance. The performances in different rhythms always occurred at the same time of day&#xD;
      between 3:00 and 4:00 p.m. A period of rest (pre-intervention) with a duration of 10 minutes&#xD;
      occurred prior to completion of each performance rhythm, with volunteers being seated&#xD;
      comfortably in an upholstered armchair. At the end of the rest measurements of the&#xD;
      physiological and the perceptual variables of the study were performed. Soon after the&#xD;
      pre-intervention a standardized warm-up/stretching in light intensity perceived was performed&#xD;
      during 5 minutes with the own Capoeira movements. Then pairs of participants were conducted&#xD;
      for the intervention with the performing of its respective Capoeira performance rhythms&#xD;
      (Angola, Benguela or São Bento). Each rhythm of performance had duration of 90 seconds and&#xD;
      participants received voice instructions to start and finish the performance. After each&#xD;
      physical performance with the Capoeira rhythm, during recovery period (post- intervention) in&#xD;
      the moments 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 minutes was measured the physiological and the perceptual&#xD;
      variables of the study. The pre-intervention, intervention and post-intervention were&#xD;
      performed in a room free of noise and temperature between 22-24ºC. During the experimental&#xD;
      sessions the participants used a device brand Polar Electro Oy mod. RS800CX duly validated to&#xD;
      record the HR and R-R intervals (RRi) of HR variability (HRV). In addition to the analysis&#xD;
      pre- and post-intervention, during the intervention it was considered the lowest HR and RRi&#xD;
      (MIN), the average HR and RRi (AVE) and the largest HR and RRi (PEAK). The records of the&#xD;
      RRi, during the intervention, were exported from the device Polar to the software Polar&#xD;
      ProTrainer 5 by infra red and analyzed through the software Kubios HRV version 2.0. In order&#xD;
      not to jeopardize the reliability of the indexes obtained, the early ectopic and artifact&#xD;
      beats were removed and adjusted, being a criterion the differences greater than 20% in&#xD;
      relation to adjacent beats. After editing the RRi, analyzes using linear methods in the time&#xD;
      and frequency domain were performed with the objective of estimation of cardiac autonomic&#xD;
      modulation. Concerning the time domain, the parameters analyzed were the absolute mean RRi&#xD;
      and rMSSD (root mean square differences of successive RRi) as an indicator of the modulation&#xD;
      of the parasympathetic nervous system. As to frequency domain the high frequency components&#xD;
      (HF: 0.15 to 0.4 Hz) as well as the low frequency (LF: 0.04 to 0.15 Hz) were analyzed to&#xD;
      calculate the LF:HF ratio, which characterizes the cardiac sympathovagal balance In the pre-&#xD;
      and post-intervention BP measures were conducted by means of an automatic sphygmomanometer&#xD;
      brand Microlife, mod. BP3AC1-1PC, equipment validated and with high reproducibility for&#xD;
      normotensive individuals. The procedures adopted for BP evaluation were those recommended by&#xD;
      the Cardiology Brazilian Society. Besides, in the pre- and post-intervention periods a&#xD;
      puncture in the participants' ear lobe was done to collect 25 μl of capillary blood by&#xD;
      calibrated capillaries. The blood samples were deposited in Eppendorf microtubules and stored&#xD;
      in 50 μl of sodium fluoride to 1% for later analysis of [Lac] and [Gluc]]. To this end, a&#xD;
      biochemistry electroenzymatic analyzer (Yellow Springs 2,700 STAT, OH, USA) was properly&#xD;
      calibrated and used. During MAIT and at the pre- and post-intervention periods with the&#xD;
      experimental sessions the perceptual variables were measured through psychometric scales.&#xD;
      Rate of perceived exertion (RPE): The whole-body perceived exertion was assessed using the&#xD;
      Borg's RPE [6-20] Scale. Before the MAIT, and experimental sessions with Capoeira, the&#xD;
      meaning of RPE was explained to the subjects. A rating of 6 (low anchor, &quot;very, very light&quot;)&#xD;
      was assigned to the lowest exercise intensity, while a rating of 20 (high anchor, &quot;very, very&#xD;
      hard&quot;) was assigned to the highest exercise intensity. Basic affective response: The Feeling&#xD;
      Scale (FS) was used to assess the affective response and it is an 11-point bipolar scale&#xD;
      ranging from +5 to -5, commonly used to measure pleasure/displeasure during exercise. This&#xD;
      scale presents the following verbal anchors: -5 = very bad; -3 = bad; -1 = fairly bad; 0 =&#xD;
      neutral; +1 fairly good; +3 = good; and +5 = very good. The subjects received standard&#xD;
      instructions regarding to the use of the FS in according to Hardy and Rejeski. Perceived&#xD;
      activation (PA): The PA scale was used to assess the arousal state of the participants. The&#xD;
      PA scale is a 6-point single-item measure, ranging from +1 (low arousal) to +6 (high&#xD;
      arousal). This scale assesses how the participant felt activated, stimulated and motivated&#xD;
      during different times of the study (pre- and post-intervention). In addition, an integrated&#xD;
      analysis interpolating FS and PA responses was performed, aiming to obtain the sense that the&#xD;
      affective domain points from different quadrants of the circumplex model (high&#xD;
      activation-pleasure; high activation-displeasure; low activation-displeasure; low&#xD;
      activation-pleasure). Finally, standard definitions of perceptual responses and separate&#xD;
      instructional sets for scales were read to the participants immediately before the MAIT. The&#xD;
      low and high perceptual anchors for the RPE, FS and PA scale were established during the&#xD;
      MAIT. RPE, FS and PA values were evaluated randomly during the last 10 seconds of each stage&#xD;
      of MAIT, during pre-intervention and, different moments of post-intervention. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics with mean and standard deviation was performed. The normality of data distribution&#xD;
      was tested by the Shapiro-Wilk test. ANOVA two-way for repeated measures, reporting the&#xD;
      &quot;F-ratio&quot;, degrees of freedom and the &quot;P&quot; value was used to verify the interaction&#xD;
      time*rhythms and the main effect of time within each Capoeira performance. The test of&#xD;
      Mauchly was adopted to verify the sphericity of the data, which, in case of violation, the&#xD;
      degrees of freedom would be corrected by the epsilon of Greenhouse-Geisser. Partial eta&#xD;
      squared (ηp2) was used to determine the effect size. Post hoc of Bonferroni was adopted for&#xD;
      identification of pairs of difference. The alpha was set at 5% and the software used was SPSS&#xD;
      22.0 for Windows (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).&#xD;
