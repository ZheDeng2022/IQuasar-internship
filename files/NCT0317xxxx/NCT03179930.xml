  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test any good and bad effects of the study drugs called&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab and Entinostat when used in combination to treat lymphoma. This combination&#xD;
      could shrink the lymphoma but it could also cause side effects. Researchers also hope to&#xD;
      learn whether adding entinostat to pembrolizumab can be more effective for patients with&#xD;
      lymphoma than either drug alone.&#xD;
