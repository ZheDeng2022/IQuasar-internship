  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gut with severe&#xD;
      complications. There is strong evidence to suggest that diet and gut bacteria are key&#xD;
      components in the onset, perpetuation and management of CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An 8-week exclusive liquid diet (EEN) without any normal food is the best treatment for&#xD;
      paediatric CD. The mode of action of EEN remains unknown, but according to recent&#xD;
      publications, the modulation of the gut bacteria drives its therapeutic properties. While&#xD;
      successful, EEN is a challenging therapy to follow. Half of the paediatric EEN patients will&#xD;
      require a nasogastric tube to support treatment, its use in adults is limited, and the need&#xD;
      for a more palatable diet is very well described. Based on these findings, a non-liquid and&#xD;
      more acceptable dietary treatment was recently devised called CD-TREAT (Crohn's Disease&#xD;
      TReatment-with-EATing) diet. CD-TREAT, which is a solid food-based diet designed to replicate&#xD;
      the nutrients and food ingredients composition of EEN, was recently tested in healthy adults&#xD;
      and a rat model of colitis. In order to pilot CD-TREAT diet as a CD induction treatment, 10&#xD;
      children and 10 adults with active luminal CD will be recruited. Once consented, baseline&#xD;
      blood, urine and faecal samples will be collected and the CD-TREAT prescribed for a maximum&#xD;
      of 12 weeks. Another 3 blood, urine and faecal samples will be requested during the 12 weeks.&#xD;
      All the foods/meals of the CD-TREAT diet will be purchased and delivered to the participants'&#xD;
      house by the researcher and the meals which need cooking will be pre-prepared by a&#xD;
      sub-contracted catering company. Blood and faecal inflammatory biomarkers will be measured,&#xD;
      the disease activity assessed with routinely used clinical indices and the faecal bacteria&#xD;
      and its metabolites characterised.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children and adults who are eligible to participate will be identified by medical staff. A&#xD;
      member of the clinical team will briefly inform potential participants about the study via&#xD;
      the phone, via e-mail, or at the clinic. After the end of the clinical appointment and if the&#xD;
      patient and/or the parent/carer are agreeable, a member of the clinical team will introduce&#xD;
      the eligible participants to the researcher who will explain the study in full and answer any&#xD;
      questions they might have. During this meeting, the researcher will discuss the specific&#xD;
      aspects of dietary treatment with CD-TREAT and will inform participants that urine, blood and&#xD;
      faecal samples will be collected to try and determine the type of bacteria which may be&#xD;
      associated with gut inflammation, and their metabolites, and whether these can predict&#xD;
      response to treatment. The researcher will also ask for permission to collect medical&#xD;
      information from the participant's medical records. If they are interested in taking part,&#xD;
      they will be given detailed written information (including an age-appropriate information&#xD;
      leaflet). The information pack will also invite the family to contact the researcher at any&#xD;
      time if they require further information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As there is a very narrow time window between identification of eligible participants and&#xD;
      consent to participate to the study, and considering the need for immediate initiation of&#xD;
      treatment in patients with active disease, it is anticipated that signed consent to join the&#xD;
      study will be obtained on the same day of receiving information about it; however there will&#xD;
      be subsequent opportunity to review this decision. Consent will only be taken if participants&#xD;
      feel they have had adequate time to make this decision, and no pressure will be applied in&#xD;
      any way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will also facilitate the completion of a health check questionnaire, baseline clinical&#xD;
      review, medication and disease history, quality of life assessment, anthropometry&#xD;
      measurements, collection of baseline research bloods (extra volume at the time of routine&#xD;
      clinical tests (no additional venepuncture required). At this point the participant will be&#xD;
      asked to take a stool and urine sample collection kit at home and a suitable date/time to&#xD;
      collect the baseline samples will be arranged. The actual intervention will start&#xD;
      approximately 24 hours later in order to allow the participants enough time to consider and&#xD;
      discuss the study with their relatives, decide whether they would like to continue or drop&#xD;
      out and start the standard induction treatment as deemed necessary by the treating clinical&#xD;
      team. Furthermore, this 24 hour time window will enable the researcher to collect baseline&#xD;
      samples before the initiation of the CD-TREAT dietary treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where appropriate, the assent of the child will be sought (usually under age 11 or younger),&#xD;
      and in the case of young adults who would be deemed able by a member of the clinical team to&#xD;
      consent on their own part (usually age 12 or older), consent from the young person will be&#xD;
      accompanied by the parent/carer giving signed assent before they can join the study; to&#xD;
      ensure both child and parent/carer are willing and happy to take part. For children unable to&#xD;
      give written consent/assent, the parent/carer will be asked to explain the study in terms&#xD;
      that the child can understand and the carer will sign consent on their behalf.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will also be made clear at this stage, on information sheets and throughout the study that&#xD;
      participants can withdraw from the study at any time without it affecting their routine care&#xD;
      in any way. Continuation of CD-TREAT dietary advice and provision of CD-TREAT foodstuffs is&#xD;
      dependent however on continuation in the study. Discontinuation of study participation after&#xD;
      commencement of CD-TREAT would therefore involve return to standard induction treatment at&#xD;
      the discretion of the treating clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study recruited participants will be asked to provide urine, faecal and blood&#xD;
      samples (an additional small tube of blood when they are having routine bloods at clinical&#xD;
      appointments) on a maximum of 4 occasions. In addition, these time points will include&#xD;
      clinical review, quality of life assessment and anthropometry measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also provide some dietary information reflecting their compliance to&#xD;
      CD-TREAT diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD-TREAT Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients on the CD-TREAT diet will be supplied with an individually tailored,&#xD;
      dietitian-devised diet, consisting of ordinary foods, but custom-designed to recreate the&#xD;
      nutritional content and ingredients of EEN. The dietary intervention will be overseen by&#xD;
      qualified dieticians including a National Health Service (NHS) research dietician. The energy&#xD;
      content will be tailored to adult participants' total energy expenditure and physical&#xD;
      activity level calculated by the World Health Organisation (WHO) set of equations or will be&#xD;
      calculated for each child to meet their estimated average requirement (EAR) for age. Food and&#xD;
      instructions for those patients on CD-TREAT will be supplied directly to them by the&#xD;
      researchers on the day following recruitment. Foods which need cooking will be prepared by a&#xD;
      sub-contracted (food handling and hygiene certified) catering company and will be delivered&#xD;
      to the participants' house every 2-3 days. The rest of the foods will be delivered to the&#xD;
      participants' house every week. Participants will initially receive the modified diet for a&#xD;
      period of 8 weeks, similar to the duration of an EEN course. The researchers will instruct&#xD;
      the participants and their carers on how to follow the diet and how to record their dietary&#xD;
      intake during the intervention. Research follow-up visits will coincide with the&#xD;
      participants' clinical follow-ups (Week 2: phone review; Weeks 4 &amp; 8: hospital visit). These&#xD;
      follow up appointments will include collection of research bloods as an extra aliquot to&#xD;
      their routine clinical tests (no additional needle insertion is required), clinical review,&#xD;
      quality of life assessment and anthropometry measurements. At these appointments, the&#xD;
      researchers will give the participants a stool and urine sample collection kit to take home&#xD;
      and will arrange a suitable date/time to collect the faecal and urine sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response to treatment will be assessed according to clinical review, CD activity score and&#xD;
      measurements of established biomarkers in faeces and blood (e.g. faecal calprotectin). The&#xD;
      primary endpoint will be clinical response (Adults: HBI fall≥3; Children: wPCDAI fall≥17.5)&#xD;
      or clinical remission (Adults: HBI&lt;5; Children: wPCDAI&lt;12.5) at 8 weeks; while secondary&#xD;
      endpoints include reduction in faecal calprotectin and blood inflammatory markers and changes&#xD;
      in anthropometry. All patients will be under close follow-up. No new CD-related medications&#xD;
      will be allowed during the pilot study, however if patients' disease activity is&#xD;
      deteriorating at any point during the study or there is no response at 4 weeks, patients will&#xD;
      be eligible to discontinue CD-TREAT diet and commence medical/surgical treatment as deemed&#xD;
      necessary by the treating clinical team. Those participants will still be encouraged to&#xD;
      provide stool, blood and urine samples at intervention exit. For those demonstrating&#xD;
      response, all background CD-related medication dosages will remain stable unless a subject&#xD;
      develops specific drug-related side-effects, blood monitoring abnormalities or blood drug&#xD;
      levels requiring alteration. Those patients who experience clinical response but not clinical&#xD;
      remission at 8 weeks will be given the opportunity to stay on CD-TREAT for a further 4 weeks.&#xD;
      At the end of this period (12 weeks post CD-TREAT initiation) they will be asked to provide&#xD;
      the last stool and urine sample and they will have the last follow-up appointment including&#xD;
      collection of research bloods, clinical review, quality of life assessment and anthropometry&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
