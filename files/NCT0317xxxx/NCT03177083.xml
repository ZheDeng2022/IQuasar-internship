      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate safety and tolerability as defined by the&#xD;
      frequency of the adverse events (AEs) of flu-like symptoms (FLS) [chills, pyrexia, myalgia,&#xD;
      and asthenia], injection site reactions (ISRs), and injection site reaction pain (ISR-P),&#xD;
      over 24 weeks of treatment (the active comparator period) with PLEGRIDY 125 microgram (μg)&#xD;
      subcutaneous (SC) every 2 weeks versus current SC IFN-β therapy in participants with&#xD;
      Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire is a validated instrument to measure impairments in work and activities. The WPAI yields four types of scores: 1. Absenteeism (work time missed) 2. Presenteesism (impairment at work / reduced on-the-job effectiveness) 3. Work productivity loss (overall work impairment / absenteeism plus presenteeism) 4. Activity Impairment. WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>
