    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized open-label trial. Women scheduled for their first or second&#xD;
      in-vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmatic Sperm Injection (IVF/ICSI) cycle and with no&#xD;
      abnormality detected in transvaginal ultrasound examination, were randomized to two groups.&#xD;
      In the first group (group I) 31 patients underwent hysteroscopy examination before IVF cycle&#xD;
      while in the second group (group II) 37 patients underwent direct cycle without previous&#xD;
      hysteroscopy&#xD;

      This is a prospective randomized open-label trial. Women scheduled for their first or second&#xD;
      IVF/ICSI cycle and with no abnormality detected in transvaginal ultrasound examination, were&#xD;
      randomized to two groups. In the first group (group I) 31 patients underwent hysteroscopy&#xD;
      examination before IVF cycle while in the second group (group II) 37 patients underwent&#xD;
      direct cycle without previous hysteroscopy. Then IVF cycle was performed with habitual&#xD;
      protocol. Beta Corionic Gonatropic hormone (BhCG) test two weeks after embryo transfer was&#xD;
      done. If test was positive, patients were followed up for detection pregnancy by transvaginal&#xD;
      ultrasound two weeks later. Another transvaginal ultrasound at 12 weeks of gestation was done&#xD;
      to confirm ongoing pregnancy. Biochemical pregnancy, implantation, on-going pregnancy and&#xD;
      livebirth rates were compared in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Miscarriage, complications rate and hysteroscopy tolerability were also analyzed.&#xD;
