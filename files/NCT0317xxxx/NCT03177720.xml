  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will determine the difference of pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin and&#xD;
      imipenem between healthy volunteers and intensive care patients suffering from pneumonia in&#xD;
      plasma and at the target site - lung - using bronchoalveolar lavage. As additional aspect the&#xD;
      feasibility of combining microdosing of C14 ciprofloxacin with microdialysis, saliva sampling&#xD;
      and bronchoalveolar lavage is studied by comparing pharmacokinetics of microdose and&#xD;
      macrodose.&#xD;
