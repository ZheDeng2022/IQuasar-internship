  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are bone marrow diseases.&#xD;
      People with these diseases usually need a bone marrow transplant. Researchers are testing&#xD;
      ways to make stem cell transplant safer and more effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if treating people with SAA or MDS with a co-infusion of blood stem cells from a&#xD;
      family member and cord blood stem cells from an unrelated donor is safe and effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients ages 4-60 with SAA or MDS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors ages 4-75&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood, lung, and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients will have an IV line placed into a vein in the neck. Starting 11 days before the&#xD;
      transplant they will have several chemotherapy infusions and 1 30-minute radiation dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients will get the donor cells through the IV line. They will stay in the hospital 3-4&#xD;
      weeks. After discharge, they will have visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First 3-4 months: 1-2 times weekly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then every 6 months for 5 years&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors veins will be checked for suitability for stem cell collection. They may need an IV&#xD;
      line to be placed in a thigh vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors will get filgrastim injections daily for 5-7 days. On the last day, they will have&#xD;
      apheresis: Blood drawn from one arm or leg runs through a machine and into the other arm or&#xD;
      leg. This may be repeated 2 days or 2-4 weeks later.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are life-threatening bone&#xD;
      marrow disorders. For SAA patients, long term survival can be achieved with immunosuppressive&#xD;
      treatment. However, of those patients treated with immunosuppressive therapy, one quarter to&#xD;
      one third will not respond, and about 50% of responders will relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined haplo-cord transplant as an alternative to cord or haploidentical donor alone&#xD;
      transplantation has recently been shown to be a viable transplant option for SAA patients&#xD;
      lacking an HLA matched donor. In our ongoing protocol 08-H-0046, we have utilized this&#xD;
      approach in 25 patients with SAA with 23/25 patients having sustained engraftment and&#xD;
      long-term disease free/transfusion free survival. However, engraftment patterns have varied&#xD;
      substantially and in some patients, cord engraftment was profoundly delayed or never&#xD;
      occurred. A number of strategies to expand hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) in vitro to&#xD;
      improve engraftment and prevent graft rejection have recently been studied. Nicotimanide&#xD;
      (NAM) expanded umbilical cord blood/unrelated cord blood (UCB) can be successfully engrafted&#xD;
      in NOD/SCID mice (1) and humans (2) where they appear to have long-term repopulating&#xD;
      potential. CordIn(TM) is a cryopreserved stem/progenitor cell-based product of purified&#xD;
      CD133+ cells composed of ex vivo expanded allogeneic UCB cells. CordIn(TM) comprises: 1) Ex&#xD;
      vivo expanded, umbilical cord blood-derived hematopoietic CD34+ progenitor cellsU (&#xD;
      (CordIn(TM) cultured fraction (CF)); and 2) the non-cultured cell fraction of the same CBU&#xD;
      (CordIn(TM) Non-cultured Fraction (NF)) consisting of mature myeloid and lymphoid cellsU.&#xD;
      Both fractions, i.e. CordIn(TM) CF and CordIn(TM) NF are kept frozen until they are infused&#xD;
      on the day of transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research protocol is therefore designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      transplantation with ex vivo expanded UCB (CordIn(TM)) to overcome the high incidence of&#xD;
      graft rejection associated with conventional UCB for aplastic anemia, where graft rejection&#xD;
      occurs in up to 50% of subjects. We believe, based on preliminary data, that transplantation&#xD;
      of CordIn(TM) will not only lead to rapid engraftment, but will also lead to sustained&#xD;
      hematopoiesis, expedited immune recovery, and will reduce the chance of cord graft failure in&#xD;
      this setting, potentially obviating the need for co-transplanting haploidentical CD34+ cells&#xD;
      as a stem cell back-up. This phase II study is designed to have two cohorts: cohort 1 is&#xD;
      intended to establish (in as safe a manner as possible) preliminary pilot data to support the&#xD;
      capacity for the CordIn unit to engraft in patients with SAA in the presence of haplo CD34+&#xD;
      cells. For cohort 1, three to six subjects will be conditioned then will be transplanted with&#xD;
      the thawed CordIn(TM) unit (consisting of the cultured fraction and the non-cultured fraction&#xD;
      of the same CBU) and approximately 3 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg from a haploidentical donor which&#xD;
      will serve as a backup stem cell source should cord graft failure occur. If 3 of the first 3&#xD;
      to 4 subjects or 4 of 6 subjects achieve early and sustained engraftment (defined as ANC &gt;500&#xD;
      cells/ul by day 26 and a calculated cord ANC &gt;500 cells /ul by day 42 sustained at day 100),&#xD;
      the study will move to cohort 2 where up to 23 subsequent subjects will be transplanted with&#xD;
      the CordIn(TM) unit alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the Phase II study is to evaluate the ability of the CordIn(TM) unit&#xD;
      to achieve sustained early engraftment. Secondary endpoints will include 100 day and 200 day&#xD;
      treatment related mortality (TRM), and standard transplant outcome variables such as&#xD;
      non-hematologic toxicity, incidence and severity of acute and chronic GVHD, and relapse of&#xD;
      disease. Health related quality of life will also be assessed as secondary outcome measure.&#xD;
