  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pancreatitis is a progressive inflammatory condition where progressive fibrosis and&#xD;
      calcification results in loss of physiological pancreatic function (both endocrine and&#xD;
      exocrine). The structural, fibrotic changes of chronic pancreatitis can only be seen in&#xD;
      advanced disease with conventional radiology tests and the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis&#xD;
      early in the disease course remains challenging. Early diagnosis and treatment of chronic&#xD;
      pancreatitis can prevent the complications of pain and malnutrition and improve the quality&#xD;
      of life of patients. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has recently become a favoured method for&#xD;
      diagnosing early structural fibrotic changes of chronic pancreatitis in clinical practiceÍ¾&#xD;
      however this technique is subjective with sub-optimal intra-observer agreement. A new&#xD;
      technique called elastography, performed during EUS, quantitatively measures tissue stiffness&#xD;
      which may give more reliable results. This study aims to assess whether EUS elastography can&#xD;
      accurately identify for chronic pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients referred for EUS examinations will be identified and recruited prospectively. The&#xD;
      investigators will perform endoscopic ultrasound examinations with elastography readings in&#xD;
      two groups of patients: those referred for EUS with suspicion of chronic pancreatitis and&#xD;
      those referred for EUS for assessment of abdominal pain without risk factors or any other&#xD;
      tests suggesting chronic pancreatitis. The elastography readings will then be compared to the&#xD;
      gold standard which is a composite evaluation including standard EUS examination using&#xD;
      morphological appearance (Rosemont classification), and other tests already performed&#xD;
      including cross-sectional imaging (MRCP and CT), patient history and faecal pancreatic&#xD;
      elastase (FEL-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified and data collected prospectively. There is no randomization or&#xD;
      blinding involved in the study as the endoscopists will need to be aware of the indication&#xD;
      for referral in order to carry out a complete examination.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic pancreatitis is a chronic inflammatory condition where progressive fibrosis and&#xD;
      scarring leads to loss of pancreatic exocrine and endocrine function and can lead to&#xD;
      development of malnutrition, weight loss, abdominal pain and impaired quality of life.&#xD;
      Patients with chronic pancreatitis have a high risk of pancreatic adenocarcinoma compared to&#xD;
      the general population so it is vital that they are identified early in the disease. There&#xD;
      are numerous causes of chronic pancreatitis therefore early detection and treatment can&#xD;
      prevent irreversible changes and symptoms developing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trans-abdominal ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) are currently used to investigate patients with symptoms suggestive of chronic&#xD;
      pancreatitis. These tests may, however, fail to show early changes in the bile ducts or small&#xD;
      areas of inflammation in pancreatic tissue. In areas of diagnostic uncertainty, endoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasound (EUS) is currently used to provide a more detailed assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUS uses a flexible endoscope (similar to a gastroscope) passed into the stomach via the&#xD;
      mouth. The EUS scope has the addition of a tiny ultrasound probe on the tip which is used to&#xD;
      acquire high resolution detailed images of the pancreas and other extra luminal structures&#xD;
      (lymph nodes, bile ducts, mediastinum) lying only centimeters from the tip of the probe.&#xD;
      Despite the advantages of EUS, image interpretation can be extremely challenging and in the&#xD;
      presence of inflammation. Morphological changes of chronic pancreatitis seen at EUS have been&#xD;
      classified according to the Rosemont classification; however, the findings are subjective&#xD;
      with sub-optimal intra-observer agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elastography is an ultrasound technique used to assess stiffness of tissues in the body. It&#xD;
      has established applications in detecting chronic liver disease, and improving diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy in breast and prostate cancers. Pancreatic elastography is now able to be performed&#xD;
      during a standard EUS examination using the existing equipment (in a similar manner to&#xD;
      Doppler). Tissue elasticity is measured and represented with different colours (on a scale of&#xD;
      1 to 255). The colour signal (red-green-blue) is then superimposed on the conventional&#xD;
      grey-scale image. Areas of increased stiffness are marked with dark blue, intermediate areas&#xD;
      with green and soft tissue areas with red. Areas of interest are able to be marked to give an&#xD;
      elasticity reading and this is also compared to a control area of stomach wall to calculate a&#xD;
      ratio (strain ratio).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elastography has now become part of the routine EUS exam following several studies that have&#xD;
      shown elastography can be successfully used to identify malignant pancreatic and lymph node&#xD;
      masses with high sensitivity allowing accurate targeting of fine needle aspiration (FNA)&#xD;
      biopsies and early confirmation or exclusion of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that changes of chronic pancreatitis can also be detected using&#xD;
      elastography assisted EUS. Detecting change at an early stage will benefit patients and&#xD;
      potentially reduce complications that result from chronic pancreatitis such as malnutrition,&#xD;
      pain and osteoporosis.&#xD;
