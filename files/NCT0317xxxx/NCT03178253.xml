  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes Mellitus is the most common disorder seen. The impact of this disease on the quality&#xD;
      of life, and on morbidity and mortality through the complications that affect the small and&#xD;
      large vessels resulting in retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and ischemic heart disease&#xD;
      has been emphasized by the findings of the national commission (USA) on diabetes .&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, there was curiosity to understand and learn the association of this disorder with another&#xD;
      common endocrine gland function that is thyroid gland . The association between these two&#xD;
      disorders has long been recognized although the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in diabetic&#xD;
      population varies widely between studies. With insulin and thyroid hormone being intimately&#xD;
      involved in cellular metabolism and thus excess or deficit of these hormones result in&#xD;
      functional derangement of the other.&#xD;

      Diabetic patients have higher prevalence of thyroid disorder when compared with the normal&#xD;
      population. Diabetic women are more frequently affected than men and hypothyroidism is more&#xD;
      common than thyrotoxicosis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-clinical hypothyroidism is an independent risk factor for development of diabetic&#xD;
      nephropathy. Severe hypothyroidism (biochemically) may be completely asymptomatic. Though our&#xD;
      patient had throid stimulating hormone level more than 100 mIU/L, he did not have any&#xD;
      symptoms of hypothyroidism.so diagnosis of hypothyroidism depends on laboratory parameters&#xD;
      rather than clinical findings Recognition and treatment of hypothyroidism in diabetic&#xD;
      patients will benefit glycemic control and improve general well-being ). Diabetic&#xD;
      nephropathy, a major micro-vascular complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus, is an important&#xD;
      cause of chronic kidney disease. It results from interactions between hemodynamic and&#xD;
      metabolic factors .&#xD;
