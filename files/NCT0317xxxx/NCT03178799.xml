      Aims: To compare clinical outcomes for patients under FLS and usual care at the NTUH MH and&#xD;
      BB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Four hundred subjects with new hip fracture or newly identified vertebral fracture&#xD;
      are randomly assigned into FLS and usual care (UC). FLS subjects received&#xD;
      osteoporosis-related assessments, treatments, consultations on diet, medications, exercise,&#xD;
      fall preventions given mainly by care managers with followed up telephone call at 4, 8, 12,&#xD;
      18, 24 months then annually for up to 10 years. Care managers will perform baseline&#xD;
      assessments and follow them by telephone annually for up to 10 years for UC subjects. Major&#xD;
      outcomes include bone mineral density assessment rate, calcium, vitamin D, and osteoporosis&#xD;
      medication initiation and adherence rate, fall and fracture incidences, mortality, and&#xD;
      healthcare resource utilizations.&#xD;

      Background: First fragility fracture increased risk for further fracture for 2-4 folds.&#xD;
      However, most fracture sufferers did not receive secondary prevention for osteoporosis to&#xD;
      decrease future fracture risks. Since 2014, the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH)&#xD;
      Healthcare system established fracture liaison services and were certified as gold (main&#xD;
      hospital, MH) and silver (Beihu branch, BB) medal for best practices. Our preliminary results&#xD;
      showed that compared with national average data, hip fracture patients under FLS may have&#xD;
      lower mortality rate. However, randomized control trial (RCT) is still needed to confirm&#xD;
      results from observational studies.&#xD;

      medication initiation and adherence rate, fall and fracture incidences, mortality, and&#xD;

&#xD;
      Anticipated results: Provide evidence on benefit of FLS in RCT on osteoporosis evaluation,&#xD;
      medication initiation, mediation adherence, calcium, vitamin D, protein, exercise adherence,&#xD;
      fall, re-fracture, mortality and other outcomes.&#xD;
