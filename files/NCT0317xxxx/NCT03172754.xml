  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II, open-label, multi-center study of axitinib in combination with&#xD;
      nivolumab in patients with previously treated and untreated advanced RCC. This clinical study&#xD;
      will be composed of a dose finding phase (Phase I) and two parallel dose expansion phases&#xD;
      (Phase II). The dose finding phase will assess the safety of the combination and establish a&#xD;
      recommended phase II dose (RP2D, the highest tested dose that is declared safe and tolerable&#xD;
      by the Investigators and the Sponsor Investigator) in patients with advanced RCC who have&#xD;
      received prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease. Phase II will evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      of the combination at the RP2D in two parallel expansion cohorts in both previously treated&#xD;
      and treatment naïve patients.&#xD;

             kg x 1.00)/(72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL). AST/ALT ≤ 3 x ULN. Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5&#xD;
             x ULN (except subjects with Gilbert Syndrome, who can have total bilirubin &lt; 3.0&#xD;

             doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active&#xD;
             autoimmune disease.&#xD;
