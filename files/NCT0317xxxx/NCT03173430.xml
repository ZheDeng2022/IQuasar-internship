    <textblock>
      This study involves receiving blinatumomab after high-dose melphalan and ASCT for multiple&#xD;
      myeloma. The main purpose of this study is to: - To determine whether blinatumomab is safe&#xD;
      and feasible to administer after ASCT in patients with advanced multiple myeloma. - To assess&#xD;
      how long multiple myeloma remains under control when blinatumomab is administered after&#xD;
      second ASCT.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have undergone a prior ASCT for multiple myeloma and have progressed&#xD;
             within 365 days of stem cell infusion. Progression is defined according to IMWG&#xD;
             criteria49.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior ASCT must have utilized melphalan conditioning at a dose of 200 mg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who underwent syngeneic transplant (i.e., transplant from an identical&#xD;
                  twin donor) rather than autologous transplant are eligible if syngeneic stem&#xD;
                  cells are available for use in the salvage transplant and syngeneic transplant&#xD;
                  will be considered equivalent to ASCT for the purposes of these&#xD;
                  inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients in whom first progression is identified between days 366 and 450&#xD;
                  (inclusive) after ASCT will be eligible if progression is identified on their&#xD;
                  first evaluation for progression in this window and if they had not been&#xD;
                  evaluated between days 270 and 365 for progression. This clause is to account for&#xD;
                  practice patterns in which patients otherwise doing well are monitored&#xD;
                  infrequently (every 3-6 months) for relapse after they recover from their first&#xD;
                  ASCT. This will allow infrequently monitored patients to be included if&#xD;
                  progression is identified on their &quot;12 month follow-up evaluation&quot; if this&#xD;
                  appointment happens to be scheduled just outside the 365-day post-ASCT window.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  There is no requirement that patients must enroll within 365 days of prior ASCT,&#xD;
                  and patients may be treated with other agents, including experimental agents,&#xD;
                  following relapse/progression after prior ASCT before enrollment on this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Subjects must have received as part of their initial therapy for multiple&#xD;
                       myeloma, prior to first ASCT, a regimen containing either bortezomib or&#xD;
                       lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have signed written, informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be ≥ 18 and ≤ 70 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have adequate vital organ function to undertake ASCT, defined as the&#xD;
             following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Estimated or measured creatinine clearance of ≥60 mL/min. CKD-EPI equation will&#xD;
                  be used for estimation of creatinine clearance&#xD;
                  (http://www.kidney.org/professionals/kdoqi/gfr_calculator).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  SGOT ≤ 3x the upper limit of normal and total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dl (except for&#xD;
                  patients in whom hyperbilirubinemia is attributed to Gilbert's syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction ≥45% as measured by echocardiography or MUGA&#xD;
                  scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequate pulmonary function with FEV1, FVC, TLC, and DLCO (after appropriate&#xD;
                  adjustment for lung volume and hemoglobin concentration) ≥40% of predicted&#xD;
                  values.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Non-hematologic toxicities from prior therapies must have recovered to grade ≤2&#xD;
                  according to CTCAE 4.0 criteria or the subject's prior baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have measurable disease, as defined in the IMWG response criteria49, on&#xD;
             study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have an ECOG performance status of 0-2 unless a higher performance&#xD;
             status is due solely to bone pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have stored in usable condition for second ASCT, as judged by the&#xD;
             principal investigator, ≥3x106 CD34+ cells per kg of body weight (either autologous or&#xD;
             syngeneic) stored in at least two bags such that after administration of the minimum&#xD;
             dose of 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg required on this protocol that a separate aliquot of at&#xD;
             least 1 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg remains for rescue infusion in the event of graft&#xD;
             failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must agree not to attempt to become pregnant or impregnate others (e.g.,&#xD;
             through sexual intercourse or sperm donation) between enrollment and completion of&#xD;
             blinatumomab therapy. Sexually active subjects with reproductive potential must agree&#xD;
             during the study to utilize a reliable method of contraception, which may include&#xD;
             condoms (male or female), diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide, intrauterine&#xD;
             device, or hormonal contraceptive. Acceptable documentation of the absence of&#xD;
             reproductive potential may consist of any one of the following: (1) physician&#xD;
             report/letter, (2) operative report or other source documentation of surgical&#xD;
             sterilization, (3) laboratory report of azospermia (required to document successful&#xD;
             vasectomy), (4) follicle stimulating hormone measurement elevated in the menopausal&#xD;
             range.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Due to the potential for neurological events, including seizures, while receiving&#xD;
             blinatumomab, subjects must be willing and able to refrain from driving and engaging&#xD;
             in hazardous occupations or activities such as operating heavy or potentially&#xD;
             dangerous machinery during the periods of blinatumomab infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating. Female subjects of reproductive potential (women who have&#xD;
             reached menarche and who have had menses within the preceding 24 months or have not&#xD;
             undergone hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) must have a negative serum pregnancy&#xD;
             test performed at the time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active and uncontrolled infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive serum testing for hepatitis B core antibody or hepatitis B surface antigen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of active hepatitis C or HIV infection (positive serology with appropriate&#xD;
             positive confirmatory testing, such as nucleic acid-based testing).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that would preclude participation as outlined in the judgment of the&#xD;
             principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior receipt of &gt;1 autologous stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant CNS pathology, including documented or suspected CNS myeloma.&#xD;
             Clinically insignificant clinical examination findings or imaging abnormalities (e.g.,&#xD;
             age-related changes) should not be cause for exclusions of potential subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Class III/IV cardiovascular disability according to the New York Heart Association&#xD;
             Classification.&#xD;
