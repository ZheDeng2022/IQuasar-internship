      The proposed study will conduct a preliminary investigation of the effectiveness of two&#xD;
      different psychotherapy classes at the Mental Health Crisis Response Centre (CRC) in reducing&#xD;
      suicidal ideation. One class - Managing Difficult Emotions (MDE) - is an 8-session,&#xD;
      Dialectical Behavioral Therapy-informed program that focuses on skills related to increasing&#xD;
      tolerance for distress and emotion regulation such that harmful behaviors are reduced. The&#xD;
      other class - Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBTm) - is a 4-session program&#xD;
      that focuses on challenging and changing maladaptive beliefs and behaviors in order to reduce&#xD;
      distress. Both classes are delivered in lecture style, PowerPoint format. The investigators&#xD;
      will also examine the effectiveness of participation in psychotherapy classes in reducing&#xD;
      symptoms of general psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and emotion dysregulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is the ninth leading cause of death in Canada, and rates are exponentially higher&#xD;
      among specific sub-populations of Canadians (Statistics Canada, 2015). Worldwide,&#xD;
      approximately 800,000 individuals die by suicide each year (WHO, 2016). A number of&#xD;
      interventions, such as psychotherapy, have been shown to effectively reduce suicidal thinking&#xD;
      and behaviors; however, several factors often impede or delay access to clinical care. In&#xD;
      order to reduce suicide, interventions must not only be evidence-based but also readily&#xD;
      accessible and perceived as being helpful by patients (Pagura et al., 2009; Turecki &amp; Brent,&#xD;
      2015). Large, lecture-style, skills-based psychotherapy interventions where patients can join&#xD;
      at any session can ensure timely access to services while being relatively unintimidating to&#xD;
      patients. However, little research to date has examined the effectiveness of such&#xD;
      interventions in reducing suicidality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a dire need to develop evidence-based clinical interventions that can be accessed&#xD;
      rapidly by individuals during their time of highest need (Brown &amp; Jager-Hyman, 2014). For&#xD;
      example, the first few days and weeks following hospital discharge post-suicide attempt&#xD;
      represents the period of highest risk for suicide completion, however, a staggering&#xD;
      proportion of individuals do not have an outpatient mental health appointment within this&#xD;
      timeframe (Glenn et al., 2015; Olfson et al., 2014). Further, studies have often not&#xD;
      evaluated the effectiveness of suicide interventions in &quot;real world&quot; settings and where&#xD;
      high-risk subgroups of individuals are included (e.g., substance users) and have not&#xD;
      consistently used valid and reliable measures of suicidal ideation (Brown &amp; Jager-Hyman,&#xD;
      2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are unaware of any study to date that has examined the effectiveness of&#xD;
      rapid access, large-scale, psychotherapy classes in reducing suicidality in a crisis&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 1: To examine the effectiveness of rapid access, large volume CBT and&#xD;
      DBT-informed psychotherapy classes in reducing suicidal ideation among individuals presenting&#xD;
      with a mental health crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that participation in either class will reduce&#xD;
      suicidal thinking, and that decreases in suicidal ideation will be greater among those&#xD;
      patients completing the total number of classes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 2a: To examine the effectiveness of participation in psychotherapy classes in&#xD;
      reducing symptoms of general psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and emotion&#xD;
      dysregulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2a: The investigators hypothesize that class participation will result in symptom&#xD;
      decreases across all outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 2b: To identify the sociodemographic and symptom profile(s) of patients&#xD;
      benefiting most from psychotherapy classes as well as the characteristics of patients for&#xD;
      whom the classes are not helpful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2b: The patient profiles deriving the greatest and least psychological benefit&#xD;
      (i.e., changes in suicidality and symptoms) from these classes are more exploratory in&#xD;
      nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Patients accessing care for a mental health crisis at the Crisis Response&#xD;
      Centre (CRC) or at hospital emergency departments in the city will be referred to the CRC's&#xD;
      Urgent Follow-up Intensive Treatment Team (UFITT). The UFITT program is designed to be as&#xD;
      inclusive as possible. Referral criteria include: 1) Being 18 years of age or older, 2) the&#xD;
      ability to benefit from and participate in large psychotherapy groups (i.e., absence of&#xD;
      active psychotic symptoms, ability to understand and read the class material, etc.), 3) not&#xD;
      having mental health needs that would be better served by other community resources (e.g., a&#xD;
      severe primary substance use disorder, intimate partner violence, etc.), and 4) not being at&#xD;
      immediate risk of harming self or others (i.e., patient is safe to return home and to attend&#xD;
      an appointment 1-2 weeks after the walk-in visit). Referrals are reviewed for appropriateness&#xD;
      by the UFITT team and patients are subsequently invited to attend an information session in&#xD;
      order to learn about the follow-up mental health services available. The majority of patients&#xD;
      who attend an information session choose to be enrolled in one of the two available&#xD;
      psychotherapy classes at the CRC. It is this subpopulation of patients who will be recruited&#xD;
      for the proposed study, and we aim to recruit approximately 250 participants. Each&#xD;
      participant will receive a $5 Tim Hortons Gift Card as a token of appreciation for their&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent Procedure: Prior to the start of the UFITT information session, the two study&#xD;
      coordinators will describe the study to patients, and will inform them that research&#xD;
      assistants will be available after patient appointments to meet with those who are interested&#xD;
      in participating. Study procedures will be explained in more detail and written informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained following the information session appointment. Participants will&#xD;
      additionally be asked if they would be willing to be contacted in the future. Patients who do&#xD;
      not consent to participate in the study will receive usual care and follow-up as per UFITT&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Procedures: The proposed study will collect a prospective cohort of patients&#xD;
      participating in the psychotherapy classes and will employ a pre-post design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UFITT patients currently complete a package of widely used, validated measures at the&#xD;
      information session in paper and pencil format that assess symptoms in a number of mental&#xD;
      health domains. This package of measures will serve as the baseline assessment in the&#xD;
      proposed study. Immediately following the information session, patients meet briefly with a&#xD;
      CRC staff member to discuss follow-up services and to receive recommendations related to&#xD;
      which UFITT psychotherapy class is most likely to benefit them based on their questionnaire&#xD;
      scores. Patients choosing to participate in either of the psychotherapy classes are typically&#xD;
      provided with an appointment to a class within one week of their information session date.&#xD;
      Patients are encouraged to attend psychotherapy classes weekly and at the completion of their&#xD;
      last class, are re-administered a subset of the same outcome measures. In the development of&#xD;
      the prospective cohort, the investigators will additionally administer the primary outcome&#xD;
      measure, the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (Beck &amp; Steer, 1991), to all consenting study&#xD;
      participants, which represents a validated and comprehensive assessment of suicidal thinking.&#xD;
      In order to understand changes in suicidal ideation among study participants who both&#xD;
      complete and 'drop out' from the classes, research assistants will contact those participants&#xD;
      who stop attending classes in order to re-administer the measures by telephone. The data&#xD;
      collection period will be approximately ten months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Study participants will take part in one of two psychotherapy classes currently&#xD;
      ongoing at the CRC. CBTm is a four session (90 minutes per session) introduction to cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral skills for managing symptoms of anxiety and depression. The content includes an&#xD;
      introduction to mindfulness, challenging maladaptive thoughts, behavioral activation,&#xD;
      exposure, managing anger, problem-solving and goal-setting strategies, sleep hygiene, and&#xD;
      healthy living guidelines. Managing Difficult Emotions is based on DBT, an intervention&#xD;
      developed by Dr. Marsha Linehan (2014). It is an eight session (90 minutes per session)&#xD;
      introduction to selected DBT skills related to mindfulness, emotion regulation, distress&#xD;
      tolerance, and interpersonal effectiveness. Although both of these classes have been&#xD;
      developed to target transdiagnostic psychological distress, several examples related to&#xD;
      suicidal ideation and behavior will be used when teaching the skills. Classes are delivered&#xD;
      in PowerPoint format, and class sizes typically range from 10 to 25 patients. Sessions have&#xD;
      been developed to stand alone, and patients can join either class at any session. Patient&#xD;
      participation is encouraged but not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytic Plan: Data from the hard copy measures will be entered into an electronic database&#xD;
      and statistical analyses will be conducted using SPSS v.22. A comprehensive&#xD;
      intention-to-treat analysis will examine change in suicidal ideation - the primary outcome -&#xD;
      as assessed by the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation. These analyses will include all study&#xD;
      participants for whom pre-post scores can be obtained, including non-completers of the&#xD;
      classes. Type of class (MDE vs. CBTm) and number of sessions attended will additionally be&#xD;
      evaluated as predictors of decreases in suicidal ideation. A parallel analysis will be used&#xD;
      to examine the effectiveness of class participation in reducing the secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures, namely depression, anxiety, general distress, and emotion dysregulation symptoms&#xD;
      from the baseline assessment to the last class completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sociodemographic factors (i.e., sex, age, marital status, employment status, level of&#xD;
      education), nature of presenting problem at walk-in (e.g., increase in suicidal&#xD;
      ideation/behavior, onset of psychosocial stressors, exacerbated trauma-related symptoms,&#xD;
      depression/anxiety), and baseline symptoms of depression, anxiety, distress, and emotion&#xD;
      dysregulation will be examined as predictors of suicidal ideation at follow-up using linear&#xD;
      regression analysis. This analysis will identify the profile of patients who have benefitted&#xD;
      the most and the least from psychotherapy classes, and will include both class completers and&#xD;
      non-completers. The type and number of classes attended will also be examined in relation to&#xD;
      suicidal ideation.&#xD;
