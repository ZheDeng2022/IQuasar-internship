      This study is designed to investigate the association of the clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      parameters or data with the cardiac structural and functional abnormalities in systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematosus(SLE). Patients with at least four ACR classification criteria for SLE and&#xD;
      stable clinical condition (no need for immunosuppressive therapy intensification, i.e.&#xD;
      current immunosuppressive drug dose increase or introduction of an additional&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drug within last 3 months) will be included in the study. Study procedures&#xD;
      will include clinical evaluation, lab tests including blood counts, liver and kidney&#xD;
      functions and antibodies levels such as ANA, antiphospholipid antibodies, anti-ds DNA as well&#xD;
      as inflammatory markers such as sedimentation rates. Also evaluation of cardiac status by&#xD;
      cardiologist examination echocardiography and gadolinium enhanced cardiac MRI. Next,&#xD;
      correlation between cardiac abnormalities and laboratory changes will be statistically&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;

      -  Subject recruitment and obtaining consent Study subjects (SLE patients) will be&#xD;
           recruited from patients attending outpatient clinic and inpatients of the Rheumatology&#xD;
           and Rehabilitation Department, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University. Written informed&#xD;
           consent form will be obtained from each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. All SLE patients selected for the study will fulfill the ACR criteria for the&#xD;
                diagnosis of SLE .&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Thorough clinical history and examination will be performed to all SLE patients.&#xD;
                Pulmonary function (PFTs) test will be performed to exclude respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Urine pregnancy test to exclude pregnancy will be performed to all SLE females'&#xD;
                patients of the childbearing period in the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory tests: the following tests will be performed to all study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Complete blood count (CBC),&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Liver and kidney functions and measurement of protein in urine collected over 24&#xD;
                hours,&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Levels of Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and their titer will be assessed by indirect&#xD;
                immunofluorescence,&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Complement system C3 and C4 factors will be measured to determine disease activity,&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Serum levels of anticardiolipin (aCL) and lupus anticoagulant antibodies will be&#xD;
                measured using ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease activity will be assessed by using SELDAI score [11].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Echocardiography will be performed to evaluate structural and functional outcome&#xD;
                measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Cardiac MRI: Multiple consecutive MR image sections will be obtained from the apex&#xD;
                to the base of the heart. T2 and T1 mapping will be performed. T1-weighted&#xD;
                inversion recovery scout images will be acquired 15 min after injection of 0.2&#xD;
                mmol/kg of gadolinium based contrast agent. The functional and volumetric analysis&#xD;
                will be performed to quantify ventricular volumes and functions.&#xD;
