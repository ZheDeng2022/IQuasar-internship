    <textblock>
      This study is being done to test the safety and effectiveness of pembrolizumab followed by&#xD;
      radiation therapy in Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine how effective combining the research drug,&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, with a targeted form of radiation therapy known as involved site radiotherapy&#xD;
      can be in patients with relapsed or refractory early stage classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The&#xD;
      goal is to see whether this treatment strategy can cure a significant number of patients with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory early stage classical Hodgkin lymphoma while avoiding the toxicity of&#xD;
      either a large radiation field or further chemotherapy and stem cell transplant.&#xD;

    <description>Following a PET/CT simulation to evaluate the extent of disease, pembrolizumab 200mg IV will be given over 30 minutes on day 1 of each 21 day cycle for a total of 4 cycles. Fourteen to 21 days after the completion of therapy, a PET/CT simulation will be repeated. Pts with complete response will proceed to 20 Gy of ISRT. Pts without a PET CR, but improvement on CT scan will have a repeat biopsy. If the biopsy is negative for Hodgkin Lymphoma, these ps will receive 30 Gy of ISRT. If the biopsy is positive for Hodgkin Lymphoma, they will receive 36-40 Gy ISRT. Pts without a PET CR, but improvement on CT scan will have a repeat biopsy. If the biopsy is negative for Hodgkin Lymphoma, these pts will receive 30 Gy of ISRT. If the biopsy is positive for Hodgkin Lymphoma, they will receive 36-40 Gy ISRT. Pts with new sites of disease or progression on imaging will have a repeat biopsy, per treating physician's discretion &amp; then be treated off study.</description>
