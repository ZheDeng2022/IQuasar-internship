  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure can cause physical changes to the blood vessels of the body (remodeling).&#xD;
      If a person who has high blood pressure also has a lot of blood vessel remodeling with their&#xD;
      condition, they are more likely to have poor results with medical treatment for hypertension.&#xD;
      The researchers examine the impact of different classes of drugs that doctors use to treat&#xD;
      high blood pressure (hypertension) on blood vessel remodeling. Some drugs that doctors&#xD;
      prescribe for their patients contain a &quot;sulfhydryl group&quot; (a sulfur atom bonded to a hydrogen&#xD;
      atom). Drugs that have the sulfhydryl group may reduce blood vessel remodeling more that&#xD;
      drugs that do not. For this study, participants who have high blood pressure perform the&#xD;
      experiments, take a drug for 16-weeks to lower blood pressure, and repeat the experiments.&#xD;
      The researchers randomly assign one of three drugs to participants who have high blood&#xD;
      pressure: a diuretic (&quot;water pill&quot;), a drug containing a sulfhydryl (SH) group, or a drug&#xD;
      that does not contain a sulfhydryl group. Participants who do not have high blood pressure&#xD;
      perform the experiments, but do not take any of the drugs. In some of our experiments, the&#xD;
      researchers use a technique called &quot;microdialysis&quot; (MD). With MD, the researchers perfuse&#xD;
      some research drugs into the skin on the forearm through tiny tubing that mimics capillaries.&#xD;
      These MD drugs mimic or block substances the body naturally makes to control the small blood&#xD;
      vessels in the skin. The drugs remain in nickel-sized areas around the tubing and do not go&#xD;
      into the rest of the body. The researchers also analyze very small skin samples (skin biopsy)&#xD;
      obtained from the forearm. Lastly, the researchers use a standard technique called &quot;flow&#xD;
      mediated dilation&quot; (FMD) that uses blood pressure cuffs and ultrasound to look at the health&#xD;
      of larger blood vessels in the body. FMD includes placing a small tablet of nitroglycerin&#xD;
      under the tongue during part of the test.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Upon initial screening and again within a week of testing, all subjects will have an&#xD;
      assessment of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure. Subject screening will be performed by the&#xD;
      Penn State Clinical Translational Research Center (CTRC) medical staff and will include a&#xD;
      physical exam by a clinician, anthropometry, and a chemical and lipid profile, liver and&#xD;
      renal function. Women will be either postmenopausal (absence of menstruation of &gt;1 year and&#xD;
      Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) &gt;25 milli-international units per milliliter (mlU/ml)) and&#xD;
      not be taking hormone replacement therapy, or normally menstruating and tested in the early&#xD;
      follicular phase of their cycle. Subjects will also go through an assessment of conduit&#xD;
      vessel endothelial and vascular smooth muscle function with brachial artery flow-mediated&#xD;
      vasodilation (FMD), and sublingual nitroglycerin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo initial microdialysis experiments and biopsy samples will be obtained.&#xD;
      Subjects will then be randomly assigned to treatment group. Blood pressure will be monitored&#xD;
      every 2 weeks and weekly compliance checks will be made by the researcher's nurse&#xD;
      coordinator. 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring will be conducted monthly to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy of antihypertensive treatment and to inform dosing titration.&#xD;
      Examining pharmacokinetic and dynamic data from the literature indicate that blood pressure&#xD;
      lowing and peripheral vascular effects are maximized by 12 weeks of antihypertensive therapy&#xD;
      and maintained thereafter. After 16 weeks of the assigned intervention, subjects will repeat&#xD;
      microdialysis experiments and additional cutaneous biopsy samples will be obtained. Conduit&#xD;
      artery measures including brachial artery FMD and responsiveness to sublingual nitroglycerin&#xD;
      will also be evaluated at this time.&#xD;
