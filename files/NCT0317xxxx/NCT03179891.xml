      This Phase 2 open-label, two-way study was conducted in adult subjects with epilepsy who were&#xD;
      on stable regimens of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) and who were admitted to an Epilepsy&#xD;
      Monitoring Unit (EMU), General Clinical Research Center (GCRC), or similar facility for&#xD;
      evaluation of their seizures. All subjects received a single DBF 12.5 mg dose during the&#xD;
      Interictal State and a single DBF 12.5 mg dose during the Ictal/peri-ictal state with at&#xD;
      least 14 days washout between the 2 doses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 2 multicenter, open-label, two-way study conducted in adult subjects to&#xD;
      assess the bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and safety of DBF during the Interictal Period&#xD;
      and during the Ictal/peri-ictal Period, with a minimum of 14 days of washout between periods.&#xD;
      Subjects had a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy (with generalized tonic-clonic seizures or&#xD;
      focal seizures with impaired awareness) who were on stable regimens of anti-epileptic drugs&#xD;
      and were scheduled for admission to an EMU, GCRC, or similar facility for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects were to receive a single 12.5-mg dose of study drug, without regard to meals,&#xD;
      during both Interictal Period and Ictal/peri-ictal Period. The treatment was identical for&#xD;
      both periods. Treatment sequence was not randomized. The interictal period and&#xD;
      ictal/peri-ictal could occur in either order as determined by seizure occurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interictal Period: Subjects were considered to be in an interictal state if an interval of at&#xD;
      least 3 hours had elapsed since any clinically observable postictal signs or symptoms (from&#xD;
      the last observed seizure) and the subject had been seizure-free over this period. Subjects&#xD;
      on electroencephalogram (EEG) video monitoring were to be considered to be in an interictal&#xD;
      state if an interval of at least 3 hours had elapsed since there were any postictal&#xD;
      electrical findings on EEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ictal/peri-ictal Period: For the purposes of this study, the ictal state was defined as an&#xD;
      ongoing clinically observable seizure or seizure activity as verified via EEG. The periictal&#xD;
      state was defined clinically as the subject's immediate postictal state following a&#xD;
      generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizure or focal seizure with impaired awareness, and within 5&#xD;
      minutes following the last clonic jerk. For subjects on EEG video monitoring, the periictal&#xD;
      state was to be defined as less than 5 minutes after cessation of seizure activity as&#xD;
      verified via EEG.&#xD;

      <recruitment_details>Planned enrollment was 40 adult male and female subjects with a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy requiring admission to an epilepsy monitoring unit, a general clinical research center, or similar facility for evaluation of seizures. A minimum of 30 subjects was expected to complete the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 35 subjects were enrolled to receive a 12.5-mg dose of study drug during both the interictal and the ictal/peri-ictal period which occurred in either order as determined by seizure occurrence.</pre_assignment_details>
