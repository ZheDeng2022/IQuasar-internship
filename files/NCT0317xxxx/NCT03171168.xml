    <textblock>
      AposTherapy is a home based exercise program utilizing footwear that causes exercise with&#xD;
      normal activity that may significantly improve function in patients with knee osteoarthritis&#xD;
      since patients with knee osteoarthritis have altered mechanics of motion contributing or due&#xD;
      to the presence of the conditions. Capitalizing on the reported excellent adherence and&#xD;
      clinical benefit of ApostTherapy in patients with significant knee OA, the investigators&#xD;
      propose to evaluate this as a conservative treatment that may supplant/supplement traditional&#xD;
      pain medications and physical therapy in an at-risk urban inner city population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AposTherapy is a home-based exercise program utilizing footwear that causes exercise with&#xD;
      normal daily activity that may significantly improve function in patients with knee pain in&#xD;
      general, and specifically knee osteoarthritis (OA). Capitalizing on the reported excellent&#xD;
      adherence and clinical benefit of Apos Therapy in patients with significant lower limb&#xD;
      arthritis, the investigators propose to evaluate this as a conservative treatment that may&#xD;
      supplant/supplement traditional pain medications and physical therapy in knee OA population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A potential use of AposTherapy as a replacement for traditional physical therapy may yield a&#xD;
      less costly, more effective therapy with better adherence. Problems with traditional therapy&#xD;
      include poor patient adherence (patients often do not complete the sessions and have very&#xD;
      poor adherence (about 50-60%) to home therapy programs), added cost of travel (which may be&#xD;
      more than $100 per session for ambulette or access-a-ride for eligible patients), and the&#xD;
      lack of continuation in an ongoing exercise program, leading to relapse and need for&#xD;
      retreatment. Additionally, access to physical therapy is limited for many patients since&#xD;
      there are not enough available outpatient therapy services to meet the needs of all patients.&#xD;
      Finding an alternative exercise program that will increase adherence, decrease total therapy&#xD;
      visits, and improve patient's outcomes with decreased dependence on pain medications is a&#xD;
      high priority from both patient care and cost management perspectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AposTherapy potentially overcomes many of these issues with improving/modifying abnormal&#xD;
      biomechanics (therefore decreasing pain), and a home-based exercise program utilizing&#xD;
      footwear that causes exercise with normal activity by promoting perturbation. This&#xD;
      biomechanical approach may significantly reduce pain and improve function in patients with&#xD;
      knee OA. Capitalizing on the reported excellent adherence and clinical benefit of AposTherapy&#xD;
      in patients with significant knee OA, the investigators propose to evaluate the biomechanical&#xD;
      exercise (wearing an appropriately calibrated shoe at home for a prescribed amount of time&#xD;
      each day) as a conservative treatment that may supplement or supplant traditional pain&#xD;
      medications, interventional pain procedures and physical therapy in an at-risk urban inner&#xD;
      city population with knee OA.&#xD;
