  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a common consequence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, not all&#xD;
      individuals with OSA have hypertension and there are major individual differences in blood&#xD;
      pressure response to positive airway pressure treatment of OSA. This project is focused on&#xD;
      determining the basis of these individual differences in blood pressure response to OSA and&#xD;
      will evaluate the possible underlying reasons for these differences. The results will help&#xD;
      clinicians to know whether or not to expect a reduction in blood pressure (BP) to OSA&#xD;
      treatment in a given patient and thereby personalize patient management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We seek to assess the clinical determinants and molecular/genetic mechanisms underlying known&#xD;
      individual differences in BP response to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This will result in a&#xD;
      more personalized approach to BP management of OSA patients. Hypertension is a common&#xD;
      consequence of OSA. Animal studies with cyclical intermittent hypoxia indicate that oxidative&#xD;
      stress is likely the major mechanism, but cardiovascular response to arousals may also play a&#xD;
      role. However, not all individuals with OSA have hypertension. Moreover, recent meta-analyses&#xD;
      of treatment trials of OSA show major individual differences in BP response. The largest drop&#xD;
      in BP with positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy for OSA is in patients with resistant&#xD;
      hypertension taking three or more BP medications. This project is focused on determining the&#xD;
      basis of these individual differences in BP response to OSA and PAP treatment. For Aim 1, we&#xD;
      will assemble four groups of OSA subjects with: 1) no hypertension; 2) controlled&#xD;
      hypertension on medications and/or lifestyle modifications; 3) uncontrolled hyper-tension&#xD;
      despite one or two anti-hypertensive medications; and 4) resistant hypertension. We will&#xD;
      assess reductions in BP with PAP therapy with mean nocturnal (sleep) arterial BP being the&#xD;
      primary end-point. The prediction is that group 4 will show the largest fall in BP, even&#xD;
      after controlling for relevant covariates, group 3 the next biggest fall, while groups 1 and&#xD;
      2 will show minimal BP changes. Both intent to treat and per protocol analyses, i.e.,&#xD;
      analyzing only those subjects who had PAP adherence of ≥ 4 hours/day and are adherent to&#xD;
      medication, will be conducted. All subjects will have the following measured before and after&#xD;
      4 months of therapy: urinary isoprostanes and plasma levels of norepinephrine, renin&#xD;
      activity, aldosterone, oxidized LDL, endothelin-1, and inflammatory biomarkers. In Aim 2, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that those individuals with higher BP at baseline and the greatest BP response to&#xD;
      PAP therapy will have higher levels of urinary isoprostanes and plasma norepinephrine at&#xD;
      baseline and greater falls with therapy. Animal studies show that the key enzyme mediating&#xD;
      oxidative stress in OSA is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase (NADPH)&#xD;
      oxidase (NOX), in particular NOX2. Thus, NADPH oxidase activity will also be assessed.&#xD;
      Individuals with the largest falls in BP on PAP therapy are hypothesized to have the highest&#xD;
      activity of this enzyme at baseline. There are known genetic variants of this enzyme that&#xD;
      affect its structure/activity. Thus, individual differences could be the result of genetic&#xD;
      variants. To address this, we will employ in-depth sequencing and evaluate variants in 7 key&#xD;
      genes regulating NOX2 structure/activity. Gene variants identified will be related to BP&#xD;
      responses and to NADPH oxidase activity. In Aim 3, the role of arousals in the BP response to&#xD;
      OSA will be assessed using a novel measurement of heart rate response to arousal. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that the heart rate response to arousal will be related to the BP and molecular&#xD;
      outcomes of Aims 1 and 2. Finally, given the complex relationship between OSA and BP, Aim 4&#xD;
      will utilize structural equation modeling to assess the relative impact of the various&#xD;
      biological pathways.&#xD;
