      Study Design: Randomized Controlled Trial, Open label. Study setting: Neonatology unit,&#xD;
      Postnatal clinic and children Out Patient Department and growth clinic at Advanced Pediatrics&#xD;
      Centre, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) Chandigarh Study&#xD;
      period: January 2017 to June 2018 Consecutively born all term babies in the labour room,&#xD;
      PGIMER,Chandigarh, and residing in tricity area and within 100 km radius of Chandigarh will&#xD;
      be screened for fulfilment of inclusion criteria within 1st 24 hours of life. Babies will be&#xD;
      classified as SGA or AGA as per Fenton's growth chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of maternal and neonatal characteristics will be recorded in a structured proforma&#xD;
      with a verbal consent of parents and counselling for follow up from 6 weeks onwards till 1&#xD;
      year of age. Details of discharge characteristics and anthropometry will be recorded in a&#xD;
      structured format. Exclusive breast feeding till 6 months will be advised to all mothers.&#xD;
      Kuppuswamy's scale will be used to assess socioeconomic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Birth details of babies will be recorded from the labour room register in PGIMER Labour Room.&#xD;
      Their parents will be asked to report to the PostNatal Clinic after 6 weeks for their routine&#xD;
      followup. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be applied at the postnatal visit at 6 weeks,&#xD;
      and consent will be taken. Randomisation will be done at 6 weeks in the postnatal clinic,&#xD;
      along initiation of iron in the early (6 weeks group) These babies are routinely followed up&#xD;
      in Post Natal Clinic (PNC) at 6 weeks for maternal check up and for initiation of&#xD;
      vaccination. Subsequently they are seen in Children's OPD at 10 and 14 wks to complete&#xD;
      vaccination and at 6 months for complementary feeding advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A written, informed consent would be obtained from one of the parents after explaining&#xD;
      details of intervention at enrolment at 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currenly as per unit protocol, all term babies receive only Vitamin D drops 400 IU daily for&#xD;
      1 year. No other supplements are given till 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants in early group will receive iron supplementation from 6 weeks of age, while those in&#xD;
      routine group will receive iron supplementation from 6 months of age as per World Health&#xD;
      Organisation (WHO) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an open label study regarding group allocation due to nature of the study&#xD;
      however labs will be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics permission will be sought from Institute Research ethics committee as per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION Term SGA and AGA babies fulfilling the inclusion criteria would be randomised&#xD;
      to early and routine iron supplementation using computer generated random numbers using block&#xD;
      randomization in opaque sealed envelopes which will be opened once the parental consent is&#xD;
      given. Flow of patients will be recorded as per CONSORT guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be done in 2 separate groups (AGA and SGA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients along with their parents would be contacted on phone at 6 weeks to report to PNC&#xD;
      along with their mothers where enrolment and randomization will take place. Subsequently&#xD;
      babies will be seen at 10 weeks, 14 weeks, 6 months , 9 months and 1 yr of age . Compliance&#xD;
      would be ensured by telephonic conversation in the interim period. Parents will be taught to&#xD;
      use daily alarms in mobile for administration of iron.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit they will be examined by PI and the supervising consultant in CHOPD for&#xD;
      Anthropometry, Feeding/ Diet, Any illness, Compliance about drug intake and Drug dose&#xD;
      adjustments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6 months, parents would be advised to give complementary feeding as per CF chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron supplementation would be started at 3 mg/kg/day at 6 weeks in early group as well as 6&#xD;
      months group using a liquid preparation of iron, vitamin B12 and folic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Composition per 1 ml Elemental iron 25 mg + lysine hydrochloride 200 mg + Vitamin B12 5 mcg +&#xD;
      Folic acid 200 mcg&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the child suffers from any illness during study period, it shall be noted. Sampling for&#xD;
      ferritin will not be done at time of illness; it will be done 1 week after illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any additional drug intake by the child during this period will also be noted in the&#xD;
      proforma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All illnesses including all OPD visits and admissions during study period will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of complementary feeding would be taken by 24 hour recall method, and calculation of&#xD;
      calorie and protein intake per day would be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HEMATOLOGICAL PARAMETERS Blood samples would be drawn at 6 months of age in all babies and&#xD;
      repeated at 1 year of age. 2 ml of blood would be drawn by aseptic precautions in 1 EDTA vial&#xD;
      for Hemoglobin, RBC indices as well as ferritin.. No payment will be required to be made, as&#xD;
      it will be purchased from departmental research grant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected EDTA sample would be first processed for hemogram by 6-part differential Sysmex&#xD;
      XN-1000 (Japan) automatic analyser which would use 400 microlitre of blood. Processing would&#xD;
      be done on a daily basis. Reports will be collected by the primary investigator in the&#xD;
      evening and will be handed over to the parents during followup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EDTA sample would then be centrifuged at 300 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the plasma,&#xD;
      which will be kept in properly labelled 2ml Eppendorf tubes. The samples would be stored at&#xD;
      -20Â°C at APC 4A Hematology Lab. Processing would be done in batches every 2nd day by&#xD;
      chemiluminescence assay using ADIVA Centaur Ferritin assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples for hemogram and ferritin will be processed under the guidance of coguide Dr. Prateek&#xD;
      Bhatia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROWTH ASSESSMENT Growth assessment would be done by the principal investigator under the&#xD;
      guidance of Prof AK Bhalla at 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year of age, in Growth Lab, APC 5D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. WEIGHT: The nude body weight of each child in standing /lying down position will be&#xD;
           recorded on an electronic weighing scale (make Every India Limited) upto accuracy of 50&#xD;
           gram. Scale is calibrated before each individual weighing then weight will be plotted on&#xD;
           WHO growth charts [ANNEXURE 8], and the respective percentile noted&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. LENGTH: Infantometer will be used to measure crown heel length up to an accuracy of 1&#xD;
           mm. Each infant will be placed over the horizontal board. The infant's head will be&#xD;
           adjusted against the head plate so that the lower orbital margin and tragus lie on the&#xD;
           same plane. The knee of the infant will be straightened and the foot will push the foot&#xD;
           plate out so that the there is no gap between the foot and the foot plate. The reading&#xD;
           in the tape across at the level of the foot plate will be noted after taking the infant&#xD;
           out. Length will be plotted on WHO growth chart [ANNEXURE 9], and the respective&#xD;
           percentile noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. HEAD CIRCUMFERENCE: Head circumference (HC) will be measured by using non flexible fibre&#xD;
           glass tape with minimum record of 1mm. The measure will be taken by encircling the tape&#xD;
           firmly around the head just above the supra orbital ridges and over the most prominent&#xD;
           backwardly protruding part of the occiput. HC will be plotted on WHO growth chart&#xD;
           [ANNEXURE 10], and the respective percentile noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard deviation scores for weight, length and HC scores for corrected age will be&#xD;
      calculated using the WHO anthro for PC software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be assessed at&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 weeks - anthropometry (length, weight, HC) at enrolment and randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 months - anthropometry and haematological parameters (Hemoglobin, RBC indices,&#xD;
           Ferritin)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 year - anthropometry and haematological parameters (Hemoglobin, RBC indices, Ferritin)&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY ENDPOINTS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. At 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Any condition requiring blood transfusion before 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OUTCOME - 1. Proportion of infants with Iron Deficiency Anemia. at 6 months and 1&#xD;
      year in 2 groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OUTCOME -&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Growth parameters ( weight, length and HC and their z scores) in 2 groups at 6 months and&#xD;
      1 year Serum ferritin in early vs routine iron supplementation group at 6 months and 1 year&#xD;
      All the above outcomes will be assessed in SGA and AGA groups separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IRON DEFICIENCY will be defined as serum ferritin &lt; 15 Âµg/l. IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA will be&#xD;
      defined as Iron deficiency (serum ferritin &lt; 15 Âµg/l) with haemoglobin less than the age&#xD;
      specific cutoffs.&#xD;
