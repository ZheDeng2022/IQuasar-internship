  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the effect of adjunctive use of the SpinalStim bone growth stimulator on&#xD;
      lumbar fusion rate in high risk subjects who have had lumbar fusion surgery. All participants&#xD;
      will wear the bone growth stimulator for a minimum of 2 hours/day for 6 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this post market prospective study is to examine the effect of the adjunctive&#xD;
      use of the Orthofix SpinalStim™ device on lumbar fusion rate in high risk subjects who have&#xD;
      undergone lumbar fusion surgery. High risk subjects are those who are currently using&#xD;
      nicotine, who are having a multi-level fusion, who have had a prior failed fusion at any&#xD;
      lumbar level, who are diabetic or who are osteoporotic. Because this is a post market&#xD;
      prospective study, subjects who are enrolled in this study will be identified by the&#xD;
      Investigator as needing lumbar fusion surgery and asked if they would like to participate in&#xD;
      a study looking at the efficacy of lumbar fusion with adjunctive use of the SpinalStim bone&#xD;
      growth simulator. The type of lumbar fusion surgery performed (lateral lumbar interbody&#xD;
      fusion [XLIF], posterior lumbar interbody fusion [PLIF], anterior lumbar interbody fusion&#xD;
      [ALIF], posterolateral fusion) is up to the Investigator; the subjects in the study must be&#xD;
      agreeable to using the bone growth stimulator daily for 6 months post surgery.&#xD;

               -  Is currently using nicotine&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  multi-level lumbar fusion surgery planned&#xD;
