  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a phase Ib study of PDR001 in combination with bevacizumab and mFOLFOX6 as first&#xD;
      line therapy in patients with metastatic microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer. The&#xD;
      study was to have assessed primarily, the safety and tolerability and then the efficacy of&#xD;
      PDR001 in combination with bevacizumab and mFOLFOX6. Particular attention would have been&#xD;
      paid to the level of activity of study drug combinations in CMS4 patients (retrospective&#xD;
      analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was terminated early due to company decision.&#xD;

        Key inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with metastatic MSS colorectal adenocarcinoma.Note: MSI status will be&#xD;
             performed locally by an immunohistochemistry (IHC) or PCR based test for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must provide a newly obtained or an archival tumor sample corresponding to&#xD;
             CRC diagnosis (primary tumor) with sufficient tissue quality (qualified) for analysis&#xD;
             (mandatory)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must provide a newly obtained tumor tissue sample from a metastatic site&#xD;
             (mandatory)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who are na√Øve to systemic treatment in metastatic setting. Patients with&#xD;
             previous neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy (that may have included oxaliplatin or&#xD;
             investigational VEGF inhibitors) are eligible if the treatment was completed &gt; 12&#xD;
             months before inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with the presence of at least one lesion with measurable disease as per&#xD;
             RECIST 1.1 guidelines. Lesions in previously irradiated areas should not be considered&#xD;
             measurable unless they have clearly progressed since the radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Patients have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
        Key exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with MSI-H colorectal adenocarcinoma as defined per local assessment using&#xD;
             standard of care testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with metastatic disease amenable to be resected with potentially curative&#xD;
             surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who have received any systemic treatment for metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with a history of prior treatment with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PDL2,&#xD;
             anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, other checkpoint inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients who had received radiation within 14 days prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
             drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply&#xD;
