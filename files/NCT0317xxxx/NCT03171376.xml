    <textblock>
      Increased incidence of apical periodontitis was reported where root filling was found coronal&#xD;
      to the marginal bone due to communication between pulp and periodontal space. It has been&#xD;
      suggested to place intraorifice barrier in the canal to provide coronal seal. However there&#xD;
      exists a void in literature regarding clinical validity of the termination of obturation&#xD;
      apical to marginal bone and placement of intraorifice barrier in resolution of periapical&#xD;
      pathology. Therefore this randomized controlled trial intends to investigate effect of&#xD;
      coronal level of obturation on endodontic success and marginal breakdown.&#xD;

      TITLE : &quot; Effect of coronal extent of obturation in relation to marginal bone on the healing&#xD;
      of endodontic - periodontal lesions without communication: a randomized controlled trial.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTRODUCTION: Coronal leakage is considered significant factor for failure of endodontic&#xD;
      treatment . To provide endodontic care of highest quality attention should be given to&#xD;
      coronal restoration after successful completion of root canal treatment. In an array of&#xD;
      retrospective studies significant numbers of cases were reported of apical periodontitis in&#xD;
      teeth with unsatisfactory coronal seal as compared to the ones with clinically or&#xD;
      radiographically acceptable coronal restoration. Post treatment restorative status and&#xD;
      quality &amp; extent of root filling along with preoperative periapical lesion were found to have&#xD;
      strong effect on outcome of endodontic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gutta-percha and sealer alone used routinely as root canal obturating material are found to&#xD;
      be ineffective to guard against microleakage. Even clinically acceptable root filling allow&#xD;
      penetration of bacteria and their products in as less as three days and contribute to&#xD;
      eventual treatment failure. This breach of seal in coronal segment of obturated root canal&#xD;
      may significantly jeopardize endodontic treatment outcome particularly in molars because of&#xD;
      presence of accessory canals in the floor of the pulp chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placing an additional protective barrier in the coronal portion of the root canal has been&#xD;
      recommended to minimize microleakage and facilitate healing of apical periodontitis.&#xD;
      Intraorifice barrier apart from enhancing probability of success of endodontic treatment may&#xD;
      also augment periodontal therapy as intra pulpal infection is known to contribute in&#xD;
      worsening of periodontal health by promoting marginal bone loss and pocket formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many materials have been tried as intraorifice barrier like cavit, IRM, amalgam, GIC,&#xD;
      composite resin, dentin bonding agents, MTA. Some studies have reported no difference amongst&#xD;
      materials while other found better performance of MTA over composite/GIC ; GIC over&#xD;
      Polycarboxylate cement/Flowable composite and resilon alone without intraorifice barrier and&#xD;
      composite over MTA/Cavit12 and Cavit/IRM.Recent studies have advocated use of adhesive&#xD;
      restorative material like GIC to provide adequate seal against bacterial micro leakage. Lee&#xD;
      et al demonstrated better sealing ability of MTA over both composite and GIC in an in vitro&#xD;
      dye infiltration experiment. Glass ionomer may provide better seal against penetration of&#xD;
      bacteria to the periapex because of its adhesive nature and ability to bond to the sclerotic&#xD;
      dentin found on the pulpal floor better than composite resin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However concerns are raised while applying these results in clinical setting because of&#xD;
      varied methodology employed in these studies. Also in a review article Gillen et al pointed&#xD;
      out that coronal restoration may be overemphasised based on the results of the in vitro&#xD;
      studies. So It remain to be seen whether the success of intraorifice barrier in preventing&#xD;
      microleakage is translated from in vitro studies in to the clinical setting which by far is&#xD;
      more challenging, variable and difficult to interpret.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few animal studies have compared the efficacy of coronal plug in preventing periapical&#xD;
      inflammation. Animal studies in dog have reported minimal or no periapical inflammation in&#xD;
      teeth with MTA intraorifice barrier than the ones without intraorifice barrier. Stassen et al&#xD;
      in an retrospective study evaluated the effect of intraorifice barrier in relation to&#xD;
      marginal bone level and found more cases of apical periodontitis in tooth where root filling&#xD;
      extended coronal to marginal bone level called positive than the ones where the root filling&#xD;
      ended apical to marginal bone level called negative on the healing of apical periodontitis.&#xD;
      While depth of intraorifice barrier has been investigated earlier. Level of intraorifice&#xD;
      barrier and its effect on propagation of marginal periodontitis and healing of apical&#xD;
      periodontitis remain unexplored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far no prospective clinical trial has investigated the effect of intraorifice barrier on&#xD;
      the healing of marginal and apical periodontitis after successful root canal treatment. In&#xD;
      absence of a clinical study substantial amount of doubt still persists whether intraorifice&#xD;
      barrier can emerge as an effective mean to prevent microleakage in furcation and root canals&#xD;
      of a multirooted tooth which because of its anatomical aberrations poses stiff challenge for&#xD;
      clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore aim of this randomised controlled trial is to determine effect of the coronal&#xD;
      extent of obturation in relation to marginal bone on the marginal breakdown and periapical&#xD;
      healing and to determine effect of intracanal glass ionomer restoration as intraorifice&#xD;
      barrier on treatment outcome of apical periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS AND OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine effect of the coronal extent of obturation in relation to marginal bone on&#xD;
           the marginal breakdown and periapical healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine effect of intracanal glass ionomer restoration as intraorifice barrier on&#xD;
           treatment outcome of apical periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is conducted in the department of conservative dentistry and endodontics, post&#xD;
      graduate institute of dental sciences, Rohtak. Study subjects were obtained from the pool of&#xD;
      OPD patients in the Department of conservative dentistry and endodontics, PGIDS, Rohtak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY Prior to treatment a thorough clinical and radiological examination was carried&#xD;
      out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A thorough history was taken from each patient. Prior informed consent was taken after&#xD;
      explaining the procedure, risks and benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 patients (n=20 in each group) were included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size determination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample of 16 patients each was calculated based on the difference in periapical inflammation&#xD;
      with and without intraorifice barrier(39% and 89% respectively) in an animal study conducted&#xD;
      by Yamauchi et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the attrition rate of 25% sample of 20 patients each were recruited in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mature mandibular permanent molar with diagnosis of apical periodontitis (as confirmed&#xD;
      clinically &amp; by periapical radiograph) were chosen for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All periapical radiographs were exposed by using constant kVP, mA and exposure time (70 KVP,&#xD;
      8 mA, 0.8 sec.) After initial periodontal therapy, administration of local anesthesia, rubber&#xD;
      dam isolation of the involved tooth was done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caries excavation was done and access cavity was prepared using carbide burs in high speed&#xD;
      handpiece with copious irrigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Debridement of the pulp chamber was done and all canal orifices were identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Negotiation of canals was done. Working length was determined using root ZX apex locator and&#xD;
      were verified radiographically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After creating glide path with #15 k-file, Revo-S (Micro Mega, Besancon, France) instruments&#xD;
      were used in sequence as suggested by manufacturer recommendation with a rotational speed of&#xD;
      350 rpm in gentle in-out motion. The torque was adjusted to 2.5 Ncm, and a crown-down&#xD;
      approach was selected. Once, the instrument had negotiated to the end of the canal and had&#xD;
      rotated freely, it was removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irrigation was carried out using 5 mL of a 5.25% NaOCl solution between files. After&#xD;
      preparation, the root canals were irrigated with 5 mL 17% EDTA for 3 minutes to remove smear&#xD;
      layer, followed by 5 mL 5.25% NaOCl. The final irrigation was done with 5 mL distilled water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The root canals was dried using paper points and filled with laterally condensed gutta-percha&#xD;
      (Meta Biomed Co Ltd, Korea) and Roth R-801 sealer (Roth International Drug Co., Chicago, Ill)&#xD;
      mixed according to manufacturers' instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gutta-percha was cut with a heated instrument and vertically condensed right at the orifice&#xD;
      opening of the canals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The teeth were randomly divided into 3 experimental groups of 20 teeth each as follows :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group I: intraorifice barrier of glass-ionomer cement (Ketac™ Molar, 3M ESPE) placed 3mm&#xD;
           in the canal from root canal orifice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group II: base of 2mm of glass-ionomer cement (Ketac™ Molar, 3M ESPE) placed on the&#xD;
           floor of the pulp chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Group III: control group with neither intraorifice barrier placed nor base applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of randomization Using an equal proportion randomization allocation ratio, one of the&#xD;
      investigators created envelopes containing concealed assignment codes that was assigned&#xD;
      sequentially to eligible patients. It was ensured that neither the investigator nor the&#xD;
      patient were aware of the treatment protocol at the time of patient allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glass Ionomer Cement (Ketac™ Molar, 3M ESPE) was mixed according to manufacturer's&#xD;
      instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group I: The gutta-percha was removed 3mm from the coronal portion of the canal with hot&#xD;
      plugger. Excess root canal sealer was removed with sterilized alcohol-wet cotton pellets.&#xD;
      Glass Ionomer Cement was applied inside canal and condensed as well as 2mm thick uniform base&#xD;
      on the floor of the pulp chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group II 2mm thick base of Glass Ionomer Cement was applied uniformly on the floor of the&#xD;
      pulp chamber with plastic instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final composite restoration was placed in all groups according to the manufacturer's&#xD;
      instruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal therapy in the form of scaling and root planning was done on the day endodontic&#xD;
      treatment completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW UP Follow up and clinical and radiographic examination is carried out at 3, 6, 9 &amp; 12&#xD;
      month period.&#xD;
