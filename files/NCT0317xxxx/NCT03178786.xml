    <textblock>
      The purpose of this dual phase cross-sectional, controlled and prospective, open label,&#xD;
      exploratory study is to determine the general characteristics of visuospatial exploration and&#xD;
      its neural substrate in subjects with Parkinson's Disease (PD) and to explore the impact of&#xD;
      professional art therapy intervention in a cohort of subjects with Parkinson's Disease on&#xD;
      visuospatial exploration, visuomotor integration, neuropsychological and emotional sphere,&#xD;
      quality of daily living and motor symptoms.&#xD;

    <measure>Eye Movement Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>19 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Eye positions will be recorded for both eyes concurrently. The system will record binocularly with a sampling frequency of 250Hz and a spatial accuracy of 0.5 degrees, approximately. Eye movement data will be analyzed off-line using customized MATLAB software (www.mathworks.com).</description>

    <measure>Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test</measure>
    <time_frame>19 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>These tests explore different aspects of visuospatial abilities including attention, memory, abstraction, planning and visuoexecutive skills; neuropsychological assessment in which examinees are asked to reproduce a complicated line drawing, first by copying it freehand (recognition), and then drawing from memory (recall)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Benton test</measure>
    <time_frame>19 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>These tests explore different aspects of visuospatial abilities including attention, memory, abstraction, planning and visuoexecutive skills; individually administered test for people aged from eight years to adulthood that measures visual perception and visual memory. It can also be used to help identify possible learning disabilities among other afflictions that might affect an individual's memory. The individual examined is shown 10 designs, one at a time, and asked to reproduce each one as exactly as possible on plain paper from memory.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Corsi Block Test</measure>
    <time_frame>19 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>These tests explore different aspects of visuospatial abilities including attention, memory, abstraction, planning and visuoexecutive skills; psychological test that assesses visuo-spatial short term working memory. It involves mimicking a researcher as he/she taps a sequence of up to nine identical spatially separated blocks.</description>
