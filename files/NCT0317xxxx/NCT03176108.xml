  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) with or without Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (ADHD) is a&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental syndrome that has a lasting impact on the child's daily lifestyle and&#xD;
      leads to functional impairment. ADHD is recognized as the most common psychiatry disorder in&#xD;
      children and it's considered as a public health problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADHD is frequently associated with a new diagnostic entity &quot; Disruptive Disorder with&#xD;
      Emotional dysregulation &quot;. This disorder is characterized by crisis of anger with verbal or&#xD;
      physical aggression, intensity disproportionate to the context and developmental age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have examined the elements of emotional dysregulation in ADHD in children. Many&#xD;
      studies have shown the interest of CBT in multimodal management of ADHD symptoms and&#xD;
      associated disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of a Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy&#xD;
      Parent/Child program versus a body mediation focused on emotional and behaviorial aspects in&#xD;
      ADD children aged 7-13 years with dimensional emotional dysregulation at 6 months after&#xD;
      intervention. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the impact of this program, at short-term&#xD;
      (at the end of CBT) and at 6 months after intervention, on socio-communicative capacities,&#xD;
      quality of life, children's functioning and parental stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's a biomedical research, prospective, controlled, randomized, monocentric, two parallels,&#xD;
      with an evaluation of the criteria of blind judgment.&#xD;

      68 patients (parents and children) will be recruited within Montpellier University Hospital.&#xD;
      They will be divided into a CBT group and a control group (body mediation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CBT group benefits from an intervention based on the program &quot;Better manage its anger and&#xD;
      its frustrations&quot; of 15 sessions for the children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group participates in an intervention of body mediation (theatre) of 15 session&#xD;
      for the children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parents of CBT and Control groups participate in an CBT intervention of 8 sessions every&#xD;
      15 days.&#xD;
