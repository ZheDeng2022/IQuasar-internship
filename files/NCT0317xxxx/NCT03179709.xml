      The proposed study will use qualitative methodology to understand health care provider&#xD;
      perceptions of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress&#xD;
      Syndrome (ARDS). To achieve this goal the investigators will conduct a prospective ancillary&#xD;
      study at four clinical centers participating in the NHLBI PETAL network as part of the ROSE&#xD;
      (Reevaluation of Systemic Early Neuromuscular Blockade) clinical trial (NCT02509078). Using&#xD;
      thematic content analysis of semistructured interviews with health care providers caring for&#xD;
      patients enrolled in the ROSE trial the investigators will determine the barriers to NMB use&#xD;
      and develop a framework for future NMB adoption in ARDS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Efficient translation of clinical trial results into practice is an enduring challenge in&#xD;
      critical care, with many critically ill patients not receiving evidence-based therapies&#xD;
      proven to save lives. One approach to speed the translation of clinical trial evidence into&#xD;
      practice is through qualitative research to better understand the barriers to evidence-based&#xD;
      care and help design innovative interventions to overcome those barriers.. This work need not&#xD;
      wait until the clinical trial is complete-an emerging literature highlights the value of&#xD;
      qualitative research concurrent with the conduct of a clinical trial. Such research has&#xD;
      several potential benefits, including facilitating implementation of the intervention in the&#xD;
      real world, identifying the potential mechanism of action, and identifying contextual factors&#xD;
      necessary for the treatments effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Reevaluation Of Systemic Early Neuromuscular Blockade (ROSE) study, conducted by the&#xD;
      NHLBI PETAL Clinical Trials Network, is an ideal trial for which to perform a concurrent&#xD;
      qualitative implementation study (NCT02509078). NMB has the potential to substantially reduce&#xD;
      mortality in ARDS. Yet NMB remains incompletely adopted for reasons that are poorly&#xD;
      understood but likely relate to clinical equipoise, historical concerns about safety, and the&#xD;
      inherent difficulties in providing complex practices in the intensive care unit (ICU). A&#xD;
      better understanding of provider views regarding NMB will provide essential data to aid&#xD;
      interpretation of study results and design an implementation study should ROSE demonstrate a&#xD;
      survival benefit with NMB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine this issue the investigators will perform a prospective qualitative study using&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews health care professionals providing direct care for patients&#xD;
      enrolled in ROSE. A trained research coordinator will perform semi-structured interviews with&#xD;
      consenting participants. Interviews will be transcribed and uploaded into commercially&#xD;
      available qualitative data software. Trained qualitative researchers will read and code each&#xD;
      interview based on Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, a widely accepted&#xD;
      conceptual theory of evidence-uptake.&#xD;
