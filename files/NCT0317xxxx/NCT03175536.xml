  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in the U.S. Despite guidelines, adherence&#xD;
      to recommended controller medications is low. Cost is an important barrier to adherence.&#xD;
      Employers are increasingly adopting high-deductible health plans (HDHPs) which require&#xD;
      deductibles of &gt; $1,000 per individual/$2,000 per family each year. In HDHPs with Health&#xD;
      Savings Accounts (HSAs), most medications and non-preventive care must be paid out-of-pocket&#xD;
      (OOP) until the deductible is reached. The lower premiums of HSA-HDHPs are appealing, but the&#xD;
      high level of OOP costs can lead patients to forgo needed care. HSA-HDHPs can exempt&#xD;
      preventive care from the deductible, and employers can add Preventive Drug Lists (PDLs) which&#xD;
      exempt certain chronic medications from the deductible (including asthma medications), making&#xD;
      them free. PDLs have the potential to improve controller medication use, which could prevent&#xD;
      negative health outcomes and reduce cost-related trade-offs for families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this research is to evaluate the impact of these two developments in the health&#xD;
      insurance market -- HSA-HDHPs and PDLs -- on medication use and clinical outcomes for adults&#xD;
      and children with asthma. To do this, tteh investigators will first conduct in-depth&#xD;
      interviews with patients with asthma and parents of children with asthma who have HDHPs and&#xD;
      traditional plans. Interviews will collect patient-reported data on how patients and their&#xD;
      families navigate their insurance plan and make health care decisions when faced with OOP&#xD;
      costs. Findings from the interviews will inform analyses of data from a large national health&#xD;
      plan from 2004-2017. Investigators will select adults and children with asthma whose employer&#xD;
      switched them from traditional plans or HSA-HDHPs without PDLs to HSA-HDHPs with or without a&#xD;
      PDL. Analyses will examine changes in asthma medication use, emergency department (ED)&#xD;
      visits, hospitalizations, and OOP costs before and after changing plans compared to similar&#xD;
      patients who did not switch to a HSA-HDHP. The study aims to: 1) understand health care&#xD;
      decision making and experiences of families with asthma with HDHPs; 2) examine the impact of&#xD;
      HSA-HDHPs with and without PDLs on use of asthma medications and asthma-related ED visits and&#xD;
      hospitalizations; 3) examine the extent to which the response to HSA-HDHPs and PDLs is&#xD;
      affected by the presence of other family members with asthma or other chronic conditions; 4)&#xD;
      examine the impact of HSA-HDHPs with and without PDLs on OOP costs for families.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background and Significance Asthma is one of the most common serious chronic diseases of&#xD;
      adults and children in the United States. Despite guidelines and evidence, adherence to&#xD;
      recommended asthma controller medications is low. Cost is an important barrier to&#xD;
      non-adherence to asthma medications. Employers are increasingly adopting high-deductible&#xD;
      health plans (HDHPs) particularly those that qualify for Health Savings Accounts (HSAs),&#xD;
      which subject most medications to deductibles rather than copayments as in traditional&#xD;
      coverage. HSA-HDHPs can thus lead to forgone care due to cost, including clinically&#xD;
      appropriate services such as asthma medications. As a response, value-based insurance designs&#xD;
      (VBID) have been proposed to promote high-value care by reducing or eliminating cost-sharing&#xD;
      for these services. One common example is a Preventive Drug List (PDL) that can accompany&#xD;
      HSA-HDHPs, which exempts certain chronic medications from the deductible to promote&#xD;
      adherence. Many PDLs include asthma controller and rescue medications. With the increasing&#xD;
      prevalence of HSA-HDHPs, PDLs have the potential to improve controller medication adherence&#xD;
      for both adults and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims: The goal of this research is to provide needed evidence on the impact of two&#xD;
      important developments in the health insurance landscape, HSA-HDHPs and PDLs, and whether&#xD;
      PDLs can mitigate cost barriers associated with HSA-HDHPs and improve patient-centered&#xD;
      outcomes for adults and children with asthma. The Aims of this research are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To understand health care decision making and experiences of families with asthma with&#xD;
           HSA-HDHPs and PDLs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the impact of HSA-HDHPs with and without PDLs on use of asthma controller and&#xD;
           rescue medications, and on adverse clinical outcomes (asthma-related ED visits and&#xD;
           hospitalizations), overall and for vulnerable subgroups (low-income and racial/ethnic&#xD;
           minority patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine the extent to which the response to HSA-HDHPs and PDLs is affected by the&#xD;
           presence of other family members with asthma or other chronic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To examine the impact of HSA-HDHPs with and without PDLs on OOP costs for patients and&#xD;
           families with asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sources of Data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. This study will collect patient-reported data through in-depth qualitative phone&#xD;
      interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims 2-4 will use 14 years (2004-2017) of enrollment and claims data from a large U.S.&#xD;
      commercial health plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Aim 1 study population will consist of adults with asthma and parents of children with&#xD;
      asthma. Eligible participants will be those who are currently enrolled in employer-sponsored&#xD;
      health insurance plans (high-deductible plans with and without a PDL, or traditional plans).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health plan population will be identified through enrollment and claims data from Harvard&#xD;
      Pilgrim Health Care (HPHC). Eligible patients will include adults aged 18-64 and children&#xD;
      aged 4-17 years with a diagnosis of asthma. Patients will be selected if they have been&#xD;
      enrolled in an employer-sponsored HSA-HDHP with or without a PDL, or a traditional plan&#xD;
      without a high deductible, for the prior year. Among those eligible in each sub-group, the&#xD;
      investigators will randomly select 9 from each cell to send a recruitment mailing, for a&#xD;
      total of 81 patients or parents invited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A population from the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) will be recruited&#xD;
      through postings to AAFA's Asthma Online Community, Educational Support Group, email list&#xD;
      serve, Facebook page, and newsletters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aims 2-4, the study population will consist of adults aged 18-64 years and children aged&#xD;
      4-17 years with asthma. Study subjects must have spent a year in a traditional health plan&#xD;
      with no or low deductibles prior to the switch to an HSA-HDHP without a PDL, or in a HSA-HDHP&#xD;
      without a PDL prior to switching to an HSA-HDHP with PDL, and then remain enrolled for at&#xD;
      least one year post-switch. Control group members spend a year in a traditional plan or HDHP&#xD;
      without PDL then remain in that plan for at least another 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollees over age 64 who are eligible for Medicare will be excluded. The investigators will&#xD;
      identify members with asthma during the baseline year using the same claims-based algorithm&#xD;
      in which an asthma diagnosis will be defined as having at least one inpatient or two&#xD;
      outpatient claims in the prior year with a diagnosis of asthma based on International&#xD;
      Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9 and 10 codes for asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible employers are those that offer only one plan type in a given benefit year: 1)&#xD;
      traditional Health Maintenance Organization/Preferred Provider Organization/Point of Service&#xD;
      plans (deductibles &lt;$1000, copayments of &lt;$50 for most services, tiered copayments for&#xD;
      medicines); 2) HSA-HDHPs without PDLs; or 3) HSA-HDHPs with PDLs. The investigators will&#xD;
      select &quot;full-replacement&quot; employers that replace a traditional plan or HSA-HDHP without PDL&#xD;
      with an HSA-HDHP without PDL or HSA-HDHP with PDL, respectively, for all employees at a given&#xD;
      point in time; matched comparison employers will include those that keep all employees in&#xD;
      their prior plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 qualitative interviews will assess patient and family experiences across a number of&#xD;
      domains related to asthma health care decision making and outcomes in HDHPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study outcomes for Aims 2-4 are the claims-based measures of asthma medication&#xD;
      use, outcomes, and OOP costs listed below, measured at the individual level. See section on&#xD;
      primary outcomes for details,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictors and Covariates&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary predictor variables include study period and insurance type. Study period&#xD;
      indicates the one-year period before or up to three years after the index date. Insurance&#xD;
      type includes: 1) HSA-HDHP without PDL; 2), HSA-HDHP with PDL; and 3) traditional plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other co-variates include baseline asthma severity, co-morbidity, presence of other chronic&#xD;
      conditions, self-reported and geocoded race/ethnicity data, neighborhood education and&#xD;
      poverty levels, sex, age, state, individual versus family plan, baseline number of outpatient&#xD;
      visits, presence of an inpatient hospitalization, total expenditures, employer size, average&#xD;
      employer baseline expenditures per capita, number of family members, mean age of children in&#xD;
      the family, mean age of adults, baseline mean family morbidity score, number of family&#xD;
      members with asthma, number of asthma and other medications used by the family, and number of&#xD;
      family ED visits and hospitalizations in the baseline year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will analyze qualitative data in iterative cycles of content analysis in the&#xD;
      manner described by Patton. In the second, deductive phase of analysis, investigators will&#xD;
      consider data code-by-code to identify areas of convergence and divergence by insurance type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses will compare changes in outcomes from baseline to up to three years of follow-up&#xD;
      among 1) asthma patients switched to HSA-HDHPs without PDLs from traditional plans vs.&#xD;
      matched patients whose employers remain in traditional plans; and 2) patients switched to&#xD;
      HSA-HDHPs with PDLs from HSA-HDHPs without PDLs vs. matched controls remaining in HSA-HDHPs&#xD;
      without PDLs. The investigators will use separate regression models to compare year-to-year&#xD;
      changes for each intervention group relative to its matched control group, rather than&#xD;
      including all patients in a single model with multiple interaction terms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyses will use both Interrupted Time Series (ITS) and Difference-in-Differences (DiD)&#xD;
      frameworks. Controlling for potential confounders, analyses will use generalized linear&#xD;
      models (GLMs) to model the independent effect of switching to each of the two types of&#xD;
      HSA-HDHPs (with or without PDLs) on the likelihood of each outcome, assessed by interacting&#xD;
      insurance type and study period variables in models. Extended GLMs - generalized estimating&#xD;
      equations (GEE) and generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) - are appropriate methods to&#xD;
      adjust for correlation within families and to examine changes in outcomes between baseline&#xD;
      and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine controller medication adherence using ITS. Investigators will test&#xD;
      the statistical significance of level or trend changes following insurance plan type switch&#xD;
      using GLM models, adjusting for seasonality and first-order autocorrelation between&#xD;
      sequential monthly measurements using the empirical sandwich estimator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For analyses of rescue medication use, investigators will focus on albuterol and levalbuterol&#xD;
      inhaler users. The standardized number of rescue inhalers dispensed will be modeled as count&#xD;
      data in difference-in-differences models. ITS models will be used to model changes in level&#xD;
      and trend of monthly rates of rescue inhalers dispensed, as in previous studies. Analyses&#xD;
      will also model the ratio of controller medications to total asthma medications. For analyses&#xD;
      of asthma-related ED visits and hospitalizations, outcomes can be binary, counts, or&#xD;
      continuous. The investigators will use logistic GEE models to estimate the effect of&#xD;
      switching to each type of HSA-HDHP on binary outcomes such as any asthma-related&#xD;
      hospitalization. Negative binomial regression will be used to model the effect for count&#xD;
      outcomes such as ED visits. Investigators will select the conditional mean and variance&#xD;
      functions based on the actual data, using a log link with a Gamma error distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the impact of HSA-HDHP with and without PDLs on vulnerable populations and test&#xD;
      for heterogeneity of treatment effects among vulnerable populations, the investigators will&#xD;
      first perform stratified analyses, comparing outcomes between intervention and control&#xD;
      subgroups defined by the binary measures of the risk factors of interest (low income,&#xD;
      minority race/ethnicity, moderate-severe asthma, presence of other chronic conditions, high&#xD;
      morbidity based on the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical Groups (ACG) system). Analyses will&#xD;
      use three-way interaction terms (insurance type * study period * subgroup) to test for&#xD;
      statistical differences between subgroups in the impact of the change to an HSA-HDHP with PDL&#xD;
      vs. remaining in a traditional plan. In Aim 2 analyses, the investigators will include both&#xD;
      adults and children together, with age included as a co-variate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses will use the same population, outcomes, study group comparisons, and modeling&#xD;
      strategies as Aims 1 and 2 except that stratified analyses will be performed, comparing&#xD;
      outcomes between intervention and control groups stratified by adult/child status. To&#xD;
      statistically test for heterogeneity of treatment effect for adults vs. children, analyses&#xD;
      will use three-way interaction terms (insurance type * study period * adult/child) to test&#xD;
      for statistical differences between adults and children in the impact of the change to an&#xD;
      HSA-HDHP with PDL vs. remaining in a HSA-HDHP without PDL. Analyses will be done at the&#xD;
      individual level, but will include family-level variables as predictors of interest.&#xD;
      Separately for adults and children, the investigators will test the extent to which having&#xD;
      another family member with asthma, another chronic condition, or high baseline family ACG&#xD;
      morbidity modifies the impact of HDHPs and PDLs on study outcomes for an individual asthma&#xD;
      patient. The primary predictor of interest will be the interaction between the family-level&#xD;
      variable, study period, and study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses will be similar to those of Aim 2, but for OOP cost outcomes. The primary analyses&#xD;
      of changes in OOP costs will use a DiD analytic framework. The investigators will follow the&#xD;
      same approaches as used in analyzing ED visits and hospitalizations, employing two-part&#xD;
      models/zero-inflated negative binomial models to account for zero costs. GEE or GLMM models&#xD;
      will be used to examine changes in outcomes between baseline and follow-up to model the&#xD;
      independent effect of switching to each of the two types of HSA-HDHPs (with or without PDLs)&#xD;
      on the likelihood of having financial burden (OOP cost greater than 5% of income).&#xD;
