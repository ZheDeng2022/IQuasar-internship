  <brief_summary>

      The proposed project will compare two ways to apply a known-effective cancer educational&#xD;
      strategy through African American churches: 1) a standard method vs. 2) a new method in which&#xD;
      the churches integrate the strategy into their organizational structure and practice at&#xD;
      multiple levels. It will be determined whether this &quot;integrated approach&quot; results in more&#xD;
      effective and sustained cancer education and screening activities at both the church and&#xD;
      individual levels over time. This project will make important contributions to research in&#xD;
      evidence-based medicine and sustainability. In a climate of limited resources, identifying&#xD;
      sustainable and effective ways to increase cancer awareness and screening in African American&#xD;
      men and women is more important than ever.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This population-based application responds to the American Cancer Society Research Scholar&#xD;
      Grant, Priority Program in Cancer Control. Recent years have seen a growing research interest&#xD;
      in learning how to get known-effective health education strategies to reach more people who&#xD;
      could benefit from them. An important part of this growing movement is a focus on sustained&#xD;
      impact, or continued program benefit after the funding period is over. It is believed that&#xD;
      the best way to achieve this sustained impact is through integrating the program into the&#xD;
      host community at multiple levels. This innovative strategy has not been systematically&#xD;
      tested in community-based settings, where the most vulnerable people can be reached. Since&#xD;
      churches have a historical and ever-growing role in health promotion particularly among&#xD;
      African Americans, they are an ideal place to reach this group for cancer education. The&#xD;
      proposed project will compare two ways to apply a known-effective cancer educational strategy&#xD;
      through African American churches: 1) a standard method vs. 2) a new method in which the&#xD;
      churches integrate the strategy into their organizational structure and practice at multiple&#xD;
      levels. It will be determined whether this &quot;integrated approach&quot; results in more effective&#xD;
      and sustained cancer education and screening activities at both the church and individual&#xD;
      levels over time. The educational strategy is one that has been used successfully in previous&#xD;
      work: Project Health through Early Awareness and Learning (HEAL). Project HEAL is a series of&#xD;
      three cancer early detection workshops (breast, prostate, colorectal) delivered through&#xD;
      trained and certified lay peer community health advisors in African American churches. 14&#xD;
      churches will be randomly chosen to conduct either the standard Project HEAL program or an&#xD;
      integrated Project HEAL strategy where the churches build the program into their organization&#xD;
      in multiple ways (e.g., allocating volunteer or paid staff, space, or funds; policy change;&#xD;
      ministry development). The project will be conducted in three phases: 1) refining the&#xD;
      integrated approach with community and stakeholder feedback; 2) pilot testing the integrated&#xD;
      approach in 2 churches; and 3) conducting the study to comparatively evaluate the standard&#xD;
      vs. the integrated approaches in 14 churches. A scientifically rigorous evaluation plan will&#xD;
      be used to look at outcomes at both the individual and the church level. This project will&#xD;
      make important contributions to research in evidence-based medicine and sustainability. In a&#xD;
      climate of limited resources, identifying sustainable and effective ways to increase cancer&#xD;
      awareness and screening in African American men and women is more important than ever.&#xD;
