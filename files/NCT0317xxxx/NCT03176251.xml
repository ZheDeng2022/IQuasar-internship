  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Simulation-based training curricula for gastrointestinal endoscopy have been developed and&#xD;
      have been shown to be effective. It is possible that these curricula may be further improved.&#xD;
      Gamification, the application of game-design principles to non-game contexts, has been shown&#xD;
      to improve learning and skill performance in medical education. In gastrointestinal&#xD;
      endoscopy, however, no dedicated curricula have been developed using gamification principles.&#xD;
      We aim to evaluate the impact of applying gamification to a curriculum using SBT in endoscopy&#xD;
      on clinical performance, compared to an identical curriculum without gamification. 36 novice&#xD;
      endoscopists from the general surgery and gastroenterology programs at the University of&#xD;
      Toronto will be recruited. Participants will be randomized into two groups: the Conventional&#xD;
      Training Curriculum (CTC) Group, in which participants will receive 6 hours of training on a&#xD;
      simulator augmented with expert feedback and interlaced with 4 hours of didactic training on&#xD;
      the theory of colonoscopy; and the Gamified Integrated Curriculum (GIC) Group, in which&#xD;
      participants will receive the same curriculum, using the following applications of gamified&#xD;
      learning: a leaderboard of participant performances; badges for achievement of training&#xD;
      landmarks; and rewards for top performance. Participants will be trained to perform&#xD;
      colonoscopies progressively moving from a low to high complexity simulators, starting with&#xD;
      the bench-top model (1 hour) and then moving to the EndoVRÂ® virtual reality (VR)&#xD;
      gastroenterology simulator (5 hours). Performance will be assessed at three points: prior to&#xD;
      training (pre-test), immediately after training (acquisition post-test) and 4-6 weeks after&#xD;
      training (retention test). Assessment will take place on the simulator at all three time&#xD;
      points and during two live colonoscopies at the retention test. The primary outcome measure&#xD;
      will be the difference in clinical colonoscopy performance between the two training groups,&#xD;
      as assessed by the Joint Advisory Group for GI Endoscopy Direct Observation of Procedural&#xD;
      Skills (JAG/DOPS). We aim to have data collection finished by 2018. Our results have the&#xD;
      potential to improve existing curricula for training in colonoscopy. Moreover, the&#xD;
      development of a gamified curriculum in procedural skills may have applicability to other&#xD;
      specialities, such as general surgery and anesthesiology.&#xD;

    <description>This group will receive 4 hours of didactic and hands-on sessions on colonoscopy theory and non-technical skills. Participants will also watch a video that demonstrates an ideal endoscopic procedure. After each didactic session, a short multiple-choice questionnaire based on the topics covered in that session will be administered. In addition to didactic training, the control group will be given six hours of expert-assisted instruction on low-fidelity (1 hour) and high-fidelity (5 hours) colonoscopy simulators. Six modules of increasing difficulty in colonoscopy will be taught using one-on-one feedback from an expert academic endoscopist. The endoscopy instructor will demonstrate techniques and provide feedback. During training on the high-fidelity simulator, the last two hours will take the form of the integrated scenario, which will feature a standardized patient (SP) and standardized nurse (SN). Feedback will be given after each integrated scenario by the instructor.</description>

    <description>The intervention group will receive the same core training as the control group with additional elements of gamification: leaderboards and badges. First, leaderboards will be used to track and rank participants' performances. This will be done through an anonymized ID tag that allows a participant to identify only their position on the leaderboard. This leaderboard will include 4 components: non-technical skills, technical skills, cognitive skills, and overall ranking. Scores will be aggregated only from participants training on the same days. The leaderboard will be displayed on a central laptop and/or TV screen and will be accessible at any time throughout the day. Second, participants in the GIC group will have the opportunity to be rewarded for their performances using achievement badges which are visual cues to the player that he or she has achieved something. Awards will be given to participants at the top of the leaderboard and with the most badges.</description>
