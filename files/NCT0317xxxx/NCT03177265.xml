  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco-related diseases account for a significant portion of all VA healthcare costs and are&#xD;
      a detriment to the health and quality of life of our Veterans. Despite progress in&#xD;
      instituting tobacco screenings and treatment referral, most Veterans still do not receive the&#xD;
      most effective strategy to help them quit smoking - pharmacotherapy combined with behavioral&#xD;
      coaching. This study builds on findings from population health and mobile interventions to&#xD;
      help more Veterans receive evidence-based tobacco treatment. The investigators propose to&#xD;
      test the effect of two types of text messaging in combination with telephone cessation&#xD;
      counseling: 1) pre-counseling text messages to increase enrollment in counseling, and 2)&#xD;
      ongoing texts for those who start counseling that provide appointment reminders and support&#xD;
      between sessions to increase adherence to counseling. This study supports multiple goals of&#xD;
      the VA's Blueprint for Excellence. Results will directly inform decision-making and&#xD;
      population-based care models for tobacco treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco use remains the number one cause of premature death and morbidity in the United&#xD;
      States, and tobacco-related diseases account for 24% of all VA healthcare costs. The VA has&#xD;
      been a leader in addressing tobacco use, having implemented annual tobacco screening and made&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy readily available. However, one of the most cost-effective services -&#xD;
      telephone quit lines - remain highly underused. Few Veterans enroll in telephone counseling&#xD;
      to help them quit smoking, and among Veterans who begin telephone counseling, few complete a&#xD;
      full course. The advent of electronic health records (EHRs) has enabled new strategies for&#xD;
      ensuring that patients receive preventive services. These methods can reduce provider burden&#xD;
      and close gaps in systems of care. The investigators' research team has conducted numerous&#xD;
      studies using EHRs to identify smokers and proactively reach out to coordinate telephone&#xD;
      tobacco treatment. While the investigators have successfully implemented this approach, the&#xD;
      overall enrollment rates for counseling remain low and the majority of smokers complete only&#xD;
      one counseling session. Therefore, the investigators propose to test novel mHealth strategies&#xD;
      for promoting enrollment in and adherence to telephone counseling. The Specific Aims are to:&#xD;
      1) Conduct a sequentially randomized trail to estimate the effectiveness of text messaging&#xD;
      for increasing enrollment in and adherence to telephone tobacco treatment, 2) Compare rates&#xD;
      of tobacco cessation between patients who received and did not receive text messaging during&#xD;
      treatment, and 3) Evaluate patient experiences with these interventions. Using the VA EHR,&#xD;
      the investigators will identify N=3,600 smokers at two VA sites. All identified smokers will&#xD;
      be mailed an introductory packet with information about the study. Patients who consent will&#xD;
      be randomized to standard telephone outreach for counseling or to receive 8 educational texts&#xD;
      to counter barriers of participating in counseling prior to telephone outreach. Patients who&#xD;
      enroll in tobacco treatment will then be randomized to receive standard telephone counseling&#xD;
      or to also receive appointment reminders and supportive texts throughout the 8-week&#xD;
      counseling period. The investigators hypothesize that these approaches will increase the rate&#xD;
      of enrollment in telephone tobacco cessation and 12-month biochemically validated abstinence&#xD;
      (primary outcomes) over standard telephone counseling approaches. The investigators will also&#xD;
      assess patient experiences with each texting protocol. The investigators' overarching goal is&#xD;
      to investigative innovative mHealth strategies for increasing Veteran use of telephone-based&#xD;
      tobacco cessation counseling and to improve quit rates. This research, exploring both&#xD;
      population-based outreach and text messaging, advances multiple goals set forth by the VA's&#xD;
      Blueprint for Excellence. Results will have direct implications to inform decision-making and&#xD;
      population-based care models for tobacco treatment.&#xD;
