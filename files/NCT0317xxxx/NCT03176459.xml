      Primary objective: The primary objective of this study is to compare total opioid consumption&#xD;
      through 72 hours following EXPAREL+bupivacaine HCl infiltration into the transversus&#xD;
      abdominis plane (TAP) after spinal anesthesia to active bupivacaine HCl TAP infiltration&#xD;
      after spinal anesthesia in subjects undergoing an elective cesarean section (C-section).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: The secondary objectives are to assess efficacy and safety parameters&#xD;
      and patient satisfaction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase-4, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study planned in&#xD;
      approximately 152 adult subjects undergoing elective C-section. All subjects will remain in&#xD;
      the hospital for up to 72 hours postsurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened within 30 days prior to surgery; screening on the day of surgery&#xD;
      will be allowed but is discouraged. During the screening visit, subjects will be assessed for&#xD;
      any past or present medical conditions that in the opinion of the investigator would preclude&#xD;
      them from study participation. After the informed consent form (ICF) is signed, a medical&#xD;
      history, surgical history, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), vital sign&#xD;
      measurements, alcohol breath test and urine drug screen, and clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
      (hematology and chemistry) will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day of Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative medications: Use of pre-operative analgesics (eg, opioid medications,&#xD;
      acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) is prohibited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomized in a blinded 1:1 ratio to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: EXPAREL+bupivacaine TAP infiltration following spinal anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: Active bupivacaine HCl TAP infiltration following spinal anesthesia On Day 1,&#xD;
           prior to the C-section, all subjects will receive a intrathecal injection of 150 mcg&#xD;
           preservative-free morphine for spinal injection (eg, Duramorph®) in conjunction with&#xD;
           single-shot spinal anesthesia using 1.4-1.6 mL bupivacaine HCl 0.75% and 15 mcg&#xD;
           fentanyl. If preservative-free morphine for spinal injection (eg, Duramorph) is&#xD;
           unavailable because of a drug shortage, subjects may instead receive an intrathecal&#xD;
           injection of 75 mcg preservative-free hydromorphone in conjunction with single-shot&#xD;
           spinal anesthesia using 1.4-1.6 mL bupivacaine HCl 0.75% and 15 mcg fentanyl. A combined&#xD;
           spinal epidural (CSE) anesthesia technique may also be used provided the epidural&#xD;
           component is not used. Subjects who receive the epidural component of the CSE anesthesia&#xD;
           must be immediately withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative medications: The intraoperative use of the following medications is&#xD;
      discouraged, but may be permitted if clinically indicated based on the investigator's&#xD;
      discretion (all medications must be appropriately recorded [ie, drug, dose, and route of&#xD;
      administration]): ketamine and midazolam (Versed®). Prophylactic use of dexamethasone for&#xD;
      prevention of nausea and vomiting is prohibited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After delivery of the baby and prior to the TAP infiltration, a small amount of lidocaine (&lt;2&#xD;
      mL) may be administered subcutaneously to form a skin wheal over the area of the needle&#xD;
      insertion site. A 2-point classic TAP block will be performed under ultrasound guidance&#xD;
      within 1 hour (± 30 minutes) following skin incision closure of the C-section. A confirmatory&#xD;
      ultrasound picture or video will be taken of each side of the abdomen after the TAP needle&#xD;
      position has been established and following infiltration of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAP infiltration: Subjects randomized to the EXPAREL+bupivacaine group (Group 1) will receive&#xD;
      a single 20-mL dose of EXPAREL 266 mg expanded in volume with 20 mL normal saline plus 20 mL&#xD;
      0.25% bupivacaine for a total volume of 60 mL, administered as 30 mL (10 mL EXPAREL, 10 mL&#xD;
      0.25% bupivacaine HCl, and 10 mL saline) on each side of the abdomen. Subjects randomized to&#xD;
      the active bupivacaine group (Group 2) will receive 20 mL 0.25% bupivacaine expanded in&#xD;
      volume with 40 mL normal saline for a total volume of 60 mL, administered as 30 mL (10 mL&#xD;
      0.25% bupivacaine HCl and 20 mL saline) on each side of the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postsurgical Analgesia: Patient-controlled analgesia is not permitted. The following&#xD;
      multimodal pain regimen will be initiated immediately following the delivery of the baby:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IV ketorolac 15 mg once at the time of skin incision closure and prior to the TAP&#xD;
           infiltration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intravenous (IV) acetaminophen 1000 mg at the time of skin incision closure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scheduled oral (PO) acetaminophen 650 mg beginning 6 hours from the administration of&#xD;
           the single dose of IV acetaminophen at the end of surgery and then every 6 hours (q6h)&#xD;
           for up to 72 hours or hospital discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scheduled PO ibuprofen 600 mg beginning 6 hours from the administration of the single&#xD;
           dose of IV ketorolac at the end of surgery and then q6h for up to 72 hours or hospital&#xD;
           discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
      The date, time, and dose of all standardized multimodal pain medications administered must be&#xD;
      recorded. Note: The scheduled PO medication will be administered on a q6h schedule only&#xD;
      through hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue Medication: Subjects should only receive opioid rescue pain medication upon request&#xD;
      for breakthrough pain. Postsurgical rescue medication will comprise PO immediate-release&#xD;
      oxycodone (initiated at 5-10 mg every 4 hours [q4h] or as needed [PRN]). If a subject is&#xD;
      unable to tolerate PO medication or fails the PO oxycodone rescue, IV morphine (initiated at&#xD;
      1-2 mg) or hydromorphone (initiated at 0.3-0.5 mg) may be administered q4h or PRN. All&#xD;
      surgical and postsurgical opioid and other analgesics (pain medications) administered must be&#xD;
      documented through Day 14 postsurgery. Additionally, an unscheduled pain intensity score&#xD;
      using a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) must be completed immediately prior to any rescue&#xD;
      medication while in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Permitted medications for the prevention and treatment of possible medication side effects&#xD;
      include the following and may be used at the discretion of the study site principal&#xD;
      investigator:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ondansetron 4 mg IV immediately after delivery of the baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ondansetron 4 mg IV (should not exceed a maximum of 12 mg in a 24-hour period) for&#xD;
           intraoperative and postoperative nausea and vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metoclopramide 10 mg PO PRN for nausea and vomiting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nalbuphine IV 2.5 mg PRN for pruritus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Naloxone IV 50-100 mcg PRN for pruritus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postsurgical Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will remain in the hospital for up to 72 hours postsurgery. Postsurgical assessments&#xD;
      will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Opioid use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of first unassisted ambulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain intensity scores using a 10-cm VAS at rest&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discharge readiness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject's satisfaction with postsurgical pain control&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall benefit of anesthesia score (OBAS) questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of recovery 15-item questionnaire (QoR-15)&#xD;
&#xD;
      While in the hospital, subjects will be provided with a Patient Diary and will use the diary&#xD;
      to record all scheduled and unscheduled VAS scores. For all scheduled assessments and&#xD;
      unscheduled assessments in the hospital, subjects will assess, &quot;How much pain are you&#xD;
      experiencing right now&quot; and a vertical mark will be placed on the VAS line to indicate the&#xD;
      level of pain experienced at the time of assessment. If a subject is discharged prior to a&#xD;
      scheduled VAS assessment, a member of the study site staff will contact the subject to remind&#xD;
      her to complete the scheduled VAS assessment at the scheduled time and to record the&#xD;
      assessment in the Patient Diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At hospital discharge, the subject will be instructed to record in the Patient Diary VAS pain&#xD;
      intensity score daily and all pain medications taken following hospital discharge through Day&#xD;
      14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At home, the subject will assess pain intensity at rest each day at noon (± 4 hours). This&#xD;
      assessment should capture her average pain at rest in the prior 24 hours by assessing &quot;What&#xD;
      has been your average pain since your last pain assessment?&quot; (ie, from noon on the previous&#xD;
      day to the current assessment). At the same time, the subject should record any pain&#xD;
      medication (medication name, date, time, and dose) taken in the prior 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phone call will be made to each subject on Day 14 for safety purposes and to inquire as to&#xD;
      whether the subject has made any unscheduled phone calls or office visits related to pain;&#xD;
      experienced any hospital readmission; or experienced an emergency room visit since hospital&#xD;
      discharge. Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be recorded from the&#xD;
      time the ICF is signed through Day 14.&#xD;

Subjects were evaluated for pain intensity scores at rest using the 10-cm VAS at rest at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, and 72 hours after surgery and then once daily (at noon ± 4 hours) through Day 14. To assess pain intensity (VAS) at rest, the subject should rest quietly in a supine or seated position that does not exacerbate her postsurgical pain for 3-5 minutes before entering the pain score. While in the hospital, subjects are to assess, &quot;How much pain are you experiencing right now?&quot; and a vertical mark is placed on a 10-cm straight line to indicate the level of pain experienced at the time of assessment.&#xD;
Note higher AUC means more pain over time.</description>

          <title>American Society of Anesthesiologists classification</title>
          <description>American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification was determined by physicians using the ASA Physical Status Classification System which assesses the patient's pre-anesthesia medical co-morbidities. ASA 1 patients would be considered a normal, healthy patient. ASA 2 is a patient with mild systemic disease (eg, smoker, well controlled diabetes or high blood pressure (HBP)). ASA 3 is a patient with severe systemic disease (eg poorly controlled diabetes or HBP). ASA 4 is a patient with severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life (eg, recent myocardial infarction, stroke).</description>

        <description>AUC for VAS pain scores through 72 hours. Pain intensity scores were measured on a 10-cm VAS (0 cm= &quot;no pain&quot; to 30 cm=&quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot;).&#xD;
Subjects were evaluated for pain intensity scores at rest using the 10-cm VAS at rest at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, and 72 hours after surgery and then once daily (at noon ± 4 hours) through Day 14. To assess pain intensity (VAS) at rest, the subject should rest quietly in a supine or seated position that does not exacerbate her postsurgical pain for 3-5 minutes before entering the pain score. While in the hospital, subjects are to assess, &quot;How much pain are you experiencing right now?&quot; and a vertical mark is placed on a 10-cm straight line to indicate the level of pain experienced at the time of assessment.&#xD;
Note higher AUC means more pain over time.</description>
