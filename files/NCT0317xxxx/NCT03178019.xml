      Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) is a serine exopeptidase able to inactivate various&#xD;
      oligopeptides involved in inflammation, immunity and vascular function. Our aim was to&#xD;
      investigate the associations between constitutive levels of DPP4 activity and inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers, skin microvascular reactivity, gut peptides, insulin resistance indexes, heart&#xD;
      rate and blood pressure variability, and measures of adiposity in subjects with different&#xD;
      grades of glucose tolerance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), also known as adenosine deaminase binding protein or cluster&#xD;
      of differentiation 26 (CD26), is a serine exopeptidase able to inactivate various&#xD;
      oligopeptides composed of proline, hydroxyproline, or alanine as the penultimate residue. In&#xD;
      recent years, DPP4 has received attention due to its ability to rapidly inactivate the main&#xD;
      incretins secreted by the gastrointestinal tract: glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and&#xD;
      glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). As its own name already says, incretins&#xD;
      enhance insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent fashion, but also suppress or modulate&#xD;
      glucagon secretion. Since it was demonstrated that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) have&#xD;
      incretin deficiency and hyperglucagonemia on its physiopathology, gliptins emerged as a new&#xD;
      class of drugs for the treatment of this disease, acting through the inhibition of DPP4 and&#xD;
      consequently ameliorating these defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DPP4 not only inactivate incretins but also a number of cytokines, chemokines, and&#xD;
      neuropeptides involved in inflammation, immunity and vascular function. Furthermore, evidence&#xD;
      from in vitro and in vivo studies, including clinical ones in T2D, suggested that gliptins'&#xD;
      inhibition of DPP4 was associated with reduction of inflammatory biomarkers and also&#xD;
      attenuation of endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis, possibly through regulation of the&#xD;
      DPP4 substrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a paucity of studies that associate the constitutive levels of DPP4 activity (i.e.,&#xD;
      outside the context of pharmacological inhibition of the enzyme) with markers of inflammation&#xD;
      and endothelial function, specially tested on skin microcirculation. We hypothesized that&#xD;
      constitutive levels of DPP4 activity might be directly associated to inflammation and&#xD;
      inversely correlated with skin blood flux and one or more components of vasomotion&#xD;
      (suggesting an association with endothelial disfunction) even in the absence of diabetes. Our&#xD;
      aim was to investigate the associations between constitutive levels of DPP4 activity and&#xD;
      inflammatory biomarkers, skin microvascular reactivity, gut peptides, insulin resistance&#xD;
      indexes, heart rate and blood pressure variability, and measures of adiposity in subjects&#xD;
      with different grades of glucose tolerance.&#xD;
