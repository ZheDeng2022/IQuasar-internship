  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian masses are common problems in clinical practice. Sonography is considered the&#xD;
      firstline imaging technique for discriminating between malignant and benign lesions, and it&#xD;
      has been shown to be useful for determining optimal treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transvaginal Ultrasonography has been demonstrated to be the most sensitive and effective&#xD;
      technique, being also non-invasive and in-expensive maneuver.Since in early reports, a&#xD;
      standardized method for the description of the sonographic appearance of the ovarian masses&#xD;
      was not used, the data of different studies are not easily compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, there is no consensus on sonographic diagnostic criteria for ovarian cancer,&#xD;
      despite many ultrasonography features being considered to be predictive of malignancy, such&#xD;
      as presence of septations, internal nodularity, wall thickening, solid areas, free fluid or&#xD;
      bilaterality.Usually the clinical management decision is based on data provided in the&#xD;
      sonographic report. Many sonographers and sonologists use scoring systems to characterize&#xD;
      ovarian masses, whereas others use the so called pattern recognition approach However,&#xD;
      sometimes sonographic reports are misleading and confusing for the clinician. Although some&#xD;
      groups have made considerable efforts in establishing terms and definitions for sonographic&#xD;
      findings in ovarian masses .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we proposed a new data reporting system for sonographic findings in ovarian&#xD;
      masses. This system is based on the concept developed for breast imaging, namely the Breast&#xD;
      Imaging Reporting and Data System classification. Originally developed for mammographic&#xD;
      findings, it has been successfully applied to breast sonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Like its breast sonographic counterpart, the gynacological imaging reporting and data system&#xD;
      in ovarian masses by ultrasonography lexicon is intended to provide a unified language for&#xD;
      sonographic reporting and for avoiding confusion in communication between the sonographer /&#xD;
      sonologist and the clinician..&#xD;
&#xD;
      This system is based on a description of the ovarian mass using the pattern recognition&#xD;
      approach and color Doppler blood flow location and the prior risk for malignancy in each&#xD;
      group. On this basis, the proposed classification enables the sonologist or sonographer to&#xD;
      give the clinician as much information as possible in a summarized way, as well as an&#xD;
      estimated risk of malignancy, based only on the sonographic characteristics of the images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is enough evidence to indicate that when an experienced examiner performs&#xD;
      the sonographic examination, such accuracy is achievable for most types of ovarian masses.&#xD;

Bilaterality , wall thickness, septations , papillary projections, solid areas, and echogenicity. The presence of ascites also will be recorded. Pattern recognition analysis will be used for ovarian masses highly suggestive of some diseases , then color Doppler will be activated to identify vascular color signals within the lesion.</description>
