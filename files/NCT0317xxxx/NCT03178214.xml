  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, open-label, randomised, single dose, three-period, crossover study&#xD;
      to evaluate the bioavailability of Infacort® administered as 'sprinkles' with soft food and&#xD;
      yoghurt compared with direct administration to the back of the tongue in&#xD;
      dexamethasone-suppressed healthy adult male subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will comprise of a pre-study screen, followed by 3 treatment periods and a&#xD;
      post-study follow-up.&#xD;
