    <textblock>
      The present study aims to develope a risk assessment model of ischemic stroke endpoint events&#xD;
      combining multi-dimensional traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) indicators with modern medicine&#xD;
      indicators. The proposed study is a registry study based participant survey conducted in 7&#xD;
      hospitals nationwide in China. After obtaining informed consent, a total of 3000 study&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with ischemic stroke will be recruited. 1-year follow-ups are carried out&#xD;
      on-site in hospitals and by telephone to track endpoint events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is characterized by high incidence and high rates of recurrence and other endpoint&#xD;
      events. Risk assessment is important for secondary prevention of ischemic stroke. To date, no&#xD;
      study has been conducted to evaluate the risk of ischemic stroke endpoint events by&#xD;
      establishing risk accessment models combining TCM and modern medicine indicators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to develope a risk assessment model of ischemic stroke endpoint events&#xD;
      combining multi-dimensional TCM indicators with modern medicine indicators. The proposed&#xD;
      study is a registry study based participant survey conducted in 7 hospitals nationwide in&#xD;
      China. After obtaining informed consent, a total of 3000 study patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      ischemic stroke will be recruited. 1-year follow-ups are carried out on-site in hospitals and&#xD;
      by telephone to track endpoint events. Comparative analysis of prevalence of endpoint events&#xD;
      and other TCM or modern medicine features in different groups is conducted using frequency&#xD;
      analysis and chi-squared tests, and expressed with composition ratios. Comparative analysis&#xD;
      of quantitative scores of the scales and related syndromes or symptoms is conducted using&#xD;
      rank-sum test. Correlation analysis of endpoint events and TCM or modern medicine factors&#xD;
      will be performed using multivariate Cox proportional hazard model.&#xD;
