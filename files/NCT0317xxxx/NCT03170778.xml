  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to identify indicators of vision problems and ocular&#xD;
      abnormalities in patients with a Fontan circulation through a standardized questionnaire and&#xD;
      to correlate the intraocular pressure measured with the Icare tonometer with central venous&#xD;
      pressure measured with the VENUS 2000 CVP non-invasive system to determine whether&#xD;
      intraocular pressure can be used as a surrogate measure of increased central venous pressure&#xD;
      in patients with a Fontan circulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous authors have described optic disc edema, globe flattening, choroidal folds which&#xD;
      were thought to be part of the well-defined but still idiopathic syndrome of idiopathic&#xD;
      intracranial hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is not well understood. Recent&#xD;
      reports, however suggest that elevated cerebral venous pressure underlines the process. The&#xD;
      close relationship that exist between spinal fluid pressure and cerebral venous pressure has&#xD;
      been definitely established. It was found that patients with increased venous pressure due to&#xD;
      heart failure had an increase in spinal fluid pressure as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, numerous authors have described venous stasis retinopathy, bilateral choroidal&#xD;
      detachments, intraretinal hemorrhages, vessel tortuosity, microaneurysms, capillary leakage,&#xD;
      central retinal vein occlusion, open angle glaucoma, choroidal effusion, etc. in patients&#xD;
      with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Elevated venous pressure found in pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      hypertension is responsible for the delayed choroidal perfusion and the reduced venous blood&#xD;
      outflow. This explains the clinical findings of venous stasis retinopathy, choroidal&#xD;
      detachments, etc. which are related to elevated episcleral, retinal and choroidal venous&#xD;
      pressure secondary to elevated systemic venous pressure (increased pulmonary vascular&#xD;
      resistance in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension leads to right heart failure and&#xD;
      subsequent elevation in systemic venous pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic venous pressures in Fontan patients are comparable with those in patients with&#xD;
      significant right heart failure in a 2- ventricular circulation. With Fontan anatomy the&#xD;
      elevated central venous pressure is transmitted to the dural venous sinuses of the brain&#xD;
      through jugular veins and the paraspinal venous plexus and after the Fontan procedure brain&#xD;
      venous pressure are chronically elevated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that the long-term effects of the Fontan operation can result in a&#xD;
      spectrum of ocular changes similar to those occurring in patients with idiopathic&#xD;
      intracranial and pulmonary arterial hypertensions due to chronically elevated cerebral venous&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been reported that intraocular pressure is directly related to the episcleral and&#xD;
      jugular venous pressure in patients without underlying ophthalmic diseases. Several previous&#xD;
      studies have shown a linear correlation between central venous pressure and intraocular&#xD;
      pressure. Therefore, the investigators believe that the monitoring of intraocular pressure&#xD;
      may be simple and effective method for estimating central venous pressure in patients with&#xD;
      Fontan circulation.&#xD;
