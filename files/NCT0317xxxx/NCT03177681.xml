  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if probiotics found in yogurt can help&#xD;
      to decrease gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in cancer patients. Probiotics are live bacteria&#xD;
      and yeast that help with many of our functions and may help digestive problems. Researchers&#xD;
      also want to learn if the bacteria in your stool change as your symptoms change while eating&#xD;
      yogurt.&#xD;

      Baseline Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will have the following tests and procedures&#xD;
      when you enroll:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The coating on your tongue will be checked. Researchers think that the thickness of the&#xD;
           coating on your tongue may be related to the microorganisms in your stomach and/or&#xD;
           intestines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A stool sample will be collected for bacteria testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about your diet and how often you eat yogurt.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will wear a monitoring device called a Holter monitor for 20-24 hours to check your&#xD;
           nervous system and heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked to complete 4 questionnaires about your symptoms in the past 24 hours,&#xD;
           your irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), your most recent stool, and your quality-of-life.&#xD;
           These questionnaires should take about 30 minutes total to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) time during Days 3-7 and 1 time during Days 8-12:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked to complete the same 4 questionnaires you completed at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A stool sample will be collected by your bedside nurse for bacteria testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You may wear a Holter monitor to check your heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given at least 2 tablespoons (33 cc) of DannonÒ OikosÒyogurt each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation in this study will be over after you complete the study procedures during&#xD;
      Days 8 to 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are discharged before you complete the study procedures above, you will be called and&#xD;
      asked about your symptoms and given a stool collection kit. This phone call should take about&#xD;
      30 minutes to complete. The study staff will give you more information about stool&#xD;
      collection. Your sample will be collected for bacteria testing at your next clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The use of probiotics in yogurt to treat GI symptoms in&#xD;
      cancer patients is investigational. The study doctor can explain how the probiotics are&#xD;
      designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;
