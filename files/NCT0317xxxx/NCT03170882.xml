  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to learn if ixazomib, given with dexamethasone, stops the&#xD;
      cancer from getting worse in people with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. It will be&#xD;
      compared to another medicine called pomalidomide, given with dexamethasone with people with&#xD;
      the same condition. Relapsed means the previous cancer treatment stopped working, over time.&#xD;
      Refractory means they did not respond to previous cancer treatment. Another aim is to check&#xD;
      for side effects from the study medicines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, the study doctor will check who can take part. Participants who can take&#xD;
      part will be picked for 1 of 2 treatments by chance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ixazomib capsules, given with dexamethasone tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pomalidomide capsules, given with dexamethasone tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will take their study medicine on specific days during a 28-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 1st dose of study medicines in each 28-day cycle will take place in the clinic, The other&#xD;
      doses of the study medicines will be taken at home. This will happen for 6 cycles. After&#xD;
      this, all study medicines will be taken at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment, participants will visit the clinic every 12 weeks for a check-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants cannot attend their clinic for an important reason (for example, due to the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic), the clinic will make alternative arrangements using their local&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Ixazomib. Ixazomib is being tested to treat&#xD;
      people who have relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). This study will compare&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety in participants who take ixazomib and dexamethasone to pomalidomide&#xD;
      and dexamethasone. It is an open-label, Phase 2 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 120 participants. Participants will receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ixazomib 4 mg + dexamethasone 20 mg (or 10 mg if participant is aged &gt;=75 years) OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pomalidomide 4 mg + dexamethasone 40 mg (or 20 mg if participant is aged &gt;=75 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to take either ixazomib plus dexamethasone (in cases where&#xD;
      only 4 mg tablets for dexamethasone are available, the following dexamethasone schedule is&#xD;
      recommended for participants aged &gt;=75 years: 12 mg dexamethasone will be given on Days 1, 8,&#xD;
      15, and 22 of every 28-day cycle; and 8 mg dexamethasone will be given on Days 2, 9, 16, and&#xD;
      23 of every 28-day cycle) or pomalidomide 4 mg + dexamethasone 40 mg at recommended doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this&#xD;
      study is approximately 28 months after the first participant enters the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be contacted for progression&#xD;
      free-survival (PFS) follow-up, in case of study drug discontinuation for up to 4 years from&#xD;
      first dose administration. After disease progression, participants will be followed-up for&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) every 12 weeks until death or up to 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative methods for administering study procedures/assessments may be considered when it&#xD;
      is not possible for the participants to come to the study site due to extenuating&#xD;
      circumstances (e.g., due to the COVID-19 pandemic).&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Must have had a relapse or progressive disease (PD) after having received 2 or more&#xD;
             prior lines of systemic therapy. Note: A line of therapy is defined as 1 or more&#xD;

        <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 contains 30 items across 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 9 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) and a global health status/quality of life (QOL) scale. The physical domain consisted of 5 items covering participant's daily physical activities on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Raw scores were linearly transformed to a total score between 0-100, with a high score indicating better physical functioning.</description>

Most of the 30 items had 4 response levels (not at all, a little, quite a bit, and very much), with 2 questions relying on a 7-point numeric rating scale. Each subscale raw score were linearly transformed to a total score between 0 to 100. For the functional scales and the global health status/QOL scale, higher scores represent better QOL; for the symptom scales, lower scores represent better QOL.

        <description>The EORTC QLQ-MY20 has 20 items across 4 independent subscales, 2 symptoms scales (disease symptoms, side effects of treatment), and 2 functional subscales (body image, future perspective). Scores were averaged and transformed to 0-100 scale. Higher scores for the future perspective scale indicate better perspective of the future, for the body image scale indicate better body image and for the disease symptoms scale indicate higher level of symptomatology.</description>
