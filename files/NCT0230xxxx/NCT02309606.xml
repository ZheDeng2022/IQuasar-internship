  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine affects 16% of the world population and is one of the most disabling of all&#xD;
      disorders. It is a complex brain disorder characterized primarily by recurrent headache&#xD;
      attacks. The signaling molecule serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has for decades been&#xD;
      thought to play a central role in migraine pathophysiology. The most effective class of&#xD;
      abortive migraine drugs, the triptans, act on 5-HT receptors. However, the migraine-specific&#xD;
      actions of serotonin and the mechanisms of triptans are still unknown. In this project the&#xD;
      investigators will use high-resolution positron emission tomography and specific radioligands&#xD;
      to investigate the significance of serotonin in migraine. Two newly developed radioligands&#xD;
      that are specific for the 5-HT1B and 5-HT4 receptor, respectively, will be applied. To&#xD;
      investigate the level and distribution of serotonin in the migraine brain the investigators&#xD;
      will compare the binding of these ligands in episodic migraine patients with healthy&#xD;
      controls. In addition, the investigators will include chronic migraine patients to evaluate&#xD;
      the relation between the level of serotonin in the brain and the frequency of migraine&#xD;
      attacks. To investigate the changes in the serotonin level during a migraine attack and the&#xD;
      effects of triptans on the central nervous system the investigators will repeat the scans&#xD;
      using the 5-HT1B specific ligand during induced migraine attacks and following treatment with&#xD;
      sumatriptan. The results from this study will shed light on the role of serotonin in the&#xD;
      migraine brain and elucidate the migraine-specific action of triptans. This will improve our&#xD;
      understanding of the migraine pathophysiology and, potentially, facilitate the development of&#xD;
      more efficient treatment of migraine.&#xD;
