  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type A Thawed Plasma (TP) will be compared in polytrauma patients who receive only Normal&#xD;
      Saline (NS) (standard of care) before arrival at the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if prehospital administration of thawed plasma can&#xD;
      reduce mortality of patients who have lost a large amount of blood due to their injuries,&#xD;
      compared to those receiving standard of care.&#xD;

      INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN This will be an open-label, non-blinded, randomized clinical trial to&#xD;
      investigate mortality (30 days) and morbidity of Type A thawed Plasma (TP) versus NS infusion&#xD;
      at earliest contact, administered by Emergency Medical Service (EMS) supervisors to subjects&#xD;
      who have sustained severe Polytrauma / Major hemorrhage (PTr / MH). The total study is&#xD;
      expected to last 2 years with 210 patients enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two EMS agencies involved in the study will each have one EMS supervisor quick-response&#xD;
      vehicle (QRV) equipped with an approved, validated refrigeration unit for TP transport. EMS&#xD;
      personnel trained in plasma administration and recognition of reactions may administer up to&#xD;
      2 units of TP to subjects approved for study enrollment. Blood samples for coagulation and&#xD;
      lipid testing will be drawn prior to TP administration by EMS personnel,and repeated by&#xD;
      hospital personnel at 30 minutes, 8 hours, and 24 hours post-injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is approved for &quot;Exception from Informed Consent&quot; (EFIC). Once the patient has&#xD;
      reached VCUMC and has been entered into the VCUMC health care system, the treating team will&#xD;
      advise the Study Coordinator (SC) whether or not a subject is able to consent. As the plasma&#xD;
      administration will occur in the field prior to arrival to VCUMC, the SC will make every&#xD;
      effort possible to obtain consent from the subject or legally authorized representative (LAR)&#xD;
      for continued study participation before the next intervention (8 hour blood specimen&#xD;
      collection). The attempts to contact the LAR will be documented in detail. If a subject lacks&#xD;
      the ability to provide his/her own consent by the end of day 30, the consent signed by the&#xD;
      LAR will be the consent document in force at the subject's completion of the study and no&#xD;
      further consent will be sought.&#xD;
