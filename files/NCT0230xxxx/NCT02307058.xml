  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn about: 1) improving control of prostate cancer&#xD;
      using an extra high dose radiation treatment to the MRI defined high risk tumor areas, in&#xD;
      addition to the standard radiation treatment to the rest of the prostate; 2) preserving&#xD;
      quality of life by reducing dose to the nearby organs at risk around the prostate; and 3)&#xD;
      establishing the relationship of pre- and post-treatment MRI to MRI-directed biopsy results&#xD;
      at 2-2.5 years after treatment.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 5.25 years (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related Quality of Life (HRQOL) will be measured using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite and Medical Outcomes Study SF-12 (EPIC SF-12) to evaluate patient function and satisfaction after prostate cancer treatment. Response options for each item form a Likert scale, and multi-item scale scores are transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores representing better HRQOL.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 5.25 years (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) will be measured using the scores on the Modified 18-item Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer (MAX-PC) from pre-treatment to post-treatment. The scale consists of 18 items (e.g. &quot;I thought about prostate cancer even though I didn't mean to.&quot;) scored on a scale from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;often&quot;). Total scores range from 0 to 54, with higher scores indicating higher levels of anxiety.</description>

There are 7 questions related to urinary function. Responses are on a scale from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 5 (&quot;almost always&quot;), with higher scores indicating higher levels of urinary dysfunction. There is 1 quality of life question related to urinary symptoms. Responses are on a scale from 0 (&quot;delighted&quot;) to 6 (&quot;terrible&quot;).</description>

    <description>The multiparametric-MRI (MP-MRI) defined Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) will receive 12-14 Gy on the first day of treatment and then the prostate plus proximal seminal vesicles (SV), the Clinical Target Volume (CTV)1, will receive 76 Gy in 38 fractions (Fxs) at 2.0 Gy per Fx. For High Risk patients, the distal SVs may be treated to 56 Gy in 38 Fxs or full dose (CTV2), and the pelvic lymph nodes may be treated to 56 Gy in 38 Fxs (CTV3).</description>

    <description>The MRI defined GTV(s) will receive a higher dose per day than the CTV by dose painting. The GTV(s) will receive an absolute dose of 91.2 Gy. Assuming an α/β ratio of 3.0, this would be equivalent to 98.5 Gy in 2.0 Gy fractions. The prostate plus proximal seminal vesicles (CTV1) will receive 76 Gy in 38 fractions (Fxs) at 2.0 Gy per Fx. For High Risk patients, the distal SVs (CTV2) may be treated to 56 Gy in 38 Fxs or full dose, and the pelvic lymph nodes (CTV3) may be treated to 56 Gy in 38 Fxs.</description>

&#xD;
          -  B. T1-T3 disease based on digital rectal exam.&#xD;

             An anti-androgen (e.g., bicalutamide at 50 mg per day po) is recommended to start&#xD;
             prior to LHRH agonist injection (not recommended for LHRH antagonist injection) and is&#xD;
             recommended to not be administered for more than 4 months. If ADT is planned, the&#xD;
             following restrictions apply:&#xD;

             is without evidence of metastasis. A questionable bone scan is acceptable if&#xD;
             additional imaging studies (e.g., plain x-rays, CT, or MRI) do not confirm for&#xD;
             metastasis.&#xD;

             eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  L. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
             document.&#xD;
