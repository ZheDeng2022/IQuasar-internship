  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to assess whether a natural inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2&#xD;
      (ALDH2) contained in a soy extract could interfere on alcohol metabolism and effects in&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Soybeans contain isoflavones, which are biologically active polyphenols known as antioxidants&#xD;
      and phytoestrogens. These isoflavones include daidzin, daidzein, genistin and glycitin, and&#xD;
      have been implicated in the beneficial effects of soy consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daidzin and daidzein are isoflavones contained in soybean that can act as natural inhibitors&#xD;
      of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2. Animal studies have demonstrated that some soy isoflavones can&#xD;
      reduce the auto-administration of cocaine and suggest they might be useful to treat cocaine&#xD;
      dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitors, as disulfiram, are currently used in humans to treat&#xD;
      alcohol dependence because they interfere with ethanol metabolism (specifically in the&#xD;
      transformation of acetaldehyde to acetate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alcohol intake after disulfiram administration increases concentration of acetaldehyde in the&#xD;
      blood (five to 10 times higher than that found during metabolism of the same amount of&#xD;
      alcohol alone). The combination produced acute symptoms of a severe &quot;hangover&quot; (named&#xD;
      disulfiram-like reaction), and the patient may experience symptoms as flushing of the skin,&#xD;
      tachycardia, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, throbbing headache, visual disturbances,&#xD;
      mental confusion, and in some cases severe reactions as postural syncope, and circulatory&#xD;
      collapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, disulfiram have demonstrated clinical efficacy in cocaine dependence. The&#xD;
      mechanism of action for that effects are related to its ability to decrease dopamine&#xD;
      degradation by inhibiting the dopamine-beta-hydroxylase enzyme (metabolizes dopamine to&#xD;
      norepinephrine), and increasing its concentrations in some areas of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess whether a soy extract containing isoflavones (daidzin,&#xD;
      daidzein and genistein) could interfere on alcohol metabolism and produce adverse effects in&#xD;
      humans.&#xD;
