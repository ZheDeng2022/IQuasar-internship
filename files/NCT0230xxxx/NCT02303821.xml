    <textblock>
      The purpose of Phase 1b of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Asses the safety, tolerability and activity of carfilzomib, alone and in combination&#xD;
           with induction chemotherapy, in children with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic&#xD;
           leukemia (ALL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to recommend a phase 2 dose of&#xD;
           carfilzomib in combination with induction chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of Phase 2 of this study is to compare the rate of complete response (CR) of&#xD;
      carfilzomib in combination with vincristine, dexamethasone, PEG asparaginase, daunorubicin&#xD;
      (VXLD) at the end of induction therapy to an appropriate external control.&#xD;
