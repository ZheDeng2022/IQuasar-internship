      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of nivolumab when given with or&#xD;
      without ipilimumab to see how well they work in treating younger patients with solid tumors&#xD;
      or sarcomas that have come back (recurrent) or do not respond to treatment (refractory).&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the&#xD;
      body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to&#xD;
      grow and spread. It is not yet known whether nivolumab works better alone or with ipilimumab&#xD;
      in treating patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors or sarcomas.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the tolerability, and define and describe the toxicities of nivolumab&#xD;
      administered as a single agent in children with relapsed or refractory solid tumors at the&#xD;
      adult recommended dose of 3 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine if systemic nivolumab exposure in children is similar to the systemic exposure&#xD;
      in adults following a 3 mg/kg dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and&#xD;
      define and describe the toxicities of nivolumab plus ipilimumab administered to children with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess antitumor effects of nivolumab across selected childhood solid tumors in seven&#xD;
      expansion cohorts (Parts B1-B6, B8); neuroblastoma (2 cohorts: measurable disease,&#xD;
      metaiodobenzylguanidine [MIBG] positive only non-measurable disease), osteosarcoma,&#xD;
      rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Assess antitumor effects of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab across selected&#xD;
      childhood solid tumors in two dose combinations (Part D and Part E).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Characterize the pharmacokinetics of nivolumab alone and in combination with ipilimumab,&#xD;
      including area under the curve (AUC), concentration maximum (Cmax), concentration minimum&#xD;
      (Cmin), using intensive sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Assess immunogenicity of nivolumab alone and in combination with ipilimumab by measuring&#xD;
      anti-drug antibody (ADA) levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Conduct exploratory studies of the phenotypic and functional effects of nivolumab (alone&#xD;
      and in combination with ipilimumab), as well as changes in antibodies to previously&#xD;
      vaccinated viruses, in serum samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Explore whether correlations exist between PD-L1 expression on tumor and antitumor&#xD;
      effects of nivolumab (alone and in combination with ipilimumab) in pediatric solid tumors and&#xD;
      to conduct exploratory studies of potential tumor associated biomarkers of response in tumor&#xD;
      tissue (at least five out of the following markers: NRAS, BRAF, MEK, KIT, PDGF, TP53, RB1 and&#xD;
      BRCA1, Akt phosphorylation, IL-17 or PD-L1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Explore presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and their association with antitumor&#xD;
      effects of nivolumab (alone and in combination with ipilimumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Conduct exploratory studies of the effect of nivolumab (alone or in combination with&#xD;
      ipilimumab) on cytokine levels in serum samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. For Part E, determine tumor mutational burden of diagnostic specimens using&#xD;
      FoundationOneCDx testing to explore immune- related gene expression or mutation and its&#xD;
      association with antitumor response to nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of nivolumab followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART A (COMPLETED): Patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors receive nivolumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART B (COMPLETED): Patients with neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing&#xD;
      sarcoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or melanoma receive nivolumab as in Part A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART C (COMPLETED):&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on&#xD;
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive nivolumab IV as in Part A. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART D (COMPLETED):&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients with neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma,&#xD;
      Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or melanoma receive nivolumab IV and ipilimumab IV as&#xD;
      in Part C. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART E: Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and ipilimumab IV over 90&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive nivolumab IV over 30&#xD;
      minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at approximately 100 days,&#xD;
      every 6 months for up to 24 months, and then annually for up to 60 months.&#xD;
