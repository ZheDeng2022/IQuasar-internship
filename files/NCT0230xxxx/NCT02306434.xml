  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childbirth related fear is a public health issue strongly related to subsequent reproduction,&#xD;
      a request for caesarean section and women's and children's health. Currently, women are&#xD;
      offered 3-5 counseling sessions with specially trained midwives and obstetricians in most&#xD;
      Swedish hospitals as standard care (SC). In general, women are satisfied with counseling but&#xD;
      research show no major effect on cesarean section rates neither in decreased level of&#xD;
      childbirth related fear. It is therefore important to find the best available treatment for&#xD;
      this issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this program is to compare Internet given cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) with&#xD;
      standard counseling care for pregnant women reporting childbirth related fear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions: What effect does ICBT compared to SC have on a) the level of childbirth&#xD;
      related fear b) a request for cesarean section c) compliance and satisfaction with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A randomized controlled trial of women reporting childbirth related fear during&#xD;
      pregnancy. One arm will receive SC and one arm ICBT though the U-CARE platform. Follow up of&#xD;
      given treatment will occur at 30 and 36 weeks of pregnancy, two months and one year after&#xD;
      birth. Intervention: The intervention will focus on management of childbirth related fear.&#xD;
      This means that the participants do weekly sessions and homework assignments during&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome will be level of childbirth related fear measured at 36 weeks of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are level of childbirth related fear at 2 months and one year after birth,&#xD;
      preferences for mode of birth, request for elective cesarean section, compliance and&#xD;
      satisfaction with treatment and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected benefits: This study will contribute to the development of new treatment methods for&#xD;
      childbirth related fear. Evidence of the best treatment to reduce childbirth related fear&#xD;
      based on the results from this study could be implemented in clinical practice and hopefully&#xD;
      decreases the numbers of cesarean sections without medical indications.&#xD;

      Project area&#xD;
&#xD;
      Childbirth related fear is a public health issue strongly related to subsequent reproduction&#xD;
      and women's and children's health. It could be assumed that previous negative birth&#xD;
      experiences are caused by interventions and/or lack of support from staff during birth which&#xD;
      in turn could be linked to women's emotional wellbeing. Childbirth related fear often&#xD;
      involves a request for a caesarean section, which in turn could have short and long term&#xD;
      consequences for women's and children's health. The majority of studies on childbirth related&#xD;
      fear have focused on maternal characteristics and the reasons for childbirth fear. Fewer&#xD;
      studies have addressed treatment options for curing childbirth fear. Standard care for women&#xD;
      with childbirth related fear in Sweden, is usually counseling with midwives and sometimes&#xD;
      this counseling leads to an elective caesarean section. In general, women are satisfied with&#xD;
      counselling. However, research shows no major effect of counselling, neither in decreased&#xD;
      numbers of cesarean sections on maternal request nor in decreased levels of childbirth&#xD;
      related fear one year after birth. Today a substantial financial amount of the budget for&#xD;
      women's health care is allocated to treatment of childbirth fear using counselling teams. The&#xD;
      introduction of such counseling teams was introduced without being preceded by any randomized&#xD;
      trials about its effects. In other areas of health care, cognitive behavior therapy is&#xD;
      recommended for psychosocial issues. The present project will compare Internet based&#xD;
      cognitive behavior therapy (iCBT) with standard care (SC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey of the field Childbirth related fear has gained major research interest particularly&#xD;
      in the Scandinavian countries.Severe fear of childbirth has been reported to 6-10% in a&#xD;
      Finish study, and fear comparable to PTSD 1.3%. Measures of childbirth related fear: The FOBS&#xD;
      scale was developed in a cross-cultural comparative study where two VAS scales (measuring&#xD;
      worries and fears in relation to childbirth) were combined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reported reasons for fear of childbirth are; fear of pain, childhood abuse, and feelings that&#xD;
      the woman or the baby will be damaged during birth or even die, being denied help from&#xD;
      caregivers or felt badly treated by delivery staff and, for multiparous women previous&#xD;
      emergency caesarean sections or previous negative experiences of birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment for childbirth fear Most Swedish hospitals have special counseling teams for women&#xD;
      with childbirth fear, often called Aurora groups. Their antenatal midwife refers women to&#xD;
      these special teams. The most common treatment model for these women are visits with a&#xD;
      specially trained midwife, but psycho-somatic support, cognitive behavior therapy, and&#xD;
      relaxation techniques are also used. This counseling treatment in Sweden has not been&#xD;
      preceded by large randomized studies, but studies indicate that women are satisfied with the&#xD;
      treatment. It has also been shown that women who are referred to the Aurora services more&#xD;
      frequently have caesarean sections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim and research questions The aim of this study is to compare Internet given cognitive&#xD;
      behavior therapy (ICBT) with standard care (SC) for pregnant women identified with childbirth&#xD;
      related fear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions: What effect does Internet given cognitive behavior therapy compare to&#xD;
      standard care have on a) the level of childbirth related fear b) request for cesarean section&#xD;
      c) compliance and satisfaction with care and d) costs for the treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A randomized controlled trial of women with childbirth related fear. One arm will&#xD;
      receive standard care and one arm cognitive behavioral therapy by internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: One large Swedish university hospital and two regional hospitals. Recruitment: All&#xD;
      pregnant women at the routine ultrasound screening examination, offered to all pregnant women&#xD;
      during gestational week 16-20, will receive oral and written information about the study. The&#xD;
      recruitment process will follow two steps. First, all women who attend the ultrasound&#xD;
      examination will be handed a leaflet where a few questions are asked about their age, parity,&#xD;
      gestational week, access to Internet and the FOBS-scale. The women will receive a brief&#xD;
      information text with information about the purpose of the study, e.g. that we are interested&#xD;
      in women's feelings towards the approaching birth and if they score over the cutoff point&#xD;
      will be offered to attend a study of treatment for childbirth fear. To be eligible for&#xD;
      inclusion, potential participants have to meet the following criteria; a) Swedish speaking b)&#xD;
      scoring â‰¥60 on the FOBS score c) available internet access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second step of recruitment, women who score 60 or above on the FOBS-scale will be sent&#xD;
      a letter of invitation and a phone call from the recruiting midwives. The invitation letter&#xD;
      and the phone call will explain the study outline and the women will be informed that they&#xD;
      will be randomized either to iCBT or standard care. Informed consent from the women will be&#xD;
      returned either by an on-line form to the U-CARE platform or in a prepaid envelope indicating&#xD;
      consent or not. The women will be provided with login details to the U-CARE platform and all&#xD;
      communication thereafter will be though the platform regardless of which arm women will be&#xD;
      randomized to. After completion of a baseline questionnaire randomization to treatment will&#xD;
      occur and women will receive instructions about the following program. If randomized to the&#xD;
      iCBT arm the psychologist will introduce the iCBT-treatment by a telephone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Internet Cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) is given by a psychologist by the&#xD;
      U-CARE platform. The intervention will focus on management of childbirth related fear. This&#xD;
      means that the participants read texts and do homework assignments instructed from an&#xD;
      internet page. Additional resources such as pictures, animations, videos and sounds will be a&#xD;
      part of the treatment program. A psychologist will communicate with the participants through&#xD;
      internal text-messages and feed back on their homework assignments.The therapist will devote&#xD;
      time to each participant each week via the Internet. The content of the intervention will be&#xD;
      standard components from CBT, for example relaxation training, behavioral activation,&#xD;
      exposure for fear related stimuli, cognitive restructuring, behavioral sleep treatment. The&#xD;
      women complete homework assignments, this consists of tasks such as doing relaxation&#xD;
      training, to perform planned new behaviors, to break behavioral habits, to expose oneself to&#xD;
      frightening situations or to change sleeping routines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard care: Counselling for childbirth fear is given by the antenatal care midwife and by&#xD;
      specially trained midwives working in collaboration with obstetricians at approximately 3-5&#xD;
      face to face counselling sessions. Often a visit to the delivery unit is included in the&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures: At baseline previously validated instruments measuring women's levels of fear of&#xD;
      childbirth, anxiety, depressive symptoms, stressful life events, Prenatal Attachment&#xD;
      Inventory (PAI-R), Blood and injection phobia, Cambridge Worry Scale, Performance Based&#xD;
      Self-esteem, and Pain Catastrophizing scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the instruments included, women's socio-demographic and obstetrics background,&#xD;
      psychosocial history, experience of childbirth, attitudes towards birth, partner and family&#xD;
      support will be measured along with the woman's previous birth preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up: The randomized women will receive follow up questionnaires at 30 and 36 weeks of&#xD;
      pregnancy where women's fears and emotional wellbeing will be further investigated using the&#xD;
      above mentioned instruments. Two months and one year after birth additional questions about&#xD;
      birth outcome, birth experience, breast feeding duration, attachment and bonding to their&#xD;
      infant and their satisfaction and experience of the treatment program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The primary outcome will be level of childbirth related fear at 36 weeks&#xD;
      gestation. Secondary outcomes are childbirth related fear at two months and one year after&#xD;
      birth, preferences for mode of birth, request for cesarean section in late pregnancy and in&#xD;
      case of a subsequent pregnancy, compliance and satisfaction with the treatment, birth outcome&#xD;
      and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis: A previous Swedish study showed that 59% of women with childbirth fear during&#xD;
      pregnancy were 'cured' after a year. A power calculation based on a 20% reduction in&#xD;
      childbirth fear, a two-sided test, a power of 0.80 and a level of significance of 5 %, shows&#xD;
      that approximately 200 women need to be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations: The study has received full ethical review and approval. The hospital&#xD;
      managers at the participating sites are cooperating with the study. The project leaders' name&#xD;
      and contact details are available in the letter of invitation and women as well as recruiting&#xD;
      midwives are encouraged to make contact if they have questions about the project. All data&#xD;
      collection will be administered by the U-CARE platform and the research group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification: Fear of childbirth is a public health issue strongly related to subsequent&#xD;
      reproduction and women's and children's health. Currently identification and treatment is&#xD;
      taking place without a clear evidence base. It is therefore important to find the most&#xD;
      effective and acceptable treatment for this issue which can be offered to the maximum number&#xD;
      of affected women in the most cost effective and sustainable manner. The study is linked to&#xD;
      new innovations in person centered care in clinical practice using Internet based technology&#xD;
      which is offering new and equitable access to best practice health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected benefits: This study will contribute to the development of new treatment methods for&#xD;
      childbirth related fear. Finding evidence of the best treatment to reduce childbirth related&#xD;
      fear based on the results from this study could be implemented in clinical practice and&#xD;
      hopefully reduces the psychological distress felt by women during the childbearing period and&#xD;
      reduces the number of caesarean sections requested by women without medical indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consumer perspective and disseminating of study results: Prior to the recruitment of study&#xD;
      participants think-aloud interviews with approximately 30 women will be performed in order to&#xD;
      test the included instruments. In the pilot study women will carefully answer all questions&#xD;
      and at the same time communicate their thoughts to a researcher when completing the&#xD;
      questions, for construct and face validity.&#xD;
