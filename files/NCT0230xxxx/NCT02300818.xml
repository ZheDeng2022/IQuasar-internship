    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is among the leading causes for blindness in the western world. Elevated intraocular&#xD;
      pressure (IOP) has been identified as the most important risk factor. However, some patients&#xD;
      progress despite adequate IOP lowering while some subjects with elevated IOP never develop&#xD;
      glaucoma. Other patients develop glaucoma although IOP measurements were always in the normal&#xD;
      range. Therefore, other factors must be involved. In the last years, studies using MRI have&#xD;
      been performed and evidence has accumulated that also changes in retrobulbar structures are&#xD;
      present, in particular in the lateral geniculate nucleus and the visual cortex. However,&#xD;
      these studies were limited by the low spatial resolution of the MRI instruments used.&#xD;

      The two principal pathophysiological mechanisms of glaucomatous process (hydromechanical and&#xD;
      metabolic) determine the development of two trends in the treatment of glaucoma. One&#xD;
      treatment modality is aimed at reduction of intraocular pressure, the other at therapy of&#xD;
      hemodynamic and metabolic disorders. General and local drug therapy and physiotherapy,&#xD;
      including electro- and laser stimulation of the retina and optic nerve and magneto-therapy,&#xD;
      are used to correct these disorders. Modern ocular hypotensive agents are myotics and&#xD;
      beta-adrenoblockers, adrenergic drugs, alpha 2-agonists, carboanhydrase inhibitors, some&#xD;
      prostaglandins, osmotic agents. The progress attained in conservative therapy of glaucoma&#xD;
      should by no means be overstated. In many cases only a combination of conservative and&#xD;
      surgical methods of treatment helps preserve vision in a glaucoma patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the following investigation we will demonstrate that the use of Magneto therapy Ocular&#xD;
      (MTO) reverses the symptomatology in Glaucoma patients. The use of Eyeglass magnetic prevents&#xD;
      the development of Glaucoma disease.During the following investigation we will demonstrate&#xD;
      that the use of MTO reverses the symptomatology of Glaucoma patients; the use of seawater as&#xD;
      drops prevents the development of Glaucoma disease and the combined use of MTO and seawater&#xD;
      is an effective therapy against Glaucoma disease that will cure a grand percentage of the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will randomized 100 glaucoma patients and will treat them with MTO (group 1) and seawater&#xD;
      drop (group 2) and combined group 3 and will compare results&#xD;

    <description>Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Therapy widely termed as (PEMF) is a reparative technique used for treatment of eye therapy has proved to be a beneficial treatment for those suffering from glaucoma. This therapy helps in increased blood flow and show positive results on latent, initial and advanced glaucoma with ten sessions of seven minutes' each.&#xD;
PEMF has also proved to be beneficial in vision acuity of patients with low vision. In 50 per cent of the cases, values improved. Patients with vision acuity of 0.2 diopters showed improvement from 46 before treatment to 75 after treatment.&#xD;
Different studies on varied diseases have proved that Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Therapy (PEMF) treatment is a safe, non-invasive and effective option for curing ocular conditions.</description>
