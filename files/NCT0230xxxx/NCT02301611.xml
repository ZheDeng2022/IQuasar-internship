  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of melanoma vaccines tested to date have been antigen-specific vaccines&#xD;
      targeting melanoma-specific or associated antigens and utilizing a variety of delivery&#xD;
      systems and immune-adjuvants. As opposed to testing an &quot;off the shelf&quot; vaccine that might be&#xD;
      able to treat a subset of patients, our approach has been personalized to the patient and&#xD;
      applicable to all patients. Our vaccine approach consists of harnessing the most potent&#xD;
      antigen presenting cell in the body - the dendritic cell (DC) - together with the full&#xD;
      repertoire of tumor antigens from an individual's cancer. We have conducted phase I and II&#xD;
      studies using an autologous DC-tumor cell fusion technique that has now been simplified into&#xD;
      a DC-tumor cell lysate vaccine. The autologous tumor lysate (TL) is loaded into yeast cell&#xD;
      wall particles (YCWP) that are naturally and efficiently taken up into the patient's DC.&#xD;
      These autologous tumor lysate, particle-loaded, DC (TLPLDC) are injected intradermally (ID)&#xD;
      monthly x 3 followed by boosters at 6, 12, and 18 months.&#xD;

      Stage III and Stage IV (resected) melanoma patients will be identified prior to definitive&#xD;
      surgery and screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Eligible patients will be counseled&#xD;
      and consented for tissue procurement. Enrolled patients will have their disease surgically&#xD;
      resected and a portion 1mg minimum of their melanoma sterilely frozen in provided freezing&#xD;
      vials and storage tubes. This tissue will be shipped in liquid nitrogen shippers through&#xD;
      FedEx to our central facility in Greenville SC and stored frozen until vaccine preparation.&#xD;
      If patients cannot be rendered disease-free, they will be considered screen failures for this&#xD;
      study. If melanoma is being resected from multiple locations primary and nodes two different&#xD;
      metastatic sites then samples of each would be preferred but not mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As indicated by SoC per the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines and&#xD;
      determined by the treating team, if a patient is to receive systemic therapy (chemotherapy or&#xD;
      IFN-aguidelines) and determined by the treating team, if a patient is to receive systemic&#xD;
      therapy (chemotherapy or IFN-central facility in Greenville, SC) and stored frozen until&#xD;
      vaccine preparation. If patients cannot be rendered disease-free, they will receive a single&#xD;
      injection of Neupogen (G-CSF) 300 mod (or its equivalent) SQ 24-48 hrs. prior to having 70 mL&#xD;
      of blood collected and sent to our central facility for DC isolation and preparation.&#xD;
      Patients who cannot tolerate Neupogen, or its equivalent or refuse it, will have 120 mL of&#xD;
      blood drawn and sent. Additional blood may be drawn if additional vaccine doses need to be&#xD;
      made or re-made for any reason. Vaccines will be prepared by producing TL through freeze/thaw&#xD;
      cycling and then loaded into pre-prepared YCWP. The TL-loaded YCWP will be introduced to the&#xD;
      DC for phagocytosis thus creating the TLPLDC vaccine which will be frozen in single dose&#xD;
      vials. Each vial will contain 1-1.5 x 106 TLPLDC and will be labeled with the patient's&#xD;
      unique study number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on their randomization, autologous TLPLDC (active vaccine) or unloaded YCWP +&#xD;
      autologous DC (control) will be sent back to the site in a blinded fashion. Regardless of&#xD;
      assigned group, the site will receive 6 single dose vials to be injected intradermal monthly&#xD;
      x 3 followed by boosters at 6, 12, and 18 months in the same lymph node draining area&#xD;
      (preferably the anterior thigh). Patients must begin vaccinations between 3 weeks and 3&#xD;
      months from completion of (SoC). Frozen tumor will be maintained for active vaccines for all&#xD;
      patients to include the control patients. The latter will be offered their active vaccine at&#xD;
      time of recurrence in a crossover fashion. Additionally, control patients who do not recur&#xD;
      will be offered active vaccine at the completion of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety data will be collected on local and systemic toxicities and graded and reported per&#xD;
      the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease-free status will be monitored per SoC as outlined by NCCN. Suspected recurrences will&#xD;
      be documented with biopsy and pathologic confirmation. Time to recurrence will be based on&#xD;
      date of randomization to time of confirmed recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent patients will be offered participation in the open label portion of the study. New&#xD;
      active vaccine will be made for all patients, and they will be inoculated at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6,&#xD;
      and 9 mos. Patients will be treated per SoC for their recurrence. Safety and tumor response&#xD;
      will be assessed per RECIST and irRC on their SoC follow-up scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood (50 mL) will be collected from all patients prior to each inoculation and at 24 months&#xD;
      from enrollment for a total of 7 time points or a total of 350 mL of blood over 2 years. The&#xD;
      collected blood will be sent to our central facility for immunologic testing of the T-cell&#xD;
      response.&#xD;

An interim analysis will be performed six months after the final patient is enrolled. This analysis will compare median DFS between vaccinated and control groups.</description>
