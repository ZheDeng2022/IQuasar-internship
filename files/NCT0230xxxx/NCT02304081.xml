      Enhanced&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under physiological conditions blood glucose is kept within a narrow range by complex&#xD;
      interactions of several signalling pathways. In this context, fine-tuning of alpha- and beta&#xD;
      cell activity is fundamental to avoid excessive metabolic excursions. The pathogenesis of&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is driven by insulin resistance, followed by an increasing&#xD;
      imbalance between alpha and beta cell activity which is characterised by relative insulin&#xD;
      deficiency and increased glucagon secretion especially in the postprandial state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual arrangement of complementary antidiabetic drugs in the escalation of&#xD;
      pharmacological intervention in T2DM is a major challenge. There is substantial need to&#xD;
      provide a scientific rationale for the best effective combination of antidiabetic drugs with&#xD;
      regard to their potency to address different aspects in the pathophysiology of T2DM.&#xD;
      Therefore, studies evaluating potential synergistic and/or complementary effects of&#xD;
      pharmacological interventions in T2DM deem imperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the effect of the DPP-IV inhibitor saxagliptin (as compared to&#xD;
      placebo) in addition to the SGLT-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on insulin resistance, pancreatic&#xD;
      alpha and beta cell function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triple therapy with metformin, SGLT-2 inhibitors, and DPP-IV inhibitors was shown to be&#xD;
      efficacious and safe in several studies and has been approved for the treatment of T2DM by&#xD;
      the European Medical Agency. Therefore, subjects with T2DM on a stable metformin background&#xD;
      therapy will be enrolled in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, phase IV, prospective, placebo-controlled, exploratory,&#xD;
      proof-of-mechanism study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a two-step treatment trial with a first open label and a second randomised,&#xD;
      double-blinded, placebo controlled treatment phase. In treatment phase 1 (TP1, 30±4 days), 26&#xD;
      subjects will receive dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily as add on to their pre-existing&#xD;
      metformin monotherapy. Thereafter, in treatment phase 2 (TP2, 30±4 days), subjects will be&#xD;
      randomised to additional saxagliptin 5 mg or corresponding placebo treatment in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
      Trial subjects will subsequently undergo both treatment phases, and endpoint assessments will&#xD;
      be performed at the beginning and end of each treatment phase on Visits 2, 3, and 4Assignment&#xD;
      of treatment allocation will take place at the investigational site. The total study duration&#xD;
      for a subject will be between 64 to 84 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a combined euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic and hyperglycaemic glucose clamp protocol&#xD;
      is chosen in order to assess parameters of insulin resistance as well as alpha- and beta-cell&#xD;
      function under highly standardised conditions within a small study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trained members of staff will perform all administrations of the IMP at the clinical site.&#xD;
      Drug accountability will be performed from Visit 2 to Visit 4 based on subject diaries and&#xD;
      returned study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whenever a deviation is noted by the Investigator, the Sponsor and/or monitor should be&#xD;
      informed and the implications of the deviation must be reviewed and discussed. The deviation&#xD;
      must be documented, explaining the reason for the deviation (root cause analysis), actions&#xD;
      taken and the impact of the deviation on the subject(s) and/or the trial. The safety&#xD;
      laboratory will perform a first check on their values for safety parameters and flag any&#xD;
      values outside the reference range. The Investigator must evaluate all results outside the&#xD;
      reference range. Before the Investigator starts the trial, the laboratory reference ranges&#xD;
      must be available in the Investigator's Trial File. The results provided by the safety&#xD;
      laboratory will be part of the trial database. Data Management is the responsibility of&#xD;
      Profil Institut für Stoffwechselforschung GmbH, Neuss Germany.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the monitoring procedures are to ensure that (i) the safety and rights of&#xD;
      the trial subjects are respected, (ii) that accurate, valid and complete data are collected,&#xD;
      and (iii) that the trial is conducted in accordance with the trial protocol, the principles&#xD;
      of GCP and local legislation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The monitor must be given direct access to the Trial Investigator File and source documents&#xD;
      (original documents, data and records). Direct access includes permission to examine,&#xD;
      analyse, verify and reproduce any record(s) and report(s) that are important to evaluation of&#xD;
      the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key tasks of the monitor include verifying the presence of informed consent, the adherence to&#xD;
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the documentation of SAEs, and the recording of all safety&#xD;
      and efficacy variables. The monitor will also confirm the completeness of patient records,&#xD;
      the adherence to the protocol and the progress in subject enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Profil Institut für Stoffwechselforschung GmbH, Neuss, Germany, will be responsible for the&#xD;
      statistical analysis. The statistical planning and conduct of analyses of the data from this&#xD;
      study will follow the principles defined in relevant ICH guidelines and the Sponsor's&#xD;
      biostatistical standard operating procedures (SOPs). All statistical analyses will be&#xD;
      performed using SAS® (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, United States of America&#xD;
      [USA]), version 9.3 or later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the lack of existing data for confirmatory sample size calculation, the study is designed&#xD;
      as an exploratory proof-of-mechanism study with an experimental assessment set-up. All&#xD;
      obtained results will be handled with equal emphasis in a strictly exploratory sense. The&#xD;
      data obtained from the trial will serve for the purpose of thesis generation and the design&#xD;
      of potential confirmatory studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dapagliflozin as well as Saxagliptin have been approved for treatment of T2DM in adult male&#xD;
      and female patients. Because it is moreover not expected that the effects of either drug on&#xD;
      the endpoint measures will differ between male and female subjects with T2DM, a specific&#xD;
      gender distribution is not planned for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a previous study in twelve patients with T2DM treatment with dapagliflozin, a group&#xD;
      size of 12 patients in each group has a power of 80% to detect a difference at a significance&#xD;
      level of 0,05 (two-tailed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before data are released for statistical analysis, a blinded review of all data will take&#xD;
      place to identify protocol deviations that may potentially affect the results. This review&#xD;
      will be performed without revealing which trial product the subjects are assigned to. The&#xD;
      blinding of the trial products will be maintained for everyone involved in allocating&#xD;
      subjects to the analysis sets until data are released for statistical analysis. Furthermore,&#xD;
      outliers will be identified by data review according to ICH-E9, using a fake randomisation.&#xD;
      In addition, protocol deviations, which may potentially affect the results, will be&#xD;
      identified and it will be evaluated if subjects and/or data should be excluded from the&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects and observations excluded from analysis sets, and the reason for this, will be&#xD;
      described in the clinical trial report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All available data will be included in data listings and tabulations. In general no&#xD;
      imputation of values for missing data will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, metric variables and derived parameters will be presented using descriptive&#xD;
      summary statistics including arithmetic means, median, minimum, maximum and standard&#xD;
      deviations. Categorical variables will be presented using descriptive summary statistics&#xD;
      including number of patients and percentages. Percentages of patients will be based on&#xD;
      non-missing values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, for all efficacy variables as well as the derived parameters the geometric means&#xD;
      and coefficients of variation will be presented as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive summaries will also be presented. Unless otherwise stated, all formal tests will&#xD;
      be conducted at the two-sided 5% level of significance. No alpha adjustment will be done. All&#xD;
      analyses on primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be interpreted in an exploratory&#xD;
      manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the dapagliflozin-corrected treatment effect, the evaluation of the change&#xD;
      from Visit 3 to Visit 4 in incremental AUCGluc270-390min / AUCIns270-390min will be performed&#xD;
      using analysis of covariance (ANOVA) with change in incremental AUCGluc270-390min /&#xD;
      AUCIns270-390min as response, treatment as fixed effect and baseline (Visit 2) value as&#xD;
      covariate. From this model, least square means of change from Visit 3 to Visit 4 and 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals for these changes will be calculated. In addition, estimate of the&#xD;
      placebo-corrected treatment effect (difference of least square mean of Visit 3 to Visit 4&#xD;
      changes between saxagliptin and placebo) and corresponding 95% confidence interval will be&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the data are homogeneous or not normally distributed and cannot be successfully&#xD;
      transformed, the analysis will be performed by non-parametric technique using Wilcoxon Signed&#xD;
      Rank Test for within treatment comparisons and Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test for between treatment&#xD;
      comparisons based on a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. In addition, the estimate of Hodges and&#xD;
      Lehmann and the corresponding 95% non-parametric confidence interval will be shown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary efficacy endpoints derived from the hyperglycaemic clamp phase based on&#xD;
      incremental AUCs will be calculated as described for the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All AEs that will be entered into the CRF (all AEs since first dosing) will be coded. All AEs&#xD;
      will be presented by individual listings and frequency tables broken down by body system and&#xD;
      preferred terms as assigned by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activity, as&#xD;
      appropriate. Separate tables for serious adverse events, by severity, as well as by&#xD;
      relationship to trial medication, will be provided.&#xD;
