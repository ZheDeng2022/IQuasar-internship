    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects of stereotactic body radiation therapy and&#xD;
      pazopanib hydrochloride in treating patients with kidney cancer who are not able to undergo&#xD;
      surgery. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers&#xD;
      high doses of radiation directly to the tumor and may kill more tumor cells and cause less&#xD;
      damage to normal tissue. Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking an enzyme needed for cell growth. Giving pazopanib hydrochloride before stereotactic&#xD;
      body radiation therapy may help make the tumor smaller and be an alternative treatment for&#xD;
      patients who cannot undergo surgery.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the rate of treatment related toxicity reports following stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiation therapy (SBRT) and pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride) as a determination of the&#xD;
      tolerability of combined therapy in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the tumor diameter/volume change prior to and following pazopanib treatment&#xD;
      prior to SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the impact of pre SBRT pazopanib therapy on radiation therapy target volumes&#xD;
      for evidence of tumor shrinkage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate tumor change in radiation therapy target volumes and the incidence of&#xD;
      treatment related toxicity reports and sparing of non-involved nephron.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Report change in tumor control following pazopanib and SBRT as evaluated by post&#xD;
      treatment repeat biopsy and/or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) daily for up to 60 days. Patients then&#xD;
      continue to receive pazopanib hydrochloride PO daily and undergo SBRT every other day over&#xD;
      days 60-65.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is considered a poor surgical candidate for removal of a renal mass as&#xD;
             determined by pre-operative assessment due to the following factors or various&#xD;
             combinations thereof:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Significant comorbidity precluding ability to deliver anesthesia, without&#xD;
                  compromised ability to undergo systemic chemotherapy with pazopanib as deemed by&#xD;
                  the Urologist and Medical Oncologist&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Medically documented contraindication for surgery due to religion or risk of&#xD;
                  blood transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Size or location of tumor deemed high risk for surgical intervention by Urologist&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Unacceptable risk for anesthesia, such as history of malignant hyperthermia&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any one of these factors may or may not constitute unresectability, but for&#xD;
                  consideration for this trial, the surgical and medical oncologist must agree that&#xD;
                  the particular constellation of findings for the patient under consideration&#xD;
                  would likely entail a low probability (&lt; 50%) that the tumor would be resectable&#xD;
                  (with negative margins) or that the potential morbidity associated with an&#xD;
                  attempt at surgical resection would not be clinically acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The numerical thresholds noted above are only a guideline and the clinical&#xD;
                  judgment of the surgeon and medical oncologist will determine unresectability or&#xD;
                  if patient refuses surgery or other forms of local therapy; the histopathology&#xD;
                  for this cohort is limited to clear cell carcinoma of the kidney&#xD;
