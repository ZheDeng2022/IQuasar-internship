  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Donation after cardiac death (DCD) livers are increasingly utilised in liver transplantation&#xD;
      but concerns exist regarding negative results. Ischemic cholangiopathy (IC) is damage to one&#xD;
      or more bile ducts probably caused by inadequate blood flow or a failure of biliary&#xD;
      epithelium to regenerate. It typically presents weeks to months after liver transplantation,&#xD;
      is often refractory to treatment and can result in a requirement for re-transplantation.&#xD;
      Although IC is more common following DCD liver transplantation, it is otherwise very&#xD;
      difficult to predict and the underlying pathogenesis is poorly understood. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to correlate microRNA (miRNA) levels and markers of senescence in liver and bile&#xD;
      duct biopsies taken during liver transplantation with the incidence of IC following liver&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;

      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue from all deceased adult liver transplant grafts will be collected. The test samples&#xD;
      will be selected from procedures were the liver transplant recipient has developed IC. The&#xD;
      control samples will include tissues from procedures were the transplant recipient had an&#xD;
      uncomplicated outcome. There will be matching of test samples and control samples based on a&#xD;
      range of clinical factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard consent for organ donation documentation has a general consent to research section.&#xD;
      Due to the small risk of damage to blood vessels when taking samples the liver transplant&#xD;
      recipient will also be consented for these procedures to take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver and bile duct samples from each graft will be obtained at various different time points&#xD;
      during liver transplant procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Processing of specimens&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following removal of the specimens, samples will be divided then added to RNAlater (Life&#xD;
      Technologies, Paisley, UK), 10% formaldehyde or will be snap frozen. At a later time point&#xD;
      samples will be analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of ischemic cholangiopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
      IC will be defined as strictures, dilatations, or irregularities of the intra- or&#xD;
      extrahepatic bile ducts of the liver graft. Isolated strictures at the bile duct anastomosis&#xD;
      will be excluded. The diagnosis will be based on at least one adequate imaging study of the&#xD;
      biliary tree, after exclusion of hepatic artery thrombosis by Doppler ultrasound, computed&#xD;
      tomography or conventional angiography.&#xD;
