    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia is a common technique for providing anesthesia for knee joint replacement&#xD;
      surgery. The investigators wish to demonstrate that using a lower approach to spinal&#xD;
      anesthetic (Taylor's approach of L5-S1) causes less low blood pressure while still providing&#xD;
      adequate anesthesia for knee joint replacement surgery than a higher approach (L3-L4).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      1. Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
           To determine if Taylor's approach (paramedian, via L5-S1 interspace) to subarachnoid&#xD;
           blockade produces less hypotension than the more commonly used paramedian lumbar&#xD;
           approach (via L3-L4 interspace).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Taylor's approach to subarachnoid blockade for total knee joint arthroplasty will result&#xD;
           in less hypotension which requires treatment than a paramedian lumbar approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Justification&#xD;
&#xD;
           Taylor described a method of obtaining spinal anesthesia for urological procedures using&#xD;
           a paramedian approach to L5-S1. This interspace is large and tends to be less affected&#xD;
           by degenerative changes than the lumbar interspaces. Because of these attributes this&#xD;
           approach can be used as an alternative to either midline or paramedian approaches to the&#xD;
           lumbar vertebrae interspaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypotension is a frequent and important complication of spinal anesthesia. As the degree&#xD;
           of hypotension correlates with the height of blockade achieved, performing the dural&#xD;
           puncture at a lower interspace may result in less hypotension. Several previous studies&#xD;
           have compared the degree of hypotension resulting from a subarachnoid block performed&#xD;
           via different lumbar interspaces with conflicting results. However a direct comparison&#xD;
           of the lower Taylor's approach with a lumbar approach has not been investigated&#xD;
           previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Studies in the past used surface anatomy to determine the level of the lumbar&#xD;
           interspaces, which has since been shown to be inaccurate. A study comparing&#xD;
           identification of lumbar interspaces by palpation and with ultrasound showed that while&#xD;
           palpation was correct 30% of the time, correct identification was able to be achieved by&#xD;
           ultrasound 71% of the time. Similar rates of correct identification by ultrasound have&#xD;
           been shown in subsequent studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Using ultrasound in this study to identify the relevant Lumbosacral anatomy will enable&#xD;
           us to make a direct comparison between these two approaches to subarachnoid blockade&#xD;
           with rates of subsequent hypotension as well as ease of procedure and other side&#xD;
           effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           a) Primary: To compare the degree of hypotension requiring treatment between Taylor's&#xD;
           approach (L5-S1) and a paramedian lumbar approach (at L3-L4) to spinal anesthesia for&#xD;
           total knee joint arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary: For each approach to compare:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The ease of each technique assessed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The number of needle insertion attempts and number of needle passes (insertion and&#xD;
                redirection attempts) required to establish dural puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Procedure time including the time taken to establish landmarks with ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient acceptability&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient rated pain score immediately after procedure (0 - 10)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient rated satisfaction immediately after procedure (1 - 5) Success of central&#xD;
                neuraxial blockade&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The maximum block height achieved&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time from completion of administration of spinal to block height of L1 dermatome&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time from completion of administration of spinal to regression of block height to&#xD;
                L3 dermatome&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Amount of additional analgesia required during the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Research method&#xD;
&#xD;
      To fulfill our objectives the investigators plan to perform a randomized trial comparing the&#xD;
      two approaches to spinal anaesthesia on patients undergoing primary total knee joint&#xD;
      arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
           Eligible patients presenting for primary knee arthroplasty surgery at University of&#xD;
           British Columbia Hospital will be identified by anesthesiologists at the anesthesia&#xD;
           pre-assessment clinic before the day of their surgery. At this stage they will be&#xD;
           informed of the study and given an information leaflet to read.&#xD;
&#xD;
           On the day of the surgery a member of the research team will approach the eligible&#xD;
           patient and inform the patient again about the option of participating in the study,&#xD;
           what each treatment group entails and answer any questions that the patient may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the patient is interested in participating in the study they will be asked to sign a&#xD;
           consent form and informed that they may withdraw from the study at any time without any&#xD;
           consequence. There will be no monetary or material compensation to participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion criteria are male and female volunteers who are over the age of 19 and are&#xD;
           able to understand the study protocol and give their informed consent. They need to be&#xD;
           presenting for elective primary total knee joint arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia&#xD;
           and be American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) class 1, 2 or 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion criteria are patients who are ASA 4 or 5, unable to understand the study&#xD;
           protocol or give informed consent. Patients who have elected not to have or are deemed&#xD;
           clinically inappropriate for spinal anesthesia will be excluded as well as patients who&#xD;
           are presenting for a revision of a knee joint arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prior to the procedure, for each participating patient, a sealed unmarked opaque&#xD;
           envelope that contains one of the two treatment groups will be opened. Patients will&#xD;
           receive their spinal anaesthetic either via a paramedian lumbar approach or Taylor's&#xD;
           approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
           For both treatment groups the patients will have the usual preparation for spinal&#xD;
           anesthesia, which involves an intravenous line with intravenous fluids running, standard&#xD;
           monitoring, and being appropriately positioned on the operating table. The patient will&#xD;
           receive premedication of 0.02 - 0.05mg/kg of midazolam. The blood pressure obtained in&#xD;
           the anesthesia pre-assessment clinic or in the preoperative area will be taken as the&#xD;
           patient baseline blood pressure. An experienced anesthesiologist will then perform an&#xD;
           ultrasound scan on the patient with a low-frequency (2 - 5 MHz) curved-array probe,&#xD;
           identifying the relevant anatomy, prior to performing the spinal anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Taylor's approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients randomised to the Taylor's approach group will first have the sacrum identified&#xD;
           with the ultrasound probe in a transverse position in the patients' midline. The&#xD;
           transducer will then be rotated 90 degrees into the paramedian axis and the L5 - S1&#xD;
           interspace identified. The position of the transducer will be adjusted to obtain the&#xD;
           best image of the interspace with it centred on the ultrasound screen. A marking pen&#xD;
           will then be used to mark the midpoints of the probe's long and short edges. The point&#xD;
           where these marks would intersect will be used as the initial needle insertion point for&#xD;
           spinal anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The lumbosacral area will then be prepared in a sterile manner and with appropriate&#xD;
           sterile technique spinal anaesthesia will be performed with a 25-gauge, 90 mm,&#xD;
           pencil-point needle inserted through a 20-gauge introducer needle. Once dural puncture&#xD;
           has been achieved and cerebral spinal fluid is obtained in the hub of the spinal needle&#xD;
           12.5 mg of 0.5% bupivacaine (preservative free) will be injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Paramedian lumbar approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients randomised to the Paramedian lumbar approach group will be scanned in a similar&#xD;
           manner to the Taylor's approach group. The sacrum will be identified first, then with&#xD;
           the transducer in the paramedian axis the interspaces will be identified and counted up&#xD;
           from L5 - S1 to L3 - L4. At the L3 - L4 interspace the image will be optimised and the&#xD;
           skin marked as described above. Spinal anesthesia will then proceed in an identical&#xD;
           manner with the same dose of bupivacaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After spinal anaesthesia is performed in both groups the patient will remain in the&#xD;
           sitting position for 5 minutes and then will be positioned supine for surgery. The&#xD;
           patient will have their blood pressure and heart rate measured at 5 minute intervals (or&#xD;
           more regularly at the discretion of the anesthesiologist). If a decrease of mean&#xD;
           arterial blood pressure occurs, which is greater than 20% from the patients'&#xD;
           pre-recorded baseline, or if there is a decrease in heart rate to less than 50 bpm then&#xD;
           5 to 10mg increments of ephedrine will be administered. Sensory block will be assessed&#xD;
           by bilateral application of ice at 5 minute intervals. Intravenous fentanyl in 25 - 50&#xD;
           mcg increments will be administered if the patient complains of any pain during the&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patient's age, height and weight will be recorded, also any significant past medical&#xD;
           problems, in particular if the patient has a history of hypertension. Baseline&#xD;
           observations including blood pressure will be taken from the anesthetic assessment&#xD;
           clinic visit prior to the day of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An independent observer will record the time taken to establish landmarks with&#xD;
           ultrasound imaging and the time taken to complete the spinal anesthesia. The number of&#xD;
           needle insertions and redirections required to achieve dural puncture will also be&#xD;
           recorded (as previously defined by Chin et al.). Immediately after the spinal&#xD;
           anaesthesia has been administered, the patient will be asked by the observer to rate the&#xD;
           pain they experienced during the procedure (from 0 - 10) and their satisfaction with the&#xD;
           procedure (from 1 - 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The sensory block height will be measured and recorded at 5 minute intervals. The number&#xD;
           of 5 minute increments where the mean arterial blood pressure is measured as being&#xD;
           greater than 20% below baseline will be collected as well as the amount of ephedrine&#xD;
           required to treat each patient. The amount of intravenous fluid given during the&#xD;
           procedure will be recorded. Other details related to the surgery will also be collected&#xD;
           including time of first incision, tourniquet inflation and deflation times, estimated&#xD;
           total blood loss and time of surgical completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Any additional analgesia requirements during the procedure will be recorded as well as&#xD;
           any other unexpected complications, including the need to convert to a general&#xD;
           anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the procedure the block height will be measured and recorded in 15 minute&#xD;
           intervals until the block height has regressed to L3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation is based on the primary outcome of a reduction in hypotension. From&#xD;
      clinical experience and a previous study by Carpenter et al. the investigators anticipate a&#xD;
      35 - 40% reduction in the incidence of hypotension in the Taylor's approach group. Based on a&#xD;
      p-value of &lt; 0.05 the sample size calculation is 12 patients in each group. The investigators&#xD;
      will aim to recruit 15 patients in each group.&#xD;
