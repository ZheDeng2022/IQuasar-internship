    <textblock>
      This study will utilize two validated tools for assessing child development and behavior, to&#xD;
      investigate the outcomes for children born preterm compared with those born at full term. Two&#xD;
      hundred children born or cared for during the neonatal period at Mount Sinai Hospital will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Parents will be asked to complete a behavioral assessment questionnaire, and which&#xD;
      will assess development in an examination administered by a trained occupational therapist at&#xD;
      Mount Sinai Hospital.&#xD;

      This research will be completed at Mount Sinai Hospital. All participants will be identified&#xD;
      from Mount Sinai Hospital records of infants born at MSH and/or cared for in the Mount Sinai&#xD;
      NICU on or after January 1, 2011, at full term or preterm. The study team will contact the&#xD;
      parents of eligible potential participants by telephone to explain the study and ask if the&#xD;
      parent will consent to their child's participation. If the parent agrees, we will make an&#xD;
      appointment for the child to come to Mount Sinai for the evaluation using the Bayley-III. The&#xD;
      parents will be mailed the study consent form, a fact sheet with information about the study,&#xD;
      and the CBCL to complete before they bring their child to their appointment. Mount Sinai&#xD;
      records from the birth hospitalization will be reviewed for the birth history and medical&#xD;
      comorbidities. Mount Sinai medical records of the mother's obstetric care will also be&#xD;
      accessed to obtain medical history from the pregnancy. If a participating child has received&#xD;
      outpatient care at Mount Sinai, the investigators will access their record in Epic to obtain&#xD;
      scores from previous developmental assessments and records of medical comorbidities. If they&#xD;
      have not attended the Mount Sinai clinic, but have received outpatient care elsewhere, the&#xD;
      parents will be asked to provide contact information for their pediatrician, and for&#xD;
      permission to obtain their child's records.&#xD;
