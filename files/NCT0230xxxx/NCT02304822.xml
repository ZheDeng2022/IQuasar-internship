    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the postoperative systemic inflammatory response&#xD;
      syndrome (SIRS) rates undergoing retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) after multiple-,&#xD;
      single-, zero-dose of ceftriaxone prophylaxis in a prospective randomized trail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll 450 patients who are candidates for RIRS in the investigators&#xD;
      study. By simple random sampling technique, patients will be assigned to three groups&#xD;
      (multiple-, single-, zero-dose of ceftriaxone prophylaxis,respectively). In addition to the&#xD;
      difference of usage of ciprofloxacin prophylaxis, the rest of the procedure is the same in&#xD;
      all three groups.The end point of the study is the comparison of outcome of procedure&#xD;
      including SIRS rate, stone free rate (SFR), operation time, length of stay,and hematuresis.&#xD;

      PURPOSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare multiple-, single-, zero-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for retrograde intrarenal&#xD;
      surgery (RIRS) and detect the ideal regimen to prevent systemic inflammatory response&#xD;
      syndrome (SIRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An α error of 5% and a power of 80% were assumed to detect a 14.9% difference in rates of&#xD;
      postoperative SIRS (5.1% for the antibiotic prophylaxis group and 20% for the control group)&#xD;
      based on the historical data. According to sample size calculation formula for comparing&#xD;
      rates between multiple independent samples, n=2λ/(2sin-1√Pmax-2sin-1√Pmin)2,the minimum&#xD;
      sample sizes to detect statistically significant differences were estimated to be 86 patients&#xD;
      for each of the study groups. To account for patients lost to follow-up and study&#xD;
      withdrawals, this number was increased to 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After finishing the cases mentioned above, we find the difference in rates of postoperative&#xD;
      SIRS in our center is 7.9% (1.2% for the antibiotic prophylaxis group and 9.1% for the&#xD;
      control group). According to sample size calculation formula, the minimum sample sizes were&#xD;
      estimated to be 124, additional 38 patients are required to be added to each group. For the&#xD;
      accuracy and availability of the trial, we decided to enlarge the sample size.To account for&#xD;
      patients lost to follow-up and study withdrawals, this number was increased to 150.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, the patients were assessed for eligibility. To allocate the&#xD;
      patients, a computer-generated list of random numbers was used. The patients were randomly&#xD;
      allocated into three groups by using a randomization ratio of 1:1:1 (group 1, multiple-dose&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotic of 200mg intravenous ciprofloxacin, 30 minutes before surgery and&#xD;
      within 12 hours after surgery additionally; group 2, single-dose prophylactic antibiotic of&#xD;
      200mg intravenous ciprofloxacin, 30 minutes before surgery; group 3,zero-dose of prophylactic&#xD;
      antibiotic). All patients were operated under intrathecal general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All operations were performed by one experienced surgeon (Guohua Zeng). The surgeon was&#xD;
      blinded to group assignment. The postoperative clinical assessment was performed by&#xD;
      investigators who had not been involved and were also blind of the group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative routine physical examination was performed in all patients. White blood count,&#xD;
      blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, liver function test, urinalysis, and urine culture were&#xD;
      investigated. Before surgery, stone size and location were determined by choosing at least&#xD;
      one of following imaging methods: intravenous pyelography (IVP), kidney, ureter, and bladder&#xD;
      (KUB),or unenhanced CT. Inclusion Criteria and exclusion Criteria were shown in the part of&#xD;
      &quot;eligibility Criteria&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All equipment used during operation was chosen from the same brand, and standard&#xD;
      sterilization procedures were applied. In this study, the investigators used SIRS criteria&#xD;
      defined by the committee for consensus on the definition of sepsis, in order to define&#xD;
      postoperative fever in a better way. Patients were followed postoperatively according to SIRS&#xD;
      criteria: white blood count &lt; 4000 or &gt;12000 cells/mm3, heart rate &gt;90 beats per minute,&#xD;
      temperature &lt;36°C or &gt;38°C, respiratory rate &gt; 20 breaths/min. Presence of two or more of&#xD;
      these criteria was accepted as SIRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RIRS technique :All the endourological procedures in the present study were performed in a&#xD;
      standard suite, and a sterile technique was strictly practiced and maintained in all cases.&#xD;
      All RIRS procedures were performed under general anesthesia in a low lithotomy position.&#xD;
      Ureteroscopy was performed with a semi-rigid 8/9.8Fr ureteroscope (Richard Wolf, Germany),&#xD;
      and a flexible 0.035-inch guide wire was inserted into the renal collecting system.A 12/14 Fr&#xD;
      ureteral access sheath (Cook Urological, USA) was inserted into the proximal ureter along the&#xD;
      guide wire under fluo guiadnce. The Olympus URF-P5 flexible ureteroscope was then advanced&#xD;
      via the ureteral access sheath. Irrigation was delivered by manual injection with a 50-mL&#xD;
      syringe to achieve a relatively uniform perfusion pressure. Stones were identified and&#xD;
      fragmented by holmium: YAG laser lithotripsy. Stone fragments were picked out by the stone&#xD;
      basket. Tiny dust and residual fragments &lt; 2 mm were left in place for spontaneous passage. A&#xD;
      pigtail 6 Fr Double-J stent was routinely placed at the end of the procedure. The operative&#xD;
      time was defined as the time from insertion of an endoscope into the urethra to the&#xD;
      completion of stent placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data for the three groups -age, sex, body mass index, laterality of the stone ( left or&#xD;
      right), stone surface, stone type (single or multiple), preoperative serum creatinine level,&#xD;
      history of hypertension,history of previous surgery, grade of hydronephrosis, operation time,&#xD;
      irrigation volume, postoperative serum creatinine level, hemoglobin decrease, duration of&#xD;
      hospital stay, initial stone free rate (SFR), final SFR at 1 month, SIRS and hematuresis&#xD;
      (modified Clavine system) were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stone surface area was measured using computerized systems either on KUB or CT scans.&#xD;
      Hospital stay was calculated from operation to discharge from hospital. The operative time&#xD;
      was defined as the time from insertion of an endoscope into the urethra to the completion of&#xD;
      stent placement. Postoperative SIRS was confirmed by the follow-up 4 weeks after the&#xD;
      operation. Stone analysis was performed using infrared spectroscopy. Stone composition was&#xD;
      classified according to the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines 2015. The JJ&#xD;
      stent was removed as an outpatient procedure at 2~4 weeks postoperatively. Postoperative&#xD;
      follow-up with a KUB and ultrasound was scheduled at the same time. No observed fragments or&#xD;
      fragments smaller than 2 mm was classified as stone free. Complications of all patients were&#xD;
      recorded according to the modified Clavien classification system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints of the study were postoperative SIRS. Secondary endpoints included SFR,&#xD;
      operative time, hemoglobin drop and hematuresis.&#xD;
