    <description>Conjunctival Inflammation was assessed by a trained technician post-conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) on a 0 to 4 scale (0 = best [least inflammation] and 4 = worst [most inflammation]).&#xD;
The Conjunctival Inflammation was averaged across all Lastacaft-treated eyes to create the average Lastacaft eye Conjunctival Inflammation score, and the Conjunctival Inflammation score was averaged across all Tears Naturale-treated eyes to create the average Tears Naturale eye Conjunctival Inflammation score.</description>

The ocular itching score was averaged across all Lastacaft-treated eyes to create the average Lastacaft eye ocular itching score, and the ocular itching score was averaged across all Tears Naturale-treated eyes to create the average Tears Naturale eye ocular itching score.</description>

        <title>Conjunctival Inflammation at 1 Hour (+30 Minutes) Post CAC on Day 1</title>
        <description>Conjunctival Inflammation was assessed by a trained technician post-conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) on a 0 to 4 scale (0 = best [least inflammation] and 4 = worst [most inflammation]).&#xD;
The Conjunctival Inflammation was averaged across all Lastacaft-treated eyes to create the average Lastacaft eye Conjunctival Inflammation score, and the Conjunctival Inflammation score was averaged across all Tears Naturale-treated eyes to create the average Tears Naturale eye Conjunctival Inflammation score.</description>
