  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maternal immunization with tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis&#xD;
      vaccine (Tdap) is a potential strategy to protect young infants against pertussis before they&#xD;
      are fully vaccinated because maternal antibodies may cross the placenta and passively protect&#xD;
      her infant. The proposed study is a randomized, blinded, controlled, vaccine trial of&#xD;
      maternal Tdap vaccination during the third trimester of pregnancy (Tdap vaccination at 27-36&#xD;
      weeks gestation). Pregnant women will be recruited from the prenatal care clinics at the&#xD;
      Hospital Nacional Occidente and the Health Centers in Quetzaltenango, La Esperanza, San Juan&#xD;
      Ostuncalco and Concepción Chiquirichapa. Enrolled women and their infants will be followed up&#xD;
      until 7 months post-partum.&#xD;

      The proposed study is a randomized, blinded, controlled, vaccine trial of maternal Tdap&#xD;
      vaccination during the third trimester of pregnancy (Tdap vaccination at 27-36 weeks&#xD;
      gestation). Pregnant women will be recruited from the prenatal care clinics at the Hospital&#xD;
      Nacional de Occidente and the Health Centers in Quetzaltenango, La Esperanza, San Juan&#xD;
      Ostuncalco and Concepción Chiquirichapa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All healthy pregnant women between the ages of 18 and 40 years (inclusive) at 27 weeks&#xD;
      gestation or later who are in the study areas will be eligible to participate in this study&#xD;
      unless they meet one or more of the exclusion criteria. Pregnant women at &lt;27 weeks gestation&#xD;
      will be pre-screened and provided information about the study to encourage them to enroll&#xD;
      later in their pregnancy. Women who are eligible will be enrolled after obtaining informed&#xD;
      consent, and then they will be randomized to receive Tdap vaccine or Td vaccine. Enrolled&#xD;
      women and their infants will be followed up until 7 months postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the primary objective, serum specimens will be collected from mothers prior to&#xD;
      receiving the study product (Tdap or Td), within 72 hours after delivery and at 7 months&#xD;
      post-partum. Moreover, infants specimens will be collected at delivery (cord blood or infant&#xD;
      blood within 72 hours of birth), at 2 months of age (prior to the first dose of the routine&#xD;
      childhood DTwP series), and at 7 months of age (approximately 4 weeks after the third dose of&#xD;
      the routine DTwP series).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants will be given all three doses of the pentavalent vaccine which includes DTwP vaccine&#xD;
      at 2, 4 and 6 months (routine childhood immunizations) as recommended by the immunization&#xD;
      schedule of Guatemala's National Immunization Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events and serious adverse events will also be monitored.&#xD;
