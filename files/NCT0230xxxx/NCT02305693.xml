    <textblock>
      140 women with clomiphene resistant PCOS will be randomly divided into 2 equal groups using&#xD;
      computer generated random numbers. Group 1 will receive Letrozole, group 2 will have&#xD;
      laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in reproductive age,&#xD;
      with an incidence of 5 -10%. Classically clomiphene citrate (CC) is the first approach to&#xD;
      induce ovulation in patients with PCOS. Although 70-80% of PCOS women can ovulate by the&#xD;
      treatment with CC, only 40%of the PCOS women become pregnant. Women who do not ovulate with&#xD;
      increasing doses of CC are described as being CC-resistant and remain a major challenge in&#xD;
      gynecologic endocrinology. Traditional alternatives for CC-resistant patients include&#xD;
      gonadotropin therapy and laparoscopic ovarian diathermy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Letrozole is an orally-active aromatase inhibitor, with good potential for ovulation&#xD;
      induction. Letrozole acts by reducing estrogen production by blocking androgens to estrogens&#xD;
      conversion. Additionally, it has no adverse effect on endometrium and cervical mucus (4).&#xD;
      This releases the pituitary from negative feedback of estrogens and releases FSH. Also, an&#xD;
      added positive effect is increased follicular sensitivity to FSH through amplification of FSH&#xD;
      receptor gene expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) can avoid or reduce the need for gonadotropins for&#xD;
      ovulation induction. Several potential mechanisms of action of LOD have also been suggested.&#xD;
      The reduction of inhibin production following LOD is followed by an increase in FSH secretion&#xD;
      and recruitment of a new cohort of follicles. Other theory is restoration of normal&#xD;
      production of the putative gonadotropin surge after laparoscopic ovarian electrocautery.&#xD;
      Moreover, drainage of androgens and inhibin from follicles surface may inhibit the excessive&#xD;
      collagenisation of overlying ovarian cortex and facilitate Softening of ovarian tunica.&#xD;
      Neighbouring follicles that are not undergoing atresia may then mature and gain access to the&#xD;
      ovarian surface, facilitating ovulation. Initiation of normal inhibin B pulsatility by LOD&#xD;
      appears to correlate with the postoperative onset of ovulatory cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main drawbacks of LOD are adhesions formation and ovarian atrophy. That is why minimising&#xD;
      the number of diathermy points and avoiding diathermy near the ovarian hilum are recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women with clomiphene resistant PCOS attending the subfertility clinic of Cairo&#xD;
      university hospitals will be invited to participate in the study. PCOS diagnosis will be&#xD;
      based on chronic anovulation and sonographic picture of polycystic ovaries. Clomiphene&#xD;
      resistance will be defined as failure of ovulation in spite of receiving 150mg of clomiphene&#xD;
      citrate for 5 days starting from the 3rd-5th day of the menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are age &gt;40 years, other causes of infertility, hyperprolactinaemia,&#xD;
      previous Letrozole or LOD therapy, and body mass index (BMI)&gt;35.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be explained to all the participants and a written informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained before participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full history will be taken followed by complete examination and sonographic evaluation.&#xD;
      Sonographic picture of polycystic ovaries will be defined when there are at least 12&#xD;
      follicles 2-9mm in the ovary and/or ovarian volume&gt;10cm3 140 women with clomiphene resistant&#xD;
      PCOS will be randomly divided into 3 equal groups using computer generated random numbers.&#xD;
      Group 1 will receive Letrozole, group 2 will have LOD and group 3 will act as the control&#xD;
      group with no intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will receive Letrozole (Femara®, Novartis, Switzerland) 2.5mg twice daily for 5 days&#xD;
      starting from the 3rd day of menstruation or progesterone withdrawal bleeding. Group 2 will&#xD;
      have LOD in which the ovaries will be stabilised by grasping the ovarian ligament and&#xD;
      monopolar diathermy will be used to do 4-10 punctures in each ovary. The number of punctures&#xD;
      will be individualised according to the size of the ovary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial vaginal ultrasound scans were done starting from the 10th day of menstruation, the&#xD;
      frequency of monitoring will be individualized according to the women's response. When the&#xD;
      dominant follicle reaches 17mm or more women will receive Human chorionic gonadotrophin&#xD;
      (Choriomon® IBSA, Switzerland) 5000IU and a timed intercourse will be advised 36 hours later.&#xD;
