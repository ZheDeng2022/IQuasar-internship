  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is current evidence that suggests eating cruciferous vegetables like broccoli,&#xD;
      cauliflower, cabbage is beneficial to our health as they contain compounds which are thought&#xD;
      to reduce the risk of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Cruciferous&#xD;
      vegetables are able to deliver in our body a group of compounds called isothiocyanates (ITCs)&#xD;
      that are thought to be responsible of their health-promoting effects. Sulforaphane (SF) from&#xD;
      broccoli is one of the most studied ITCs and its anticancer properties have been extensively&#xD;
      investigated in in vitro and in vivo models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to undertake an intervention study to measure the bioavailability&#xD;
      of SF from the soups used in another intervention study called ESCAPE. The investigators&#xD;
      would like to investigate the rate and extent to which SF reaches the systemic circulation&#xD;
      and is excreted in urine by measuring SF and its metabolites in plasma and urine samples&#xD;
      collected from apparently healthy participants after consumption of the three types of&#xD;
      broccoli + stilton soups. The three types of soups are standard broccoli + stilton soups and&#xD;
      two high-glucoraphanin (SF precursor) broccoli + stilton soups which are able to deliver&#xD;
      different levels of SF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been funded by Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)&#xD;
      and Prostate Cancer foundation (PCF).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized, double-blinded, three-phase crossover trial which will&#xD;
      investigate the bioavailability of SF following consumption of broccoli + stilton soup&#xD;
      containing different concentrations of glucoraphanin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of non-smoking men and women aged between 18 and 65 years&#xD;
      old. Participants will undergo three phases separated by a minimum of two weeks (wash-out&#xD;
      period). Each phase will consist of a 48 hour pre-intervention diet restriction, a study day&#xD;
      involving an 8 hour cannulation at the Human Nutrition Unit (HNU) of the Institute of Food&#xD;
      Research (IFR) and collection of a 24 hour urine and blood sample the following morning.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated to one of the three soups in each phase. The&#xD;
      following soups will be tested in the three phases: i) 300g standard broccoli + stilton soup,&#xD;
      ii) 300g Beneforte® broccoli + stilton soup, iii) 300g Beneforte Extra broccoli + stilton&#xD;
      soup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beneforte and Beneforte extra broccoli are especially cultivated to deliver high sulforaphane&#xD;
      levels after consumption. All the three broccoli varieties have the same appearance and&#xD;
      flavour thus enabling a blinded human intervention study to be undertaken. Broccoli soups&#xD;
      will be manufactured by a food company that supplies soups to the leading supermarket&#xD;
      retailers in the United Kingdom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each phase will consist of a 48 hour pre-intervention diet restriction, a study day (study&#xD;
      day 1) comprising of approximately a nine hour stay at the HNU which will involve&#xD;
      cannulation. The following morning participants will visit the HNU for up to 1 hour for&#xD;
      collection of a single blood sample at 24 hour post-dose followed by breakfast. During study&#xD;
      day 1, eleven 10ml blood samples will be collected over the course of the day from&#xD;
      participants at the following timepoints: 0, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 360, 480 mins and&#xD;
      a 24 hour blood sample. Six urine samples will be collected at the following timepoints: 0,&#xD;
      0-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three phases will be separated by a minimum of a two week washout period. For the&#xD;
      duration of the study, participants will be required to follow a glucosinolate-free diet for&#xD;
      a total of nine days which will be three days per phase. The three days are split into 48&#xD;
      hours (2 days) prior to the study day, 24 hours (1 day) on the study day as well as the&#xD;
      following morning until the 24 hour blood and urine sample have been collected. After the 24&#xD;
      hour urine and blood samples have been collected, participants can resume their normal diet&#xD;
      for a minimum of two weeks until 48 hours prior to their next study day. This will reduce the&#xD;
      contribution of glucosinolate from other foods having an impact on the results of the study.&#xD;
      The involvement of the participants will last approximately 11-12 weeks.&#xD;
