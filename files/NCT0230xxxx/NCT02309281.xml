      Title: Intravitreal aflibercept (VEGF Trap-Eye) in neovascular age-related macular&#xD;
      degeneration with limited response to ranibizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: The purpose of this investigator initiated study is to identify the duration of&#xD;
      treatment effects of intravitreal aflibercept on sub- and intraretinal fluid and best&#xD;
      corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in choroidal neovascularizations (CNV) due to age-related&#xD;
      macular degeneration (AMD) in which the Optical coherence tomography (OCT) guided treatment&#xD;
      interval failed to be extended to 6 weeks intervals in a treat and extend regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective is to evaluate the mean maximum recurrence-free treatment&#xD;
      interval (Imax in weeks) with aflibercept treatment during the 24 months study peroid (for&#xD;
      explanation see section Objectives). The individual maximum recurrence-free treatment&#xD;
      interval (in weeks) at 24 weeks is defined as the maximum extension interval which is reached&#xD;
      during the study follow-up period without showing any CNV activity (any intra-or subretinal&#xD;
      fluid at OCT or new retinal hemorrhage). This measure reflects the duration of aflibercept&#xD;
      effect in these lesions with limited response to ranibizumab. Key secondary Outcome Measures&#xD;
      are mean changes in BCVA score at 24 weeks from baseline (Δ BCVAscore), mean changes in CRT&#xD;
      (µm) at 24 weeks from baseline (Δ CRT), mean number of treatments needed during the 24 weeks&#xD;
      study follow-up, number of participants with adverse events and serious adverse events (for&#xD;
      further outcome measures see section Objectives).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: This outpatient study population will consist of a representative group of 33&#xD;
      male and female patients ≥ 50 years of age. The study population will include patients with&#xD;
      subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD and being pre-treated with intravitreal ranibizumab in a treat&#xD;
      and extend regimen and failed to be extended to 6-weeks intervals without showing CNV&#xD;
      activity (for further information see section Criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: 1-arm interventional study with 2mg aflibercept intravitreally up to 4-weekly.&#xD;
      The first treatment interval with aflibercept will be 4 weeks and corresponding to the treat&#xD;
      and extend regime intervals will be increased in 2-weeks-steps as long as no CNV activity&#xD;
      (any intra-or subretinal fluid at OCT or new retinal hemorrhage) occurs. In case of occuring&#xD;
      CNV activity the interval is shortened by 4 weeks with a minimum treatment interval of 4&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

      Title of study: Intravitreal aflibercept (VEGF Trap-Eye) in neovascular age-related macular&#xD;
      degeneration with limited response to ranibizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study purpose: The purpose of this investigator initiated study is to identify the duration&#xD;
      of treatment effects of intravitreal aflibercept (VEGF Trap-Eye) on sub- and intraretinal&#xD;
      fluid and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in choroidal neovascularizations (CNV) due to&#xD;
      age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in which the Optical coherence tomography (OCT) guided&#xD;
      treatment interval failed to be extended to 6 weeks intervals in a treat and extend regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective is to evaluate the mean maximum recurrence-free treatment&#xD;
      interval (Imax in weeks) with intravitreal aflibercept treatment in an OCT- and fundus&#xD;
      examination- guided treat and extend regimen within a 24 weeks study period. The individual&#xD;
      maximum recurrence-free treatment interval (in weeks) at 24 weeks is defined as the maximum&#xD;
      extension interval which is reached during the study follow-up period without showing any CNV&#xD;
      activity (any intra-or subretinal fluid at OCT or new retinal hemorrhage). This measure&#xD;
      reflects the duration of aflibercept effect in these lesions with limited response to&#xD;
      ranibizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  change of quality of life scores (VFQ-25, EQ 5D) from baseline to 24 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>All eligible patients have to show a maximum treatment interval with ranibizumab (pre-study period) of 4 weeks (failed to be extended to 6 weeks, see Inclusion criteria), meaning that the mean maximum treatment interval at baseline is 4 weeks. During the study the treatment intervals with aflibercept will be increased in 2-weeks steps corresponding to the treat and extend regime (see Study design). The individual maximum recurrence-free treatment interval (in weeks) at 24 weeks is defined as the maximum extension interval which is reached during the study follow-up period without showing any CNV activity (any intra-or subretinal fluid at OCT or new retinal hemorrhage). This measure reflects the duration of aflibercept effect in these lesions with limited response to ranibizumab.</description>

          -  Use of other investigational drugs at the time of baseline, or within 30 days or 5&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Previous violation of the posterior capsule in the study eye unless as a result of YAG&#xD;
             posterior capsulotomy in association with prior, posterior chamber intraocular lens&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, examination finding, or clinical&#xD;
             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease/condition that&#xD;
             contraindicates the use an investigational drug or that might affect interpretation of&#xD;

             complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women. Pregnancy is defined as the state after&#xD;
