  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RO6870810 (formerly TEN-010) is a small molecule, bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET)&#xD;
      bromodomain inhibitor. This study is designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of RO6870810 monotherapy in participants with relapsed/refractory acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia (RR-AML) and hypomethylating agent (HMA)-refractory myelodysplastic syndrome&#xD;
      (MDS). The study will consist of a Screening Period, Treatment Period, and Post-Treatment&#xD;
      Period. A standard 3+3 design will be used in which successive cohorts of three or more&#xD;
      participants with RR-AML or HMA-refractory MDS will be treated at escalating doses until a&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is identiÔ¨Åed. Up to 51 adult participants with AML or MDS will&#xD;
      be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
