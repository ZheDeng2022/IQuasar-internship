  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to evaluate the efficiency of capsule endoscopy (CCE) in in the detection&#xD;
      of neoplasms compared to conventional colonoscopy in persons participating in the Danish&#xD;
      screening program for colorectal cancer with a positive fecal occult blood with the&#xD;
      colonoscopy being the gold standard.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited from the screening program, and are living on the main island&#xD;
      of Funen. Persons with a positive FOBT who have been offered and have accepted a colonoscopy&#xD;
      will be contacted by telephone and informed about the project by the project nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The persons who accept participation and meet the inclusion criteria will be contacted by the&#xD;
      study nurse for scheduling the capsule endoscopy according to the planned colonoscopy, which&#xD;
      has to bee within 9-13 days after the result of the FOBT test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nurse will instruct the person to take the standard colon preparation 2 days before the&#xD;
      colonoscopy, and stay from solid food until after the colonoscopy has been performed&#xD;
      according to standard procedure. Thus the period with food-restrictions has to be extended by&#xD;
      one day. A visit by the home services nurse the day before the colonoscopy will be arranged.&#xD;
      The nurse will assist and supervise the intake of the video capsule and assists with the&#xD;
      attachment of the monitor in a belt around the person's belly. Afterwards the questionnaire 1&#xD;
      (appendix 1) will be fulfilled by the patient with assistance from the nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the capsule has passed anus the monitoring equipment must be disarmed by the patient and&#xD;
      stored according to the instructions. The patient will bring the recorder to the hospital the&#xD;
      following day and deliver it to the study nurse, who will take care of data-transmission to&#xD;
      the institute in Hamburg. After the colonoscopy and recovery period, the patient and the&#xD;
      project nurse will fulfill the 2. questionnaire (appendix 2) and the colonoscopist will&#xD;
      fulfill a standard report on the findings and treatment at colonoscopy (appendix 3), which&#xD;
      will be added to the electronic database by the project secretary. The results form the&#xD;
      colonoscopy will be the only information, that will be retrieved form the patients record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trained specialists in the Diagnostic Centre in Hamburg will perform the evaluation of the&#xD;
      CCE and the data will be entered in a standard diagnostic report (appendix 4). The Diagnostic&#xD;
      Centre will not have access to the results of the colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CCE report must be available within 3 days, and the project responsible will evaluate the&#xD;
      result according to the reported findings at colonoscopy. Any disagreement will be evaluated&#xD;
      and discussed with the patient. In case of significant disagreement defined as a neoplasms of&#xD;
      &gt; 9 mm found at CCE and not detected by colonoscopy the patient will be offered additional&#xD;
      diagnostics in the form of repeated colonoscopy within 2 weeks or a CT colonography upon the&#xD;
      decision by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have to stay on a fluid diet for one day more than for the conventional&#xD;
      investigation. This might be uncomfortable for some patients, but is without any&#xD;
      health-related risk. Another side effect could be increased fecal content in the bowel at&#xD;
      colonoscopy due to the extended time from bowel preparation to colonoscopy. In some cases&#xD;
      this could result in an incomplete colonscopy, which then has to be repeated. The risk of&#xD;
      this side effect is unknown but is considered to be below 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most significant complication to the CCE will be the risk of impaction of the capsule&#xD;
      within the intestine, which may lead to surgery. The risk is minimized by the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria and according to daily clinical experience the risk will be less than 0.5%, and will&#xD;
      mainly occur in persons with an unknown intestinal pathology, which in the majority of the&#xD;
      cases would necessitate surgical treatment anyway. There is no known risk with the monitoring&#xD;
      equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of significant disagreement between the results form capsule endoscopy and the&#xD;
      conventional colonoscopy the patient may risk further investigations, but on the other hand&#xD;
      this could be an advantage for the patients in case of missed lesions at the colonoscopy. The&#xD;
      risk of missing cancer or large polyps by colonoscopy is in the range of 1-2%.&#xD;
