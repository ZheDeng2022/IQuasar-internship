    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety of single doses and multiple doses of a new&#xD;
      formulation of RPL554 in healthy subjects and subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study of a new suspension formulation&#xD;
      of RPL554 comprising a Single Ascending Dose (SAD) phase (Part A) in healthy subjects, a&#xD;
      Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) phase (Part B) in healthy subjects and a MAD phase (Part C) in&#xD;
      stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) subjects. Each cohort should comprise 10&#xD;
      subjects in a 7 active: 3 placebo ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened in the 14 days before the first dose of study drug and have an end&#xD;
      of study visit 4 to 10 days after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A. Single Ascending Dose Study in Healthy Male Subjects aged 18-50. Each subject will&#xD;
      receive a single dose of study drug. The starting dose will be 1.5 mg with planned escalation&#xD;
      as 2 fold multiples unless the safety data indicates the escalation should be at smaller&#xD;
      intervals. If RPL554 is not well tolerated at a particular dose level, the dose may be&#xD;
      reduced for the next cohort.The decision on whether or not to escalate to each new dose&#xD;
      level, and the dose, will be based on a formal review by the Dose Review Group (DRG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B. Multiple Ascending Dose Study in Healthy Male Subjects aged 18-50. The starting dose&#xD;
      for Part B will be determined from the data in Part A of the study. Each subject will receive&#xD;
      the following doses of study drug and will be confined to the study centre during dosing:&#xD;
      three doses at intervals of 8 hours on Days 1 to 5, followed by a single morning dose on Day&#xD;
      6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DRG may determine on the basis of safety or PK data that the dosing interval for&#xD;
      subsequent cohorts will be every 12 hours, rather than every 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C. Multiple Ascending Dose in moderate, stable COPD Subjects aged 40-75 Subjects will&#xD;
      have no known significant concurrent diseases, will not have had a recent exacerbation, and&#xD;
      will be expected to be able to withhold regular bronchodilator therapy for the duration of&#xD;
      the treatment phase of the study. Rescue medication with ipratropium will be allowed (and its&#xD;
      use recorded) and subjects may continue inhaled corticosteroids at a stable dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosing schedule will be the same as for Part B&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Escalation Procedures The decision on whether or not to escalate to each new dose level&#xD;
      and from one part of the study to the next and the selected dose will be based on a formal&#xD;
      review by the DRG of safety data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DRG will include the Principal Investigator and Sponsor's Medical Expert (and/or&#xD;
      delegates) and will meet by teleconference to review safety data for each cohort. The DRG&#xD;
      will review all available safety data (including adverse events [AEs], safety laboratory&#xD;
      tests, spirometry and ECG data) collected up to 24 hours post dose for Part A, and for up to&#xD;
      24 hours post final dose for Parts B and C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected during the study will be entered on case report forms and transferred to a&#xD;
      database using double entry. Blinding will be maintained until all queries are resolved and&#xD;
      the database is locked. AEs will be summarised by study treatment and further by intensity&#xD;
      and relationship to study treatment. The study will primarily be evaluated using descriptive&#xD;
      statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size selected is not based on any formal power calculation.&#xD;
