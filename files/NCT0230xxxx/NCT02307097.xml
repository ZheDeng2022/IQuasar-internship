  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of high-intensity Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT) for social anxiety&#xD;
      disorder is well established (Mayo-Wilson et al., 2014) and it is recommended by the National&#xD;
      Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) as the first-line psychological&#xD;
      intervention for social anxiety disorder. The treatment aims to modify several maintenance&#xD;
      factors (e.g., self-focused attention) that are specified in cognitive models of social&#xD;
      anxiety disorder (e.g., Clark &amp; Wells, 1995).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive-behavioural self-help treatments for social anxiety disorder have been developed to&#xD;
      overcome various accessibility issues (e.g., long wait-lists, and the patient's need to avoid&#xD;
      social situations, etc) associated with high-intensity CBT (Abramowitz et al., 2009;&#xD;
      Carlbring et al., 2007) but a recent network meta-analysis (Mayo-Wilson et al., 2014)&#xD;
      identified the former as less cost-effective than the later and thus, they are not&#xD;
      recommended as standalone treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the potential benefit of cognitive-behavioural self-help treatments for social&#xD;
      anxiety disorder within a stepped-care recovery model as a prelude to high-intensity CBT has&#xD;
      not been formally evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate a seminal Cognitive-Behavioural Bibliotherapy* (CBB;&#xD;
      &quot;pure self-help&quot; book) - 'Overcoming Social Anxiety &amp; Shyness' (Butler, 2009) - for patients&#xD;
      with social anxiety disorder while on the wait-list for high-intensity CBT within an&#xD;
      Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service, and to determine if some patients&#xD;
      recover from CBB alone or whether there may be a reduction in the average number of&#xD;
      high-intensity CBT sessions for those patients who subsequently require further treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is funded by Constable &amp; Robinson, Kellogg College (University of Oxford) and&#xD;
      Talking Change (Solent NHS Trust).&#xD;
&#xD;
      * The Reading Well Books on Prescription scheme with funding from the Arts Council England&#xD;
      enables general practitioners (GPs) and mental health professionals to prescribe seminal CBBs&#xD;
      for patients with mood and anxiety disorders. The books are accessed free of charge via local&#xD;
      libraries. The scheme works within NICE guidelines and it is support by the Royal Colleges of&#xD;
      GPs, Nursing and Psychiatrists, the British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive&#xD;
      Psychotherapies and the Department of Health through its IAPT programme.&#xD;

      P A R T I C I P A N T S&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited within an Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT)&#xD;
      service: 'Talking Change' (Portsmouth). Advertisement for the study will be distributed&#xD;
      locally, through social media and via the 'Talking Change' Internet website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is generally accepted that social anxiety disorder is a chronic condition and significant&#xD;
      change in the wait-list does not occur. Hence, because the study aims to explore predicators&#xD;
      of treatment response, a priori power analyses determined that approximately 114 patients&#xD;
      randomly assigned for twelve-weeks at a ratio of 2:1 would provide sufficient power for&#xD;
      statistical analyses; seventy-six and thirty-eight patients in the Cognitive-Behavioural&#xD;
      Bibliotherapy (CBB) and wait-list control (WAIT) group, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be conducted by someone unassociated with the study using sealed&#xD;
      envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      M E A S U R E S&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An IAPT-standard risk assessment will be utilised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic interviews will use a combination of the Anxiety and Related Disorders Interview&#xD;
      Schedule (ADIS-5; Brown &amp; Barlow, 2014) for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental&#xD;
      Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) to identify social anxiety&#xD;
      disorder and the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of&#xD;
      Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-4; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) Axis I disorders&#xD;
      (SCID-I; First, Spitzer, Gibbon and Williams, 1995) and Axis II disorders (SCID-II; First,&#xD;
      Gibbon, Spitzer, Williams and Benjamin, 1997). All patients will be assessed with the social&#xD;
      anxiety disorder module of the ADIS, the overview and screener modules of the SCID-I, and the&#xD;
      screener questionnaire for SCID-II. If the SCID-I screener module indicates that another Axis&#xD;
      I disorder might be present, the SCID-I module for that disorder will also be administered.&#xD;
      The same applies to the screener questionnaire for the SCID-II. However, regardless of&#xD;
      screening responses, all patients will also be assessed with the avoidant personality&#xD;
      disorder section of the SCID-II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN; Connor, 2000) will assess the main spectrum of social&#xD;
      anxiety disorder such as fear, avoidance, and physiological symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Adult Reading Test (ART; Everatt, Brooks, &amp; Fidler, 2004) will assess reading accuracy,&#xD;
      reading comprehension, speed of reading and speed of writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary measures (CBB, CBT and WAIT groups):&#xD;
&#xD;
      IAPT Standard Minimum Data Set (MDS): The brief versions of the Patient Health Questionnaire&#xD;
      (PHQ-9; Kroenke, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 2001) and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder&#xD;
      Questionnaire (GAD-7; Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, &amp; Löwe, 2006) will assess mood and&#xD;
      generalised anxiety, respectively. The Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS; Marks, 1986)&#xD;
      will assess functional impairment attributable to an identified problem. The Phobia Scales is&#xD;
      a non-validated phobia screener of social phobia, panic disorder/agoraphobia, and specific&#xD;
      phobia avoidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN; Connor, 2000) will assess the main spectrum of social&#xD;
      anxiety disorder such as fear, avoidance, and physiological symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Social Participation &amp; Satisfaction Questionnaire (SPSQ; Alden &amp; Taylor, 2011) will&#xD;
      assess the degree by which the participant is participating is social activity, and&#xD;
      relationship satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary measures (CBB, CBT and WAIT groups):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The self-report version of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS-SR; Baker, Heinrich, Kim,&#xD;
      &amp; Hofmann, 2002; Liebowitz, 1987) will assess social anxiety and the frequency of avoidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Self-Focused Attention Scale (SFA; Bögels, Alberts, &amp; de Jong, 1996) will assess the&#xD;
      degree by which the participant engages in self-focused attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Social Behaviour Questionnaire (SBQ; Clark et al., 2006) will assess the frequency by&#xD;
      which the participant engages in a range of common safety-seeking behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Social Phobia Cognitions Questionnaire (SPC; Clark et al., 2006) will assess the&#xD;
      frequency and belief ratings for a range of typical cognitions in social anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Anticipatory Processing Questionnaire (APQ; Vassilopoulos, 2004) and the Post-Event&#xD;
      Processing Questionnaire-Revised (PEPQ-R; McEvoy &amp; Kingsep, 2006) will assess the degree by&#xD;
      which the participant engages in pre- and post-event rumination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly measures [CBB and CBT groups only]:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IAPT Standard Minimum Data Set (MDS): The brief versions of the Patient Health Questionnaire&#xD;
      (PHQ-9; Kroenke, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 2001) and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder&#xD;
      Questionnaire (GAD-7; Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, &amp; Löwe, 2006) will assess mood and&#xD;
      generalised anxiety, respectively. The Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS; Marks, 1986)&#xD;
      is a self-report scale of functional impairment attributable to an identified problem. The&#xD;
      Phobia Scales is a non-validated phobia screener of social phobia, panic&#xD;
      disorder/agoraphobia, and specific phobia avoidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The self-report version of the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS-SR; Baker, Heinrich, Kim,&#xD;
      &amp; Hofmann, 2002; Liebowitz, 1987) will be administrated weekly to assess social anxiety and&#xD;
      the frequency of avoidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN; Connor, 2000) will assess the main spectrum of social&#xD;
      anxiety disorder such as fear, avoidance, and physiological symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A written answer to the question &quot;What have I learnt?&quot; will assess treatment compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative measure (if received CBB):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A semi-structured interview of patients' experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of high-intensity CBT sessions required following CBB will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P R O C E D U R E&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will engage with a brief telephone Triage Assessment of their presenting problems&#xD;
      and will complete the primary measures to assess symptoms of social anxiety, depression,&#xD;
      generalised anxiety, phobia avoidance, general functioning, and social functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be &quot;stepped-up&quot; to a full face-to-face Step Three Assessment of their&#xD;
      presenting problems if their condition is chronic and cannot be appropriately treated with a&#xD;
      Step 2 intervention. Thus, potential cases of social anxiety disorder who score within the&#xD;
      clinical range (≥19 points) on the SPIN (Connor, 2000) will be &quot;stepped-up&quot;. All other cases&#xD;
      will be offered alternative treatment within the service or referred elsewhere as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will complete the diagnostic measures to determine social anxiety disorder, a&#xD;
      measure of reading and writing ability, the primary measures again, and the secondary&#xD;
      measures to assess the maintenance factors that are specified in cognitive models of social&#xD;
      anxiety disorder (e.g., Clark &amp; Wells, 1995). Patients who do not meet the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be offered alternative treatment within the service or referred elsewhere as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who consent to their participation in the study will be randomly allocated to CBB or&#xD;
      WAIT for twelve weeks. The wait-list group will begin high-intensity CBT at postWAIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are not &quot;CBB responders&quot;* will receive high-intensity CBT at postCBB whereas&#xD;
      those who are will be discharged from the service, offered alternative treatment within the&#xD;
      service if &quot;caseness&quot;** remains, or referred elsewhere as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary and secondary measures will be completed again at preCBB-WAIT-CBT,&#xD;
      midCBB-WAIT-CBT, postCBB-WAIT-CBT, and CBB-CBT one-month follow-up. The CBB and CBT group&#xD;
      will complete the primary measures weekly complete and weekly measures of social anxiety. The&#xD;
      CBB group only will complete a weekly measure of treatment compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will the complete diagnostic measures to determine social anxiety disorder, the&#xD;
      primary measures and the secondary measures again at postCBB-WAIT-CBT and CBB-CBT one-month&#xD;
      follow-up. A qualitative measure of patients' experiences of treatment will be obtained at&#xD;
      postCBB, and postCBT if they previously received CBB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be notified when measures must be completed; most of which are completed online&#xD;
      a secure and encrypted Internet website and some of which are completed face-to-face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CBB group will be provided with a self-help book ('Overcoming Social Anxiety &amp; Shyness';&#xD;
      Butler, 2009) by local libraries and encouraged to work through in a twelve-week period. A&#xD;
      suggested timetable for completing the &quot;pure self-help&quot; treatment will be provided. Clinical&#xD;
      or non-clinical contact will not be provided. The CBT group will receive up to fourteen&#xD;
      face-to-face sessions of high-intensity CBT at their local clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be provided the Chief Investigator's contact details should they wish to&#xD;
      discuss any aspect of the study or if they become distressed. If patients' risk status should&#xD;
      change during the trail they will be instructed to contact the Chief Investigator&#xD;
      immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of study all patients will be discharged from the service, offered alternative&#xD;
      treatment within the service if &quot;caseness&quot; remains, or referred elsewhere as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Those patients who have a statistically reliable improvement that place their mean LSAS-SR&#xD;
      score within the range (mean ± two standard deviations) of the non-clinical population mean,&#xD;
      who score ≤ 18 points on the SPIN (Connor, 2000), and who no longer meet full DSM-V criteria&#xD;
      for social anxiety disorder (APA, 2013) will be &quot;CBB responders&quot; (i.e., a clinically&#xD;
      significant change; see Jacobson &amp; Truax, 1991). The non-clinical population mean will be&#xD;
      based on Fresco et al.'s (2001) non-anxious control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ** The IAPT programme defines &quot;caseness&quot; as ≤ 9 points on the PHQ-9 (Kroenke, Spitzer, &amp;&#xD;
      Williams, 2001) and ≤ 7 points on the GAD-7 (Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, &amp; Löwe, 2006).&#xD;
