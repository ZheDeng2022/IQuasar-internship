  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The New Viviscal Professional Strength is an oral food supplement specifically designed to&#xD;
      promote hair growth for women suffering from temporary thinning hair. It does not contain&#xD;
      hormones, drugs or industry by-products. Viviscal has been marketed in Europe for over 15&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this clinical research study is to evaluate certain physiological effects of&#xD;
      Viviscal compared to placebo in forty (40) female subjects, ages 21-75 years of age with&#xD;
      self-perceived thinning hair associated with poor diet, stress, hormonal influences or&#xD;
      abnormal menstrual cycles when compared to using the placebo tablet.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The key ingredient is AminoMar C™ marine complex, an organic form of silica derived from&#xD;
      Equisetum sp. (horsetail), vitamin C derived from Malpighia emarginata (acerola cherry),&#xD;
      microcrystalline cellulose (E460), natural orange flavor, magnesium stearate, hypromellose,&#xD;
      and glycerol. The AminoMar C ™ is an active ingredient which has been trademarked and&#xD;
      comprises of a proprietary blend of shark powder and mollusc powder. It is derived from&#xD;
      sustainable marine sources. Viviscal provides essential nutrients to nourish hair naturally&#xD;
      from within. Viviscal works in 4 stages (see below) over several months of use to improve the&#xD;
      appearance of thinning hair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE 1: Nourishes the hair follicles STAGE 2: Strengthens and promotes the growth of&#xD;
      terminal hairs. Terminal hair is defined as coarse hair, short or long, found on the scalp&#xD;
      with minimum cross-sectional diameter of 40 micrometers. Vellus hair is defined as fine,&#xD;
      short hairs found on the scalp with maximum cross-sectional diameter of 40 micrometers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE 3: Supports the growth of hair where it has slowed down or temporarily stopped STAGE 4:&#xD;
      Hair becomes stronger, healthier and more vibrant&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ingestion of Viviscal over a six (6) month period will strengthen and promote the growth of&#xD;
      terminal hairs in female subjects, ages 21-75 years of age with self-perceived thinning hair&#xD;
      associated with poor diet, stress, hormonal influences or abnormal menstrual cycles. The&#xD;
      primary endpoints will be individual hair counts and favorable analysis using the Nikon&#xD;
      CoolPix 4300 with 3GEN Dermlite Foto37 or Nikon D90 camera with a Nikor 105 mm macro lens for&#xD;
      phototrichogram analysis at the end of the six (6) month period. The secondary endpoints will&#xD;
      be favorable improvements in terminal hair diameter measured by the Dino-Lite Digital&#xD;
      Microscopic and positive feedback on the Quality of Life and Self-Assessment questionnaires&#xD;
      after six (6) months of Viviscal ingestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients enrolled must be identifiable throughout the study. The Investigator will&#xD;
      maintain a personal list of patient numbers and patient names to enable records to be found&#xD;
      at a later date and the list will be stored in a locked cabinet. Subject numbers consist of a&#xD;
      2 digit number from 01 to 40. Patients will be randomized to active or placebo supplements&#xD;
      (1:1 ratio) using a randomization table prepared prior to the start of the study by a&#xD;
      non-participating staff member at the office of the Investigators. The study blind will not&#xD;
      be broken until the end of the study. All test product and placebo will be labeled with&#xD;
      subject numbers per the non- participating staff member. Subjects will be assigned a subject&#xD;
      number in numerical order as enrolled. Randomization will occur by assignment to either New&#xD;
      Viviscal professional strength supplement or placebo with 1:1 ratio. Subjects who terminate&#xD;
      their study participation for any reason, regardless of whether study medication was used or&#xD;
      not, will retain their randomization number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assigned a two-digit number which will uniquely identify every subject on&#xD;
      the study. This number will remain with the subject throughout the study and should be used&#xD;
      in all references to the individual in this study. No number will be reassigned once the&#xD;
      study begins. Subjects at the ASIRC will start with 01 to 20 and at DeNova Research 21 to 40.&#xD;
      Patients will be identified solely by this number and any paper records which reflect&#xD;
      electronic data or relationships of those data with patient confidential information are kept&#xD;
      in locked cabinets.&#xD;
&#xD;

           to ingest the test product per Sponsor instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: Month 6 (180 days) ± 1 week (7 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A clinician will ask subjects if they have experienced any changes in their health or&#xD;
           taken new/adjusted current medications since the last visit. If an AE or SAE is&#xD;
           reported, the examining Investigator will be informed and the appropriate forms will be&#xD;
           completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The test product will be collected and counted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subjects will receive a brief physical exam. The physical will include vital signs&#xD;
           (pulse and blood pressure).&#xD;

           the scalp and the diameter of the hairs measured (see Appendix III).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All primary and secondary parameters will be collected at Visits 1, 2 and 3. Missing data&#xD;
      values will be minimized by intensive training of the interviewers in techniques of&#xD;
      clarifying answers and checking questionnaires while participants are on-site. When missing&#xD;
      values are identified, several approaches such as rescheduled within 24 hours of completion&#xD;
      of tests or interviews will be employed to acquire the necessary data. Missing data will be&#xD;
      also examined to assess randomness. Descriptive statistics will be obtained for all&#xD;
      variables, tests of normality of continuous measures will be made and data will be examined&#xD;
      for homogeneity of variance. An appropriate statistical method will be employed to correct&#xD;
      for any abnormalities. All statistical tests will be two-tailed. Differences will be&#xD;
      considered statistically significant provided a p-value of 0.05 or less is obtained. For each&#xD;
      visit, the differences of the two groups from baseline Visit will be tested using analyses of&#xD;
      variance with repeated measurements.&#xD;

    <description>The first primary efficacy parameter from the phototrichogram will be the number of terminal hairs in the target area of the scalp. Terminal hair is defined as coarse hair, short or long, found on the scalp with minimum cross-sectional diameter of greater than 40 micrometers. Phototrichogram macrophotographs will be taken of the selected target area of each subject at each visit as specified under the Schedule of Procedures. Digital macrophotography will be performed using a Nikon Coolpix 4300 camera with a 3GEN Dermlite Foto37 system for scalp photography. The macrophotographs are then read by the investigator to determine the terminal hair count.</description>
