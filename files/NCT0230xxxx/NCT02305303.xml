    <textblock>
      Treatment of severe trauma patients includes intensive cares. Both trauma and intensive care&#xD;
      may lead to a post-traumatic stress disorder‬ and then to a decreased quality of life.&#xD;
      Diaries may improve the frequency and the intensity of PTSD. Aim of investigator is to assess&#xD;
      if diaries may improve quality of life after a severe trauma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trauma is the third cause of death in France and the first cause of death of people under 40&#xD;
      years (48 000 deaths a year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe trauma defined by an Injury Severity Score ( ISS) &gt; 15 implies intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensive care unit admission induces considerable psychological distress and memory&#xD;
      troubles, both promoting posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and symptoms of anxiety and&#xD;
      depression. A diary written prospectively during the ICU stay by the staff and relatives has&#xD;
      been suggested as a means of help¬ing patients to build a more detailed and factual narrative&#xD;
      of their ICU stay than would be possible based only on their fragmented memories. Garrouste&#xD;
      et al. have shown that the intensive care unit diary significantly affected posttraumatic&#xD;
      stress disorders in surviving patients 12 months after intensive care unit discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides, severe trauma by itself may decrease the quality of life (QoL). It is recommended to&#xD;
      assess QoL on one year after the trauma. In trauma patients, the change in QoL is associated&#xD;
      with the presence of a PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, severe trauma patients who undergo a double stress, that of the accident and&#xD;
      that of the intensive care unit stay: they may so even more have a decrease of their QoL by&#xD;
      developing a PSTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator formulate the hypothesis that a diary, written by the staff and relatives&#xD;
      from the very acute phase of the ICU stay (first 48 hours) to the discharge of ICU would&#xD;
      improve the QoL and would decrease the frequency and the intensity of PTSD of the severe&#xD;
      trauma patients one year after the trauma.&#xD;
