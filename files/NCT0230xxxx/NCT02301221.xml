      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of fecal microbiota transplantation in&#xD;
      adults with slow transit constipation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Constipation is a chronic disease estimated to affect about 10% - 15% of the worldwide&#xD;
      general population. Constipation frequency appears to augment with increasing age,&#xD;
      particularly after 65 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent evidence in the literature and collected in our laboratory confirm that constipation&#xD;
      can be a consequence of intestinal dysbiosis, with an increase of potentially pathogenic&#xD;
      microorganisms and a decrease of potentially beneficial microorganisms. These alterations may&#xD;
      affect the motility and metabolic environment of colon, especially the production of short&#xD;
      chain fatty acids (SCFAs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new and under-explored method to manipulate the gastrointestinal microbiota involves fecal&#xD;
      microbiota transplantation (FMT). There has been growing interest in the use of fecal&#xD;
      microbiota for the treatment of patients with chronic gastrointestinal infections (e.g. CDI)&#xD;
      and other extraintestinal conditions (e.g. IBD). Similarly, we suppose that reshaping the gut&#xD;
      microbiome with FMT would be effective for patients with slow transit constipation.&#xD;
