    <textblock>
      Abnormally invasive placenta (AIP) is defined as an abnormal placental attachment of a part&#xD;
      or the entire chorionic plate with penetration of chorionic villi in the myometrium and&#xD;
      absence of the decidua basalis. This anomaly is associated with significant maternal&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality as it may result in severe haemorrhage during the post-partum. It has&#xD;
      been demonstrated that prenatal diagnosis of AIP is essential to reduce maternal morbidity.&#xD;
      In a recent study of Chantraine F. et al. prenatal diagnosis of AIP leads to better outcomes,&#xD;
      due to fewer emergency operations and less mass transfusions. Currently, the diagnosis of AIP&#xD;
      is based on a combination of conventional B-mode ultrasound and MRI. However, prenatal&#xD;
      diagnosis of AIP remains challenging and recent reports demonstrated it is achieved in only&#xD;
      thirds of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a non-invasive technique based on the detection by&#xD;
      ultrasound (US) of gas-filled microbubbles used as perfusion tracers. Intravascular&#xD;
      rheological properties of these bubbles are similar to those of red blood cells and they&#xD;
      remain entirely within the intravascular space. Previous studies have demonstrated that&#xD;
      microbubbles do not transfer into fetal circulation. CEUS has been used for years in many US&#xD;
      imaging applications (e.g. liver, kidneys and breast). In obstetrics, despite not yet&#xD;
      approved for clinical use, CEUS offers the opportunity to analyze anatomical placental&#xD;
      landmarks, improving the contrast between placenta and myometrium. In addition,&#xD;
      quantification parameters related to the contrast enhancement have been proposed as objective&#xD;
      indicators to estimate blood perfusion rates in the placental intervillous space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to provide pre-clinical evaluation of CEUS for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of AIP and to try to determine if AIP are characterised by differences in&#xD;
      intervillous blood rheological properties. Conventional CEUS parameters will be: rise time,&#xD;
      peak enhancement, wash-in rate, mean transit time and wash-in area under the curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this study is a pre-clinical evaluation, sample size calculation remains subjective and&#xD;
      imprecise. For this reason, a sample size of 100 pregnant women to be included in this&#xD;
      prospective study has been decided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential impact of this study will be to propose a more reliable tool with both improved&#xD;
      sensibility and specificity compared to the combination US/MRI and therefore to reduce the&#xD;
      maternal worldwide burden of AIP.&#xD;
