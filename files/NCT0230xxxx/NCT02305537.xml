    <textblock>
      The collection of patient self-report and diagnostic data will allow us to examine the&#xD;
      efficacy of the treatment delivered in the McLean Anxiety Mastery Program. Using data&#xD;
      gathered through routine clinical care, the investigators seek to explore whether patients in&#xD;
      treatment show improvements from admission to discharge, compared to patients on the&#xD;
      waitlist, and whether these gains are maintained three months post-discharge. The following&#xD;
      are included as examples of some of the study's hypotheses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population will involve all assenting/consenting patients, both male and female,&#xD;
      admitted to the McLean Anxiety Mastery Program at McLean Hospital. This program provides&#xD;
      intensive group-based treatment for anxious youth (aged 6-19). Patients in the McLean Anxiety&#xD;
      Mastery Program participate in a minimum of four weeks of treatment and attend the program&#xD;
      for four days per week. Three days per week, patients attend group-based treatment for&#xD;
      two-and-a-half hours per day. The fourth day of each week consists of a one-hour group-based&#xD;
      treatment, a one-hour family meeting, and a one-hour exposure session that includes children&#xD;
      and their caregivers. One day per week, parents also attend a one-hour parent guidance group&#xD;
      as part of the overall treatment package. Patients also have psychopharmacology consultations&#xD;
      with the program psychiatrist on a case-by-case basis. On their first birthday that falls&#xD;
      after the date of discharge, patients are sent a birthday card that includes a greeting and&#xD;
      reminders about coping skills that they learned in the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect to recruit at least 45 assenting/consenting patients in the first&#xD;
      year of the study. The plan is to treat six-to-eight patients during each one-month module&#xD;
      and to have a waitlist, if interest in the program exceeds the program's capacity. If a&#xD;
      waitlist exists, patients, who are on this waitlist, will be evaluated as the study's control&#xD;
      group once they are four weeks away from their target admission date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the patient's first assessment through the program, a clinician will inform the&#xD;
      patient and caregivers about the opportunity to participate in a voluntary research study at&#xD;
      the McLean Anxiety Mastery Program. Assent/consent will be requested to utilize these data&#xD;
      for research purposes. The patient and caregivers will be told that all of the information&#xD;
      gathered from the child- and caregiver-report measures are part of routine clinical practice,&#xD;
      and permission is being sought to use this de-identified data for research purposes. The&#xD;
      patient and caregivers will be reminded that their decision to or not to participate in the&#xD;
      research study will not affect the treatment they receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessments are conducted at the following time points: 1) upon admission, 2) weekly&#xD;
      while the patients are participating in treatment, 3) upon discharge, and 4) at a three-month&#xD;
      follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The child- and parent--report questionnaires are administered through REDCap Survey, a&#xD;
      secure, HIPAA-compliant program for building and managing online surveys. The measures are&#xD;
      completed on families' devices at home. If a patient or family member does not complete the&#xD;
      online survey within 48 hours, a clinician will contact them with a reminder one time via&#xD;
      phone or e-mail. The survey does not include questions assessing risk (e.g., for suicidal&#xD;
      ideation, self-harm, substance use).&#xD;
