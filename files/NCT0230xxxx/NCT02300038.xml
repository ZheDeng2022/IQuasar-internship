      Background Subanesthetics concentrations of lidocaine are able to produce a differential&#xD;
      block of the ectopic discharges, but not propagation of impulses, suppressing differentially&#xD;
      the associated neuropathic pain symptoms. The aim of this study was to investigate the&#xD;
      differences between the analgesic effects of lidocaine 0.5% and a control group of lidocaine&#xD;
      0.1% on several neuroma related pain modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Sixteen patients with neuropathic pain due to painful neuromas caused by nerve injury&#xD;
      participated in this randomized, double-blind experiment. The patterns of sensory changes&#xD;
      were compared before and after injection of 1 ml lidocaine 0.5% and 0.1% close to the&#xD;
      neuroma, the sessions being 1-2 weeks apart. Spontaneous and evoked pains were assessed using&#xD;
      a visual analogue scale (VAS), quantitative and qualitative sensory testing.&#xD;

      Patients were recruited by using a postal follow up questionnaire . The number of enrolled&#xD;
      subjects in this study- 16 patients, Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patients visited the Pain Clinic twice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The same investigator (AM) performed all study procedure assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuroma was localized by Tinel's sign 14 and when possible (7 patients out of 16), the&#xD;
           localization of a neuroma was verified by ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of study drug The patients were randomized by a computer generated random list&#xD;
      to receive either 1ml lidocaine 0.5% (A) or 1 ml 0.1% (B-control) injected perineuromally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain assessments Duration of the present pain condition was recorded. The patients were asked&#xD;
      to rate the mean, maximum, minimum pain intensity of their spontaneous and evoked pain in the&#xD;
      week prior to both visits. The pain score was measured from baseline until 60 min after&#xD;
      injection. Assessments of pain were done post injection at 15 s, 30 s, 1 min, and at 5-min&#xD;
      intervals for the first 30-min post injection and then every 10-min to 1 hr post injection.&#xD;
      The assessments of pain were performed between the limbs in the following order: spontaneous&#xD;
      pain, then assessment of dynamic mechanical allodynia and then pinprick hyperalgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spontaneous pain Evaluation of sensory function was performed in the affected limb using&#xD;
      bedside examination according to EFNS (European Federation of Neurological&#xD;
      Societies)guidelines: light touch, pinprick sense, warmth (40°) and cold (25°) temperature&#xD;
      stimuli were tested.&#xD;
