  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Everolimus represents an approved therapy for patients with advanced well/moderately&#xD;
      differentiated pancreatic NETs. Although some patients could benefit from this drug in terms&#xD;
      of long-term tumor growth control, others are resistant upfront or become resistant during&#xD;
      treatment. Therefore, it is crucial to detect some biological factors which can help to&#xD;
      identify the responsive tumors. Given that Everolimus is a biological agent and its mechanism&#xD;
      of action can be partially directed towards angiogenesis its effects can be studied on&#xD;
      different levels and with different methods. Upfront and early surrogate predictive markers&#xD;
      of activity/efficacy can be studied on tumor tissue, tumor imaging, and peripheral blood.&#xD;
      mTOR pathways alterations, circulating endothelial cells, and other circulating angoigenic&#xD;
      factors will be correlated with clinical outcome. Tumor perfusion and circulating markers&#xD;
      will be studied also as markers of response compared with the morphological imaging.&#xD;

      • Background:: Everolimus has been reported to be effective compared with placebo in&#xD;
      well/moderately differentiated pancreatic NETs in terms of progression-free survival (PFS)&#xD;
      improvement. However, a number of patients are refractory upfront or become resistant after&#xD;
      few months of therapy. Therefore, it is crucial to detect some biological factors which can&#xD;
      help to identify the responsive tumors. Everolimus is a biological agent and its mechanism of&#xD;
      action can be partially directed towards angiogenesis. This can be studied on different&#xD;
      levels and with different methods. Upfront and early surrogate predictive markers of&#xD;
      activity/efficacy can be studied on tumor tissue, on tumor imaging, and on the peripheral&#xD;
      blood. Tumor study with diffusion-MRI and angiogenic circulating markers can be studied also&#xD;
      as markers of response compared with the morphological imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Material and Methods :&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Circulating Endothelial Cells (CECs) and Circulating endothelial progenitors (CEPs)&#xD;
                will be performed by flow cytometry. The monoclonal antibodies used for the search&#xD;
                of CECs and CEPs include: cluster of differentiation antigen 45 (CD45), CD31,&#xD;
                CD133, CD146, CD34, VEGFR-2, 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) and Syto1. Vascular&#xD;
                endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), VEGFR-2&#xD;
                and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) will be also detected on the peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. On the tumor tissue the following determinations will be performed, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Subtype 2 somatostatin receptor,&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Phospho-AKT&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Phospho-mTOR&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Phospho-4E-BP1&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Phospho-p70-S6 kinase Rabbit anti-tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) Cell&#xD;
                     Signaling Technology&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Mouse anti-PTEN Cell Signaling Technology&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been shown to be able to provide information&#xD;
                regarding the cellular density and properties of the extracellular matrix and the&#xD;
                apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value calculated using DWI can serve as a&#xD;
                marker of cellularity. Given that tumor cellularity is contributed largely by&#xD;
                cellular proliferation, the ADC value can be a surrogate biomarker for tumor-cell&#xD;
                proliferation . ADC-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be performed at baseline,&#xD;
                after 1 month and after three months of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline, after 1 month of therapy, after three months of therapy and at progression:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abdomen DWI-MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CEC, CEPs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Circulating VEGF, VEGFR-2, bFGF, TSP-1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline biopsy of a metastatic site and possibly a new biopsy at the time of tumor&#xD;
      progression&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correlation of biological parameters with clinical outcome ( tumor response and progression&#xD;
      free survival, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors , RECIST 1.0 criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Statistical analysis: This is an exploratory study on the potential predictive value of&#xD;
      some biological factors (CECs, VEGF and bFGF among them) expressed in terms of reducing risk&#xD;
      of progression in patients with advanced pancreatic NETs treated with Everolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use two-tailed log-rank test (α = 0.05, 1-β = 0.20) to test the hypothesis of 30% a&#xD;
      reduction in risk (hazard rate; HR) equal to HR = 0.30 for those belonging to the following&#xD;
      layers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ≥ 2.2/uL vs &lt; 2.2/uL for CEC at basal or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ≤ 65.6 vs &gt; 65.6 for FGF levels after two months since start treatment or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ≤ 32.5 vs &gt; 32.5 for VEGF levels after two months since start treatment The sample size&#xD;
           is calculated to compensate for the power loss of the log-rank test assuming an average&#xD;
           and uniform log-rank test drop-out of 10% and bearing in mind that the threshold values&#xD;
           refer to the 25th, 75th and 50th percentile distributions of CEC, bFGF, and VEGF,&#xD;
           respectively. Considering an accrual rate of 20 patients/year, a treatment period of 12&#xD;
           weeks with a follow-up of 1 year and for a sample size equal to 43 patients, the study&#xD;
           will have a total length of about 3 years and 6 months.&#xD;
