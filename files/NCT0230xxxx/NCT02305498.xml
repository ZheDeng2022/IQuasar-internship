  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research suggests that regular physical activity may make cancer survivors do better&#xD;
      in the long run. Laboratory studies suggest that stress may be bad for cancer patients as&#xD;
      well. The investigators are interested in whether yoga, a practice that combines physical&#xD;
      activity and stress reduction, is beneficial to cancer survivors. To answer that question,&#xD;
      the investigators will need to do a large scale clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the investigators can do that large study, they need to know whether people are&#xD;
      willing to participate in this kind of study, whether they can do the yoga practice regularly&#xD;
      and for how long, what kind of changes they may experience in how they can handle their daily&#xD;
      activities, emotion, sleep, memory and problem solving ability, and what are the changes that&#xD;
      can happen in their body after doing the yoga practice. Answering these questions is what&#xD;
      this study is about.&#xD;

    <description>The study will be deemed feasible and safe if at least 15/20 patients in each arm complete the study. If the underlying feasibility rate is 90%, then the probability of 15/20 patients or more completing the study is 98.9%, and 97.8% for 15/20 patients completing in the study in both arms simultaneously.</description>

    <measure>safety of a supervised vigorous yoga practice by the number of serious adverse events reported.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Each serious adverse event (SAE), defined as grade III or IV toxicity, will be evaluated by the PI or a Co-PI and its relationship to the study intervention is determined by the PI or a Co-PI. The study will be deemed feasible and safe if at least 15/20 patients in each arm complete the study.</description>
