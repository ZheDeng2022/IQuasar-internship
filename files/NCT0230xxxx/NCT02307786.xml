  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beta thalassemia (β-thalassemia) is the most common genetic disease worldwide. Individuals&#xD;
      with thalassemia are born with a defect in hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood&#xD;
      cells that carries oxygen to vital organs such as the brain, heart, lungs and kidneys.&#xD;
      Thalassemia major is a hereditary anemia characterized by little or no ß-globin production,&#xD;
      which results in hemolysis (breakdown or destruction of red blood cells) due to the formation&#xD;
      of unstable alpha-globin tetramers and ineffective erythropoiesis which is uniformly fatal in&#xD;
      the absence of regular transfusions. Although improvements in conservative treatment have&#xD;
      improved the prognosis of thalassemia considerably disease and transfusion related&#xD;
      complications in affected patients progress over time, causing severe morbidity and shortened&#xD;
      life expectancy. Substantial lifelong health care expenses are also involved, often a&#xD;
      financial burden for families and unsustainable in most developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that patients who had beta thalassemia who have undergone a hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell transplant (HSCT) and are &gt;1 year post-HSCT will have less long term comorbidities&#xD;
      and a higher quality of life (QOL) as compared to those with beta thalassemia who are&#xD;
      maintained on supportive care. In order to assess quality of life, a quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire will be asked. Extraction of data from the patient's medical record will also&#xD;
      be used to determine any comorbidities that have occurred after either a HSCT or supportive&#xD;
      care therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is considered a suitable alternative to&#xD;
      conservative management which includes chronic transfusion therapy, iron chelation (iron&#xD;
      overload) and management of complications of transfusion therapy and iron overload. Barriers&#xD;
      to HSCT considerations include risks inherent to transplant- early mortality, graft versus&#xD;
      host disease (GVHD), graft rejection, infections prior to immune reconstitution, and&#xD;
      transplant related organ toxicities. As in supportive care, significant progress has been&#xD;
      made in HSCT for thalassemia has been made over the last 3 decades. This has resulted in&#xD;
      disease-free survival (DFS) rates exceeding 80% especially in young, low-risk patients with&#xD;
      histocompatible (same gene) family donors and more recently even in unrelated donor&#xD;
      transplants following streamlining of preparative regimen and improvements in post-HSCT&#xD;
      supportive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lucarelli and his colleagues at Pesaro initially pioneered HSCT in thalassemia and described&#xD;
      a standard &quot;Pesaro&quot; risk stratification scheme based on liver size by physical examination,&#xD;
      fibrosis detected on liver biopsy, and chelation history. This has been used for years to&#xD;
      risk stratify patients before HSCT and has been shown to correlate well with immediate&#xD;
      transplantation outcomes. More recently reports from the Center for International Blood and&#xD;
      Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) and from the Asian sub-continent on results of Human&#xD;
      Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) -matched sibling HSCT for thalassemia major confirmed that age at&#xD;
      transplantation and liver size are independent predictors of mortality after transplantation.&#xD;
      In patients aged &lt;7 years and without hepatomegaly (liver palpated &lt;2 cm below the costal&#xD;
      margin), the 5-year probabilities of Overall Survival (OS) and DFS were 98% and 94%,&#xD;
      respectively (ref). Morbidity in thalassemia patients (both transplant related and&#xD;
      non-transplanted) is attributed to iron overload associated end organ damage. Although there&#xD;
      is data on long term outcomes in chronically transfused thalassemia patients, the data on&#xD;
      long-term outcomes after HSCT for thalassemia remains limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in hopes to cure&#xD;
      themselves of Beta-Thalassemia. Other patients manage their Beta-Thalassemia with supportive&#xD;
      care including chronic blood transfusions, iron chelation and medications. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to compare how patients with Beta-Thalassemia are doing after HSCT versus those&#xD;
      patients who manage their Beta-Thalassemia with supportive care. This proposal aims to&#xD;
      compare long term outcomes in thalassemia patients that have survived a HSCT for thalassemia&#xD;
      and compare it with the age and sex matched patients who have remained on transfusion therapy&#xD;
      with regular chelation. In order to compare these two subsets of patients, data will be&#xD;
      obtained from the Thalassemia Longitudinal Cohort (TLC) study.&#xD;
