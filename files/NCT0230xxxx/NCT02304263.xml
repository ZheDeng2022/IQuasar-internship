  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tenofovir continues to play a vital role in the treatment of the human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
      (HIV) and as the age of the HIV-infected population increases in the United States and&#xD;
      worldwide, there is an urgent need to understand the extent to which older age influences the&#xD;
      way this antiretroviral medication works in the body. The investigators study aims to&#xD;
      characterize and compare the pharmacology of tenofovir in older versus younger HIV-infected&#xD;
      adults and to assess kidney function over the course of approximately one year. The&#xD;
      investigators will be analyzing tenofovir levels in different compartments of the blood and&#xD;
      in hair samples, and will be assessing the relationship between tenofovir concentrations and&#xD;
      changes in kidney function over time in the older and younger cohorts. Lastly, the&#xD;
      investigators will be evaluating the relationship between tenofovir concentrations and&#xD;
      functional status (including body composition, bone mineral density, and frailty) in study&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Despite a growing population of older HIV infected persons world-wide, major knowledge gaps&#xD;
      exist with regards to the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antiretroviral drugs in&#xD;
      older persons. In the United States, the median age of HIV-infected persons is expected to&#xD;
      surpass 50 years by 2015. A global report from UNAIDS indicated that for the first time since&#xD;
      the start of the HIV epidemic, 10% of the adult population currently living with HIV in low-&#xD;
      and middle-income countries is aged 50 or older, and in high-income countries, approximately&#xD;
      30% of adults living with HIV are aged 50 years and over. Hypertension, diabetes,&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, cancer, osteoporosis, cognitive decline, and hepatic and renal&#xD;
      dysfunction are commonly encountered problems in older persons. Frailty is also commonly&#xD;
      encountered in the aging population and is defined as the cumulative effects of age-related&#xD;
      declines in multiple physiological systems and homeostatic mechanisms, resulting in greater&#xD;
      vulnerability to stressors. People living with HIV have a higher prevalence and earlier onset&#xD;
      of age-related declines in health, including frailty, compared to HIV-uninfected adults. The&#xD;
      emphasis of HIV management over the past decade has shifted from the prevention of AIDS&#xD;
      complications, to the management of chronic non-infectious comorbidities in an increasingly&#xD;
      older and more complicated patient population. Age-related declines in health along with&#xD;
      established changes in body composition as individuals get older (increased body fat,&#xD;
      decreased lean mass), may impact the pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral medications used in&#xD;
      the treatment of HIV, but this has not been studied adequately. To date, there is a&#xD;
      substantial lack of information regarding the pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral medications,&#xD;
      including tenofovir (TFV), in older HIV-infected adults. As evidence, the 'Geriatric Use'&#xD;
      sections of the Viread® (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, TDF)-containing products state the&#xD;
      following, &quot;Clinical studies of Viread® did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged&#xD;
      65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general,&#xD;
      dose selection for the elderly patient should be cautious, keeping in mind the greater&#xD;
      frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or&#xD;
      other drug therapy.&quot; These gaps in knowledge arise from underrepresentation of older&#xD;
      individuals in the early phases of drug development. This is especially true for&#xD;
      antiretroviral drugs because HIV-infection afflicted mostly young people at the time most&#xD;
      antiretroviral drugs were being developed. It is important to realize that HIV-infected&#xD;
      individuals are now reaching older ages in high numbers, and that studies are urgently needed&#xD;
      to optimize drug responses in this population. A major gap in knowledge is the lack of&#xD;
      information surrounding the association between functional (frailty) status and the&#xD;
      pharmacology of antiretroviral medications in older HIV-infected individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As older adults experience natural declines in renal function, drugs that are renally&#xD;
      eliminated may accumulate in the systemic circulation, thus increasing the risk for&#xD;
      toxicities. Tenofovir is renally eliminated and its principal dose-related toxicity is new or&#xD;
      worsening renal impairment, meaning that slowed elimination may accelerate damage to the&#xD;
      kidneys in this population. In order to assess changes in renal function clinically,&#xD;
      regression equations that incorporate age, such as Cockgroft-Gault and MDRD, are utilized,&#xD;
      but depend on serum creatinine (endogenous muscle byproduct). Serum creatinine is not an&#xD;
      ideal marker in older populations because muscle mass decreases with age. A better method to&#xD;
      quantify actual GFR is by evaluating the plasma clearance of the contrast agent, iohexol&#xD;
      (iGFR). This approach is considered a gold standard for assessing renal function at all ages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Anderson Laboratory recently validated a method for measuring the intracellular&#xD;
      concentration of tenofovir-di-phosphate (TFV-DP), the active form of tenofovir, in red blood&#xD;
      cells (RBC) using dried blood spots (DBS )to indicate both recent and cumulative dosing.&#xD;
      Similar to the benefits provided by hemoglobin A1C testing in diabetes therapy, TFV-DP in DBS&#xD;
      testing allows for a much needed quantitative approach for assessing cumulative exposure to&#xD;
      tenofovir over long periods of time. This is enabled by the 17 day half-life for TFV-DP in&#xD;
      RBC. Measuring TFV concentrations in scalp hair is an alternative method for measuring&#xD;
      cumulative exposure to the drug over long periods of time (weeks to months), as demonstrated&#xD;
      by researchers at the University of California San Francisco.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These novel biomarkers for long-term tenofovir exposure provide an opportunity to compare&#xD;
      cumulative tenofovir exposure in older versus younger individuals. Long-term use of tenofovir&#xD;
      is associated with two main adverse effects, namely changes in bone mineral density and renal&#xD;
      function, however the link between age, tenofovir exposure, and rate of decline in bone&#xD;
      mineral density and renal function have not been fully elucidated. The goals of the present&#xD;
      study are to characterize and compare the pharmacokinetics of TFV in older HIV-infected&#xD;
      adults versus younger HIV-infected adults and to assess the changes in bone mineral density&#xD;
      and renal function (using iohexol) over an approximate one year time period in these two&#xD;
      cohorts. The study will also include measures of body composition (using duel-energy x-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry, DXA) and functional status (frailty) and will assess the relationships&#xD;
      between these factors and TFV pharmacology in both the younger and older HIV-infected&#xD;
      cohorts.&#xD;
