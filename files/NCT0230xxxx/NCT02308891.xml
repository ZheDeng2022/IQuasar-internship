    <textblock>
      Postendoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis is the most frequent and&#xD;
      serious complication of ERCP procedures, occurring in approximately 5-15% of unselected&#xD;
      patients. Pharmacologic prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis has been the topic of several&#xD;
      investigations in recent years. Hydration is considered a mainstay of treatment for acute&#xD;
      pancreatitis. We perform multicenter, prospective, randomized trial to investigate whether&#xD;
      intravenous vigorous hydration with lactated Ringer's solution reduces the risk of post-ERCP&#xD;
      pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria : consecutive patients older than 18 years who are scheduled to undergo&#xD;
      diagnostic or therapeutic ERCP will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either vigorous hydration&#xD;
      (treatment arm) or standard hydration (standard arm). Randomization will be performed in a&#xD;
      double blinded fashion using computer-generated random numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment arm (vigorous hydration arm);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial bolus of lactated Ringer's solution at 10 mL/kg over 1 hour prior to ERCP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intravenous lactated Ringer's solution at a rate of 3 mL/kg/h during the procedure and&#xD;
           continued for 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of ERCP, post-procedure bolus of lactated Ringer's solution at 10 mL/Kg over&#xD;
           1hour Standard arm (standard hydration arm);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive lactated Ringer's solution at the start of the ERCP and the fluids&#xD;
           will be administered at a rate of 1.5 ml/kg/h during the procedure and for 8hours after&#xD;
           ERCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint was development of post-ERCP pancreatitis, which define as increased&#xD;
      pancreatic pain (more than 3 on a visual analogue pain scale) and hyperamylasemia (three&#xD;
      times the upper limit of normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoint included the development of asymptomatic hyperamylasemia, severity of&#xD;
      pancreatitis, and fluid overload.&#xD;

        -  Initial bolus of lactated Ringer's solution at 10 mL/kg over 1 hour prior to ERCP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intravenous lactated Ringer's solution at a rate of 3 mL/kg/h during the procedure and&#xD;
           continued for 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of ERCP, post-procedure bolus of lactated Ringer's solution at 10 mL/Kg over&#xD;
           1 hour&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard arm (standard hydration arm);&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Patients will receive lactated Ringer's solution at the start of the ERCP and the fluids&#xD;
      will be administered at a rate of 1.5 ml/kg/h during the procedure and for 8hours after ERCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is development of post-ERCP pancreatitis, which define as increased&#xD;
      pancreatic pain (more than 3 on a visual analogue pain scale) and hyperamylasemia (three&#xD;
      times the upper limit of normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoint included the development of asymptomatic hyperamylasemia, severity of&#xD;
      pancreatitis, and fluid overload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum amylase levels are measured at baseline, and at 8 hours and 18-24 hours, 48 hours after&#xD;
      the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators recorded the details of the maneuvers performed, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the total time of the procedure,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the number of attempts at cannulation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the number of pancreatic duct cannulation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the final diagnosis by ERCP,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. whether a sphincterotomy, a needle-knife papillotomy, or stent placement&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. endoscopic papillary balloon dilation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. common bile duct (C) tissue sampling (biopsy, brush, cytology),&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. common bile duct-intraductal ultrasonography (C-IDUS),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Serum amylase is determined 8, 18~24, and 48 hours after ERCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  If the 12-hours serum amylase level was &gt; 3 times the upper normal limit and&#xD;
                     the patient exhibited pain or nausea and vomiting, then the patient had&#xD;
                     pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Acute pancreatitis is defined as serum amylase &gt; 3 times the upper limit of&#xD;
                     normal and associated with epigastric pain, back pain, and epigastric&#xD;
                     tenderness.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Randomization was done by the GI nurse, concealed envelop&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Data were summarized by descriptive statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. The Chi square was used to compare categorical patient data.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  4. The Student's t test was used to compare continuous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  5. Two-tailed P &lt; 0.05 was considered to indicate significance.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  consecutive patients older than 18 years who are scheduled to undergo diagnostic or&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be excluded if they have acute pancreatitis during the 2 weeks before&#xD;
             ERCP, a history of chronic pancreatitis, previous sphincterotomy, or if they refuse to&#xD;
             participate the study protocol. Patients will be also excluded if they undergo ERCP,&#xD;
             for procedures such as stone removal following previous sphincterotomy, change or&#xD;
             removal of previous biliary stents, or surveillance biopsy after endoscopic&#xD;
             papillectomy without pancreatography, which are considered to carry minimal risks of&#xD;
             post-ERCP pancreatitis. Patients with high risk of fluid overload (heart failure, more&#xD;
             than NYHA II; renal insufficiency, creatinine clearance &lt;40ml/min; liver cirrhosis; or&#xD;
             hypoxemia, SaO2 &lt;90%; signs of pulmonary edema) are excluded.&#xD;
