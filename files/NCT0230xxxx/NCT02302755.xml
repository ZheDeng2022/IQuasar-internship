      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of repeated TP10 dosing in pediatric and&#xD;
      adult patients with C3G and to evaluate the activity of TP10 in pediatric and adult patients&#xD;
      with C3G, as measured by the proportion of patients with normalization of serum C3, serum C3&#xD;
      breakdown products, or alternative pathway (AP) complement activity.&#xD;

      Overview of Study Design: This study is a pilot Phase I, open-label, non-randomized,&#xD;
      single-arm, clinical trial of TP10 in 5 patients with C3G, aged 4 years or older. The study&#xD;
      consists of a 4-week screening period followed by a 26-week treatment period. (See Schedule&#xD;
      of Events, Table 1.) The 26-week treatment period is further divided into an Induction Period&#xD;
      of up to 4 weeks, followed by a Maintenance Period, which allows for continued treatment to a&#xD;
      total of 26 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Period: Patients will be identified for possible enrollment in this study through a&#xD;
      number of mechanisms, including physician or patient-self referral and participation in an&#xD;
      on-going study of C3G in which renal pathology is reviewed to confirm the diagnosis of C3G&#xD;
      and genetic and complement studies are performed. Patients who appear to meet eligibility&#xD;
      criteria for this study upon initial review will be asked to contact Drs. Nester and Smith if&#xD;
      they are interested in this study. Those patients who express interest in this study will be&#xD;
      scheduled for a screening clinic visit at which time they will meet the study team and review&#xD;
      the study design and requirements. A consent for study participation will be obtained. During&#xD;
      this visit those events/tests noted on Table 1, Screening Visit, will be completed. If not&#xD;
      already vaccinated within the time period of active coverage specified by the vaccine&#xD;
      manufacturer, patients will be administered meningococcal, pneumococcal and haemophilus&#xD;
      influenzae vaccines prior to study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Period: All patients will be enrolled through the University of Iowa. This study&#xD;
      will follow a patient-specific dose-escalation scheme during the Induction Period and&#xD;
      subsequent dose adjustments based on complement levels during the Maintenance Period (as&#xD;
      described under Investigational Product Dosing and Administration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring: Safety data for this trial will be reviewed by a Data Monitoring and&#xD;
      Safety Person (DMSP) consisting of one reviewer who is otherwise independent of trial&#xD;
      conduct, as well as study investigators. The DMSP will review safety data on a periodic basis&#xD;
      based on the accrual rate and emergence of safety data. The DMSP will evaluate patient data&#xD;
      with the purpose of identifying safety concerns that may require a modification of the&#xD;
      current study protocol and will also be responsible for determining if criteria for halting&#xD;
      of the trial are met (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Stopping Rules: If any of the following criteria are met, further enrollment into the&#xD;
      trial will be halted and the data reviewed with the DMSP. The trial will only be reopened&#xD;
      after a mutually agreed plan is defined with the DMSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Futility in the first three patients. Futility is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Failure during the Induction Period to normalize C3, C3 breakdown products or&#xD;
           alternative pathway complement activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any of the following toxicities in more than one patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), defined as any Grade 3 or higher drug-related adverse&#xD;
                event (AE)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 3 or higher infection caused by encapsulated bacteria, not responsive to&#xD;
                appropriate medical intervention within 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug-related death Investigational Product Dosing and Administration Each TP10&#xD;
           administration will consist of a 60 (±5)-minute intravenous drip infusion using a 0.22&#xD;
           µm in-line filter and a controlled-rate infusion pump. Administered doses will range&#xD;
           from 5 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg, as determined by patient-specific dose-escalation and&#xD;
           adjustment. Any change in weight of more than 10% will require re-calculation of the&#xD;
           administered dose; otherwise, dosing may be based on the baseline weight. All dosing&#xD;
           will be bi-weekly during induction and weekly during maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of TP10 on complement and C3 convertase inhibition, complement&#xD;
      studies will include measuring TP10 serum concentrations and serum levels of C3 and C3&#xD;
      breakdown products and assays of alternative pathway function. Testing will be done on serum&#xD;
      and plasma samples obtained prior to and approximately 15 minutes post each TP10 dose. All&#xD;
      complement studies will be performed at the University of Iowa. The following treatment plan&#xD;
      will be followed for each patient. However, given the limited experience with TP10 in the&#xD;
      treatment of C3G, as well as the breadth of complement studies that may be used to assess the&#xD;
      impact of treatment, it is acknowledged that the treatment plan within this pilot study may&#xD;
      not account for all potential clinical scenarios. Therefore, adjustments to dose level or&#xD;
      frequency that fall outside of this plan may be implemented when determined clinically&#xD;
      appropriate by the lead investigators at the University of Iowa. In such cases, the IRB will&#xD;
      be notified of the plan for dose change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction Period During the Induction Period, samples for complement studies will be analyzed&#xD;
      at least weekly. The first two doses of the Induction Period will be 5 mg/kg. Intra-patient&#xD;
      dose-escalation will subsequently occur weekly, in 5 or 10 mg/kg increments (as determined by&#xD;
      the investigator, based on complement biomarker changes), up to a maximum dose of 30 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Induction Period schedule will be modified when either of the following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose escalation will discontinue when normalization of C3, C3 breakdown products AND/OR&#xD;
           measure(s) of alternative and/or terminal pathway complement activity is achieved.&#xD;
           Thereafter, the patient will receive one additional TP10 dose at the same dose level as&#xD;
           the prior dose, and then transition to the Maintenance Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the dose level of 30 mg/kg is reached without normalization of C3, C3 breakdown&#xD;
           products AND/OR measure(s) of alternative and/or terminal pathway complement activity,&#xD;
           the patient may receive one additional dose of TP10 at 30 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If normalization of C3, C3 breakdown products AND/OR measure(s) of alternative&#xD;
                and/or terminal pathway complement activity fails to occur, treatment will be&#xD;
                discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If normalization of C3, C3 breakdown products AND/OR measure(s) of alternative&#xD;
                and/or terminal pathway complement activity occurs, the patient will enter the&#xD;
                Maintenance Period and follow rules for Maintenance Period dose adjustments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, study drug dosing will be discontinued if any additional criteria for&#xD;
      discontinuation of study therapy (see below) are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance Period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since it is quite possible that the dose required for maintenance may be significantly lower&#xD;
      than that required during induction, the Maintenance Period will seek to identify the lowest&#xD;
      dose that provides ongoing control of undesirable complement activity. The starting dose for&#xD;
      TP10 Maintenance will be the same dose level as the last dose during the Induction Period;&#xD;
      however, the Maintenance Period allows for dose decrease to 2 mg/kg, which is lower than the&#xD;
      starting dose in the Induction Period. Samples for complement studies will be collected on&#xD;
      each dosing day and analyzed at least weekly at University of Iowa during the Maintenance&#xD;
      Period. Therefore, treatment decisions will be made at least weekly, and dose adjustments&#xD;
      throughout the Maintenance period will be implemented as follows (see Section 8.3.2 for&#xD;
      further details):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If C3, C3 breakdown products AND/OR measure(s) of alternative and/or terminal pathway&#xD;
           complement activity are normalized for two consecutive weeks, the next Maintenance dose&#xD;
           may be decreased by 5 mg/kg (if the previous dose is 5 mg/kg, dosing will decrease to 2&#xD;
           mg/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Note: The dose level MAY be maintained if deemed appropriate by the treating&#xD;
           investigator, with consideration to factors such as biomarker evidence of neo-C3&#xD;
           convertase generation and overall profile of labs utilized for defining maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If C3 levels have dropped &gt;25% compared to entry into the Maintenance Period, C3&#xD;
           breakdown products are present (greater than normal), AND/OR measure(s) of alternative&#xD;
           or terminal pathway complement activity have significantly changed (&gt;50% worsening in&#xD;
           value), the next Maintenance dose will be increased by 5 mg/kg up to a maximum of 30&#xD;
           mg/kg (if the previous dose is 2 mg/kg, dosing will increase to 5 mg/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a patient has experienced dose reduction and subsequent dose escalation twice,&#xD;
           further dose reductions may not be required, but can be implemented at the&#xD;
           investigator's discretion. Otherwise, these patients may be maintained at the last dose&#xD;
           that provided normalization of C3, C3 breakdown products AND/OR alternative and/or&#xD;
           terminal pathway complement activity unless there are changes requiring a dose&#xD;
           increased, as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If normalization of C3, C3 breakdown products AND/OR alternative and/or terminal pathway&#xD;
           complement activity fails to occur despite receipt of 30 mg/kg twice weekly dosing for&#xD;
           two weeks, the patient will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Maintenance Period will be continued until either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The total study treatment period of 26 weeks has elapsed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any additional criteria for discontinuation of study therapy (see below) are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional criteria for treatment discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
      At any point during the study, treatment will be discontinued for any of the following&#xD;
      reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decrease in renal function, defined by an increase in serum creatinine by 50% over&#xD;
           baseline (last assessment prior to first TP10 dose), persistent for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), defined as any Grade 3 or higher AE&#xD;
           attributed to TP10 dosing, or any Grade 3 infection caused by encapsulated bacteria, not&#xD;
           responsive to appropriate medical intervention within 24 hours. Patients who experience&#xD;
           DLT but who are considered by the treating investigator to be potentially appropriate&#xD;
           for further TP10 treatment may be retreated only after consultation with, and agreement&#xD;
           from, the DMSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study is terminated (see early stopping rules).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Request of the patient or the patient's legal representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If, in the investigator's medical judgment, further participation would be injurious to&#xD;
           the patient's health or wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-compliance of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient lost to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Evaluation Safety Evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed by vital sign measurements, clinical laboratory tests, ECG (for&#xD;
      patients ≥ 35 years of age) and routine physical examinations, including physical growth for&#xD;
      children up to 18 years old and the incidence and severity of adverse events (graded&#xD;
      according to CTCAE v 4.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity Evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity of TP10 in C3G will be assessed via complement studies (including but not limited to&#xD;
      serum C3, serum C3 breakdown products, and alternate pathway activity), chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease stage, renal biopsy (C3 deposition in the glomerular basement membrane), and renal&#xD;
      function (proteinuria, serum creatinine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic Evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum concentrations of TP10 will be measured concurrently with serum C3, C3 breakdown&#xD;
      products, and alternative pathway complement activity in samples taken immediately before and&#xD;
      approximately 15 minutes after TP10 infusion. No pharmacokinetic parameters will be&#xD;
      determined in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunological Evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored for the development of antibodies to TP10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacodynamic Evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacodynamics of TP10 will be assayed by changes in serum C3, serum C3 breakdown products&#xD;
      and alternative pathway complement activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacogenomic Evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo genetic testing of CFH, C3, CFB and CFHR5; assays for C3Nef activity;&#xD;
      and screening for factor H autoantibodies (FHAA) and factor B autoantibodies (FBAA).&#xD;
