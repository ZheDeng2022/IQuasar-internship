    <textblock>
      Preoperative dexamethasone reduces symptoms after different surgical procedures including&#xD;
      mastectomy in breast cancer, but the effect in the postoperative respiratory function remains&#xD;
      unknown. The aim of this protocol was to determine if the administration of a single dose of&#xD;
      dexamethasone during the preoperative, could improve respiratory function and postoperative&#xD;
      symptoms of patients undergoing mastectomy in breast cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Controlled clinical trial will be performed in 120 surgical patients treated for breast&#xD;
      cancer, conducted from Nov 2014 to Nov 2015. Patients will be divided in three groups: Group&#xD;
      1 consisted in patients who underwent conservative breast with axillary lymph node&#xD;
      dissection, group 2 in patients with radical mastectomy without reconstruction, and group 3&#xD;
      patients with radical mastectomy with immediate reconstruction with synthetic breast&#xD;
      implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be randomly assigned by a system of sealed envelopes, to receive 8 mg of&#xD;
      intravenous dexamethasone or placebo 60 minutes before surgery. All patients will be female&#xD;
      and had a confirmed diagnosis of breast carcinoma. The investigators will exclude patients&#xD;
      with a classification of the American Society of Anesthesiologists classes III and IV. Other&#xD;
      exclusion criteria are: age 80 years, pregnancy or during menstruation, during steroid&#xD;
      therapy, severe diabetes mellitus (serum HbA1c&gt; 8%); opioids, sedatives or painkillers less&#xD;
      than a week before the mastectomy, or a history of alcohol or drugs. The investigators will&#xD;
      exclude patients with a history of inner ear disease and / or severe PONV after any surgical&#xD;
      procedure performed in the past. All patients will be admitted to hospital one day before&#xD;
      surgery and were followed from hospital admission and until 30 days after surgery for any&#xD;
      medical or surgical morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia and surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be standardized to the next anesthetic protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under venipuncture, patients receive 1 g of Cephalothin IV one hour before starting the&#xD;
      procedure. After entering the operating room, type 1 continuous monitoring was placed via&#xD;
      noninvasive, Midazolam will be administered via peripheral 0.1-0.2 mg/kg as well as fentanyl&#xD;
      1 mcg / kg IV. Prongs will be placed and basal hemodynamic values will be taken with&#xD;
      preoxygenation by tidal volume technique per minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction will be performed with Propofol 1-2 mg/kg IV and completed with fentanyl (3 mcg /&#xD;
      kg IV) along with the administration of Rocuronium 0.06 mg/kg IV. Assisted oxygenation&#xD;
      continues at a rate of 5 lpm and laryngeal mask (mask measure according to weight and body&#xD;
      distribution of the patient) is placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surgery, the medication will be completed with omeprazole 40 mg IV, Ondancetron 4 mg&#xD;
      IV. All patients will be monitored with indirect determinations of blood pressure and heart&#xD;
      rate using standard techniques, as well as the content of expired CO2 and oxygen saturation&#xD;
      of the blood. Subsequently, all patients will be extubated and transferred to the unit for&#xD;
      immediate post-surgical care with cardiovascular monitoring and oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Procedures All patients will be submitted to treatment according to the clinical&#xD;
      stage with conservative breast surgery with axillary dissection, radical mastectomy without&#xD;
      immediate reconstruction or radical mastectomy with immediate reconstruction with synthetic&#xD;
      implants. In case of radical mastectomy, a closed drainage system will be placed in the&#xD;
      chirurgic region, and will be removed when drainage is less than 50ml in 24 hours.&#xD;
      Chemotherapy or radiation therapy will be administered 3-4 weeks following surgical&#xD;
      resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analgesic and antiemetic therapy Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs will be used as&#xD;
      analgesia after surgery with sodium ketorolac 30 mg IV every 6 hours (in patients younger&#xD;
      than 60 years) or lysine Clonixinate 100 mg IV every 6 hours (in patients older than 60&#xD;
      years). Also, patients who will be submitted to a conservative surgery will receive&#xD;
      intravenous Tramadol 100mg (diluted in 50ml of solution); the dose may be repeated every 12&#xD;
      hours until. Repeated doses of Morphine of 2.5 mg IV will be used in case of radical&#xD;
      mastectomy, according to the needs of the patient. If pain is not diminish within 30 minutes&#xD;
      a VAS will be used and in case the scale is greater than 7, an infusion of 10mg of morphine&#xD;
      in 250ml 0.9% of saline solution will be used. Pain will be assessed on return to the&#xD;
      recovery room and at 6, 12 and 24 h postoperatively using a visual analogue scale (VAS; 0 =&#xD;
      no pain and 10 = most severe pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of PONV will be recorded immediately on return to the recovery room and at 6,&#xD;
      12 and 24 h postoperatively using a three-point ordinal scale (0 = asymptomatic, 1 = feeling&#xD;
      of nausea or tonnage without expulsion oral route of gastric contents 2 = vomiting). Nausea&#xD;
      is defined as a unpleasant sensation associated with awareness of the urge to vomit; retching&#xD;
      is defined as the labored, spasmodic rhythmic contraction of the respiratory muscles without&#xD;
      the expulsion of gastric contents, and vomiting is defined as the forceful expulsion of&#xD;
      gastric contents from the mouth. Ondancetron will be used IV (4-8 mg) to treat these&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary Function. To perform a spirometry, the ambient must comply the following&#xD;
      characteristics: environment without audio or visual shocks and thermal comfort for the&#xD;
      comfort of the patient. Patients will be told to sit in a comfortable position with your back&#xD;
      straight (at an angle greater than 45°, to patient tolerance) and high chin. Lightweight&#xD;
      support will be perform in the patient by taking her gently by the shoulders to keep them&#xD;
      lean forward and off balance grew. In the immediate postoperative and due to postoperative&#xD;
      pain, the patient will be settled in the stretcher to emulate the sitting position&#xD;
      (inclination greater than 45 °) performing the previously mentioned subject. The nature of&#xD;
      the study will be explained in understandable language to the patient, and their cooperation&#xD;
      will be requested. Forced espiratory maneuver will be explained and immediately exemplified&#xD;
      by the best qualified to understand the patient and to avoid measurement bias evaluator.&#xD;
      Special emphasis will be placed on the importance of starting the effort with the maximum&#xD;
      volume of air in the lungs, so determined and energetic, as well as maintaining exhalation as&#xD;
      long as possible. She will be asked to take the disposable cardboard mouthpiece adaptable to&#xD;
      pneumotachograph, sealing it with the lips in the position of maximal inspiration and then&#xD;
      blow air through it, initiating a sharp exhalation maneuver with the above characteristics.&#xD;
      To be a valid test, the maneuver should be performed with a proper effort, starting from the&#xD;
      position of maximal inspiration without hesitation or false start with a continuous&#xD;
      exhalation without corrections, cough or Valsalva maneuver, as well as checking for leaks&#xD;
      were recorded in nozzle. A total of three satisfactory maneuvers will be performed with a&#xD;
      maximum of eight attempts for each measurement, spaced at least for 30 seconds. To perform&#xD;
      the study, a &quot;Fleisch spirometer&quot; with brand Sibelmed® neumotac type model will be used&#xD;
      Datospir 110/120.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements of forced espiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC)&#xD;
      Maximum Forced Espiratory Flow (FEFM) and the ratio between forced espiratory volume in one&#xD;
      second and forced vital capacity will be taken into account (FEV1 / FVC). Such clinical&#xD;
      parameters are directly related to muscle fatigue, the compliance of the lung parenchyma and&#xD;
      respiratory status of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Postoperative complications will be recorded during hospitalization and&#xD;
      patients will be followed up to 30 days after hospital discharge. Data collected will include&#xD;
      patient age, body mass index (BMI), smoking history and neoadjuvant chemotherapy, anesthesia&#xD;
      and operation time and the frequency of use of analgesics and antiemetics. These parameters&#xD;
      will be added and compared between dexamethasone and placebo groups. The endpoints of the&#xD;
      study will be postoperative nausea and vomiting, and pain measured by the VAS and the need&#xD;
      for additional analgesia and antiemetic drugs as described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was predetermined. The investigators expect a 35% difference in the incidence&#xD;
      of nausea and vomiting between groups. The α error 0.05 and β error 0.20; n = 35 patients in&#xD;
      each group will be considered adequate, according to an analysis of power. All results eill&#xD;
      be expressed as percentages and means with standard deviation ± (SD). Student t test, Chi 2&#xD;
      of Fisher's exact test will be used to analyze quantitative and qualitative data,&#xD;
      respectively. Differences will be considered statistically significant at p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations This protocol has been registered with the Local Research and Ethics&#xD;
      Committee on Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted according to the principles of the Helsinki Declaration of 1989,&#xD;
      and with the Guidelines of Health of Mexico. The local research and ethics committee of&#xD;
      Health Research Ethics Committees of the Cancer Institute of Jalisco, Mexico approved all&#xD;
      protocols. A full written informed consent will be obtained from all patients before&#xD;
      inclusion in the study.&#xD;
