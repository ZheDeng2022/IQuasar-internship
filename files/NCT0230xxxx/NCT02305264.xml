  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we plan to image the compartmentalized inflammation in MS using molecular&#xD;
      imaging by positron emission tomography (PET) with a very highly resolutive camera. Two&#xD;
      tracers will be studied and compared: i) [18F]DPA-714, which bind to the peripheral&#xD;
      benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), a target mainly expressed by activated microglial cells. This&#xD;
      new ligand for PBR displays several advantages compared to the existing reference compound&#xD;
      PK11195 in term of brain entrance, signal to noise ratio, and radiolabelling possibility with&#xD;
      [18F] ii) [18F]-fluoro-desoxy-glucose ([18F]FDG), which should reflect glucose metabolism in&#xD;
      activated immune cells in the white matter. Progressive MS patients (secondary progressive&#xD;
      and primary progressive) will be compared to relapsing-remitting patients and to healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. All subjects will pass a complete neurological evaluation and a multimodal MRI to&#xD;
      document clinical disability and tissue injury. A clinical and radiological follow up will&#xD;
      then be performed for a 2-year period. This study should help to understand the contribution&#xD;
      of the intracerebral inflammation on the progression of disability and could provide a&#xD;
      surrogate marker for further therapeutic trials in chronic progressive MS.&#xD;

      Study design This study is a prospective cross-sectional controlled multicentric clinical&#xD;
      study in 45 MS patients and 20 controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four groups of person will be included and compared:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group I: 20 healthy volunteers aging from 18 to 65 years. These healthy volunteers will&#xD;
           be matched for age and sex with patients (1/2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group II: 15 patients aging from 18 to 65 years with relapsing-remitting (RRMS), with&#xD;
           less than 10 years of evolution since the first manifestation and no recent relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group III: 15 patients aging from 18 to 65 years with secondary progressive MS (SPMS),&#xD;
           with less than 10 years of evolution since the occurrence of the secondary progressive&#xD;
           phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group III: 15 patients aging from 18 to 65 years with primary progressive MS (PPMS)&#xD;
           diagnosed since less than 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study centres MS patients and the 20 healthy volunteers will be recruited in the Hospital&#xD;
      Pitie-Salpetriere&#xD;
&#xD;
      MS patients will be recruited in the Hospital Tenon&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be performed by complementary teams already collaborating on molecular&#xD;
      imaging trials in MS (which assess neuronal loss or demyelination/remyelination): i) the&#xD;
      &quot;Centre d'Investigation Clinique&quot; (Salpetriere hospital, Paris), which is strongly&#xD;
      experienced in the coordination of clinical and translational research on MS; ii) the CENIR&#xD;
      (centre for neuroimaging research, Salpetriere hospital, Paris) a specialized MRI centre for&#xD;
      research on neurological diseases; iii) the SHFJ (DSV, CEA, ORSAY) which is a world class&#xD;
      molecular imaging centre;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration Per patient the study will last two years Per control the study will last up&#xD;
      to 8 weeks&#xD;
