      In this study the investigators are testing if the addition of Stereotactic Body Radiation&#xD;
      therapy (SBRT) prior to surgery improves surgical outcome in patients with borderline&#xD;
      resectable or resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm prospective phase I dose escalation radiation study investigating&#xD;
      5-fraction stereotactic radiotherapy prior to planned surgical resection in borderline&#xD;
      resectable or resectable pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical resection is the only potentially curative technique for managing pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
      However more than 80% of patients present with disease that cannot be cured with surgical&#xD;
      resection. Negative margin (R0 resection), tumour size, absence of lymph nodes metastases are&#xD;
      the strongest prognostic indicators for long term survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a radiation technique for pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      where an ablative dose of radiotherapy (RT) can be delivered to a small volume targeting the&#xD;
      at risk surgical margin in a short time (1 week versus 5-6 weeks for standard radiotherapy),&#xD;
      achieving much higher biologically equivalent dose (BED) (100Gy versus 50Gy) than&#xD;
      conventionally fractionated radical RT. The short time of delivery and minimal acute toxicity&#xD;
      makes this an attractive treatment option in BPRC as offers the opportunity to integrate&#xD;
      systemic treatment. With standard fractionation schedules larger volumes of normal tissue are&#xD;
      usually irradiated than with SBRT and an effective dose is limited by toxicity despite the&#xD;
      use of Intensity Modulated RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study builds on the current evidence base in SBRT pancreas, which has so far been&#xD;
      largely used in the locally advanced setting with promising results and aims to take it a&#xD;
      step further. This study aims to test the safety and benefit of pre-operative SBRT,&#xD;
      delivering very high local doses to the at risk surgical margin which is usually around the&#xD;
      main vessels in the retroperitoneum. The concept of margin-intensive therapy is novel, and&#xD;
      aims to deliver a higher radiation dose while limiting toxicity to organs at risk.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators expect to need a maximum of 3 dose levels investigating dose to the area at risk of involved resection lines and to the tumour bed to assess the tolerability of SBRT in this setting.&#xD;
Patient entry will commence at level 1. There is the option to de-escalate to Level -1 should 2 or more DLTs be observed at the starting level. SBRT will not be escalated above level 3.&#xD;
Level -1:&#xD;
Tumour (PTV) 6Gy/# (total dose 30Gy). Area at risk of R1 (PTV_R) 8Gy/# (total dose 40Gy)&#xD;
