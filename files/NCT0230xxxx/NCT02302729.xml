  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 200 million children under the age of 5 years in low and middle-income countries do not&#xD;
      reach their developmental potential, largely due to lack of adequate nutrients and lack of&#xD;
      psychosocial stimulation. Stunting (length-for-age &lt; -2 z-scores) is an indication of chronic&#xD;
      undernutrition. Guatemala has the high rates of stunting in the Western Hemisphere (over&#xD;
      40%). This trial examines the effect of providing a micronutrient powder manufactured in&#xD;
      Guatemala vs. placebo and an early learning environment vs. no early learning environment on&#xD;
      the growth, health, and development of young children in Guatemala.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The plan is to implement a clustered randomized placebo controlled trial with an infant phase&#xD;
      (6-12 months of age) and a preschool phase (36-48 months of age). For the infant phase, the&#xD;
      investigators will use ProPAN (Process for the Promotion of Child Feeding) in the development&#xD;
      of the evaluation and intervention, with modifications as necessary for the Guatemalan&#xD;
      context. ProPAN is a tool developed and distributed by the Pan American Health Organization&#xD;
      to develop, implement, and evaluate interventions and programs to improve infant and young&#xD;
      child diet and feeding. ProPAN includes four modules:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Module 1: Assessment Module 2: Testing Recipes and Recommendations Module 3: Intervention&#xD;
      Module 4: Monitoring and Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the preschool phase, the investigators will use an evidence-based school readiness&#xD;
      intervention (Little By Little) that has been shown to be effective with Hispanic&#xD;
      preschoolers. The intervention will be implemented through the Association for the Prevention&#xD;
      and Study of HIV/AIDS who will train and supervise the community health workers. By working&#xD;
      directly with a local non-profit organization, the project will be well positioned to inform&#xD;
      strategies to scale up the intervention on a community wide basis, if beneficial effects are&#xD;
      shown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project examines the effects of an integrated intervention that includes both&#xD;
      micronutrient powder added to food and responsive feeding for infants or school readiness for&#xD;
      preschoolers. The primary aim is to examine how an integrated micronutrients + responsive&#xD;
      feeding/school readiness intervention changes the development (primary outcome), growth and&#xD;
      micronutrient status (secondary outcomes) of young children. The investigators will focus on&#xD;
      infants (6-12 months) when the risk for micronutrient deficiencies is high, as they&#xD;
      transition from breast feeding to complementary feeding and the family diet. The&#xD;
      investigators will focus on preschoolers (36-48 months) to examine if micronutrients + a&#xD;
      school readiness intervention can improve children's school readiness skills. The design&#xD;
      includes neighborhood clusters randomized into four groups: 1) micronutrients plus responsive&#xD;
      feeding/school readiness 2) micronutrients only, 3) placebo plus responsive feeding/school&#xD;
      readiness, and 4) placebo only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Children in the two micronutrients groups have better change from baseline in&#xD;
           development (primary outcome), growth and micronutrient status (secondary oitcomes),&#xD;
           than children in the two placebo groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mothers and children in the two responsive feeding/school readiness groups have better&#xD;
           change from baseline measures of child development than those in the two control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The impact of the responsive feeding/school readiness intervention is greater in the&#xD;
           micronutrient groups than in the placebo groups. Children in the micronutrients plus&#xD;
           responsive feeding/school readiness group have better change from baseline in&#xD;
           development than children in any of the other three groups.&#xD;

    <description>Strategy&#xD;
Mother ensures that feeding area is set up with infant and mother able to see one another.&#xD;
Mother mirrors the infant's facial expressions to attract the infant's attention.&#xD;
Mother interprets infant's behavior with a positive voice, &quot;Oh, you like the spinach.&quot; Mother extends infant's behavior by saying, &quot;Oh the cereal is all gone&quot; and doing a consistent hand signal Mother models eating, makes positive comments in a nurturing tone. Mother offers finger food or use of utensil</description>
