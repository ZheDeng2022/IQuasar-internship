    <textblock>
      210 women with clomiphene resistant PCOS will be randomly divided into 3 equal groups using&#xD;
      computer generated random numbers. Group 1 will receive FSH, group 2 will have Letrozole and&#xD;
      group 3 will act as the control group with no intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in reproductive age,&#xD;
      with an incidence of 5 -10%. Classically clomiphene citrate (CC) is the first approach to&#xD;
      induce ovulation in patients with PCOS. Although 70-80% of PCOS women can ovulate by the&#xD;
      treatment with CC, only 40%of the PCOS women become pregnant. Women who do not ovulate with&#xD;
      increasing doses of CC are described as being CC-resistant and remain a major challenge in&#xD;
      gynecologic endocrinology. Traditional alternatives for CC-resistant patients include&#xD;
      gonadotropin therapy and laparoscopic ovarian diathermy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gonadotropin therapy is widely used for ovulation induction in CC-resistant PCOS patients.&#xD;
      The use of purified FSH preparation virtually free of LH activity, is a recommendable&#xD;
      treatment since there is evidence that pure FSH may significantly reduce tonic LH levels,&#xD;
      favourably alter the intraovarian hormonal milieu, and promote the initial follicular&#xD;
      development with minimal risk of multiple follicular growth or ovarian hyperstimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of metformin in PCOS is associated with cycle regulation, improved ovulation, and a&#xD;
      reduction in circulating androgen levels. Metformin likely plays its role in improving&#xD;
      ovulation induction in women with PCOS through a variety of actions, including reducing&#xD;
      insulin levels and altering the effect of insulin on ovarian androgen biosynthesis, theca&#xD;
      cell proliferation, and endometrial growth. In addition, potentially through a direct effect,&#xD;
      it inhibits ovarian gluconeogenesis and thus reduces ovarian androgen production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Letrozole is an orally-active aromatase inhibitor, with good potential for ovulation&#xD;
      induction. Letrozole acts by reducing estrogen production by blocking androgens to estrogens&#xD;
      conversion. Additionally, it has no adverse effect on endometrium and cervical mucus (7).&#xD;
      This releases the pituitary from negative feedback of estrogens and releases FSH. Also, an&#xD;
      added positive effect is increased follicular sensitivity to FSH through amplification of FSH&#xD;
      receptor gene expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyper-insulinemia, which is closely associated with PCOS, is thought to be one of the&#xD;
      causative factors for CC resistance. The prevalence of insulin resistance in PCOS is close to&#xD;
      50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women with clomiphene resistant PCOS attending the subfertility clinic of Cairo&#xD;
      university hospitals will be invited to participate in the study. PCOS diagnosis will be&#xD;
      based on chronic anovulation and sonographic picture of polycystic ovaries (10). Clomiphene&#xD;
      resistance will be defined as failure of ovulation in spite of receiving 150mg of clomiphene&#xD;
      citrate for 5 days during the menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are age &gt;40 years, other causes of infertility, hperprolactinaemia,&#xD;
      allergy to FSH or metformin, previous FSH or LOD therapy, and body mass index (BMI)&gt;35.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be explained to all the participants and a written informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained before participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full history will be taken followed by complete examination and sonographic evaluation.&#xD;
      Sonographic picture of polycystic ovaries will be defined when there are at least 12&#xD;
      follicles 2-9mm in the ovary and/or ovarian volume&gt;10cm3 (10) 210 women with clomiphene&#xD;
      resistant PCOS will be randomly divided into 3 equal groups using computer generated random&#xD;
      numbers. Group 1 will receive FSH, group 2 will have Letrozole and group 3 will act as the&#xD;
      control group with no intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will receive urinary purified FSH (Fostimon® IBSA, Switzerland) 75IU daily for 7 days&#xD;
      starting from the 3rd day of menstruation or progesterone withdrawal bleeding. If the&#xD;
      follicle does not exceed 9mm the dose will be increased by 37.5IU every 7 days. The cycle&#xD;
      will be cancelled if no follicles exceed 9mm 4 weeks after starting FSH. Group 2 will receive&#xD;
      Letrozole (Femara®, Novartis, Switzerland) 2.5mg twice daily for 5 days starting from the 3rd&#xD;
      day of menstruation or progesterone withdrawal bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 will have regular progesterone withdrawal bleeding in the form of norethisterone&#xD;
      (stereonate® Hi Pharm, Egypt).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial vaginal ultrasound scans were done starting from the 10th day of menstruation, the&#xD;
      frequency of monitoring will be individualized according to the women's response. When the&#xD;
      dominant follicle reaches 17mm or more women will receive Human chorionic gonadotrophin&#xD;
      (Choriomon® IBSA, Switzerland) 5000IU and a timed intercourse will be advised 36 hours later.&#xD;
