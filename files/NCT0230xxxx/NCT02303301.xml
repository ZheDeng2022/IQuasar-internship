      Hospitalised patients have in contrast to healthy people enteric pathogenic bacteria in their&#xD;
      oropharynx Increased risk of pneumonia due to the pathogens in the oropharynx Probiotics can&#xD;
      reduce such bacteria in intubated critically ill patients This study will use two strain of&#xD;
      probiotic bacteria for half of the patients and a placebo for the rest Active arm gurgles&#xD;
      with a suspension twice a day Cultures at inclusion and at set time intervals The results of&#xD;
      cultures from the two groups will be compared as will the use of antibiotics&#xD;

    <textblock>
      When patients are admitted to hospital some of them are already colonized in the oropharynx&#xD;
      with pathogens that are normally found as commensal or possible pathogens in the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract. This is probably a consequence of the illness that is the cause of&#xD;
      their hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients admitted to hospital are elderly. Those patients often have their natural&#xD;
      functions down regulated including their ability to secure their airway from aspiration.&#xD;
      Acute illness whether you are old or young leads to changes in the intestinal microbiological&#xD;
      flora. Bacteria normally found in the colon or distal ileum frequently appear in the stomach&#xD;
      and more alarming in the oropharynx. Weakened by the illness, acute or chronic, there is an&#xD;
      increased risk of aspiration and when there are pathogenic bacteria in the oropharynx,&#xD;
      aspiration is likely to induce pneumonia - health related pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For intubated ICU patients we have demonstrated a reduction of colonization with enteric&#xD;
      bacteria by applying probiotics in the mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a screening period to find out what groups of patients that are most vulnerable, we&#xD;
      will in a randomised way give probiotics to half of the included patients and to the other&#xD;
      patients only the filling material (maltodextrin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this procedure our aim is to show a reduction of pathogens in the oropharynx and as a&#xD;
      secondary outcome we hope to see a reduction of pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples for microbiological analysis will be taken during the first day of admission to&#xD;
      hospital and then at specified intervals.&#xD;
