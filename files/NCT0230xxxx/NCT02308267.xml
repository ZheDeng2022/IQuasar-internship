      This project entitled &quot;Impaired secretory IgA and mucosal immunity in cystic fibrosis&quot; is a&#xD;
      research program which aims to determine, owing to national (KULeuven) and international&#xD;
      (Descartes university Paris, university of Torino) collaborations for expertise and access to&#xD;
      human material, whether a defect exists for the production of IgA antibodies in the lung from&#xD;
      patients with this serious genetic disease. These antibodies line and protect normally the&#xD;
      airways, and are secreted through a specific epithelial receptor called pIgR (polymeric&#xD;
      immunoglobulin receptor); its expression and regulation will be studied in lung tissue and in&#xD;
      cell cultures of the lung epithelium from these patients. The link between the putative IgA&#xD;
      defect and chronic bacterial infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which often complicates&#xD;
      the evolution of the disease, will also be evaluated ex vivo and in vivo, in an animal model&#xD;
      of lung infection.&#xD;

      Impaired secretory IgA and mucosal immunity in cystic fibrosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      role of CFTR-related epithelial changes in the regulation of pIgR-mediated IgA transcytosis&#xD;
      and contribution to lung pathology and impaired defence against bacterial infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECT DESCRIPTION Cystic fibrosis (CF) represents the most common lethal autosomal&#xD;
      recessive disorder in the white population, mainly affecting the lungs. Twenty-four years&#xD;
      after the identification of the gene responsible for the disease, many questions remain,&#xD;
      current treatments are symptomatic and it remains a lethal disease. It affects the Cystic&#xD;
      Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes a protein expressed on the apical&#xD;
      membrane of airway epithelial cells, where it acts as a cAMP-dependent chloride channel and&#xD;
      regulator of other channels, including the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). Mutations of the&#xD;
      CFTR (F508del, 70% of cases) either result in malfunction or complete absence of the CFTR&#xD;
      protein at the apical membrane, due to protein misfolding and retention in the endoplasmic&#xD;
      reticulum. It results in defects in chloride efflux and hydration of the epithelial lining&#xD;
      fluid, resulting in abnormally viscous mucus which may obstruct the airways, the intestinal&#xD;
      lumen and glandular ducts (e.g. in the pancreas). CFTR dysfunction also leads to&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory activation (e.g. through NFkB) of the epithelium, resulting in CXCL8/IL8&#xD;
      release (Sloane et al, 2005) and impaired production of protective factors such as&#xD;
      a-defensins. Airway colonization of the airways and lung infections are a hallmark of this&#xD;
      disease, in particular with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) that affects 70% of CF patients and&#xD;
      is associated with poor clinical outcomes. However, the mechanisms underlying the persistence&#xD;
      of pathogens in CF airways, remain largely unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to investigate whether the production of secretory IgA (S-IgA) is impaired&#xD;
      in the CF lung, through which mechanisms, and whether this defect contributes to the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of CF by impairing immunoprotection against respiratory pathogens such as PA.&#xD;
      S-IgA is a major line of mucosal defense, through so-called immune exclusion of inhaled /&#xD;
      ingested antigens and pathogens (Norderhaug et al, 1999). Following synthesis of polymeric&#xD;
      (mainly dimeric) IgA by subepithelial mucosal plasma cells, p-IgA is transported across the&#xD;
      epithelium by a transcellular routing mediated by the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor&#xD;
      (pIgR). P-IgA binds to the pIgR at the basolateral pole of the epithelium, and is&#xD;
      transcytosed up to the apical pole, where a proteolytic cleavage releases the extracellular&#xD;
      part of the pIgR, called secretory component (SC) which remains bound to p-IgA to form S-IgA.&#xD;
      This transport represents the most important transcellular routing in the body (3g/day).&#xD;
      S-IgA is mainly produced upon mucosal stimulation by microbial signals acting through&#xD;
      Toll-like receptors on epithelial cells and B cells (MacPherson et al, 2008) while cytokines&#xD;
      (IFN-g, IL-4, IL-1 or TNF-a) may upregulate pIgR expression and/or transcytosis (see review&#xD;
      Pilette et al, 2001a).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A defect of pIgR expression has been identified in smoke-induced chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (COPD) (Pilette et al, 2001b). Reduced pIgR in COPD could be due to&#xD;
      degradation by neutrophil-derived serine proteinases (Pilette et al, 2003), as well as to&#xD;
      impaired gene transcription (Gohy &amp; Pilette, submitted manuscript). In contrast to COPD, it&#xD;
      remains unclear whether pIgR expression is affected in CF, through which mechanisms, and if&#xD;
      so, with which consequences in terms of mucosal defense. Our hypothesis is that pIgR&#xD;
      expression is reduced in CF epithelia, as a result of CFTR-related epithelial changes, and&#xD;
      leads to impaired IgA-mediated immune exclusion of respiratory pathogens, thereby favoring&#xD;
      chronic bacterial colonization and lung infections in CF. The specific objectives of this&#xD;
      project are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to evaluate pIgR &amp; IgA expression in bronchial tissue from CF patients, as compared to&#xD;
           controls. This will be performed both in lung explants from CF patients with end-stage&#xD;
           lung disease (11 from KULeuven and 18 from Paris, already collected; as compared to 7&#xD;
           explants from controls and to lung surgical specimens from non-smokers) and in bronchial&#xD;
           biopsies (n=8) and BAL (2x50mL) sampled during pre-transplantation bronchoscopies&#xD;
           (prospective sampling, KULeuven). Control subjects will be patients without CF and&#xD;
           without evidence of lung disease and who are undergoing narcosis for an independent&#xD;
           reason at the KULeuven centre. In addition, a series of sputum (from CF and control&#xD;
           patients) will also be analyzed. Control subjects will consist of COPD patients and&#xD;
           healthy subjects (smokers or not). Moreover, nasosinusal and rectal biopsies from CF&#xD;
           will also be obtained, in order to investigate mucosal CF tissues outside of the lung&#xD;
           environment. Readouts will consist of pIgR expression at both gene (RT-qPCR) and protein&#xD;
           (immunohistochemistry, western blot) levels, as well as for IgA (immunohistochemistry,&#xD;
           RT-qPCR for IgA1 and IgA2). In addition, (S-)IgA and SC will be measured in bronchial&#xD;
           lavage fluids and in sputum.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Globally, we expected if possible to analyse 30 explants, 30 endoscopies and 150 sputum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to evaluate S-IgA antibodies to respiratory bacteria in CF airways: The relevance of&#xD;
           S-IgA deficiency in CF will be assessed with regard to microbial colonisation of lower&#xD;
           airways. First, correlation between low S-IgA levels (both total IgA and&#xD;
           pathogen-specific IgA) and colonisation by pathogens - in particular PA - will be tested&#xD;
           in sputum and bronchial lavage fluids from CF patients. In addition, in lung explants a&#xD;
           regional/spatial relationship between S-IgA defect and PA staining will also be&#xD;
           addressed. Second, PA-specific IgA antibodies will be assayed in bronchial lavage and&#xD;
           sputum fluids, and correlated to colonisation data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to evaluate the contribution of S-IgA defect to lung pathology in CFTR KO mice: The&#xD;
           potential contribution of S-IgA deficiency to CF lung disease will be assessed in vivo,&#xD;
           using CFTR KO mice. As these KO mice do not recapitulate the human CF phenotype, we will&#xD;
           take advantage of our pilot observation that repeated LPS exposure - which leads to a&#xD;
           COPD-like phenotype (Juanita et al, 2002) - results in pIgR/SC downregulation (see&#xD;
           &quot;Results obtained&quot;). We will thus evaluate whether pIgR deficiency induced upon chronic&#xD;
           LPS exposure promotes in CFTR KO mice the development of a lung pathology with CF&#xD;
           features. Accordingly, double (CFTR, pIgR) KO mice could be generated to directly&#xD;
           address the contribution of pIgR deficiency to lung pathology in conjunction to CFTR&#xD;
           mutation. In addition, a second model mimicking persistent PA infection (Martin et al,&#xD;
           2011) will be used to address the effects of PA in CFTR and/or pIgR KO mice. Beta-eNaC&#xD;
           Tg mice have a baseline lung pathology and could also be obtained and infected by a&#xD;
           model of PA infection (microbeads, Pr Burgel). Readouts will include histomorphological&#xD;
           and biomolecular analyses (inflammatory and cytokine responses), and lung function tests&#xD;
           (FlexiVent).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to explore mechanisms of pIgR downregulation in the CF epithelium: As CFBE 41o-cell line&#xD;
           (expressing wt or mutant F508del CFTR; Bruscia et al, 2002) do not express significant&#xD;
           levels of pIgR (see &quot;Results obtained&quot;), primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC)&#xD;
           will be used to assess whether pIgR downregulation is maintained in the CF epithelium&#xD;
           cultured in vitro. Primary cultures in air-liquid interface (ALI) of HBEC will be&#xD;
           carried out from CF patients, as compared to controls (up-and-running protocol in the&#xD;
           PI's lab in COPD; cells from EpithelixR will also be used; as well as nasal cells from&#xD;
           CF (de Courcey et al, 2012)). ALI cultures allow evaluating cellular functions in a&#xD;
           polarized and reconstituted muco-ciliary airway epithelium, either resting or stimulated&#xD;
           by LPS and/or IL-1. If pIgR expression is also decreased in the CF epithelium in vitro,&#xD;
           it could relate to either the CFTR gene defect and/or to epigenetic memory of the in&#xD;
           vivo imprinting of the epithelium by the inflammatory microenvironment. We will thus&#xD;
           distinguish these possibilities by using CFTR inhibitors (CFTR-inh172, PPQ-102; Martin&#xD;
           et al, 2013). Another post-transcriptional mechanism of pIgR dysfunction include its&#xD;
           wrong addressing to the cell membrane: the relationship between disturbed expression of&#xD;
           each receptor (apical CFTR, basal pIgR) will be evaluated. Readouts will include pIgR&#xD;
           expression assessed by immunostaining (of filters) and western blot, and by RT-qPCR. The&#xD;
           function of the pIgR will be tested by measuring the capacity of the ALI epithelium to&#xD;
           transcytose dimeric IgA from the basolateral to the apical compartment. Membrane&#xD;
           addressing of CFTR (apical) and pIgR (basal) will be studied by confocal microscopy.&#xD;
