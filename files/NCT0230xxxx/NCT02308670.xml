      The primary aim of this study is to observe the effect of switching from daily injections of&#xD;
      20mg glatiramer acetate (GA) (20mg/daily) to GA 40mg three times a week (40mg x 3/weekly) on&#xD;
      thalamus pathology, as measured by changes in diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) in patients with&#xD;
      relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). We hypothesize that GA 40mg x 3/weekly will&#xD;
      exert similar, if not better effect on prevention of thalamic pathology, as compared to GA&#xD;
      20mg/daily. The secondary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of switching&#xD;
      from GA 20mg/daily to GA 40mg x 3/weekly on evolution of microstructural changes in normal&#xD;
      appearing white matter (NAWM) and normal appearing gray matter (NAGM), as measured by DTI.&#xD;
