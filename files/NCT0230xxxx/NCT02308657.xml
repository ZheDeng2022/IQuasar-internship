  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the best ways to assess how people are affected by&#xD;
      myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). The study will assess walking speed, muscle strength, muscle&#xD;
      size, myotonia, heart rhythm, mental efficiency, and overall health. Participants will&#xD;
      complete questionnaires to record their ideas about how they are affected by DM1. The study&#xD;
      will evaluate people with DM1 over 1 year to determine how the condition changes over time.&#xD;
      The study will identify biomarkers of DM1. Biomarkers are laboratory measurements that show&#xD;
      the effects of DM1 on a person's muscle tissue or blood. Biomarkers are needed in future&#xD;
      studies to determine how DM1 may respond to treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in the study will come to the study site for 3 study visits. Each visit will&#xD;
      take most of the day. Each visit will include a series of evaluations to determine how the&#xD;
      person is affected by myotonic dystrophy. The results from the initial study visit will be&#xD;
      compared to the second study visit after 3 months and the third study visit after 1 year. A&#xD;
      small needle biopsy of a leg muscle will be performed at the first and second study visits&#xD;
      (but not at the third visit). After the second study visit, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      make a phone call every day for 30 days to report their symptoms and muscle strength (grip&#xD;
      strength).&#xD;

      Blood samples will be used for routine laboratory testing, such as tests of blood cells,&#xD;
      chemistry, and ability to form blood clots. Blood samples will be used for genetic testing&#xD;
      (DNA testing) and to identify biomarkers. Needle muscle biopsies will be obtained from the&#xD;
      tibialis anterior, a muscle in the front of the leg, next to the shin.&#xD;

        Approximately 100 adult patients (18 to 70 years old, inclusive) with DM1 will be enrolled&#xD;
