      The study aims at screening Israeli Arab men, smokers or past smokers, for abdominal aortic&#xD;
      aneurysms (AAA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening is to be performed at the family doctors clinics in the rural arab erea of the&#xD;
      north of Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim at revealing the actual prevalence of AAA in the Israeli Arab smoking&#xD;
      men population. By revealing this prevalence we believe the need for a nation-wide screening&#xD;
      program for AAA will turn available for assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the goal of improving the accessibility of health services for the Israeli Arab&#xD;
      population is a key issue in the design of the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2000 patients are to be enrolled in the study over a period of 2 years. Each of the patients&#xD;
      will be examined once for a duplex ultra-sound and will be classified into one of 4&#xD;
      sub-groups according to the maximal aortic diameter found.&#xD;

      Study Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the United States ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are the 15th leading cause of&#xD;
      death overall and the 10th leading cause of death in men older than 55 years. The prevalence&#xD;
      of AAA found in population-based ultrasonography (US) screening studies from various&#xD;
      countries is about 4-9% in men and 1% in women older than 65yr.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If left untreated, the aneurysm continues to expand; thinning of the aortic wall ensues and&#xD;
      rupture may eventually occur. Most of large AAA are asymptomatic and often rupture occurs&#xD;
      with no warning signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mortality due to rupture of an aortic aneurysm is high (80-90%), compared to 5-7% in elective&#xD;
      surgery for AAA repair and even lower when treated by endovascular means (1-2%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultra-sound can reliably demonstrate the aorta in 99% of the population, and its sensitivity&#xD;
      and specificity in diagnosing AAA approaches 95-100%. Screening with Ultra-sound for AAA has&#xD;
      been proved in multiple studies to reduce AAA related mortality by an average of 42% in the&#xD;
      screened population compared with the non-screened population. The reduction in mortality was&#xD;
      achieved in a cost effective way. Based on such studies a number of screening programs have&#xD;
      been implemented in the United Kingdom (UK), United States (USA), Scotland and Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for today there is no screening program for AAA in Israel. The investigators would like to&#xD;
      conduct a study in a specific group of the population demonstrating the need for screening in&#xD;
      such group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major risk factors for AAA include Age (&gt;65 years), male gender and a history of ever&#xD;
      smoking. It has been demonstrated that smoking rates among Israeli Arab men are significantly&#xD;
      higher than those of Israeli Jewish men. Most of the Israeli Arab population inhabits rural&#xD;
      areas with less access to hospitals and medical centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators decided to conduct a prospective study in which Israeli Arab men&#xD;
      between the ages 60-80 years old, with a history of smoking, will undergo an ultra-sound&#xD;
      examination for screening for AAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals The investigators aim at revealing the actual prevalence of AAA in the Israeli Arab&#xD;
      smoking men population. By revealing this prevalence the investigators believe the need for a&#xD;
      nation-wide screening program for AAA will turn available for assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the goal of improving the accessibility of health services for the Israeli Arab&#xD;
      population is a key issue in the design of the research. Performing the screening ultra-sound&#xD;
      in the family-physician's clinics (see below under &quot;Research Design&quot;) will save the patients&#xD;
      the time and the trouble involved with being examined in the central vascular clinics. It&#xD;
      will also improve the knowledge and awareness of the population in general and of the&#xD;
      family-physicians in particular of the AAA disease and for the need of early diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment as mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Last but not least, the private benefit of each patient either from ruling out the option of&#xD;
      having an AAA or from diagnosis of an AAA and referral to treatment is a valuable by-product&#xD;
      of the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design 2000 men (according to the inclusion criteria) are planned to be included in&#xD;
      the &quot;screening study&quot; over a period of one year to two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The family-physicians of the Haifa and Western Galilee district, Clalit Health Services will&#xD;
      be notified by the head researcher about the research. The organization will be asked to&#xD;
      provide a list of potential patients according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The&#xD;
      list will only include patients whom the physician had addressed and whom had given their&#xD;
      approval for being approached by the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will then be invited for a meeting with one of the researchers at the&#xD;
      family-physician clinic. After a full explanation will be given, an informed consent form&#xD;
      will be signed by the patient. Each patient will be documented on a Case Report Form (CRF)&#xD;
      and will be given a code for the rest of the research. The coding system is aimed at securing&#xD;
      the confidentiality of the patients' personal and medical information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then after, with the help of the technician a Duplex Ultra-sound examination of the abdominal&#xD;
      aorta will be performed. Since the examination is performed after a 6 hours fasting period,&#xD;
      the fasting instruction will be given to the patients in advance. The results of the scans&#xD;
      will be recorded in each patient Case Report Form (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be classified according to the Duplex US findings into one of 4 sub-groups&#xD;
      as detailed under &quot;End-Points&quot;. A recommendation for further follow-up or treatment will be&#xD;
      given to each patient and will be documented in his CRF accordingly. The results of the scan&#xD;
      and the recommendations will be sent the patient and to his family-physician within a short&#xD;
      period following the exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is to be made clear both hereby and in the informed consent form that the consent of the&#xD;
      patient to participate in the research bares no further obligations to follow the&#xD;
      recommendations of the research team nor to be followed-up or treated under the umbrella of&#xD;
      the vascular service of Haifa and Western Galilee district, Clalit Health Services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-the-less, each of the patients is entitled for full follow-up and treatment by the&#xD;
      vascular service of Haifa and Western Galilee district, Clalit Health Services regardless of&#xD;
      his consent to participate in the research or to follow the research team recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be documented digitally in a separate research file. A copy of the informed&#xD;
      consent will be given to patient. The same document will be scanned and filed in the patients&#xD;
      research file. The file will also contain the CRF and the exam results.&#xD;
