      This is a Phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended&#xD;
      phase II dose of D2C7-IT (D2C7 Immunotoxin) when delivered intratumorally by&#xD;
      convection-enhanced delivery (CED) to recurrent World Health Organization (WHO) grade III and&#xD;
      IV malignant glioma patients, and/or to determine what dose will be considered in a Phase II&#xD;
      trial. Patients with recurrent WHO grade III and IV malignant glioma who meet eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will be enrolled into the study. Immediately following the stereotactically-guided&#xD;
      tumor biopsy conducted as standard of care, up to three additional core biopsies will be&#xD;
      obtained for molecular genetic testing. After these biopsies are obtained, subjects will have&#xD;
      up to 2 catheters inserted. If the biopsy indicates a proven diagnosis of recurrent malignant&#xD;
      glioma (diagnosis results are typically received within 24-48 hours following biopsy), the&#xD;
      investigators will proceed with the D2C7-IT infusion. If no tumor is identified, the&#xD;
      catheters will be removed. A continuous intratumoral infusion of D2C7-IT will be administered&#xD;
      over 72 hours while in the hospital.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of D2C7-IT, when&#xD;
      delivered intratumorally by convection-enhanced delivery (CED) following confirmatory&#xD;
      diagnostic biopsy in recurrent World Health Organization (WHO) grade III and IV malignant&#xD;
      glioma patients, and/or to determine what dose will be considered in a phase II trial. The&#xD;
      patient will remain in the hospital during the entire infusion. At the completion of the&#xD;
      infusion, the catheters will be removed within 6 hours and a CT scan will be obtained after&#xD;
      the catheters are pulled. The patient will be observed in hospital for a minimum of another 6&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-stage continual reassessment method (CRM) design will be used to determine the MTD of&#xD;
      D2C7-IT where the first stage involves dose escalation in successive patients until an&#xD;
      initial dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed. Cohorts of 2 patients will be accrued to&#xD;
      this study within both stages of the trial. The first patient of each cohort will be observed&#xD;
      through the completion of the D2C7-IT infusion, before additional patients in that cohort are&#xD;
      treated. Once the optimal dose level of D2C7-IT is determined (dose escalation completed), a&#xD;
      total of 27 recurrent patients with WHO grade IV malignant glioma patients will be treated at&#xD;
      that dose level as a dose expansion cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following D2C7-IT infusion, subjects will be evaluated in clinic at 2 weeks for adverse&#xD;
      events and followed at 4 and 8 weeks and every 8 weeks thereafter until 48 weeks.&#xD;

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/µl unsupported is necessary for eligibility on the&#xD;
                  study; however, because of risks of intracranial hemorrhage with catheter&#xD;
                  placement, platelet count ≥ 125,000/µl is required for the patient to undergo&#xD;
                  biopsy and catheter insertion, which can be attained with the help of platelet&#xD;
                  transfusion;&#xD;

                  thrombosis/embolism are allowed to be on anticoagulation, understanding that&#xD;
                  anti-coagulation will be held in the peri-operative period per the neurosurgical&#xD;
                  team's recommendations. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is preferred. If a&#xD;

                  female of child bearing potential, the patient must agree to use appropriate&#xD;
                  contraceptive measures for the duration of the treatment of the tumor and for 6&#xD;
                  months afterwards as stated in the informed consent. Female patients of child&#xD;
                  bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at the time of&#xD;
