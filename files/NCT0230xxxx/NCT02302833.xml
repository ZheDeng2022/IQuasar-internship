  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies how well cabozantinib s-malate works in treating patients&#xD;
      with pheochromocytomas or paragangliomas that have spread from the primary site to other&#xD;
      places in the body and cannot be removed by surgery. Cabozantinib s-malate may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking&#xD;
      the growth of new blood vessels necessary for tumor growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate best overall response rate in patients with measurable disease determined by&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate progression-free survival at 1-year. II. To correlate blood pressure control&#xD;
      and change/discontinuation of antihypertensive medications with tumor responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate symptomatology evaluation by the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) with&#xD;
      tumor responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To correlate plasma metanephrines and chromogranin A with tumor responses. V. To&#xD;
      correlate plasma C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 with symptoms and tumor responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Toxicity assessment by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To correlate both c-MET expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) as well as MET&#xD;
      amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in archived samples and correlate&#xD;
      these biomarkers with overall prognosis and responsiveness to cabozantinib (cabozantinib&#xD;
      s-malate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Best overall response rate in patients with bone metastases only (8 patients) as&#xD;
      determined by fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography/computed tomography&#xD;
      (FDG-PET/CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. FDG-PET/CT maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax), advanced volumetric measures including&#xD;
      peak standard uptake value (SUVpeak), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion&#xD;
      glycolysis (TLG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Time to skeletal related events. IV. Incidence of skeletal related events at 4 months&#xD;
      and one year. V. Markers of bone turnover (bone specific alkaline phosphatase and C-terminal&#xD;
      telopeptide [CTx]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cabozantinib s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 4 weeks through week 24 and then every 8 weeks in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30-37 days.&#xD;
