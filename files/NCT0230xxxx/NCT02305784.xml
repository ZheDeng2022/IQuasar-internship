  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      YKL-40 is proposed as a biomarker of various inflammatory disease diabetes and lung disease&#xD;
      including cystic fibrosis. In those cross-sectional studies, a unique value of YKL-40 is used&#xD;
      to correlate with clinical, physiological, or biological determinants of disease severity&#xD;
      (like FEV1 for example in lung disease). There is only one longitudinal study that showed a&#xD;
      correlation between circulating levels of YKL-40 and the decline of lung function in smokers&#xD;
      sampled from the general population. In order to better understand the potential role of&#xD;
      YKL-40 in CF pathophysiology, and to determine its potential role as a biomarker of disease&#xD;
      evolution, it is essential to proceed with further clinical evaluation. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to perform an observational prospective cohort study to determine if variation of&#xD;
      YKL-40 concentration over 24 months correlates with the clinical evolution of the patients.&#xD;

      Observational prospective cohort: The primary objective of the study is to determine if&#xD;
      variation of YKL-40 concentration (in blood or sputum) over 24 months will correlate with the&#xD;
      biological or clinical condition of the patients. For this study, only patients (FEV1 &gt; 30%)&#xD;
      positive for Pseudomonas in the past year will be included, while B Cepacia positive patients&#xD;
      will be excluded. There are presently 200 patients meeting these inclusion criteria. The&#xD;
      investigators choose to limit the study population to patients with Pseudomonas since they&#xD;
      are more likely to have FEV1 changes or clinical evolution during the observation period. The&#xD;
      investigators expect a high participation rate since the only obligation for the patients is&#xD;
      to provide samples at each visit. A blood (for serum and DNA) and sputum samples will be&#xD;
      taken at each regular clinic visit (3-4/year-no evidence of exacerbation in the past two&#xD;
      weeks) as well as at the beginning and at the end of an exacerbation treated with IV&#xD;
      antibiotics. This will also allow the investigators to determine if there is a change in&#xD;
      YKL-40 during an exacerbation. The patients will be followed for a period of 24 months. In&#xD;
      parallel to the measurement of YKL-40 in blood and airway secretions, other biological&#xD;
      parameters will be monitored (see list below) as well as the BMI, lung function (FEV1/FVC),&#xD;
      oxygen saturation and heart rate. The investigators will also monitor the glucose metabolism&#xD;
      status of the patient (IGT, CFRD) and the number of exacerbations per year as well as any&#xD;
      significant changes in the microbiology status of the patients. A pulmonary exacerbation will&#xD;
      be defined as an acute exacerbation of pulmonary symptoms that in the opinion of the CF&#xD;
      physician is severe enough to require intravenous antibiotics. The proposed sample size, was&#xD;
      shown by power calculation, to be sufficient to demonstrate a meaningful changes in YKL-40&#xD;
      (initial-final) given plausible values of the standard deviation of this difference between&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

        We will follow the patients (&lt;18-year-old) for a period of 24 months. In parallel to the&#xD;

        parameters (see list below) as well as the BMI, lung function (FEV1/FVC), oxygen saturation&#xD;
        and heart rate. We will monitor the glucose metabolism status of the patient (IGT, CFRD)&#xD;
