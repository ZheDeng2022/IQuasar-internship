    <textblock>
      The study was conducted as an open-label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-period,&#xD;
      two-sequence, single-dose, crossover, bioequivalence study comparing Fenofibrate capsules,&#xD;
      USP 130 mg manufactured by Ohm Laboratories Inc, NJ 08901 with ANTARA速 (fenofibrate) capsules&#xD;
      130 mg manufactured by Ethypharm Industries Saint Cloud, France for Oscient Pharmaceuticals&#xD;
      Corp. Waltham, MA 02451 in healthy, adult, male, human subjects under fed condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects were subjected to breath test for alcohol and test for drugs of abuse (opioids&#xD;
      and cannabinoids) in urine prior to admission in each period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hour, a high-fat high calorie breakfast was served&#xD;
      to the study subjects. Thirty minutes after start of this breakfast, a single oral dose of&#xD;
      fenofibrate capsules 130 mg of either test or reference formulation was administered during&#xD;
      each period of the study, along with 240 mL of drinking water at ambient temperature under&#xD;
      low light condition and under supervision of trained study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples were collected at pre-dose and at 1.000, 2.000, 3.000, 4.000, 4.500, 5.000,&#xD;
      5.500, 6.000, 6.500, 7.000, 7.500, 8.000, 8.500, 9.000, 9.500, 10.000, 11.000, 12.000,&#xD;
      16.000, 24.000, 36.000, 48.000, 72.000 and 96.000 hours post dose in each period under low&#xD;
      light condition. The pre-dose blood samples in each period were collected in duplicate (2 x 5&#xD;
      mL), within a period of 1.5 hour before dosing. Post-dose samples were generally collected&#xD;
      within 2 minutes of the scheduled time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the study, safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical&#xD;
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical&#xD;
      parameters, serology and urine analysis at screening). Adverse event monitoring was done&#xD;
      throughout the study. Laboratory parameters of hematology and biochemistry were repeated at&#xD;
      the end of the study.&#xD;
