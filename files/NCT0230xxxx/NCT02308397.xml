      The aim of the study is to produce a tolerable alternative to normal wheat bread which would&#xD;
      be suitable for subjects with self-reported non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). The bread&#xD;
      would be made from wheat so, in contrast to gluten-free bread, would be more comparable to&#xD;
      standard bread. To make this bread, the investigators will use advanced enzyme technology&#xD;
      and/or novel formulations to target the digestion or removal of wheat proteins, which might&#xD;
      be involved in the etiology of non-coeliac gluten sensitivity, preferentially over other&#xD;
      those that are more useful for baking quality. The investigators will determine palatability&#xD;
      and tolerance of this new product in a human cross-over, randomised, blind and&#xD;
      placebo-controlled intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been estimated 6-10% of the population are sensitive to gluten who do not have coeliac&#xD;
      disease (CD). Three breads will be produced and tested in this study against a suitable&#xD;
      reference based on standard wheat flour and baking process&#xD;

      Prior to the study each volunteer will undergo screening procedure (Health Screening&#xD;
      Questionnaire) for compliance with the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The volunteers who meet&#xD;
      those criteria will be invited to sign an informed consent. Following this the volunteers&#xD;
      will be asked to complete:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gluten Sensitivity Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SF-36 Quality of Life Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Beacke Physical Activity Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DASS 21 Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that NCGS volunteers are following a low gluten or gluten-free life style.&#xD;
      Evaluation of their dietary compliance with gluten-free diet will be done through using&#xD;
      numerical scores (Biagi at al.,2009) - a system based on strategies that the subjects use to&#xD;
      avoid eating gluten.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal symptoms will be assessed by the participant completing daily diary cards&#xD;
      via a 100-mm VAS to score the presence and severity of overall abdominal symptoms, abdominal&#xD;
      pain, bloating, wind, satisfaction with stool consistency, tiredness, and nausea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity of fatigue will be evaluated by the Daily-Fatigue Impact Scale (D-FIS), a&#xD;
      questionnaire containing 8 items that evaluates the impact of fatigue on cognition, physical&#xD;
      functioning, and daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After one week of a baseline period, the subjects will be assigned to one week of dietary&#xD;
      intervention (bread A, B, C or D), followed by 14-day wash-out period before crossing over to&#xD;
      the next bread. All volunteers will be randomised to all four groups/cross over intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bread A - normal (gluten-containing) reference bread&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bread B - bread with reduced gliadin content&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bread C - bread with reduced ATIs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bread D - bread with reduced overall protein content&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each treatment bread will be consumed for one week (3 slices per day), followed by washout&#xD;
      period of at least 2 weeks or until symptoms induced during the previous dietary challenge&#xD;
      resolved. Volunteers unable to continue a treatment due to intolerable symptoms will be&#xD;
      permitted to cease the study food of that particular arm but can continue if they wish with&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bread will be provided to volunteers at the beginning of each treatment week. Compliance will&#xD;
      be determined with questioning at time of review and counting the slices of bread left at the&#xD;
      end of the treatment week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot study&#xD;
&#xD;
      For volunteers only recruited from the Aberdeen and the Aberdeenshire area as part of a pilot&#xD;
      study we will also ask volunteers to make a single visit (at the beginning of the study) to&#xD;
      the RINH. At this visit a fasting blood sample will be taken, the blood pressure will be&#xD;
      checked and anthropometric measurements will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood test:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody and total IgA level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IgA endomysial antibody&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IgG deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies (DGP-AGA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunoglobulin IgG/IgA antigliadin antibodies (AGA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Flow cytometric basophil activation test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gliadin-specific T cells in the peripheral blood&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Full blood count&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lipid profile&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vit B12 and folic acid status&#xD;
