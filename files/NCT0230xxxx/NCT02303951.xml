      Evaluation of the efficacy, safety and biologic effects of neo-adjuvant treatment with&#xD;
      vemurafenib + cobimetinib + atezolizumab in patients with limited metastasis of melanoma in&#xD;
      stage IIIC/IV melanoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with hardly resectable/unresectable limited metastasis in malignant melanoma stages&#xD;
      IIIC/IV (AJCC 2010) carrying the BRAF V600 mutation, in order to achieve operability are&#xD;
      enrolled in the NEO-VC-study. The main aim of this study is to achieve operability in a&#xD;
      higher percentage of patients by neoadjuvant treatment through shrinkage of the tumors.&#xD;
      Patients with operable stage IV disease show an impressive survival benefit with long term (5&#xD;
      y.) survival rates around 30 %. Only a percentage of up to 20 % can presently be treated by&#xD;
      complete metastasectomy. This percentage may be enlarged by pre-treatment with an efficacious&#xD;
      antitumor drug.&#xD;
