    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine why up to 25% of the pediatric patients who have&#xD;
      surgery for a tumor in the posterior fossa develops the Cerebellar Mutism Syndrome (CMS).&#xD;
      Furthermore the purpose is to explore the clinical course and the best treatment of the&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer accounts for 22 % of all deaths among children in Europe and is thus the leading&#xD;
      non-traumatic pediatric cause of death. Central nervous system (CNS) tumours constitute 25%&#xD;
      of all childhood cancers, and the majority of these are located in the posterior fossa. One&#xD;
      of the most troublesome late effects after neurosurgery for such a tumour is the cerebellar&#xD;
      mutism syndrome which is seen in up to 25% of the patients. It is characterized by mutism,&#xD;
      hypotonia, ataxia and irritability. The exact aetiology, risk factors, clinical course and&#xD;
      treatment have yet to be identified. The aim of this study is to accomplish that.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational prospective multicentre study that will include a minimum of 500&#xD;
      paediatric patients with posterior fossa CNS tumours from the Nordic countries. Additional&#xD;
      countries might be added later once the study is running. The study has started in fall 2014&#xD;
      in 20 centres from 5 Nordic countries. Prior to this a pilot study was performed on 43 Danish&#xD;
      adult patients to validate and fine-tune registration procedure. All patients will be treated&#xD;
      according to local standards, but clinical data will be collected and imaging will be&#xD;
      reviewed centrally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To calculate the participation rate the annual number of included patients from each country&#xD;
      will be compared to the number of registered patients in the cancer registers of the&#xD;
      respective country and year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample for genetic analysis will be collected from all patients. The patients'&#xD;
      neurology and speech functions will be examined both pre-operatively and repeatedly&#xD;
      post-operatively, including recording of standardised speech samples. All data will be&#xD;
      collected trough a, for the purpose developed, online database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registration of data&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be registered at the following 5 time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Preoperatively Hospital and country, and patient related variables (date of birth,&#xD;
           handedness, bilingualism, sex and date of diagnosis). Medical history (Previous&#xD;
           neurological/neuropsychological/ psychiatric problems, comorbidities, previous&#xD;
           operations or other treatment for the tumour, previous regular use of any kind of&#xD;
           medication). Preoperative neurological status will be examined and a language and speech&#xD;
           test will be performed and recorded. If the patient is younger than 2 years a bedside&#xD;
           assessment of the speech will be performed instead of a test. A blood sample for genetic&#xD;
           analysis will be drawn together with the standard blood samples. Alternatively this can&#xD;
           be done at any time during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Postoperatively within 72 hours of surgery Operation related variables (date, duration&#xD;
           and course of operation, surgical position, surgical approach, and tumour removal&#xD;
           method), complications, technology employed, preoperative hydrocephalus and estimated&#xD;
           completeness of tumour resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Postoperatively within 1-4 weeks from surgery Approximately 1-2 weeks post-op:&#xD;
           Postoperative language and speech status and for those older than 2 years, a recording&#xD;
           of a speech sample. Neurological examination. Glucocorticoid administration pre-, intra-&#xD;
           or postoperatively plus other medications used to treat the CMS postoperatively and&#xD;
           their effects. Kind(s) of imaging performed on the tumour pre- and postoperatively.&#xD;
           Approximately 4 weeks post-op: Development and treatment of postoperative intracranial&#xD;
           haematoma and hydrocephalus, leakage of cerebrospinal fluid and need for ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Postoperatively at about 2 months from surgery Postoperative development of CMS,&#xD;
           detailed survey of the status of CMS in those affected including recording of speech&#xD;
           sample and neurological examination. Medications used to treat the CMS since last&#xD;
           registration and their effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Postoperatively at about 12 months from surgery Language and neurological status&#xD;
           including a speech sample for those older than 2 years. Medications used to treat the&#xD;
           CMS since last registration and their effects. Other anti-cancer treatment given&#xD;
           (chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy). Results from the pathology department regarding the&#xD;
           kind of tumour histology and genetics. Registration of whether neuropsychological&#xD;
           assessment(s) have been performed. Kind(s) of imaging performed on the tumour since 1st&#xD;
           follow-up. Copies of the MRIs and descriptions performed pre-op, right after the&#xD;
           operation and approximately. 12 months post-op are obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All registered data will be examined by a third party who will check for missing data or&#xD;
      misentries in order to ensure a high quality of the data. In case of missing data or&#xD;
      misentries the third party will contact the person who made the registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database is administered by the children's cancer epidemiology group (CCEG) at Karolinska&#xD;
      Hospital in Stockholm, which is also responsible for the Swedish children's brain tumour&#xD;
      registry and the leukaemia database for the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and&#xD;
      Oncology (NOPHO)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other courses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of acute surgery, coma etc. information about the study and the offer to participate&#xD;
      can be given within 7 days from the operation. In these cases preoperative data about the&#xD;
      patient can be obtained from the patient's medical record and/or from the parents, but a&#xD;
      preoperative speech sample cannot be performed. These patients will not be included in the&#xD;
      analysis of whether and how preoperative speech and language status affects the risk of&#xD;
      developing CMS, but will be included in all the other study analyses. Speech samples will be&#xD;
      performed postoperatively in exactly the same manner as in patients that were included before&#xD;
      operation to able to monitor the patient's speech postoperatively and register signs of the&#xD;
      CMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should the patient have posterior fossa tumour surgery performed again during the 12 months&#xD;
      follow-up period, the patient will re-start the follow-up programme from that date. A&#xD;
      separate pre-op and all the post-op registrations will be performed again, and used in the&#xD;
      analysis of risk of first versus second or further surgery. New genetic blood samples will&#xD;
      not be necessary in these cases. Should the patient have posterior fossa tumour surgery&#xD;
      performed after the last 12 months follow-up, the patient will be offered to participate in&#xD;
      the study again and a new consent will have to be obtained. New genetic blood samples will&#xD;
      not be necessary in these cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient leaves the study for any reason before the follow-up 12 months post-op, a&#xD;
      separate form will be filled out explaining why the patient left.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient turns 18 while included in the study, a new consent to participate will have&#xD;
      to be given by the patient him- /herself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples and analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As soon as a patient has been registered, the study centre will request a 2 ml anticoagulated&#xD;
      blood sample for genetic profiling (Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use a newly developed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sequencing&#xD;
      strategy that allows cost-effective mapping of 25-30.000 genetic polymorphisms within&#xD;
      biological domains that could potentially be linked to the development of CMS (e.g.&#xD;
      inflammation, vascularization, blood-brain-barrier markers, and apolipoprotein E and other&#xD;
      lipoprotein pathway genes). The genetic data will be linked to the clinical data to identify&#xD;
      genetic variants associated with the risk of CMS or the course of CMS. Specifically the&#xD;
      investigators will map all SNPs in all genes that are known or are likely to be linked to&#xD;
      these pathways, including mRNA binding sites and first order protein-protein interactions.&#xD;
      Rather than expecting large effects of single SNPs, the strategy of this approach is to use&#xD;
      front-line bioinformatics and pathway analyses to explore the additive effect of numerous&#xD;
      SNPs involved in the same biological pathway. This will identify high-impact pathways,&#xD;
      although with individual low-impact SNPs. The results obtained could guide future therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches to CMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the custodial parents do not consent to their child contributing a blood sample to the&#xD;
      study, the child may still participate in the study, albeit not in the part involving genetic&#xD;
      analysis. The samples as well as the rest of the study data will be protected under the Act&#xD;
      on Processing of Personal Data and the Act on the Health Act.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All MRIs are analyzed by neuroradiologists with respect to tumour resection and&#xD;
      neuroradiographic signs associated with CMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All speech recording are analyzed by speech therapists with respect to signs associated with&#xD;
      CMS. The results of neuropsychological tests that may have been performed routinely will be&#xD;
      separately obtained and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the surgical hypothesis, assuming that 35% of patients are operated with an approach that&#xD;
      has a lower risk of CMS (assumed to be 10%) and the remaining 65% of patients are operated&#xD;
      using other approaches that carries a 20% risk of CMS, the investigators will with 80% power&#xD;
      be able to identify a difference at a 5% significance level if the investigators include a&#xD;
      total of 450 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the genetic analysis, several pathways and SNP-profiles will be explored with appropriate&#xD;
      adjustments for multiple comparisons. Multiple SNPs will due to randomness be found to be&#xD;
      related with the risk of CMS. Their true biological significance will subsequently be&#xD;
      validated through internal validation, as the investigators will explore if other SNPs in the&#xD;
      same biological pathway, e.g. SNPs in the same genes but not the same haplotype or SNPs that&#xD;
      affect coding or regulatory regions in the identified risk-related genes are more&#xD;
      significantly associated with risk of CMS than randomly selected SNPs. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      genes/SNPs will be explored by bioinformatic predictions of the impact of the SNPs on&#xD;
      protein-folding, binding affinity etc. Once such high-risk SNPs/genes/pathways have been&#xD;
      identified and published, the investigators will attempt to have them confirmed in&#xD;
      independent patient cohorts from Europe or the US. Based on a projected overall risk of CMS&#xD;
      of 20%, a frequency of a specific SNP (or SNP-profile) of 30%, and a projected doubled risk&#xD;
      of CMS in the group that harbour the SNP (or SNP-profile), the investigators will with 90%&#xD;
      power be able to identify such a genetic predisposition at a 5% significance level, if a&#xD;
      total of 343 patients are included in the study. Thus, the study has sufficient power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze the effect of the above mentioned variables (surgical method, administration of&#xD;
      corticosteroid, handedness etc.) on the risk of developing CMS the investigators will perform&#xD;
      univariate and multivariate regression analyses as well as standard descriptive analyses.&#xD;
      These analyses will be performed using SAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be the largest prospective multicenter study on cerebellar mutism syndrome to&#xD;
      date, and the first one of its kind to systematically gather detailed information about 1)&#xD;
      the surgical approaches least likely to cause the syndrome, 2) how the syndrome is best&#xD;
      treated, 3) the role of genetics and 4) differences in incidence and clinical course of the&#xD;
      syndrome for different patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate aim of the study is to reduce the incidence and improve the treatment of&#xD;
      cerebellar mutism syndrome and lead to harmonization of the treatment of CNS tumour patients&#xD;
      across the Nordic countries.&#xD;
