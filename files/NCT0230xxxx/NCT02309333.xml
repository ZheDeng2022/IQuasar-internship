  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a very rare type of leukemia. Because it is so rare,&#xD;
      many doctors do not have experience treating it. APL has been shown to be curable most of the&#xD;
      time. Unfortunately, some patients die early after they become sick with APL, sometimes even&#xD;
      before starting treatment. The early period is from the time of diagnosis through the first&#xD;
      treatments for the disease. This is approximately 30 days. Early deaths are often due to&#xD;
      complications caused by of the effects of leukemia and the treatments of it. These&#xD;
      complications may not be noticed quickly by doctors who don't have much experience with&#xD;
      managing APL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to collect information about the diagnosis and management of APL&#xD;
      patients by review of their medical records. This information will be stored in a central&#xD;
      database at Emory University. This data will be analyzed to discover the impact of increased&#xD;
      physician knowledge of recommended management of APL. The goal is to reduce the events of&#xD;
      early death of APL patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to collect data on patients with APL treated predominantly across&#xD;
      the states of Georgia and South Carolina but will also extend it to cover patients from&#xD;
      neighboring states. The treatment will be as per the treating physician and would be standard&#xD;
      of care and no new drugs or changes to standard of care are being proposed in educating the&#xD;
      treating physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-center study. At the lead sites, patients will sign the consent form and data&#xD;
      will be collected at those respective sites. The sites outside of Emory are centers in the&#xD;
      catchment area that treat leukemia. The lead investigators are available around the clock to&#xD;
      co-manage the APL patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to collect data to assess for improvement in mortality at the&#xD;
      primary centers as well as at the local treatment centers. This change in mortality would&#xD;
      depend on educating the community physicians and nursing staff and requires regular visits&#xD;
      both by the physicians and the nurse coordinator. The community hematologists/oncologists in&#xD;
      the catchment area will be educated by sending emails from investigators at 3 month intervals&#xD;
      to inform them of the high early death rate associated with APL. In addition, a brief&#xD;
      pamphlet will be mailed to them once every 3 months as a reminder. The lead investigators in&#xD;
      each state will make presentations in regional meetings, visit practices, and also call local&#xD;
      practices. In addition, a nurse coordinator will be instrumental in calling upon nursing&#xD;
      staff in outlying hospitals in the catchment area to apprise them of early deaths in APL and&#xD;
      also make them aware of the study and resources available. This will be done aggressively&#xD;
      during the first 6 months prior to initiating the trial and will be continued during the&#xD;
      three-year study period.&#xD;
