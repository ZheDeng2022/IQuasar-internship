      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single blinded randomised control trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 (women randomized 2:1 to receive either CPAP or no CPAP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: Assess the effects of nasal CPAP on sleep physiology, 24 blood pressures&#xD;
      and fetal movements in pregnant women (24-37 weeks gestation) with preeclampsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: Assess baseline sleep physiology, blood pressure control and fetal&#xD;
      well-being in pregnant women (24-37 weeks gestation) with preeclampsia by completing sleep&#xD;
      studies, 24 hour blood pressure monitors, CO2 monitors, and nocturnal fetal movement and HR&#xD;
      monitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the antenatal ward or high-risk antenatal clinic.&#xD;
      Following informed consent participants will be randomly assigned to receive either CPAP or&#xD;
      no CPAP for one night, following an initial baseline overnight sleep study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline- Night 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sleep study with fetal movement and HR monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 24 hour BP monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. CO2 monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention- Night 2 (Nasal CPAP device or no CPAP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sleep study with fetal movement and HR monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 24 hour BP monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. CO2 monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-partum questionnaire A brief questionnaire to be completed within the first 6 weeks&#xD;

      DESIGN Single blinded randomized control trial STUDY GROUPS Women diagnosed with preeclampsia&#xD;
      by their treating physicians (BP&gt;140/90 and proteinuria&gt; 300mg in 24 hours) who are being&#xD;
      managed either as inpatients or out-patients. They will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive active CPAP or no CPAP either in hospital (if they are inpatients) or at home&#xD;
      (outpatients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS A total of 30 women will be recruited. NUMBER OF CENTRES This study&#xD;
      will be conducted at 2 centres- Royal Hospital for Women, Randwick and Royal Prince Alfred&#xD;
      Hospital, Camperdown. The aim will be to recruit 15 participants from each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTIONS The intervention is nasal CPAP. The intervention group will be fitted with&#xD;
      nasal CPAP on night 2, set to deliver positive pressure airway ventilation. The control group&#xD;
      will not receive CPAP on night 2. The CPAP devices to be used are the ResMed S9 and the&#xD;
      Philips Respironics REMstar Pro, both of which are automatically setting machines that&#xD;
      respond to the presence of snoring, partial airway obstruction and complete apneas and&#xD;
      increase airway pressure to a therapeutic level. These systems are commercially available and&#xD;
      in widespread everyday routine clinical use in Australia. Nasal CPAP has been used for over&#xD;
      30 years including in pregnant women and has been found to be very safe therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DURATION Participants will be required to undertake 2 overnight sleep studies/BP monitors/CO2&#xD;
      monitors and complete a 10 minute questionnaire in the first 6 weeks post-partum. The study&#xD;
      will be undertaken between 1/6/14 to 1/6/16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INVESTIGATION PLAN Following informed consent participants will be enrolled to undergo the&#xD;
      following investigational plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline demographic data: all enrolled participants will be asked to provide the following&#xD;
      information:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  gestation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  height&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  current weight and pre-pregnancy weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  family history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  snoring history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  smoking and illicit drug taking history&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will then be asked to complete a Modified Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overnight Sleep Study/ BP monitor and Fetal Monitor:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inpatients will undertake a Sleep Study with accompanying 24 BP monitor, CO2 monitor and&#xD;
      fetal movement/HR monitor in their hospital bed on the day of recruitment. Outpatients will&#xD;
      be given the equipment and a brief lesson on its use by investigators on the day of&#xD;
      recruitment, and asked to perform the study in their own homes. They will be asked to then&#xD;
      return the equipment to the hospital the following day for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second Night- Intervention On the subsequent day, the active group will be fitted with a&#xD;
      nasal CPAP device and given a brief lesson on its use (Intervention group- CPAP, Controls- no&#xD;
      CPAP). Inpatients will then complete a Sleep study, 24 hour BP monitor, CO2 monitor and fetal&#xD;
      movements/HR monitor whilst on nasal CPAP. Outpatients will complete the same tests with&#xD;
      nasal CPAP in their own homes. Outpatients will then return the equipment to the hospital for&#xD;
      analysis the following day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep Study- Sonomat HST The Sonomat is a portable mat that is placed on top of the&#xD;
      participant's mattress (underneath the sheets). It contains a microphone and four vibration&#xD;
      sensors to detect breath sounds, breathing movements and body movement. It will assess&#xD;
      snoring, the number of apneas, the number of hypopneas, the number of arousals, and hourly&#xD;
      blood oxygen saturation (%) throughout the night. It also measures the total number of fetal&#xD;
      movements throughout the night, and will be used to calculate average hourly fetal movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sonomat HST (ARTG number: Sleep Assessment Device 179807, software 179908) is registered&#xD;
      with the Therapeutic Goods Administration and is routine use to perform ambulatory sleep&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24 Hour BP monitor and CO2 monitor A blood pressure cuff will be applied to the left upper&#xD;
      arm for 24 hours. It will inflate hourly to measure the participant's systolic and diastolic&#xD;
      blood pressure (mmHg) and will record all values. From this average nocturnal and daytime BPs&#xD;
      will be calculated. The device to be used is a Spacelabs portable oscillometric system ABP&#xD;
      20217.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CO2 monitor is a transcutaneous monitor applied to the patient's earlobe which&#xD;
      continuously measures CO2, O2 and HR. From this, we can monitor alterations in CO2 and O2&#xD;
      such as desaturations, complete apnoeas and hypercapnic episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasal CPAP (Continuous positive airway pressure) The CPAP devices used are ResMed S9 or&#xD;
      Philips-Respironics REMstar Pro, which are automatically setting machines that respond to the&#xD;
      presence of upper airway obstruction and complete apneas and increase airway pressure to a&#xD;
      therapeutic level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CPAP system is a small machine that sits at the bedside with a mask attached to the&#xD;
      machine via a tube. The mask fits comfortably over the nose and delivers a steady stream of&#xD;
      air under slight pressure (auto-set). It is to be worn throughout the night whilst the&#xD;
      participant sleeps. Modern nasal CPAP masks and nasal pillow are very comfortable, and&#xD;
      provided there is a gentle background flow of air, they are very easy to use and allow normal&#xD;
      sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-partum questionnaire All participants will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire,&#xD;
      which will be sent to them via email or conventional mail, in the first 6 weeks post-partum.&#xD;
      This will ask questions regarding their gestation at delivery, fetal birth weight, maternal&#xD;
      and fetal health and current signs/symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing.&#xD;
