      Objective: To evaluate the curative effect of TCM multi-channel interventional therapy on&#xD;
      women with ART Failure; to compare the curative effect of the dual therapy and triple therapy&#xD;
      on women with ART Failure; to choose the best TCM interventional therapeutic plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The cases with ART Failure from West China second University Hospital of Sichuan&#xD;
      University (West China Women's and Children's Hospital of Sichuan University) meeting the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria were randomly divided into three groups: the dual therapy group, the&#xD;
      triple therapy group and the control group, compare the natural pregnancy number, the&#xD;
      condition during the period of secondary IVF-ET and the improvement of the kidney deficiency,&#xD;
      liver depression and blood stasis syndrome among those three groups.&#xD;
