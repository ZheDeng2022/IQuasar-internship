  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the present study is to evaluate efficacy, safety and tolerability of 4:1&#xD;
      ketogenic diet administered adjunctively to standard radiation and temozolomide chemotherapy&#xD;
      in patients with GBM in a prospective, randomized open label study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary aims of the study will be to 1) To evaluate efficacy of ketogenic diet as adjunctive&#xD;
      treatment of radiation treatment in glioblastoma multiforme. 2) To evaluate the safety of&#xD;
      ketogenic diet as adjunctive treatment of radiation treatment in glioblastoma multiforme.&#xD;
      Secondary aim will be to evaluate tolerability of ketogenic diet as adjunctive treatment of&#xD;
      radiation treatment in glioblastoma multiforme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be seen at one, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks after KG diet initiation, and then&#xD;
      monthly until month 6 after diet initiation, then every 2 months until 2 years after&#xD;
      treatment initiation or death, then every 3 months until 3 years after treatment initiation&#xD;
      or death. KD treatment will last for 6 months or until exit criteria are met, whichever comes&#xD;
      first. Exit criteria are the primary outcome measures, the first of either (a) MRI tumor&#xD;
      progression or (b) death. Secondary outcome measures will include treatment compliance,&#xD;
      hunger scale scores, fasting serum glucose and BOH levels and occurrence of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with documented tumor progression will receive standard care for progressive GBM as&#xD;
      directed by their treating oncologist, independent of the study.&#xD;

    <description>We hope to achieve a substantial difference in both survival time and time to recurrence between the KD and non-KD treatment groups. Survival time of 3 years from treatment initiation and tumor progression-free time of 2.5 years from treatment initiation would be extraordinary compared to historical data.</description>

    <description>MRI outcome will be assessed by the radiographic assessment in neuro-oncology criteria based on contrast-enhanced cranial MRI scans evaluating measureable disease, measured as the sum of products of perpendicular diameters (bi-dimensional measurements) of all measurable enhancing lesions and non-measurable disease.</description>
