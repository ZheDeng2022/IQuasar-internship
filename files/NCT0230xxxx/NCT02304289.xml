      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Oral Artesunate&#xD;
      in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Artemisinins, compounds extracted from the herb Artemisia annua, are safe and effective&#xD;
      FDA-approved antimalarial drugs. Recent studies have suggested that artemisinins also exert&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic and cytotoxic effects on human cancer cells. Artesunate (ART) is a water&#xD;
      soluble semisynthetic artemisinin with improved pharmacokinetic properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single-center phase I dose-escalation study evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      oral Artesunate in patients with Advanced HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 15 patients will be enrolled in this trial. Dose-escalation protocol: The first&#xD;
      patient will receive 200 mg Artesunate once-daily for 14 days. If no dose-limiting toxicity&#xD;
      (DLT) is observed after 14 days, the next patient will start at a daily dose of 300 mg&#xD;
      Artesunate. If no DLT is observed after 14 days, a cohort of 3 patients will receive 400 mg&#xD;
      once-daily for 14 days. For each subsequent cohort of 3 patients 200 mg will be added to the&#xD;
      dose, until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.&#xD;
