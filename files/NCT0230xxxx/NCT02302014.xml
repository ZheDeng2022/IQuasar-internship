      Patients admitted as an unscheduled hospital admission with either a acute heart failure&#xD;
      syndrome (ACF) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) will be eligible if their 6-12 month&#xD;
      mortality risk is estimated to be 20% or greater at the time of discharge. Mortality risk is&#xD;
      estimated using GRACE (for ACS) or EFFECT (for AHF) scores. Patients are randomly allocated&#xD;
      to receive a holistic care intervention based around the creation of a detailed Future&#xD;
      (anticipatory) Care Plan which is agreed with the patient and their family and which is&#xD;
      shared with the Family Doctor and Emergency Services including ambulance teams. Primary&#xD;
      endpoint is quality of life assessed by questionnaire.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with either acute coronary syndrome(ACS) or acute heart failure (AHF) achieving an&#xD;
      estimated risk of mortality within 12 months of 20% or greater (GRACE score for ACS and&#xD;
      EFFECT score for AHF) will be assigned to early or delayed intervention using a web-based&#xD;
      randomisation system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age &gt; 18 years Unscheduled hospital admission due to congestive heart failure and or acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome 12 month estimated mortality risk of 20% or greater Optimal tolerated&#xD;
      medical and device therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected survival &lt; 28 days Other life limiting non-cardiac condition likely to cause death&#xD;
      within 12 months Moderate or severe dementia Moderate or severe cognitive impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supportive &amp; Palliative Care Planning Intervention The planned intervention will follow the&#xD;
      core principles of holistic palliative care. The detailed content may be adapted following&#xD;
      the baseline qualitative interviews and focus group study outlined above and may evolve&#xD;
      during the pilot phase (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first component of the intervention will consist of an interview with the patient and&#xD;
      carer within 7 days of enrolment This will be undertaken by the trial consultant cardiologist&#xD;
      and the trial nurse in a quiet room either in the hospital or in the patients home. This&#xD;
      baseline consultation will explore the clinical and social needs of the patient and their&#xD;
      carer, previous and current clinical status and treatment, goals of treatment and care now&#xD;
      and in event of a future clinical deterioration, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)&#xD;
      status. The aim will be to develop a patient-centred Future Care Plan (FCP). This interview&#xD;
      will also establish whether the patient and carer are happy to share the FCP with the&#xD;
      community-based care team and out-of-hours emergency care services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two further scheduled patient/carer consultations with the nurse specialist will take place&#xD;
      at 6 and 12 weeks following enrolment and will explore issues around cardiac care, physical,&#xD;
      social, psychological, spiritual, cultural and information needs. At each of these meetings&#xD;
      the FCP will be reviewed in detail and any changes will be made to a new document which will&#xD;
      be shared with other organisations as outlined above with the patient's permission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second component of the intervention is continuous supportive care delivered by the trial&#xD;
      nurse specialist who will act as professional carer and advocate for the patient during the&#xD;
      12 week intervention phase. Specifically, the nurse will be available on a mobile phone&#xD;
      Monday to Friday, 0900 to 1700 for the patient or carer to call for advice or support. This&#xD;
      trial nurse will ensure that the patient is placed on the primary care palliative care&#xD;
      register. They will also provide opportunities for the patient and their family to ask for&#xD;
      information about their condition and care, and that their current FCP is available to&#xD;
      primary care, out-of-hours services and on the hospital patient information systems and&#xD;
      updated at no less than 6 weekly intervals. The nurse will review the details of the FCP with&#xD;
      the patient at each follow-up interview focusing on changes in the patient's symptoms,&#xD;
      treatment goals, cardiopulmonary resuscitation status and preferences for place of care&#xD;
      should they deteriorate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial nurse will work closely with the palliative care team, the trial cardiologist and&#xD;
      the patient's general practitioner. In order to document the success of this interface&#xD;
      process, the nurse will document the number, duration and content of each communication with&#xD;
      these healthcare professionals as they arise during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial nurse specialist will use an established tool to monitor and document patient and&#xD;
      carer needs at each visit using a Needs Assessment Tool for Palliative Care. The patient's&#xD;
      secondary and primary care teams will be informed of the patient's involvement in the trial.&#xD;
      Since some patients may choose not to take-up the services defined within the intervention we&#xD;
      will carefully document their utilisation of the interventional services offered. Use of&#xD;
      primary care services will be carefully monitored during the study period. All clinical data&#xD;
      including comorbidities will be documented at the time of enrolment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of the intervention: patients will be randomised while in hospital to either early&#xD;
      intervention for 12 weeks or delayed intervention which will start 12 weeks after discharge,&#xD;
      this too will last for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline interview with trial cardiologist and trial nurse lasting for up to 1 hour Creation&#xD;
      of a Future Care Plan (FCP) document following this baseline interview Sharing of FCP&#xD;
      document with primary care and unscheduled care organisations 6 week interview with trial&#xD;
      nurse lasting for up to 1 hour to review FCP 12 week interview with trial nurse lasting for&#xD;
      up to 1 hour to review FCP Continuous access to trial nurse by mobile telephone 9am - 5pm&#xD;
      Monday-Friday for 12 weeks Trial nurse will - ensure FCP is appropriately shared with primary&#xD;
      and secondary care, patient is registered on primary care palliative care register and will&#xD;
      liaise with specialist PC services and the general practitioner as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first 12 weeks of the study, patients randomised to usual care will not&#xD;
      specifically receive these services. Recent audit from our centre suggests that delivery of&#xD;
      such services to Heart Failure patients is inconsistent and generally poor while delivery of&#xD;
      these services to people with coronary heart disease is non-existent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome-measures of the Phase 2 trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this study is not powered to assess clinical outcomes, we plan to explore a number of&#xD;
      outcomes that could be used in a later phase 3 trial. The following outcomes will be&#xD;
      explored:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient and carer-centred outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Outcomes will be assessed using the following questionnaire tools for both patients and&#xD;
           their informer carers: ESAS - Edmonton symptom assessment scale, EQ5D - European Quality&#xD;
           of Health Status, KDS - Kessler Distress Scale, Zarit 6 - caregiver burden questionnaire&#xD;
           All patients will complete a series of questionnaires, addressing symptoms (Edmonton&#xD;
           symptom assessment scale), quality of life (EQ5D) and distress (Kessler Distress scale)&#xD;
           [20] immediately prior to discharge and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks (see figure) and&#xD;
           ideally within 7 days of each contact with the trial professionals. Since the&#xD;
           intervention may have some impact on the carers we also plan to assess quality of life&#xD;
           (EQ5D), distress (Kessler) and caregiver burden (Zarit 6) [21] using validated&#xD;
           questionnaires at similar time points. Questionnaires will be mailed to the patient and&#xD;
           carer approximately 2 days after each trial time point and the respondent will be&#xD;
           encouraged to complete it within a further 3 days. The RA will offer telephone support&#xD;
           to assist completion of these questionnaires in all cases to ensure consistency of&#xD;
           response [22]. The RA will be responsible for the mailing, collection and collation of&#xD;
           the outcome measures of the phase 2 trial and will be blinded to the randomisation&#xD;
           status of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. System outcomes All-cause unscheduled hospitalisation (including number of days in&#xD;
           hospital), cardiovascular unscheduled hospitalisation, hospice admissions and use of&#xD;
           other specialist palliative care services, achievement of primary care palliative care&#xD;
           Quality Outcomes Framework criteria (placed on PC register, care plan in place and out&#xD;
           of hours handover documented) by 6, 12 and 24 weeks after enrolment, whether the&#xD;
           secondary and primary care case records contain documentation of care planning&#xD;
           discussion and a formal record of CPR status at 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks after enrolment.&#xD;
           All patients will be followed up for 12 months after enrolment for hospitalisation&#xD;
           outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. After -death outcome measures These ill include assessment of time to death from study&#xD;
           enrolment, cause of death, preferred place of care, actual place of death, Carer&#xD;
           experience (VOICES questionnaire [22]). All patients will be followed up for 12 months&#xD;
           following enrolment for mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis and statistical issues Descriptive statistics (continuous variables: mean,&#xD;
      standard deviation, median, range; categorical variables: number and percentage of&#xD;
      participants) will be presented for the clinical and demographic features of the patients&#xD;
      screened and those finally enrolled in the study. One of the main outcomes of our study which&#xD;
      we will assess carefully is quality of life. The mean differences in EQ-5D health-related&#xD;
      quality of life (QoL) utility between early and delayed intervention groups will firstly be&#xD;
      analysed at the 12 week time point using analysis of covariance, adjusting for baseline&#xD;
      utility score. We will then explore differences in QoL between groups at 24 weeks (t5) by the&#xD;
      same method. The multiple measures at baseline, mid-point and end of intervention will allow&#xD;
      analysis of trends in intervention effects on QoL and other parameters addressed by the&#xD;
      distress and symptom assessment tools using repeated measures analysis of variance. The&#xD;
      distribution and variability in EQ-5D values in this cohort of patients identified as having&#xD;
      a poor prognosis will be used to inform the design and sample size of the future phase 3&#xD;
      trial. An economic evaluation in the phase 3 trial will consider, using a discrete choice&#xD;
      experiment, patient preferences, values and willingness to pay for end of life care and the&#xD;
      components which they value for quality of life. This approach complements the&#xD;
      patient-centred nature of the intervention. Information to guide the design of the economic&#xD;
      evaluation will be gathered using feedback from the qualitative component of this study.&#xD;
