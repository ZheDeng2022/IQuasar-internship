  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study intended to evaluate a non-invasive device that uses light to measure the&#xD;
      amount of oxygen in the muscles of injured and non-injured legs in specific situations. The&#xD;
      name of this technology is NIRS (near-infrared spectroscopy). The goal of this study is to&#xD;
      collect the information necessary to understand the use of the NIRS monitoring system to&#xD;
      diagnose and direct treatment decisions in case of complications sometimes experienced in&#xD;
      traumatic tibia fracture, such as excessive swelling called acute compartment syndrome (ACS).&#xD;

      This study seeks to further develop the use of NIRS technology in the diagnosis of acute&#xD;
      compartment syndrome. NIRS values normally increase in traumatized legs compared to the&#xD;
      contralateral uninjured leg or forearm, indicative of a hyperemic response. The investigators&#xD;
      hopes to build upon the current knowledge and verify the ability to accurately detect ACS&#xD;
      using two easily identified and accessible leg compartments, the anterior and superficial&#xD;
      posterior utilizing the Nonin 7600 oximeter with the Sensor Model 8004CV. Additionally, since&#xD;
      this device was originally designed with brain tissue in mind, the NIRS device will collect&#xD;
      vital engineering data that will be used to validate the algorithm used to produce the&#xD;
      oxygenation values in injured muscle tissue.&#xD;

    <description>Assess the accuracy of the Nonin 7600 oximeter with the Sensor Model 8004CV in the diagnosis of Acute Compartment Syndrome, using the &quot;gold standard&quot; criterion for ACS, which will be &quot;clinical diagnosis&quot;. That is, all subjects undergoing fasciotomy for clinically diagnosed ACS will be considered to have ACS. NIRS values will be compared to clinical diagnosis to determine accuracy and threshold values.</description>
