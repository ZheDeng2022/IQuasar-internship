  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to investigate the effectiveness of a manualized, 20-week&#xD;
      group cognitive rehabilitation (CR) and exposure therapy (ET) course for compulsive hoarding.&#xD;
      The overarching aim is to understand whether this course will decrease the core symptoms of&#xD;
      hoarding and associated features.&#xD;

    <description>The Hoarding Rating scale has a total score ranging from 0 -40 with the higher score indicating higher symptoms of hoarding.&#xD;
This will be used to assess whether hoarding symptoms decrease as a result of treatment.</description>

    <description>Cognitive training is to improve thinking by learning new skills and strategies. The class begins with cognitive training to increase ability to carry out the skills learned later in treatment.&#xD;
Exposure therapy for discarding and acquiring helps to improve ability to make choices about possessions and learn to tolerate anxiety. Participants will face making difficult choices about items and potentially letting them go. Through repeated exposure to decisions about discarding and acquiring, distress about letting go or making choices about items will decrease over time.</description>
