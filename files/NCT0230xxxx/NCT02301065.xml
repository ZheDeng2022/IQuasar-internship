  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Viral infections and reactivation during pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (HSCT) are a common occurrence and significantly contribute to&#xD;
      post-transplant morbidity and mortality. The risk is high due to prolonged periods of immune&#xD;
      deficiency while awaiting immune reconstitution post-transplant. Current strategies to reduce&#xD;
      complications from viral infections include prophylactic treatment, close monitoring for&#xD;
      viral infections and prompt treatment at the first sign of symptoms or increasing viral load.&#xD;
      However, the most definitive treatment for viral infections remains the host's cellular&#xD;
      defenses. Improved understanding of the immune systems response to viral infections may lead&#xD;
      to better treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being done to explore the relationships between T-cells and NK cells (infection&#xD;
      fighting cells) and viral infections or reactivations in young allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
      transplant patients. The investigators will be looking at how these cells react and function&#xD;
      in young patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation, as well as in healthy stem&#xD;
      cell donors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the expansion patterns of KIR+CD56+ T-cells and FcRg-CD56+CD3- NK cells in&#xD;
           response to viral infection and reactivation in pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic stem&#xD;
           cell transplant (HSCT) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the phenotype of KIR+CD56+ T-cells and FcRg-CD56+CD3- NK cells in pediatric&#xD;
           allogeneic HSCT patients and healthy donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the specificity and functional capacity of KIR+CD56+ T-cells against viral&#xD;
           antigens in both pediatric allogeneic HSCT patients and healthy donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the functional capacity of FcRg-CD56+CD3- NK cells against CMV-infected&#xD;
           cells in both pediatric allogeneic HSCT patients and healthy donors.&#xD;
