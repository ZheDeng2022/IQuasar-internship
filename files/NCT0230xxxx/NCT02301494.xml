&#xD;
          2. Willing and able to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnosis of Mycosis Fungoides In cases with equivocal histological features, the&#xD;
             diagnosis may be confirmed through the use of clonal T-cell gamma gene rearrangement,&#xD;
             as detected by PCR amplification and primer sets specific for the T-cell receptor&#xD;
             gamma chain genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects must have at least one target lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects will be able to comply with the study instructions, apply the study&#xD;
             medication as directed and attend all visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test before&#xD;
             randomization and must agree to use an adequate method of contraception (abstinence,&#xD;
             condoms, hormonal therapy, barrier methods) during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must be otherwise healthy with an ECOG Performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The patient must not have had topical (2 weeks) or systemic therapy (4 weeks),&#xD;
             radiotherapy (4 weeks) or phototherapy therapy (4 weeks) for Mycosis Fungoides within&#xD;
             the stated number of weeks prior to start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Eligible patients will be those who topical corticosteroid would be a preferred&#xD;
             treatment and include patients newly diagnosed with stage IA, IB, or IIA disease, or&#xD;
             those patients currently stable on therapy, in whom topical corticosteroids are being&#xD;
             newly added to the regimen (i.e. recurrence or resistant lesions not currently treated&#xD;
             with topical corticosteroids)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible for inclusion in this study the subjects must not meet any of the following&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;

             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have concomitant dermatologic or medical condition(s) which may interfere with the&#xD;
             investigator's ability to evaluate the subject's response to the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Received any investigational drug or taking part in any clinical study within one&#xD;
             month prior to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Known reaction or allergy to test drug or excipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Presence of major medical illness or symptoms of a clinically significant illness that&#xD;
             may influence the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have any reason which, in the opinion of the investigator, interferes with the ability&#xD;
             of the subject to participate in or complete the trial, or which places the subject at&#xD;
             undue risk such as a history of drug, alcohol or other substance abuse or other&#xD;
             factors limiting the ability to co-operate and to comply with this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Lesions on the genitals, axillae and face will not be selected for study treatment and&#xD;
             evaluation.&#xD;
