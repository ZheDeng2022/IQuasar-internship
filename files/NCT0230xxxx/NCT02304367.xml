    <description>Mineralization lag time is a dynamic modeling parameter representing the mean time interval between the formation of osteoid and its subsequent mineralization which can be measured using histomorphometry with double tetracycline labeling.&#xD;
Mlt was calculated by dividing the osteoid width by the mineralizing apposition rate (MAR; the average rate at which new bone mineral is being added on any actively forming surface).&#xD;
If Mlt could not be calculated directly due to low tetracycline uptake, Mlt was imputed according to the following:&#xD;
Mlt = O.Th/(MAR*MS/OS), where O.Th = osteoid thickness, MAR is imputed as 0.3 Î¼m/day, MS/OS=mineralizing surface/osteoid surface, each measured at the same visit.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in Fractional Excretion of Phosphorus (FEP)</title>
          <description>Fractional excretion of phosphorus (FEP) is the percentage of phosphorus filtered by the kidney that is excreted into urine, calculated as 100% * (2-hour urine phosphorus*serum creatinine)/(2-hour urine creatinine * serum phosphorus).&#xD;
Least squares means and standard errors were estimated from a generalized estimation equation (GEE) model which includes the change from Baseline as the dependent variable, time as the categorical variable and adjusted for Baseline FEP, with compound symmetry covariance structure.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in Hand-Held Dynamometry (HHD) Elbow Measurements</title>
        <description>To assess muscle strength, hand-held dynamometry was conducted using a standardized technique. Bilateral strength (defined as the average of the left and the right scores, measured in kilograms) of the elbow flexors and extensors was measured by the maximum voluntary isometric contraction against a dynamometer.&#xD;

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in Weighted Arm Lift (WAL) Test</title>
        <description>The Weighted arm lift (WAL) test assesses upper extremity strength, mobility and reaching ability. The test was administered bilaterally to determine the number of times the participant could raise a 1 kg weight above the head in a 30-second period. The number of repetitions completed with each arm was recorded.&#xD;
Least squares means and standard errors were estimated from a generalized estimation equation (GEE) model which includes the change from Baseline as the dependent variable, time as the categorical variable and adjusted for Baseline WAL measurements, with compound symmetry covariance structure.</description>

        <description>The 6MWT is a commonly used measure of mobility and was conducted in accordance with general principles set forth in the American Thoracic Society guidelines (ATS 2002). Participants were instructed to walk the length of a pre-measured course for 6 consecutive minutes (assistive devices could be used). The total distance walked at the end of 6 minutes was recorded in meters.&#xD;

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Pain Severity Score</title>
        <description>The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is a self-reported, pain-specific questionnaire with a recall period of 24 hours.&#xD;
Pain severity is defined as the average of 4 questions (Questions 3 through 6) assessing worst pain, least pain, average pain, and pain right now, rated on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine). Mild pain is defined as a score of 1 to 4, moderate pain is defined as a score of 5 to 6, and severe pain is defined as a score of 7 to 10. A negative change from Baseline score indicates improvement.&#xD;
Least squares means and standard errors were estimated from a generalized estimation equation (GEE) model which includes the change from Baseline as the dependent variable, time as the categorical variable and adjusted for Baseline BPI measurement, with compound symmetry covariance structure.</description>

        <description>The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is a self-reported, pain-specific questionnaire with a recall period of 24 hours.&#xD;
Pain interference is defined as the average of 7 questions (9A through 9G) regarding the extent to which pain interfered with daily activities, including general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life in the last 24 hours, rated on a scale from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes).&#xD;
A negative change from Baseline score indicates improvement. Least squares means and standard errors were estimated from a generalized estimation equation (GEE) model which includes the change from Baseline as the dependent variable, time as the categorical variable and adjusted for Baseline BPI measurement, with compound symmetry covariance structure.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) Worst Fatigue Score</title>
        <description>The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) is a self-reported questionnaire consisting of 9 items related to fatigue that are rated on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale with a recall period of 24 hours.&#xD;
Worst fatigue is defined as the answer to Question 3 in which participants rated their fatigue at its worst in the last 24 hours on a scale from 0 (no fatigue) to 10 (as bad as you can imagine).&#xD;
A negative change from Baseline score indicates improvement. Least squares means and standard errors were estimated from a generalized estimation equation (GEE) model which includes the change from Baseline as the dependent variable, time as the categorical variable and adjusted for Baseline BFI measurement, with compound symmetry covariance structure.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) Fatigue Interference Score</title>
        <description>The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) is a self-reported questionnaire consisting of 9 items related to fatigue that are rated on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale with a recall period of 24 hours.&#xD;
The fatigue interference score is defined as the average of 6 questions (Questions 4A through 4F) regarding the extent to which fatigue interfered with daily activities, including general activity, mood, walking ability, work, relations with others, and enjoyment of life in the last 24 hours, rated on a scale from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes).&#xD;
A negative change from Baseline score indicates improvement. Least squares means and standard errors were estimated from a generalized estimation equation (GEE) model which includes the change from Baseline as the dependent variable, time as the categorical variable and adjusted for Baseline BFI measurement, with compound symmetry covariance structure.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) Global Fatigue Score</title>
        <description>The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) is a self-reported questionnaire consisting of 9 items related to fatigue that are rated on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale with a recall period of 24 hours. The first 3 questions measure fatigue severity and the next 6 questions assess the impact of fatigue on daily activities.&#xD;
The global fatigue score is defined as the average of all 9 questions on the BFI including severity and interference, and ranges from from 0 to 10, where higher scores correspond to greater levels of fatigue.&#xD;
A negative change from Baseline score indicates improvement. Least squares means and standard errors were estimated from a generalized estimation equation (GEE) model which includes the change from Baseline as the dependent variable, time as the categorical variable and adjusted for Baseline BFI measurement, with compound symmetry covariance structure.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary Score</title>
        <description>The SF-36 v2 is a self-administered questionnaire that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life during the past 4 weeks. The SF-36 consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health).&#xD;
The physical component summary score (PCS) is a weighted combination of the 8 subscales with positive weighting for physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health. The PCS was calculated using norm-based scoring so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores are associated with better functioning/quality of life; a positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.&#xD;
LS means and SEs were estimated from a GEE model which includes the change from Baseline as the dependent variable, time as the categorical variable and adjusted for Baseline SF-36, with compound symmetry covariance struct</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary Score</title>
          <description>The SF-36 v2 is a self-administered questionnaire that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life during the past 4 weeks. The SF-36 consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health).&#xD;
The physical component summary score (PCS) is a weighted combination of the 8 subscales with positive weighting for physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, and general health. The PCS was calculated using norm-based scoring so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores are associated with better functioning/quality of life; a positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.&#xD;
LS means and SEs were estimated from a GEE model which includes the change from Baseline as the dependent variable, time as the categorical variable and adjusted for Baseline SF-36, with compound symmetry covariance struct</description>

The SF-36 consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health).&#xD;
The role-physical (RP) domain includes 4 questions that assess limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems. The RP domain score was calculated using norm-based scoring so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores are associated with better functioning/quality of life; a positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.&#xD;
LS means and SEs were estimated from a GEE model which includes the change from Baseline as the dependent variable, time as the categorical variable and adjusted for Baseline SF-36, with compound symmetry covariance structure.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Mental Component Summary Score</title>
        <description>The SF-36 v2 is a self-administered questionnaire that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life during the past 4 weeks. The SF-36 consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health).&#xD;
The mental component summary score (MCS) is a weighted combination of the 8 subscales with positive weighting for vitality, social function, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. The MCS was calculated using norm-based scoring so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores are associated with better functioning/quality of life; a positive change from Baseline indicates an improvement.&#xD;
LS means and SEs were estimated from a GEE model which includes the change from Baseline as the dependent variable, time as the categorical variable and adjusted for Baseline SF-36, with compound symmetry covariance structure.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Social Functioning Domain Score</title>
        <description>The SF-36 v2 is a self-administered questionnaire that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life during the past 4 weeks. The SF-36 consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health).&#xD;
The social functioning (SF) domain includes 2 questions that assess limitations in social activities because of physical health or emotional problems. The SF domain score was calculated using norm-based scoring so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores are associated with better functioning/quality of life; a positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.&#xD;
LS means and SEs were estimated from a GEE model which includes the change from Baseline as the dependent variable, time as the categorical variable and adjusted for Baseline SF-36, with compound symmetry covariance structure.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over Time in 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Mental Health Domain Score</title>
        <description>The SF-36 v2 is a self-administered questionnaire that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life during the past 4 weeks. The SF-36 consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health).&#xD;
The mental health (MH) domain includes 5 questions that assess general mental health (psychological distress and well-being). The MH domain score was calculated using norm-based scoring so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores are associated with better functioning/quality of life; a positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.&#xD;
LS means and SEs were estimated from a GEE model which includes the change from Baseline as the dependent variable, time as the categorical variable and adjusted for Baseline SF-36, with compound symmetry covariance structure.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug, whether or not considered drug related. A serious AE was defined as an AE that at any dose, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant incapacity or disability, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or other important medical events (according to the investigator). An AE was considered a TEAE if it occurred on or after the first dose and was not present prior to the first dose, or it was present prior to the first dose but increased in severity during the study. Events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.0: grade 1 (mild), grade 2 (moderate), grade 3 (severe), grade 4 (life-threatening), grade 5 (death).</description>
