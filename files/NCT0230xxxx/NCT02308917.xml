    <textblock>
      The initial network clinical study will be an inception cohort study in children with new&#xD;
      onset IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) rigorously phenotyped and prospectively followed.&#xD;
      Focusing on a prospective, inception cohort of Canadian children of widely varied racial&#xD;
      origins provides a unique opportunity to explore environmental risk factors early in life and&#xD;
      close in time to disease onset, their influence on the host microbiome, and in the context of&#xD;
      genetic susceptibility. In keeping with current treatment targets, assessed outcomes will&#xD;
      include not only symptom resolution and growth, but also intestinal healing. Anticipated&#xD;
      variation between network sites in choices of evidence-based therapies, even among&#xD;
      phenotypically similar sub-types of Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, will allow&#xD;
      comparisons outcomes with disparate treatments, aiming to identify best practice and to&#xD;
      institute processes for continual improvement in care nationally.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IBD is becoming increasingly common in Canada, particularly among children, even those whose&#xD;
      families have recently moved here from countries where IBD is rare. Genetic factors are known&#xD;
      to make children susceptible to IBD, but the equally important environmental factors are&#xD;
      unknown. This multi-center network brings together investigators across Canada to understand&#xD;
      why IBD affects so many Canadian children. We will study all children at the time of IBD&#xD;
      diagnosis, asking questions about environmental, including dietary, exposures; obtaining&#xD;
      blood for assessment of genetic risk; and stool for assessment of microorganisms that might&#xD;
      be important in the development of IBD. The best treatments for specific types of IBD will be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Network's success will be as much dependent on its ability to re-distribute data, as its&#xD;
      ability to efficiently and accurately collect it. In order to achieve the Network's goals&#xD;
      related to improving care and informing clinical practice, it is imperative that the&#xD;
      Network's raw data set can be rapidly re-formatted and re-presented to first inform and then&#xD;
      report on (patient focused) clinical and quality indicators at both site and network levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples may be stored indefinitely so that, as additional genes, biomarkers, and microbes are&#xD;
      discovered, their role in intestinal disease can be assessed. The importance of these samples&#xD;
      increase over time as outcomes of intestinal disease and treatment may be tracked. As&#xD;
      required in future, research studies proposing to use biobank data and/or samples will be&#xD;
      submitted to a study committee and the REB (Research Ethics Board) for approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 2400 participants will be recruited to the Networks Inception Cohort study.&#xD;
      They will be followed from recruitment until transfer to adult care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be advised during the consent process that, as with any research study,&#xD;
      they may withdraw at any time by informing a study team member verbally or in writing. A&#xD;
      withdrawal request may be for all stored samples to be withdrawn, or it may be a request for&#xD;
      no additional samples to be collected (though already stored specimens may be retained).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Power Considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's sample size is arbitrarily fixed given the national incidence rate, duration of&#xD;
      recruitment, and selection of participating sites. Based on reported inception case numbers,&#xD;
      and likely engagement success, we anticipate recruiting approximately 400 to 500 patients per&#xD;
      year. Thus 1,200 to 1,500 subjects will have at least 18 months of follow-up data within the&#xD;
      5 year grant period. By the end of year 4 we would anticipate between 800 and 1000 subjects&#xD;
      have 18-month outcomes, reducing to 400 or 500 by the 3 year mark. The primary analysis,&#xD;
      within each of the described strata will be a test of proportions, presented as a Relative&#xD;
      Risk. Current figures would suggest 60% of the study cohort will have Crohn's disease (CD),&#xD;
      and of those 20% L1, 20% L2, 50% L3, and 10% isolated L4b. Approximately 20% of CD patients&#xD;
      are exposed to anti-TNF within 12 months. Information from ongoing studies suggest at least&#xD;
      60% of patients are in a sustained clinical remission by 12 months. The minimum RR (effect&#xD;
      size) we will be able to demonstrate in any analysis based on the network cohort, and the&#xD;
      confidence (power) we can have in that estimation, will depend on the number of exposed&#xD;
      subjects (cases) within the strata of interest and the anticipated outcome frequency in the&#xD;
      unexposed subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Environmental Exposure Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are systematically assessing environmental factors that have previously been associated&#xD;
      with Inflammatory Bowel Disease in the literature and factors that are hypothesized to be&#xD;
      associated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease based on knowledge of pathophysiology. All&#xD;
      patients will complete the comprehensive questionnaire at least once during the duration of&#xD;
      follow-up. The questionnaires will be internet-based and completed by the patient with&#xD;
      parental assistance either at home or in the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will assess the effect of environmental exposures on the following outcomes: type,&#xD;
      location and extent of disease at diagnosis (2); disease severity at diagnosis, and&#xD;
      subsequent clinical disease course. Disease course will be followed and ultimately classified&#xD;
      as 'severe', 'indolent', 'continuous sustained clinical remission'. Time to sentinel events&#xD;
      (such as surgery, commencement of anti-TNF therapy (anti-tumour necrosis factor), development&#xD;
      of complicating disease behaviour) will also be recorded. We will examine the univariate&#xD;
      effect of the listed environmental exposures including breastfeeding, antibiotic use, and&#xD;
      passive smoking exposure on both the baseline phenotype and the subsequent disease course&#xD;
      strata. Logistic regression models will be constructed to evaluate the potential effect of&#xD;
      ethnicity (eg. South Asian versus Caucasian) after adjusting for environmental exposures. CD&#xD;
      (Crohn's Disease) and UC (Ulcerative Colitis) will be studied separately. Risk estimates will&#xD;
      be expressed as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. For sentinel events within 18&#xD;
      months of diagnosis we will apply semiparametric and nonparametric methods of survival&#xD;
      analysis, including Cox regression models, to assess firstly the effect of various&#xD;
      environmental factors stratified by ethnicity, as well as the association of race/ancestry&#xD;
      after adjusting for environmental risk factors. The potential effect modification of South&#xD;
      Asian ancestry on Inflammatory Bowel Disease prognosis will be formally assessed. Finally, a&#xD;
      paired comparison will be attempted examining the effect of a change in exposure status on&#xD;
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease disease course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary Exposure Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are using a combination of quantitative dietary assessment utilizing the food frequency&#xD;
      questionnaire, FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire), (modified for the age of population&#xD;
      studied) and a qualitative dietary assessment using the modified Canadian Healthy Eating&#xD;
      Index (HEIC-2009). This approach allows us to test the hypothesis that high caloric intake&#xD;
      from processed and prepared foods with low glycemic index and high fat content have a&#xD;
      facilitative effect on the development of Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Moreover, it allows us&#xD;
      to examine diet-diet interactions, diet-gene interactions, and diet-microbiome interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) content validity and reproducibility will be assessed&#xD;
      using Pearson correlation coefficients for normally distributed data and Spearman rank&#xD;
      correlation coefficients where the data are not normally distributed. Caloric intake, dietary&#xD;
      quality and specific dietary components such as fats/specific fatty acids, sugars, vitamin D&#xD;
      and antioxidants will be divided into age and gender-specific quartiles from the distribution&#xD;
      across Inflammatory Bowel Disease cases, based on phenotype (Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's&#xD;
      Disease) and disease severity (Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) and&#xD;
      Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI).) Logistic regression models will be&#xD;
      developed, adjusting for age at recruitment, gender, ethnicity and additional environmental&#xD;
      exposures (mutually adjusted for in analyses but updated in accordance with the additional&#xD;
      data obtained through review of environmental exposure e.g. smoking status, appendectomy,&#xD;
      tonsillectomy, usage of oral contraceptives, antibiotic use). Risk estimates will be&#xD;
      expressed as odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for Crohn's&#xD;
      Disease and Ulcerative Colitis separately, as well as for Inflammatory Bowel Disease&#xD;
      combined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Coordinating Centre Team and Organizational Structure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Network's National Coordinating Centre is housed at The Hospital for Sick Children,&#xD;
      University of Toronto. Information Technology infrastructure and support will be provided by&#xD;
      the SickKids Research Institute's Research IT Department. Additional 'ad-hoc' resources&#xD;
      related to IT development/support, legal counsel, bio-statistical assistance will be&#xD;
      available to the centre as required via the resources of the SickKids Research Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Coordinating Centre is responsible for data-integrity and completeness and&#xD;
      ensures accountability by sites for full and timely data completeness. Support systems for&#xD;
      collecting and recording data and encourages 'real-time' data abstraction and direct data&#xD;
      entry. The Network is utilizing the REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) application as&#xD;
      its primary data-collection platform. REDCap is a secure, web-based application designed to&#xD;
      support data capture for research studies, providing: 1) an intuitive interface for validated&#xD;
      data entry; 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; 3)&#xD;
      automated export procedures for seamless data download to common statistical packages; and 4)&#xD;
      procedures for importing data from external sources. Within the data collection platform,&#xD;
      numerous 'real-time' and 'post hoc' data check procedures will be implemented. Statistics&#xD;
      concerning 'data-integrity' will be reported to the Executive Committee on a regular and&#xD;
      frequent basis. The National Coordinating Centre will conduct site-specific staff training at&#xD;
      the initiation of the study, when new staff are employed, and when any new tools or&#xD;
      significant study procedures are added to the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NETWORK MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strategic planning and operations of the network (including protocol development,&#xD;
      finances, development of partnerships) will be overseen by the Network Management Committee.&#xD;
      The Network Management Committee will give direction and oversight to the Clinical Site&#xD;
      Directors. Based on lessons learned from other networks, teleconferences involving site&#xD;
      clinical directors and research coordinators will be held regularly to review progress and&#xD;
      data. All clinical site directors are included as co-applicants (if not principal applicants)&#xD;
      on the grant, and will be individually engaged in working groups. The Director of the&#xD;
      National Coordinating Centre will report directly to the Network's Executive Steering&#xD;
      Committee, and is responsible for overseeing all functions of the National Coordinating&#xD;
      Centre. National Coordinating Centre functions will be informed by the Network's Phenotyping&#xD;
      Committee, Ancillary Studies/Data Access Committee, and IT Innovations Committee. The Ethics&#xD;
      committee will ensure that Ethical standards are met. The Scientific/Technical Advisory&#xD;
      Committee (S/TAC) includes Network PIs with biomedical, population health and health services&#xD;
      research expertise. These will be responsible for development of, respectively, standard&#xD;
      operating procedures for biologic specimen handling and storage, design and approval of&#xD;
      translational research initiatives; environmental questionnaires and establishment of linkage&#xD;
      to provincial administrative databases. The Scientific/Technical Advisory Committee in&#xD;
      conjunction with the Network Management Committee will develop Terms of Agreement for use of&#xD;
      biospecimens and data for ancillary research, and for publications. The Scientific/Technical&#xD;
      Advisory Committee will meet twice yearly with the Network Management Committee.&#xD;
