  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the two main types of replacement tissue heart valve used in current&#xD;
      practice, comparing outcomes from surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) with that of the&#xD;
      more recently introduced &quot;key-hole&quot; procedure called transcatheter aortic valve implantation&#xD;
      (TAVI). Participants will be recruited at various time points ranging from 1 month to 10&#xD;
      years following valve replacement with either AVR or TAVI. It is thought that progressive&#xD;
      calcium (chalk) formation is responsible for the failure of the majority of these valves. All&#xD;
      participants will therefore have a PET-CT scan with a special type of &quot;tracer&quot; called&#xD;
      18F-fluoride in order to measure active calcium formation in the valve. They will then have&#xD;
      annual clinical follow-up for 5 years and be invited back for a repeat CT scan at 2 years to&#xD;
      measure change in calcium burden. This study aims to investigate, firstly, the effects of&#xD;
      valve age and type on calcium formation as measured by PET-CT and, secondly, whether this&#xD;
      measure of calcium formation can help to predict how long different types of valve will last.&#xD;
      If successful, 18F-fluoride PET-CT could become a valuable tool for testing new treatments to&#xD;
      improve valve longevity and new valve designs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis is the commonest form of valve disease in the western world and the leading&#xD;
      indication for valve surgery. Bioprosthetic valves are known to degenerate via a process that&#xD;
      is predominantly driven by calcification. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has&#xD;
      recently emerged as a less invasive alternative to conventional aortic valve replacement&#xD;
      (AVR) surgery. Whilst this technique holds great promise, long-term follow up data are&#xD;
      lacking and the longevity of these valves remains to be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this longitudinal, cross-sectional study of 180 subjects with either surgical or&#xD;
      transcatheter implanted bioprostheses, this study proposes to look for the earliest signs of&#xD;
      active calcification using 18F-fluoride positron emission tomography (PET). During a 5 year&#xD;
      follow-up period, this study hopes to demonstrate that 18F-fluoride PET will predict&#xD;
      subsequent bioprosthetic valve degeneration and identify patients at risk of premature valve&#xD;
      failure. The study also hopes that it will inform about the comparative durability of novel&#xD;
      percutaneous valves. If successful, 18F-Fluoride could provide a useful method of assessing&#xD;
      novel therapeutic strategies targeted at improving the longevity of bioprostheses and help to&#xD;
      guide future valve design.&#xD;
