  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is a morbid disease associated with a poor outcome, particularly those with&#xD;
      high-risk cytogenetics. While standard therapies have modestly improved survival in these&#xD;
      high-risk patients, myeloma remains incurable. To date, the only potential curative treatment&#xD;
      remains allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, the high incidences of&#xD;
      toxicities including chronic GVHD and disease progression are currently the two most&#xD;
      important obstacles to this therapy. Better approaches to maintain and improve benefits of&#xD;
      allogeneic transplant, while decreasing toxicity, are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that Bortezomib administration after non myeloablative&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in high-risk myeloma patients might&#xD;
      improved the outcome of these patients by decreasing myeloma relapse and the severity of&#xD;
      chronic GVHD while preserving the graft-versus-myeloma effect. Our goal is to improve the&#xD;
      poor clinical outcome of high-risk myeloma patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, the only potential curative treatment for multiple myeloma remains allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Achievement of remission in myeloma patients&#xD;
      allotransplanted with advanced disease, achievement of complete response in relapsed patients&#xD;
      following infusion of donor leucocyte infusions, decreased incidence of relapse associated&#xD;
      with chronic GVHD, better survival in myeloma patients who have relapsed after allogeneic&#xD;
      transplant with rescue medication and production of an allo-immune response after allogeneic&#xD;
      transplant, all support the existence of a graft-versus-myeloma effect. However, chronic GVHD&#xD;
      participating to the morbidity and mortality of allogeneic transplantation, in addition to&#xD;
      the significant relapse rate despite the transplantation are two important obstacles to this&#xD;
      therapeutic modality in myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bortezomib (VelcadeTM) is a dipeptidyl boronic acid-based reversible proteasome inhibitor.&#xD;
      Several mechanisms of action have been proposed for its effects against multiple myeloma:&#xD;
      direct induction of myeloma cells apoptosis, inhibition of NF-κB activation, reduction of&#xD;
      myeloma cells adherence to the bone marrow microenvironment (decreasing drug resistance),&#xD;
      inhibition of production, secretion and intracellular signalling of myeloma-mediators. It is&#xD;
      one of the most effective drugs in the treatment of multiple myeloma. As consolidation&#xD;
      treatment after autologous stem cell transplantation, the drug has been associated with an&#xD;
      improvement in response rate and more importantly, in quality and depth of response.&#xD;
      Maintenance treatment with Bortezomib after autologous transplantation has led to survival&#xD;
      improvement, a benefit particularly obvious in myeloma patients with high-risk cytogenetics&#xD;
      such as those carrying del(17p13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to its anti-myeloma properties, Bortezomib has immunomodulatory effects. Indeed,&#xD;
      proteasome inhibitors affect several aspects of immune and inflammatory responses by&#xD;
      interfering with antigen presenting cell function and effector cell function. Given its&#xD;
      immunomodulatory properties, Bortezomib has recently been shown to be safe and effective in&#xD;
      HLA-mismatched reduced-intensity conditioning transplantation as a GVHD prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective phase II, open label, single institution study evaluating a novel&#xD;
      treatment strategy in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients with high-risk disease or&#xD;
      patients ≤ 50 years old. After an optimal Bortezomib-based induction treatment (VTD, CyBorD,&#xD;
      RVD or PAD [in patients with plasma cell leukemia]) for a minimum of 4 cycles, followed by&#xD;
      Melphalan ≥ 140 mg/m2 and autologous stem cell transplantation, eligible patients who accept&#xD;
      to participate will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 6 months of autologous transplantation, patients will receive a non myeloablative&#xD;
      allogeneic transplantation. Patients with a 6/6 compatible sibling donor will receive a&#xD;
      conditioning regimen with Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 and Cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 per day for 5&#xD;
      days from day -8 to day -4 with 3 rest days before donor stem cell infusion on day 0.&#xD;
      Patients without a sibling donor who have an 8/8 allele matched unrelated donor will receive&#xD;
      a conditioning regimen of Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 per day for 3 days from day -4 to -2 and TBI 2&#xD;
      Gy on day -1 with donor stem cell infusion on day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In sibling transplant recipients, GVHD prophylaxis will consist of Tacrolimus 3 mg p.o. BID&#xD;
      starting on day -8, adjusted thrice weekly to obtain blood levels between 8-12 ng/mL.&#xD;
      Tacrolimus tapering will start day +50 to be completed by day +100 in the absence of GVHD. In&#xD;
      matched unrelated donor recipients, Tacrolimus will be initiated as in siblings, but started&#xD;
      on day -4, and taper will be initiated on day +100 to be completed by day +180 in the absence&#xD;
      of GVHD. MMF 15 mg/kg p.o. BID will be given from day +1 to +50 in sibling recipients. It&#xD;
      will be given at same dose but TID from day +1 to +40, then tapered gradually until day +100&#xD;
      in matched unrelated donor recipients. Patients without progressive disease after allogeneic&#xD;
      transplantation will receive Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 s.c. every 14 days ± 3 days starting on day&#xD;
      +120, for a total of 26 doses (1 year treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed regularly for disease evaluation, using the IMWG criteria. Toxicity&#xD;
      will be evaluated using the NCI common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE)&#xD;
      version 4.0. Occurrence and severity of acute GVHD will be evaluated using the modified&#xD;
      Glucksberg criteria. Chronic GVHD will be evaluated using the NIH criteria. The trial will be&#xD;
      terminated when all patients have been followed for 5 years after allogeneic hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
