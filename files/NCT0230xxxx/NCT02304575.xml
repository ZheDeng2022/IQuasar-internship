  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Testicular Cancer is the most prevalent malignancy among men between 20 and 34 years of age,&#xD;
      with incidence rates rising in western countries including Israel. Cure rate of testicular&#xD;
      cancer exceeds 90% with modern treatments. Thus issues such as quality of life (QoL), coping,&#xD;
      effects on couple relationships, cognitive function, cognitive orientation and hormonal&#xD;
      function become increasingly important. This study aims to assess all these issues using&#xD;
      validated, reproducible questionnaires and hormonal plasma levels, and compare them between&#xD;
      testicular cancer survivors and controls.&#xD;

      The study will be conducted in RMC, Beilinson and Golda. Eligible male patient list will be&#xD;
      drawn from the Rabin Medical Center (RMC) operation rooms' data system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted by their treating urologists over the phone or during follow-up&#xD;
      visits and invited to take part in the research which will be conducted at RMC. The first&#xD;
      stage of the study will include a validation of the EORTC QLQ-TC26 questionnaire in Hebrew.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and partners / spouses will sign informed-consent forms and fill out questionnaires&#xD;
      during their visit, and blood samples will be drawn on the day of questionnaire completion or&#xD;
      no longer than 1 month from it. Spouses will be given the choice of arriving with the patient&#xD;
      and filling-in their questionnaires at RMC, or having them mailed to their homes. Research&#xD;
      assistants will provide assistance with the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal controls will be recruited among Tel Aviv University students, 'Achva' College&#xD;
      students and RMS staff and asked to come to RMC for blood tests. Control subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to answer the same cancer-related questionnaires as the patients, as fully as possible,&#xD;
      unless the questions are irrelevant to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anticipated recruitment period will be approximately 36 months. Financial incentives: a&#xD;
      compensation of 150 NIS will be offered to healthy participants coming to RMC for blood tests&#xD;
      under this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of research participation: 1 or 2 encounters (the second for missing data or missing&#xD;
      blood samples, and in the first 30 patients - for TC26 questionnaire re-validation by the&#xD;
      EORTC requirements), during no longer than 1 month for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will be compared across the patient and 2 control groups and their correlation&#xD;
      to hormonal function assessed.&#xD;
