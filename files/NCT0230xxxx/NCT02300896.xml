  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current model of care for the hospitalized elderly patients has been conditioned by many&#xD;
      factors unrelated to the disease process that caused the hospitalization and usually worsen&#xD;
      the outcome of hospitalization circumstances. Many times hospitalized elderly patients spend&#xD;
      most of the time in bed (even higher than 83% of bed rest versus 4% of those who stand or are&#xD;
      walking). These patients have their functional and physiological reserve reduced which makes&#xD;
      them more vulnerable to the effects of being bedridden. The consequences are at multiple&#xD;
      levels emphasizing the functional loss or cognitive impairment, longer stays, mortality and&#xD;
      institutionalization, delirium, deconditioning, pressure ulcers and decreased caloric intake,&#xD;
      social isolation, poor quality of life and increased use of resources related to health.&#xD;
      Exercise training can prevent functional and cognitive decline and modify even the posterior&#xD;
      trajectory.&#xD;

      This study is a randomized clinical trial conducted in a Department of Geriatrics of a&#xD;
      tertiary public hospital with 35 beds allocated. Hospitalized patients who meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be randomly assigned to intervention or control group. Patient recruitment will&#xD;
      begin in the first 48 hours of admission to the ward, which will be identified through the&#xD;
      list of patients admitted to the hospital and assigned to the Department of Geriatrics. The&#xD;
      doctor who decides the inclusion in the intervention or control group will not be the&#xD;
      attending physician. Patients or their families (if the patient has cognitive impairment)&#xD;
      will be informed of the random inclusion in one group, but will not be informed as to which&#xD;
      they belong. Randomization will be performed by applying http://www.randomizer.org/. The&#xD;
      information in both the intervention group and the control group will obtained in four&#xD;
      different stages: the initial visit and at months 3, 6 and 12 after hospital discharge.&#xD;
