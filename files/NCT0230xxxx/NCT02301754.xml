  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      INVAC-1 is intended to be used for the treatment of adult patients with advanced solid tumors&#xD;
      unresponsive to currently available therapies, or for whom no standard therapy is available.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is the first-in-patient study of INVAC-1, a DNA vaccine encoding human telomerase&#xD;
      reverse transcriptase (hTERT). hTERT is the catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex which&#xD;
      synthesizes telomeric DNA at the chromosome ends. hTERT is overexpressed in most human tumors&#xD;
      and virtually all types of cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INVAC-1 is developed for cancer therapy. Stimulation of the immune system directed against&#xD;
      telomerase expressing cancer cells has the potential to generate tumor responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacodynamics (PD) of INVAC-1&#xD;
      administered alone by intradermal route to adults with solid tumor malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As shown in non-clinical studies, the efficacy of the vaccine is enhanced by electroporation,&#xD;
      which thus will be combined with the vaccination in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general clinical plan includes development of INVAC-1 in both hematologic malignancies&#xD;
      and solid tumors, as a single agent and in combination with other targeted anticancer agents&#xD;
      such as check-points inhibitors, radiotherapy or chemotherapies.&#xD;
