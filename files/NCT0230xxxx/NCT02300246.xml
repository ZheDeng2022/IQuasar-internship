  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), belongs to a new generation of plasma concentrate with&#xD;
      biomechanical processing simplified and without the need for handling blood biochemistry.&#xD;
      Some studies have shown the potential of PRF in release growth factors assisting and&#xD;
      accelerating the regeneration of soft tissues, however with contradictory results regarding&#xD;
      the hard tissues. The aim of this study will be to evaluate through clinical analyzes,&#xD;
      histomorphometric and micro-computed tomographic images, the dimensional changes, the&#xD;
      quantity and the quality of the tissues formed socket after extractions that receive&#xD;
      membranes of PRF. 15 sockets (test group) will receive a membrane of PRF after extraction and&#xD;
      the other 15 (control group) received no biomaterial (spontaneous healing).&#xD;

      1. Development methodology This study will be a randomized controlled and will be conducted&#xD;
           according to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki regarding&#xD;
           experiments on human beings. This work was submitted to the Ethics Committee, with the&#xD;
           approval number: CAAE: 21317113.4.0000.5243. To ensure the quality of this randomized&#xD;
           study, guidelines RCT-CONSORT checklist will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Selection of volunteers / sample The sample will consist of 30 human alveolar socket.&#xD;
           Selected volunteers must agree to participate in the study signed an informed consent&#xD;
           form and being willing to follow the guidelines and proposed timelines. The volunteers&#xD;
           will be treated at the Dental Clinical Research Center of the Fluminense Federal&#xD;
           University. The 30 teeth involved in this study should provide an indication of tooth&#xD;
           extraction without treatment possibilities, determined by clinical and radiological&#xD;
           examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pre-Surgical Treatment Dental and medical case histories will be conducted on all&#xD;
           volunteers. Initially, volunteers will be selected and diagnosed by clinical examination&#xD;
           and periapical radiographic or cone beam tomographic to assess the need for tooth&#xD;
           extraction. All volunteers will undergo basic periodontal therapy and oral hygiene&#xD;
           instructions. Volunteers who have a risk factor for bacterial endocarditis will be&#xD;
           medicated with Amoxicillin 2g single dose one hour before the procedure, and for those&#xD;
           allergic to penicillin, will be prescribed 600g single dose of clindamycin one hour&#xD;
           before procedure, as recommended by the American College of Cardiology. Laboratory&#xD;
           tests, including blood pressure measurement, complete blood count, lipid profile,&#xD;
           coagulation profile and complete fasting glucose will be required for all volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Surgical Procedures Plaster study models are made by molding with alginate in all&#xD;
           volunteers, to enable construction of the measuring guides (templates) in acrylic. Also&#xD;
           intraoral photographs will be held. Volunteers will undergo local anesthesia (2% with&#xD;
           epinephrine Mepvacaína - 1: 100.00) for extraction of teeth. In all cases, the&#xD;
           extractions will be performed in a minimally traumatic manner and without lifting flap&#xD;
           with the aim of preservation tissues. Incisions intra-sulculares the free surfaces&#xD;
           (buccal / lingual) and proximal (mesial / distal) will be performed with a scalpel blade&#xD;
           15C aiming the disruption of the periodontal fibers. The dislocation of the tooth will&#xD;
           be conducted with a forceps, with subsequent removal of the tooth socket. After&#xD;
           extraction, a rigorous inspection and curettage of the socket for the removal of&#xD;
           granulation tissue will be held, followed by irrigation with sterile saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Performed after extraction, will start to make themselves venous blood of volunteers&#xD;
           himself for a qualified professional with the goal of achieving the PRF membrane. For&#xD;
           this, will be collected with a sterile without anti-coagulant about 10 ml of blood from&#xD;
           the median cubital vein (arm) syringe. It will be led immediately into a test tube and&#xD;
           centrifuge for which will be calibrated to 2700 rpm for 12 minutes. After processing,&#xD;
           three phases are arranged within a test tube. The fibrin clot is obtained between the&#xD;
           layers of acellular layer of plasma and red blood cells. The same tube is carefully&#xD;
           collected and manipulated to form a membrane which is sutured with 5.0 absorbable&#xD;
           synthetic yarn (Vycril - Johnson &amp; Johnson). The sutures are removed seven days after&#xD;
           the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The remaining fifteen sockets (control group) are not filled with any biomaterial (only&#xD;
           clot). Volunteers will be instructed to rinse their mouths twice daily for 15 days with&#xD;
           chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Queries review will be conducted in the first week for suture removal and the subsequent&#xD;
           second and fifth weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Clinical Evaluation Prior to the extraction of both groups, the bands of keratinized&#xD;
           gingiva buccal and lingual measures are the muco-gingival line to the gingival margin,&#xD;
           with support from the UNC-15 periodontal probe, positioned on a template (stent )&#xD;
           acrylic resin. Furthermore, measurements of the gingival margin of the template, track&#xD;
           keratinized gingiva and the measurement from the edge of the template edge bony ridge&#xD;
           will be held in the regions mesial, buccal and distal of the buccal and lingual&#xD;
           surfaces. For the evaluation of the thickness of the tissues, a surgical caliper located&#xD;
           at 5mm from the gingival margin is used. The data collected will be immediately recorded&#xD;
           by an assistant. Clinical evaluations will be performed prior to extraction (T1) and 120&#xD;
           days (T2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Histomorphometric analysis At T2, an implant will be installed in the socket region. The&#xD;
           surgical bone obtained during the discharge procedure for implant placement through a&#xD;
           trephine measuring about 3mm in diameter, will be collected. It will be stored in&#xD;
           buffered formaldehyde, decalcified in EDTA, dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in&#xD;
           paraffin. Serial sections including the central portion of the bone cylinder will be&#xD;
           prepared parallel to the long axis, with the standard microtome in 5mm. The sections are&#xD;
           stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The analysis of the new tissue formed is evaluated&#xD;
           in Leitz microscope equipped with image capture system. Morphometric measurements are&#xD;
           evaluated to determine the proportion occupied by mineralized bone (lamellar bone,&#xD;
           immature bone), osteoid tissue (connective tissue matrix rich in collagen and partially&#xD;
           mineralized), bone marrow (adipocytes and vascular structures), fibrous tissue and&#xD;
           tissue residual (tissue elements unidentified artifacts of preparation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Micro-computed tomographics Representative non-decalcified samples will be scanned at a&#xD;
           resolution of 18 x 18 x 18 voxels μc3 using a micro-Pxs5-928EA cone beam CT. The GEHC&#xD;
           MicroView Plus ® Analysis software (GE Healthcare), will be used to create&#xD;
           three-dimensional reconstructions (3D) bone tissue from the scan. The tissue to be&#xD;
           analyzed is represented by all or fragments of tissue biopsy samples. The value scale in&#xD;
           grayscale will be used in each biopsy by a single calibrated examiner and anonymous. The&#xD;
           value of the average grayscale will be calculated and used as the representative to&#xD;
           evaluate bone volume (BV) and the mineral content of the tissue value. The tissue&#xD;
           mineral density will also be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Statistical analysis The results express the mean ± 95% CI. Mann-Whitney tests will be&#xD;
           conducted. Will be considered as significant differences when P &lt; 0.05. Nominal data&#xD;
           will be evaluated by chi-square test. Alternatively, in case of no associates (extreme)&#xD;
           values, the Fisher exact test will be used. Continuous variables are expressed as mean&#xD;
           and standard deviation and analyzed for normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test.&#xD;
           The Student t or Mann-Whitney tests will be applied for normal and non-normal&#xD;
           distribution, respectively.&#xD;
