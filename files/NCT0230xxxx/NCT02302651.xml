      Non-invasive treatment of Osteoid osteoma using MRI guided high-intensity focused ultrasound.&#xD;
      This study is designed as an intention-to-treat using a totally non-invasive approach for&#xD;
      pain reduction, quality of life improvement and long-term bone restoration. Procedure is&#xD;
      performed in a single session using limited amount of acoustic energy to target the osteoid&#xD;
      nidus. Treatment will be performed under anesthesia (peripheral or general according to age&#xD;
      and lesion position).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An osteoid osteoma is a benign, painful musculoskeletal tumor that usually occurs in young&#xD;
      males. The standard of care in the United States is computed tomography (CT)-guided&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation, a minimally invasive percutaneous procedure, with clinical success&#xD;
      rates ranging between 85% and 98%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous or surgical therapy can lead to non-negligible side-effects and limited efficacy&#xD;
      for pediatric population or young adults with osteoid osteoma. We investigate whether&#xD;
      selective focal ablation of osteoid lesions can reduce this treatment burden without&#xD;
      compromising long-term clinical efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments will be performed using a 3.0-T MR unit (Discovery MR 750; GE Medical Systems,&#xD;
      Milwaukee,Wis) featuring a Conformité Européenne-approved ExAblate MR-guided focused&#xD;
      ultrasound system (InSightec,Tirat-Carmel, Israel) in which the ultrasound transducer is&#xD;
      housed in the patient table. Alignment between the lesion and the transducer will be obtained&#xD;
      in each patient by using a moistened gel pad and degassed water for acoustic coupling. This&#xD;
      approach avoided air- skin interfaces, which can cause energy reflection and skin burns.&#xD;
      After patient positioning, the lesion is localized with MR for treatment by using variably&#xD;
      orientated non enhanced T1- and T2-weighted acquisitions. In general, an ideal 90° incidental&#xD;
      angle between the planned focused ultrasound path and the lesion, relative to the bone long&#xD;
      axis, is obtained or at least approximated. The shortest skin-lesion distance is selected for&#xD;
      the beam pathway. Care will be taken to avoid multiple interfaces (skin, muscle, fasciae) as&#xD;
      much as possible so as to minimize deflection of the focused ultrasound beam. Each lesion&#xD;
      will be manually segmented by the operator to precisely delineate the nidus, skin surface,&#xD;
      and cortical surface of the bone. Sensitive areas surrounding the target volumes will also be&#xD;
      drawn to limit the energy and prevent unwanted thermal damage. The treatment plan is than&#xD;
      calculated automatically by the ExAblate software according to previously acquired&#xD;
      parameters, including the energy (in joules), the interval between two sonications, the&#xD;
      sonication duration, and the spot size, which are modifiable by the operator. Thereafter, a&#xD;
      low-energy sonication test will be performed to confirm the path and correct direction of the&#xD;
      ultrasound beam into the target area and to confirm the planned energy dose and the effective&#xD;
      dose deployed to the lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increase in tissue temperature is evaluated by using real-time MR thermometry of&#xD;
      phase-difference fast spoiled gradient-echo sequences (proton resonant frequency shift&#xD;
      method). The sequences are acquired to provide temperature-dependent images and real-time&#xD;
      mapping of the thermal dose on a preferred imaging plane. The proton resonant frequency shift&#xD;
      method starts simultaneously with each sonication. Similar to other treatments of bone&#xD;
      lesions that use MR-guided focused ultrasound, the temperature increase is determined on the&#xD;
      adjacent periskeletal tissue. In fact, proton resonant frequency sequences cannot effectively&#xD;
      measure the temperature on the bone surface because of the absence of moving protons in the&#xD;
      cortical zone. Thus, MR thermometry reveals a temperature increase, which propagates by&#xD;
      conductive processes from the bone to the immediately adjacent soft tissues that respond&#xD;
      linearly to an increase in bone temperature, thereby allowing an accurate measure of heating.&#xD;
      Portions of periosteum and adjacent tumor that are not fully ablated can be re-treated if&#xD;
      deemed necessary. The critical temperature threshold for ablation is set at 65°C in the soft&#xD;
      tissues adjacent to the targeted bone structures. Postprocedural care includes evaluation of&#xD;
      possible skin burns, monitoring of vital signs for 2 hours after treatment in the MR&#xD;
      department, and administration of analgesic and/or antiemetic drugs if requested.&#xD;
      Treatment-related adverse events will be recorded as minor or major on the basis of medical&#xD;
      severity, additional treatment, and long-term consequences for patients. Treatment will be&#xD;
      performed on an outpatient basis in the patients who receive only local and peripheral&#xD;
      anesthesia; the patient who receives general anesthesia is usually hospitalized for 24 hours&#xD;
      after treatment.&#xD;
