      The purpose of this study is to assess safety of nab-paclitaxel based chemotherapy regimens&#xD;
      administered prior to and/or in combination with nivolumab in Pancreatic Cancer, Non Small&#xD;
      Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and Metastatic Breast Cancer (mBC).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This will be a phase 1, open-label, multicenter, safety study of nab-paclitaxel based&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens administered prior to and/or in combination with nivolumab in&#xD;
      Pancreatic Cancer, NSCLC and mBC. This is a six arm study assessing two treatment arms per&#xD;
      tumor-type/indication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with 1 prior systemic chemotherapy (Arm A, Part 1 only);&#xD;
           and subsequently no prior chemotherapy, surgery or radiation therapy for locally&#xD;
           advanced or metastatic disease (Arm A, Part 2 and Arm B):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Panc Ca Arm A: nab-paclitaxel with nivolumab starting at Cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Panc Ca Arm B: nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine with nivolumab starting at Cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage IIIB or IV NSCLC with no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease and who are not&#xD;
           candidates for curative surgery or radiation:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  NSCLC Arm C: nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin x 4 cycles with nivolumab starting Cycle 1&#xD;
                and continuing as monotherapy starting at Cycle 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  NSCLC Arm D: nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin x 4 cycles with nivolumab starting Cycle 3&#xD;
                and continuing as monotherapy starting at Cycle 5&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HER2-negative recurrent metastatic breast cancer after one prior regimen for mBC,&#xD;
           including an anthracycline unless clinically contraindicated:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  mBC Arm E: weekly nab-paclitaxel with nivolumab starting at Cycle 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  mBC Arm F: q3weekly nab-paclitaxel with nivolumab starting at Cycle 3. Enrollment&#xD;
                in each treatment arm will be conducted in two sequential parts to allow for the&#xD;
                evaluation of the DLT in Part 1 prior to expanding the treatment arm in Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 will assess the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of the nivolumab dose in combination with&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel regimens in each treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the entry criteria will be assigned to the respective treatment arm based&#xD;
      on tumor type and indication as outlined above. Panc Ca Arms A and B, as well as NSCLC Arms C&#xD;
      and D, will enroll sequentially in Part 1. The safety of nivolumab in combination with&#xD;
      nabpaclitaxel, without gemcitabine, will first be assessed in Arm A in subjects with one&#xD;
      prior systemic chemotherapy regimen for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Panc Ca Arm B&#xD;
      may begin enrolling subjects in Part 1, if Panc Ca Arm A is deemed safe, based on DLT&#xD;
      criteria. Similarly, NSCLC Arm D will begin to enroll in Part 1 after NSCLC Arm C is deemed&#xD;
      safe to expand in Part 2. However, Arm D may be initiated, even if Arm C is not to proceed&#xD;
      for Part 2, if the totality of data from Arm C and emerging data from this and other studies&#xD;
      in NSCLC with nivolumab in combination with platinum chemotherapy doublets support the&#xD;
      decision. Unlike the Panc Ca and NSCLC arms, the two mBC arms (Arms E and F) will be&#xD;
      initiated simultaneously. Subjects will be assigned randomly between treatment arms of a&#xD;
      tumor type/indication whenever both treatment arms are enrolling. An IRT system will be used&#xD;
      to ensure the central random allocation of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment arms deemed safe within each tumor-type/indication may be expanded using the RP2D&#xD;
      with an additional approximately 14 subjects (to attain a total of 20 nivolumab-treated&#xD;
      subjects) to further assess safety and tolerability, as well as explore anti-tumor activity&#xD;
      of the proposed regimens. Since the primary population for the pancreas arms is in subjects&#xD;
      with no prior chemotherapy, surgery or radiation therapy, enrollment in Part 2 for Panc Ca&#xD;
      Arm A will continue until 20 such subjects have been treated with at least one dose of&#xD;
      nivolumab. Additionally, in Parts 1 and 2 overall, each mBC Arm (E and F) will enroll a&#xD;
      minimum of 9 subjects with triple- negative breast cancer (TNBC), treated at the RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both Part 1 and 2, subjects may continue to receive their assigned treatment regimen&#xD;
      until Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 defined progression or until&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. However, the chemotherapy doublet will only be given for 4 cycles in&#xD;
      the NSCLC arms; thereafter, nivolumab will be given as monotherapy.&#xD;
