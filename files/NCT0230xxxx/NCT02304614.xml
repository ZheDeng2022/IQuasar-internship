    <textblock>
      3D surface imaging has been used in the objective evaluation of cosmetic outcome of&#xD;
      oncoplastic procedures such as breast reconstruction and lipofilling, however there is only&#xD;
      one article published relating to Breast Conserving Therapy (BCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the use 3D surface imaging as a tool in the assessment of&#xD;
      symmetry of outcome following breast conserving therapy. The results of the surface imaging&#xD;
      will be correlated with patient satisfaction, using the BREAST-Q, which is a validated&#xD;
      patient questionnaire and correlated with panel assessment by an independent panel of two&#xD;
      surgeons, one clinical oncologist and one breast care nurse.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BCT is the most common breast surgical oncological procedure performed with approximately&#xD;
      28,500 patients undergoing this operation every year. In breast cancer surgery, the primary&#xD;
      aim of removing the cancer must be reconciled with the secondary aim of preserving breast&#xD;
      aesthetics. Objective analysis of cosmetic outcome measures in breast surgery has been&#xD;
      lacking, however 3D surface imaging is beginning to show promise in this area. Having a&#xD;
      robust tool for objective assessment of outcomes may facilitate critical appraisal of&#xD;
      techniques and therefore surgeon learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently the cosmetic success of an operation can be subjectively evaluated by patients' and&#xD;
      surgeons' visual assessment. Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) are instruments to&#xD;
      measure any aspect of a patient's health status. Various PROMs have been used to evaluate&#xD;
      patients' satisfaction after breast cancer treatment. For example, the BREAST-Q was developed&#xD;
      quantitatively and qualitatively to measure patients' perceptions before and after breast&#xD;
      reconstruction by examining quality of life domains (psychosocial well-being, physical&#xD;
      well-being, sexual well-being) and satisfaction domains (satisfaction with breasts,&#xD;
      satisfaction with outcome, satisfaction with care). When using any of these PROMs, accuracy&#xD;
      and reproducibility are not measurable; the results are the subjective views of the patient.&#xD;
      While the patient opinion of her own appearance is clearly the most important outcome after&#xD;
      local oncological control, for the purposes of objective comparison between groups of&#xD;
      patients, surgeons and over time, independent clinicians (and / or lay people) may be&#xD;
      recruited to perform a 'panel assessment' of photographs in which the various aspects of&#xD;
      cosmesis such as breast shape, size and cleavage are considered in addition to overall&#xD;
      appearance. However such assessments are still subjective and often lack accuracy and&#xD;
      reproducibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been many attempts to derive objective measures of outcome. In the 1970's, Edstron&#xD;
      et al described 'split and reversed negatives' where photographic negatives of the left and&#xD;
      right breast were made and laid next to the non-negative right and left breast. The&#xD;
      constructed images of perfectly symmetrical breasts were compared with the original&#xD;
      photographs of the patients' breasts. More recently two software systems have been developed&#xD;
      to objectively evaluate the aesthetic surgical outcomes of breast surgery using 2D&#xD;
      photographs. The Breast Analyzing Tool (BATÂ©) evaluates symmetry by comparing breast area,&#xD;
      breast circumference and nipple position between the breasts. The Breast Cancer Conservative&#xD;
      Treatment cosmetic result (BCCT.core) also analyses colour differences and the scar&#xD;
      appearance in addition to asymmetry calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of 3D surface imaging in the clinical setting was first described by Burke and Beard&#xD;
      in 1967 to analyze facial structures. Over the last fifteen years 3D imaging has been used as&#xD;
      a research and clinical tool in aesthetic, oncoplastic and reconstructive breast surgery.&#xD;
      Initial studies established optimal technique to obtain images and tested accuracy and&#xD;
      reproducibility. 3D imaging is currently used to simulate for the patient what a cosmetic&#xD;
      augmentation might achieve in terms of size and shape. It has been demonstrated that&#xD;
      simulated images are accurate and patients felt they helped them to choose the implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of oncoplastic reconstructive surgery 3D surface imaging has been used in the&#xD;
      objective evaluation of cosmetic outcome of oncoplastic procedures such as breast&#xD;
      reconstruction and lipofilling, however there is only one article published relating to&#xD;
      Breast Conserving Therapy (BCT). Moyer et al analyzed twenty three patients who had undergone&#xD;
      BCT and compared volume and asymmetry. They found that there was a positive correlation&#xD;
      between percentage of breast parenchyma excised and asymmetry. The location of the cancer,&#xD;
      age of the patient and need for multiple operations did not influence cosmetic results but&#xD;
      the sample size was small and therefore likely underpowered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the use 3D surface imaging as a tool in the assessment of&#xD;
      symmetry of outcome following breast conserving therapy. The results of the surface imaging&#xD;
      will be correlated with patient satisfaction, using the BREAST-Q, which is a validated&#xD;
      patient questionnaire and correlated with panel assessment by an independent panel of two&#xD;
      surgeons, one clinical oncologist and one breast care nurse.&#xD;
