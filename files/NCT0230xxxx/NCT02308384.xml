      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is common, and a leading cause of cancer death. The evaluation of&#xD;
      patients suspected to have CRC is difficult due to poorly predictive alarm symptoms and many&#xD;
      patients present with uncharacteristic or vague symptoms. The faecal marker of human globin,&#xD;
      iFOBT, could play an important role in aiding the general practitioner in detecting CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be possible to implement iFOBT in general practice as a test performed on patients&#xD;
      who do not fulfill the criteria for fast-track referral for colorectal cancer, but whose&#xD;
      symptoms could indicate an undiagnosed colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      To implement iFOBT in general practice and evaluate the uptake and clinical use of the test.&#xD;
      Furthermore, we want to investigate the performance of iFOBT when used on patients presenting&#xD;
      with uncharacteristic symptoms of CRC, and the clinical implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study uses a cluster randomised stepped wedge design. Clusters are constituted by the 18&#xD;
      municipalities in the central Denmark Region, and these are randomised when to receive a&#xD;
      continuous medical education (CME). The date of inclusion is defined as the first working day&#xD;
      in the month the CME is planned to be conducted. The CME is part of an intervention aimed to&#xD;
      facilitate the implementation of iFOBT in general practice. Besides a CME, the intervention&#xD;
      consist of a start package (iFOBT kits, a guideline and online educational material) that is&#xD;
      sent to GPs when they are included in the study, and a status mail that GPs receive approx.&#xD;
      one month after inclusion. The inclusion period is during the first 7 month of the study&#xD;
      period, the study lasts for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide important knowledge on how to improve CRC diagnostics in general&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common type of cancer in Denmark and is a leading&#xD;
      cause of cancer death. Since 2000, the incidence has been increasing by 1-1.5% each year. The&#xD;
      estimated 5-year survival rate is currently 80% for stage I cancer, 50% for stages II and&#xD;
      III, and &lt;5 % for stage IV cancer. These figures emphasize the importance of detecting the&#xD;
      disease in early stages and underline the current challenge of diagnosing CRC in general&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2008, a national fast-track system for cancer patients was established to ensure fast&#xD;
      diagnosis and initiation of treatment. The fast-track system implies that patients presenting&#xD;
      'alarm' symptoms of e.g. CRC will be referred immediately for diagnostic workup; no more than&#xD;
      14 days must pass from referral to initiation of treatment. Several studies have shown that&#xD;
      the positive predictive values (PPV) of the symptoms regarding CRC are fairly low (4-8%). In&#xD;
      addition, approximately 50% of new CRC incidents will present with other vague and&#xD;
      uncharacteristic symptoms than alarm symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a screening programme for CRC has been implemented. It is suggested that this&#xD;
      will increase survival rate of CRC, however, it is estimated that approximately 75% of yearly&#xD;
      CRC still have to be diagnosed through general practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A huge load is, consequently, still placed on general practice in the quest for earlier&#xD;
      diagnosis of CRC, and better methods to aid the general practitioner in the diagnostic&#xD;
      process are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One tool could be the use of iFOBT in general practice for patients who present with symptoms&#xD;
      that could origin from an underlying CRC, but without being alarm symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      To implement iFOBT in general practice and evaluate the uptake and clinical use of the test.&#xD;
      Furthermore, we want to investigate the performance of iFOBT when used on patients presenting&#xD;
      with uncharacteristic symptoms of CRC, and the clinical implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will develop a guideline for the use of iFOBT in general practice. The guideline is aimed&#xD;
      at men and women aged 30 years and above who present symptoms that could origin from a CRC,&#xD;
      but are not classified as alarm symptoms. The guideline will contain a list of symptoms for&#xD;
      which it is recommended to perform iFOBT and suggested actions for positive and negative test&#xD;
      result. A value of &lt;49µg/L will be considered 'negative' and &gt;50µg/L as 'positive'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study uses a cluster randomised stepped wedge design, and is executed in the Central&#xD;
      Denmark Region. Municipalities of the region are randomised when to receive a CME, and are&#xD;
      included sequentially in the study during the first seven month of the study period. The CME&#xD;
      are arranged on scheduled GP-meetings in each municipality and will consist of a 45 minutes&#xD;
      lecture on CRC diagnosis and use of iFOBT. Besides a CME, the intervention consist of a start&#xD;
      package (10 iFOBT kits, a guideline and online educational material) that is sent to GPs when&#xD;
      they are included in the study, and a status mail that GPs receive approx. one month after&#xD;
      inclusion. The study period is one year. Data analysis will focus on the uptake and clinical&#xD;
      use of iFOBT in general practice, the performance of iFOBT when used on patients presenting&#xD;
      with uncharacteristic symptoms of CRC and the clinical implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate iFOBT and explore its role in general practice. To our knowledge,&#xD;
      this study will be one of the first and most thorough investigations of this test in a&#xD;
      primary care setting. The results will bring important knowledge of how to improve the&#xD;
      diagnostics of colorectal cancer in the future and hopefully reduce time to diagnosis.&#xD;
      Especially for patients who do not meet the traditional Danish criteria for fast-track&#xD;
      referral, this study will be a corner stone in the identification of more efficient ways to&#xD;
      locate patients at risk of developing CRC. At both national and international level, this&#xD;
      project will contribute with important knowledge that may provide better planning of CRC&#xD;
      diagnostics in the future.&#xD;
