      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the change from baseline in the erectile&#xD;
      function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) scores in patients&#xD;
      receiving 4 weekly treatments of shockwave therapy versus those receiving a sham treatment.&#xD;
      The change will be evaluated at 3 months after the end of a sequence of 4 weekly treatments.&#xD;

      The secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. To evaluate erectile function (EF) categorical improvement in patients receiving 4 weekly&#xD;
      treatments of shockwave therapy versus those receiving a sham treatment, at 3 months after a&#xD;
      first sequence of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. To compare improvements in erectile function between 4 weeks of phosphodiesterase type 5&#xD;
      inhibitor (PDE5i) use and 4 weekly treatments of shockwave therapy (&quot;within patient&quot; effect).&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. To compare improvements in erectile function between 4 weeks of PDE5 inhibitor use and 4&#xD;
      weekly treatments of sham shock wave therapy (&quot;within patient&quot; effect).&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. To evaluate the effect of a 2nd sequence of 4-8 weekly shock wave treatments 3 months&#xD;
      after this second sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. To evaluate treatment effects (the same comparisons as in objectives A, B, C, D) on other&#xD;
      validated measure of EF (question 2 of the sexual encounter profile (SEP2), question 3 of the&#xD;
      sexual encounter profile (SEP3), Global Assessment Question (GAQ), Erection Hardness Scale&#xD;
      (EHS)), and the remaining domains of the IIEF score (orgasmic function, sexual desire,&#xD;
      intercourse satisfaction, overall satisfaction), as well as the total IIEF score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. To evaluate treatment tolerance and potential adverse events. G. To compare changes in EF&#xD;
      measures over time for a follow-up period of 12 months following the second sequence of 4&#xD;
      weekly shock wave treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H. To compare the effect of a sequence of 4 weekly shock wave treatments versus 8 biweekly&#xD;
      shock wave treatments 3 months after the treatment (&quot;within patient&quot; effect).&#xD;

             6.1 of the SPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In clinical studies, tadalafil was shown to augment the hypotensive effects of&#xD;
             nitrates. This is thought to result from the combined effects of nitrates and&#xD;
             tadalafil on the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway. Therefore, administration of CIALIS to&#xD;
             patients who are using any form of organic nitrate is contraindicated. (see section&#xD;
             4.5 of the SPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CIALIS, must not be used in men with cardiac disease for whom sexual activity is&#xD;
             inadvisable. Physicians should consider the potential cardiac risk of sexual activity&#xD;
             in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The following groups of patients with cardiovascular disease were not included in&#xD;
             clinical trials and the use of tadalafil is therefore contraindicated:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with myocardial infarction within the last 90 days,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with unstable angina or angina occurring during sexual intercourse,&#xD;

             6 months,&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  patients with a stroke within the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CIALIS is contraindicated in patients who have loss of vision in one eye because of&#xD;
             non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION), regardless of whether this&#xD;
             episode was in connection or not with previous PDE5 inhibitor exposure (see section&#xD;
             4.4 of the SPC).&#xD;
