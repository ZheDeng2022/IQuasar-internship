  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rates of brain atrophy for long term users of fingolimod when compared to glatiramer acetate&#xD;
      have not been examined in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). As&#xD;
      patients on long term therapy typically have little or no overt signs of white matter&#xD;
      inflammatory activity (T2, gad lesions), brain atrophy measures can provide insight into&#xD;
      whether there is continued progression of MS in these patients. What remains unknown is&#xD;
      whether patients on a particular therapy have a slower rate of brain atrophy. This would&#xD;
      provide convincing evidence that central nervous system tissue injury is further suppressed.&#xD;
      Such information would be of substantial clinical benefit when deciding between various&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will estimate the impact of long term use of fingolimod therapy (defined as&#xD;
      a minimum of two years on therapy) on whole brain atrophy in treated patients with relapsing&#xD;
      forms of MS as compared to age and gender matched patients on Glatiramer Acetate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators secondary goal is to determine the correlation between brain atrophy and&#xD;
      cognitive performance in treated patients with relapsing forms of MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also examine the correlation between the NeuroQualityofLife (NeuroQOL)&#xD;
      PROs, patient self-reports of disability, clinical assessment of physical disability, work&#xD;
      productivity, clinical assessments of cognitive functioning with whole brain volume loss for&#xD;
      patients on long term fingolimod vs. long term glatiramer acetate therapy matched on age and&#xD;
      gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate the findings of this study will generate relevant hypotheses&#xD;
      about these relationships.&#xD;
