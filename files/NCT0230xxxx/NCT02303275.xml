      Summary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic heart failure continues to be one of the highest economic burdens in the United&#xD;
      States, heavily influenced by frequent readmissions to the hospital. This study will examine&#xD;
      whether patients 65 years and older, who have NYHA class II and III heart failure, will&#xD;
      improve their symptoms after participating in a comprehensive 12-week lifestyle change&#xD;
      program. The investigators will recruit potential subjects primarily from the Scripps Clinic&#xD;
      heart failure clinic at the Torrey Pines campus. Qualifying subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      medical treatment as usual or the lifestyle program. The investigators will enroll 17&#xD;
      subjects into each group which will provide 80% power and an alpha of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lifestyle change program consists of classes conducted three times a week for 12 weeks at&#xD;
      the Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine. Each day participants will spend about four to&#xD;
      five hours in a variety of classes such as monitored exercise, group support, mindful-yoga&#xD;
      and meditation, vegetarian cooking classes, music-centered wellness, mind-body lectures, and&#xD;
      resiliency training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes will focus on determining functional status and physical agility using&#xD;
      the 6-minute walk test, handgrip strength, and NYHA class categories. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators will capture subjective physical status with a self-reported questionnaire.&#xD;
      Cognitive assessment will be performed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment tool. To&#xD;
      capture the subject's overall self-reported improvement the investigators will use a quality&#xD;
      of life and a depression questionnaire. Secondary endpoints include hospital admission rates&#xD;
      and all-cause mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators Research Question and Hypothesis is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive, evidence-based lifestyle and psychosocial interventions over a 12-week period&#xD;
      (Lifestyles Change Program) can improve various objectives (6-minute walk distance, Left&#xD;
      Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF), New York Heart Association Class, grip strength, and&#xD;
      cognitive function) as well as subjective (Quality of life, depression and functional&#xD;
      screening) measures in patients with chronic heart failure. Secondary endpoints would include&#xD;
      data such as hospital admission rates and all-cause mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background/ Gaps in Knowledge Chronic heart failure continues to be one of the highest&#xD;
      economic burdens in the United States, heavily influenced by frequent readmissions. As a&#xD;
      measure of performance quality, the Center of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) began&#xD;
      publically reporting hospital risk-standardized 30-day all-cause readmission rates, among&#xD;
      fee-for-service beneficiaries discharged after hospitalization for heart failure from all the&#xD;
      US acute care hospitals (1). Previous reported averages for hospital readmission in patients&#xD;
      with chronic heart failure averages 25% to 30%, with some studies showing a readmission rate&#xD;
      of up to 45% at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been significant research examining various methods to reduce hospital admissions&#xD;
      and improve functional capacity for patients with heart failure. Aside from published data on&#xD;
      patient factors associated with readmission (age, sex, race, education, diabetes, renal&#xD;
      disease, history of stroke, cognitive impairment, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class&#xD;
      level, and serum markers [blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, C-reactive protein], etc), there&#xD;
      have been many prospective studies evaluating readmission rates in CHF using interventions&#xD;
      including: specialized multi-disciplinary teams (CHF nursing staff, pharmacists, physicians,&#xD;
      etc), telephonic home monitoring, implantable device monitoring, various exercise programs&#xD;
      (intermittent vs. continuous), meditation and spirituality, and early hospital follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attempts at creating valid statistical models to predict patients at the highest risk for&#xD;
      readmission used heterogeneous approaches and found substantial inconsistencies regarding&#xD;
      which patient characteristics were predictive. From a policy perspective, as of 2009, a&#xD;
      validated risk-standardized model to accurately profile hospitals using readmission rates is&#xD;
      unavailable in the published English-language literature to date (3). Essentially, the&#xD;
      identification of patients at high risk for heart failure readmission remains difficult with&#xD;
      no validated objective assessment. Therefore, the strategy to reduce readmissions of heart&#xD;
      failure patients is evolving to become a more personalized, patient-centered approach based&#xD;
      on specific needs of each patient. For example, studies evaluating patient vs physician and&#xD;
      healthcare staff perceptions for the causes of heart failure readmissions (using standardized&#xD;
      questionnaires), shows discrepancy in the physician's opinion vs the patient's opinion about&#xD;
      what factors influenced the readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In essence, various aspects of the LCP have been evaluated in controlled clinical trials, but&#xD;
      an overall, comprehensive study evaluating multiple components as included in the LCP has (to&#xD;
      the investigators knowledge) not been done. Previous randomized controlled trials have shown&#xD;
      benefit (6-minute walk, NYHA class, etc) using cardiac rehabilitation in patients with CHF&#xD;
      (12). Yoga has been shown to improve exercise tolerance and positively affected levels of&#xD;
      inflammatory markers in patients with CHF, with trends towards improvements in QoL (11).&#xD;
      Education by a dietitian in patients with CHF has also been shown to result in a significant&#xD;
      decrease in sodium intake compared with patients who simply receive written instructions (9).&#xD;
      Studies have also evaluated spiritual well-being and depression in patients with heart&#xD;
      failure, and have shown that greater spiritual well-being, particularly meaning/ peace was&#xD;
      strongly associated with less depression (6). Interestingly, Tai Chi has been used in&#xD;
      complimentary medicine for many years in patients with cardiovascular disease. Recently, a&#xD;
      randomized study in 2011 showed that Tai Chi exercise improves quality of life, mood, and&#xD;
      exercise self-efficacy in patients with CHF (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators goal with the currently described study is to use a comprehensive,&#xD;
      evidence-based Lifestyle Change Program (LCP) that incorporates all of the above individual&#xD;
      components in a single program, individualized to each patient's physical abilities.&#xD;
      Moreover, the investigators hypothesis is that such an intervention with chronic heart&#xD;
      failure patients will improve Quality of Life, objective cardiometabolic markers, and reduce&#xD;
      hospital admissions..&#xD;
