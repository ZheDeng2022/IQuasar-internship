  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter study designed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics and activity of Selicrelumab administered in combination with Atezolizumab&#xD;
      (ATZ) in participants with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in two Parts (I and II), with Part I divided into Parts IA and IB. All participants&#xD;
      will be followed up for survival until death or loss of follow-up after the last visit or&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
