  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators examine changes in decision making, vigilance and cortical excitability in&#xD;
      healthy male subjects undergoing total acute sleep deprivation (40 hours) on the one hand,&#xD;
      and chronic partial sleep restriction (7 nights with 5 instead of 8 hours in bed per night)&#xD;
      on the other hand, in a cross over controlled manner. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      total sleep deprivation, as well as partial sleep restriction lead to impairments in decision&#xD;
      making and vigilance, and enhanced cortical excitability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beside these three primary outcomes, the investigators also assess changes in sleep by EEG,&#xD;
      dim light melatonin onset, skin temperature, subjective mood and sleepiness, working memory,&#xD;
      and also collect saliva samples.&#xD;
