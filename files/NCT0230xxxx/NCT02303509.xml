    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of UCB5857. Part 1 of the study explores single doses&#xD;
      of the drug. Part 2 of the study explores giving the drug every day for 14 days. The study&#xD;
      uses healthy and psoriasis subjects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, single&#xD;
      center study designed to evaluate the safety/ tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of UCB5857 following oral administration of single ascending doses&#xD;
      (SAD) in healthy subjects (Part 1) and multiple ascending doses (MAD) in healthy and&#xD;
      mild-to-moderate psoriatic subjects (Part 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of UCB5857&#xD;
      when given as single oral doses in healthy subjects and as ascending multiple oral doses in&#xD;
      healthy subjects and mild-to-moderate psoriatic subjects.&#xD;

                  follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt;40 mIU/ mL at Screening, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Having undergone complete hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, and/ or&#xD;
                  bilateral oophorectomy, or&#xD;

             sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential, a method of highly&#xD;
             effective contraception will be used (eg, condom + spermicide, and an additional&#xD;
             contraceptive method used by the partner). Male contraception is not required if the&#xD;
             male subject has undergone effective vasectomy &gt;3 months prior to the study; however,&#xD;
             his female partner must use a contraceptive method during the study period and for a&#xD;
             period of 3 months or 5 half-lives after the last administration of the IMP (whichever&#xD;
             is longer)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is of normal weight as determined by a body mass index (BMI) of between 18.0&#xD;
             and 30.0 kg/ m2 (inclusive), with a body weight of at least 50 kg (for healthy&#xD;
             subjects only)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is in good physical and mental health, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             determined on the basis of medical history and general clinical examination at&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject has clinical laboratory test results within the reference ranges of the&#xD;

             ranges and that are deemed as clinically nonsignificant will be allowed at the&#xD;
             discretion of the Investigator, following discussion with the Sponsor's Study&#xD;
             Physician, excluding ALT, AST, alkaline phosphate and bilirubin, which have to be&#xD;
             within normal range. If a subject has 1 isolated test result outside the specific&#xD;
             range that is deemed clinically significant, rescreening may be allowed at the&#xD;

             nonsignificant will be allowed at the discretion of the Investigator, following&#xD;
             discussion with the Sponsor's Study Physician. If a subject has 1 isolated finding&#xD;
             outside the specific range which is deemed clinically significant, rescreening may be&#xD;
             allowed at the discretion of the Investigator, following discussion with the Sponsor's&#xD;
             Study Physician&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a body temperature (oral or tympanic) between 35.0 and 37.5°C (95 and&#xD;
             99.5°F) inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject's ECG is considered &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;abnormal&quot; but clinically nonsignificant (as&#xD;
             interpreted by the Investigator). If the subject has 1 isolated finding outside the&#xD;
             specific range that is deemed potentially clinically significant, rescreening may be&#xD;
             allowed at the discretion of the Investigator, following discussion with the Sponsor's&#xD;
             Study Physician&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition for the psoriatic subjects cohort&#xD;
