  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a paucity of studies that focus on the symptom burden of cancer patients in&#xD;
      Singapore, particularly the clinical effects of cancer-related fatigue (CRF). Knowing that&#xD;
      early-stage breast cancer is curable, it is of paramount importance to evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      and biological determinants of lingering symptoms in breast cancer survivors so that&#xD;
      appropriate psychosocial interventions can be formulated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that variations in clinical and biological determinants&#xD;
      contribute to different severities of CRF among Asian breast cancer patients. Through this&#xD;
      study, the investigators aim to evaluate the prevalence and severity of CRF among Asian&#xD;
      breast cancer patients, and to identify the biological and clinical determinants of CRF among&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multicenter, prospective, longitudinal, observational study conducted at the&#xD;
      National Cancer Centre Singapore and KK Women's and Children's Hospital. Informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained from participants before the investigators proceed with data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants will be assessed at relevant time points. Biological determinants and&#xD;
      symptoms associated with CRF will be assessed. The associations between changes in CRF,&#xD;
      plasma cytokines levels, serum cortisol levels, and other clinical determinants will be&#xD;
      elucidated.&#xD;

    <description>MFSI-SF will be used. This is a multidimensional questionnaire for measuring fatigue in cancer patients that has been validated in a group of breast cancer patients undergoing anticancer treatment. It consists of 30 items and has five subscales, each with six items: general fatigue, physical fatigue, emotional fatigue, mental fatigue, and vigor. The MFSI-SF measures different dimensions of fatigue, which can be combined to obtain an overall score. It has favorable psychometric properties with internal consistency reliability within the range of 0.87 to 0.96 and established convergent and divergent validity. As such, it is an appropriate tool for measuring fatigue.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of cognitive impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>One year post chemotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>FACT-Cog will be used. The FACT-Cog was created to investigate the perceived impact of chemotherapy on cognitive functioning and associated impairments in quality of life. It is known in studies to assess broader aspects of cognitive complaints, thereby providing greater information about the types of cognitive complaints patients are experiencing. The qualitative data were examined using a thematic content analysis and the following domains were identified: Cognitive Problems (Cognitive), Impact on Functioning (IOF), and Impact on Quality of Life (QOL). Fifty items were written to assess these domains.</description>
