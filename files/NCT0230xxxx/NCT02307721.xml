  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overdose with potential deadly outcome is a serious problem among opioid abusers, not least&#xD;
      in Norway. The annual death toll from overdose is about 250, higher than road traffic&#xD;
      accidents. Those who inject heroin or other opioids are considered to have the highest risk&#xD;
      for death from overdose. To save lives, immediate treatment with a μ-opioid antidote such as&#xD;
      naloxone is required. Usually naloxone is injected into a muscle or a blood vessel.&#xD;
      Administration of naloxone via the nose (intranasal) has been suggested as an alternative for&#xD;
      use by emergency teams and possibly also bystanders. This is not only an easier way to give&#xD;
      naloxone, but would also eliminate the risk for needle stick injuries and blood&#xD;
      contamination. In a series of studies on intranasal naloxone at The Norwegian University of&#xD;
      Science and Technology, this study explores pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of&#xD;
      intranasal and intramuscular naloxone in healthy volunteers under the influence of&#xD;
      remifentanil.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy volunteers will be brought into a state of opioid influence in a well-known, short&#xD;
      acting, controlled and safe manner using remifentanil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Naloxone is a well-known, well-tolerated drug with an excellent safety profile over many&#xD;
      decades of use. The current formulation has proven safe and without local or systemic side&#xD;
      effects in the studies conducted so far. The excipients in the present nasal formulation are&#xD;
      all well known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two aims. Firstly to investigate what naloxone does to the body under opioid&#xD;
      influence, applying a well-tested model with infusion of the potent opioid remifentanil&#xD;
      (Target Control Infusion). This will create a state of strong opioid effect for a short time&#xD;
      and in a highly controlled fashion, inducing a state of miosis, reduced respiratory rate and&#xD;
      reduced sensation to pain, all three strong indicators of opiates. Naloxone will antagonise&#xD;
      these effects, and this change can be measured. Choosing intramuscular 0.8 mg naloxone for&#xD;
      comparison means that the novel intranasal naloxone formulation will be compared with the&#xD;
      well-established and described treatment protocol for opioid overdose in Norway used today.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly the pharmacokinetic profile of intranasal and intramuscular naloxone will be&#xD;
      studied. The same measurements as in preparative studies (OPI 12-001 and OPI 13-001) will be&#xD;
      taken: Serum naloxone concentration over time to calculate maximum concentration, Time to&#xD;
      maximum concentration, Area Under the Curve and Relative bioavailability. There are two main&#xD;
      reasons to repeat these measurements. In contrast to the previous studies under the current&#xD;
      protocol the participants will be under the influence by strong opioids. This may have&#xD;
      significant physiologic effects, and it will be explored whether the pharmacokinetics of the&#xD;
      intranasal formulation are changed. The other reason is that in this study pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of naloxone will be compared with the actual dosage and administration routes of naloxone as&#xD;
      used by doctors and paramedics in the pre-hospital setting. This has not been done before, in&#xD;
      spite of the widespread use of this treatment, The measurements of remifentanil in serum open&#xD;
      the possibility to relate pharmacodynamic data directly to an actual serum concentration of&#xD;
      the opioid at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care will be taken not to include opioid users in this study as naloxone would precipitate&#xD;
      acute withdrawal. Also possible drug misusers will be excluded as well as people who have&#xD;
      access to remifentanil and infusion equipment in their daily work, although the abuse&#xD;
      potential of this highly specialised drug is minimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety of the formulation will also be studied by measuring vital signs and for the patient&#xD;
      to report any nasal discomfort or potential adverse reactions during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By weighing spray device, and intramuscular syringes before and after discharge the&#xD;
      reliability of the dose delivered will be confirmed.&#xD;

    <measure>Pharmacodynamic profile of naloxone- Heat Pain Threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>120 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure time to maximum reversal, and duration of reversal of opioid effect on heat pain threshold measured. Heat pain thresholds will be tested using a Somedic MSA Thermotest (Somedic AB, Hørby, Sweden). This apparatus can measure the relationship between the intensity of controlled thermal stimuli and the associated perception. The stimulus (1 degree Celsius per sec rise time) is applied to the intact skin by a hand-held thermode while monitoring the temperature. The thermode (area 25x 50 mm= 12,5 cm2) will be placed over the non-dominant thenar eminence. Once the sensation changes from warm to painful the subject stops the increase in temperature by pressing a button, and the thermode cools down. The heat pain threshold (HPT) is measured in degrees C, and we will calculate the average of three repeated single HPTs.</description>

    <measure>Pharmacodynamic profile of naloxone. Pupillometry</measure>
    <time_frame>120 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Using a Neuroptics VIP 200 Pupillometer (Neuroptics, Irvine, CA, USA) we will measure the size of the pupils as a pharmacodynamic measure. The treatment visits will be conducted in a quiet room, with moderate, stable ambient lighting. Using a luxometer we will ensure similar light conditions in each visit of each participant. We will ask the participant to focus on a distant point in the room. The pupillometer will be placed over the measured eye and its position adjusted until the eye was correctly aligned within the LCD screen of the pupillometer. The reading will be recorded in CRF and/ or local work sheet A measurement of the pupils should take less than 10 seconds, and the result is given in millimetre, with an accuracy of 0.1mm and the results recorded. It is a non-invasive and pain free measurement.</description>
