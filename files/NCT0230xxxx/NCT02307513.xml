  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apremilast in the&#xD;
      treatment of oral ulcers in adults with active Behçet's disease (BD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Behçet's disease, is a rare disorder that causes inflammation in blood vessels throughout the&#xD;
      body. The signs and symptoms of Behçet's disease may include mouth sores, eye inflammation,&#xD;
      skin rashes and lesions, and genital sores that vary from person to person and may come and&#xD;
      go on their own. The exact cause of Behçet's is unknown, but it may be an autoimmune&#xD;
      disorder, which means the body's immune system mistakenly attacks some of its own healthy&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate if apremilast is better than placebo (inactive substance in the same&#xD;
      form as the drug) for the treatment of oral ulcers in subjects with active Behçet's disease.&#xD;
      Other manifestations of the disease will also be assessed, such as, pain and tenderness in&#xD;
      joints, eye inflammation, genital ulcers, and skin disease. This study also will test how&#xD;
      well the body tolerates apremilast. In addition, the second purpose of the study is to assess&#xD;
      the safety of apremilast in patients with Behçet's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design. The placebo-controlled&#xD;
      period will be 12 weeks long and participants will receive apremilast or placebo. After the&#xD;
      12-week placebo-controlled period, all participants will receive apremilast for 52 weeks in&#xD;
      the active treatment period. All participants will have their final study visit 4 weeks after&#xD;
      stopping apremilast treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Germany will have the opportunity to enter an optional open-label extension&#xD;
      phase after the 52-week active treatment phase (week 64 visit), and continue until apremilast&#xD;
      is commercially available for Behçet's disease or until apremilast is found not to be&#xD;
      acceptable for Behçet's disease, according to either the sponsor or health authority.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Oral Ulcer Pain as Measured by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Pain of oral ulcers was measured using a 100 mm VAS scale. The participant was asked to draw a single line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represented the severity of their pain during the previous week, with 0 mm (the left-hand end of the scale) representing no pain and 100 mm (the right-hand end of the scale) representing the worst pain imaginable. The distance of the perpendicular line from the left-hand end of the scale was recorded.&#xD;
A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity as Measured by Behçet's Disease Current Activity Form (BDCAF): Behçet's Disease Current Activity Index (BDCAI) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Behçet's Disease Current Activity Form (BDCAF) consists of 3 component scores: the Behçet's Disease Current Activity Index (BDCAI) score, the Patient's Perception of Disease Activity, and the Clinician's Overall Perception of Disease Activity. The BDCAI consists of 12 questions regarding disease manifestations over the previous 4 weeks, including oral and genital disease activity, as well as other manifestations of BD involving the skin, joints, GI tract, eyes, nervous system, and vascular system. The BDCAI score is the sum score of 12 items and ranges from 0 to 12. A higher score indicates higher level of disease activity (worsening), and a negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Time to Oral Ulcer Resolution (Complete Response)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Time to oral ulcer resolution (defined as oral ulcer-free) was the time between the first dose date and the date when a complete response was achieved for the first time during the placebo-controlled treatment phase. For participants who did not achieve complete response or discontinued treatment before a complete response was achieved during the placebo-controlled treatment phase, time to event was censored at the last oral ulcer assessment date during the placebo-controlled treatment phase or the first dose date if there were no postbaseline ulcer assessments. Median and 95% confidence interval was based on Kaplan-Meier estimates.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Behçet's Disease Quality of Life (BD Qol) Scores at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Behçet's Disease Quality of Life questionnaire was developed to measure the influence of BD on a particpant's life. It consists of 30 self-completed itemized questions that measure disease-related restrictions on the participant's activities and their emotional response to these restrictions. The total score is the sum of all 30 items (each yes scores 1 and each no scores 0), with 0 representing no influence of Behçet's disease on a participant's quality of life and 30 representing the most severe influence. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Total Score of the Static Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of Skin Lesions of BD at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>BD-related skin lesions (including acne-like lesions, folliculitis, and erythema nodosum) were evaluated according to the Static Physician's Global Assessment as follows:&#xD;
Score 0 = clear skin. Score 1 = mild in severity with the presence of 1 to 10 lesions (papules, pustules, cysts) or nodules at any anatomical site.&#xD;
Score 2 = Moderate severity; presence of 11 to 20 nodules or lesions (papules, pustules, cysts) at any anatomical site.&#xD;
Score 3 = Severe; presence of &gt; 20 nodules or lesions (papules, pustules, cysts) at any anatomical site.&#xD;
The total sore was calculated as the sum of the acne-like lesions, folliculitis, and erythema nodosum scores, and therefore ranges from 0 to 9, where a higher score indicates a higher level of activity. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Genital Ulcer Pain as Measured by VAS Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Pain of genital ulcers was measured using a 100 mm visual analog scale. The participant was asked to draw a single line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represented the severity of their pain during the previous week, with 0 mm (the left-hand end of the scale) representing no pain and 100 mm (the right-hand end of the scale) representing the worst pain imaginable. The distance of the perpendicular line from the left-hand end of the scale was recorded. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) During the Placebo-controlled Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug in the placebo-controlled phase to the first dose of apremilast in the active treatment phase (12 weeks) or up to 28 days after last dose for participants who did not receive study drug at week 12, whichever was earlier.</time_frame>
    <description>A TEAE is an adverse event (AE) with a start date on or after the date of the first dose of study drug and no later than 28 days after the last dose. An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. A serious AE (SAE) is any AE that resulted in death; was life-threatening; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; was a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or constituted an important medical event. For both AEs and SAEs the investigator assessed the severity of the event according to the grading scale:&#xD;
Mild: asymptomatic or with mild symptoms; Moderate: symptoms causing moderate discomfort and local or noninvasive intervention is indicated; Severe: symptoms causing severe discomfort or pain, symptoms requiring medical/surgical intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With TEAEs During the Apremilast-Exposure Period</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of apremilast (week 0 for those assigned to apremilast or week 12 for those assigned to placebo) up to 28 days after last dose; up to 56 weeks and 68 weeks in each arm respectively.</time_frame>
    <description>The apremilast-exposure period started on the date of the first dose of apremilast (week 0 for participants assigned to apremilast or week 12 for participants who were originally assigned to placebo and switched to apremilast at week 12) and ended 28 days after last dose in the active treatment phase.&#xD;
An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. An SAE is any AE that resulted in death; was life-threatening; required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; was a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or constituted an important medical event. The investigator assessed the severity of each event according to the grading scale:&#xD;
Mild: asymptomatic or mild symptoms; Moderate: symptoms causing moderate discomfort, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; Severe: symptoms causing severe discomfort or pain, requiring medical/surgical intervention.</description>

        <description>The Behçet's Disease Current Activity Form (BDCAF) consists of 3 component scores: the Behçet's Disease Current Activity Index (BDCAI) score, the Patient's Perception of Disease Activity, and the Clinician's Overall Perception of Disease Activity. The BDCAI consists of 12 questions regarding disease manifestations over the previous 4 weeks, including oral and genital disease activity, as well as other manifestations of BD involving the skin, joints, GI tract, eyes, nervous system, and vascular system. The BDCAI score is the sum score of 12 items and ranges from 0 to 12. A higher score indicates higher level of disease activity (worsening), and a negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The Behçet's Disease Quality of Life questionnaire was developed to measure the influence of BD on a particpant's life. It consists of 30 self-completed itemized questions that measure disease-related restrictions on the participant's activities and their emotional response to these restrictions. The total score is the sum of all 30 items (each yes scores 1 and each no scores 0), with 0 representing no influence of Behçet's disease on a participant's quality of life and 30 representing the most severe influence. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>BD-related skin lesions (including acne-like lesions, folliculitis, and erythema nodosum) were evaluated according to the Static Physician's Global Assessment as follows:&#xD;
Score 0 = clear skin. Score 1 = mild in severity with the presence of 1 to 10 lesions (papules, pustules, cysts) or nodules at any anatomical site.&#xD;
Score 2 = Moderate severity; presence of 11 to 20 nodules or lesions (papules, pustules, cysts) at any anatomical site.&#xD;
Score 3 = Severe; presence of &gt; 20 nodules or lesions (papules, pustules, cysts) at any anatomical site.&#xD;
The total sore was calculated as the sum of the acne-like lesions, folliculitis, and erythema nodosum scores, and therefore ranges from 0 to 9, where a higher score indicates a higher level of activity. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>A TEAE is an adverse event (AE) with a start date on or after the date of the first dose of study drug and no later than 28 days after the last dose. An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. A serious AE (SAE) is any AE that resulted in death; was life-threatening; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; was a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or constituted an important medical event. For both AEs and SAEs the investigator assessed the severity of the event according to the grading scale:&#xD;
Mild: asymptomatic or with mild symptoms; Moderate: symptoms causing moderate discomfort and local or noninvasive intervention is indicated; Severe: symptoms causing severe discomfort or pain, symptoms requiring medical/surgical intervention.</description>

An SAE is any AE that resulted in death; was life-threatening; required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; was a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or constituted an important medical event. The investigator assessed the severity of each event according to the grading scale:&#xD;
Mild: asymptomatic or mild symptoms; Moderate: symptoms causing moderate discomfort, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; Severe: symptoms causing severe discomfort or pain, requiring medical/surgical intervention.</description>
