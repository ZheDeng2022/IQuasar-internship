      This study aims to compare the quality of perioperative analgesia of lidocaine, magnesium&#xD;
      sulphate and remifentanil in patients undergoing mastectomy&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The opioid analgesics are commonly used in clinical practice for pain management in the&#xD;
      perioperative period. However, many side effects are associated with its use, such as&#xD;
      respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, itching, urinary retention,&#xD;
      constipation, hyperalgesia and impaired immune function. Therefore, alternative techniques&#xD;
      and drugs have been used to replace their use. One is the intravenous infusion of lidocaine,&#xD;
      a local anesthetic widely used in anesthetic practice. Another is intravenous infusion of&#xD;
      magnesium sulphate, a bivalent salt used as a central nervous system depressor, reducing&#xD;
      intracranial hypertension, in the treatment of epilepsy; eclampsia; in chronic alcoholism; in&#xD;
      hyaline membranes, such as hyperosmotic diuretic; in malnutrition; hypomagnesaemia; in&#xD;
      thrombotic microangiopathy; in sickle cell anemia, uterine tetany and atypical ventricular&#xD;
      tachycardia. Studies show that the use alone or combined of lidocaine and magnesium sulphate&#xD;
      during surgery significantly decreased postoperative pain. The mechanisms of analgesia this&#xD;
      local anesthetic in surgical trauma may be blocking neuronal transmission in the lesion site&#xD;
      alleviating neurogenic response, and anti-inflammatory systemic intrinsic activity.&#xD;
      Intraoperative lidocaine promotes, besides analgesia, decreased consumption of both&#xD;
      inhalational anesthetic and opioids; faster return of bowel movements; decreasing the&#xD;
      production of interleukins and reduction of airway reactivity. This anesthetic also has&#xD;
      significant anti-inflammatory properties, reduces cytokine release both in vitro and in vivo&#xD;
      by inhibiting neutrophil activation. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are critically&#xD;
      involved in the induction and maintenance of neuronal hyperexcitability after traumatic&#xD;
      events, therefore, the use of NMDA antagonists before the incision reduces the excitability&#xD;
      of the central nervous system and its result is the reduction of clinical hyperalgesia.&#xD;
      Magnesium sulphate is an antagonist of glutamate NMDA receptor, which gives analgesic,&#xD;
      anticonvulsant and sedative. It acts as a natural physiological calcium antagonist regulating&#xD;
      access to the intracellular space. Shows the effect of muscle relaxation by inhibiting the&#xD;
      release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, thereby hypermagnesaemia decreases&#xD;
      sensitivity to acetylcholine of the endplate and the potential amplitude endplate. Besides&#xD;
      there are few studies with use of these adjuvants during the perioperative period, the&#xD;
      intravenous injection of local anesthetic still arouses oddity among professionals;&#xD;
      therefore, the investigators interest in the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients underwent a prospective, randomized, double blind study, in which the examiners&#xD;
      responsible for intra and post-operative will not know which group they were randomly&#xD;
      allocated: Lidocaine group (n = 30); Lidocaine and Magnesium group (n = 30); Magnesium group&#xD;
      (n = 30) or Remifentanil group (n = 30). Rapid infusion of 0.9% saline 500 ml, in the M and&#xD;
      LM group, is added to this solution the loading dose of magnesium sulfate with 50 mg/kg and&#xD;
      in group L will only be infused saline 0.9% . Two infusion pumps containing the result of&#xD;
      randomization: Lidocaine 3 mg/kg/h and 0.9% saline (L group); magnesium sulphate 15 mg/kg/h&#xD;
      and 0.9% saline (M group); lidocaine 3 mg/kg/h and magnesium sulphate 15 mg/kg/hr (LM group);&#xD;
      and Remifentanil group (R group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the clinical record, the following information will be emphasized: Blood pressure and&#xD;
      heart rate intraoperative, perioperative side effects, quantify pain by Visual Analogue Scale&#xD;
      (VAS) (ranging from 0 to 10 cm, zero being found when the patient is no pain and ten, with&#xD;
      maximum or unbearable pain), Verbal Rating Scale (VRS), consisting of a list of phrases (no&#xD;
      pain, mild pain, moderate pain, intense pain, maximum pain) and qualification of pain&#xD;
      assessed by the amount of analgesics required postoperatively and the time to request them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results were analyzed statistically with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences&#xD;
      (SPSS) version 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, EUA) using parametric and nonparametric tests,&#xD;
      depending on the nature of the variables studied. Data were tested for normality using the&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk test. Measures of central tendency (means) and dispersion (standard deviation)&#xD;
      were used. The level of significance was set at &lt; 0.05. The following tests were used:&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test for age, duration of anesthesia and surgery, time to first analgesic&#xD;
      supplementation, total amount of analgesics, pain intensity; Student t-test for weight and&#xD;
      height.&#xD;
