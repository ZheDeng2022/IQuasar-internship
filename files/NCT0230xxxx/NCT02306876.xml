      This study is designed to investigate the safety, tolerability pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic effects of PF-06412562 following multiple dose administration as MR tablets&#xD;
      in healthy adult males. The study will be comprised of 2 analytical stages. Both analytical&#xD;
      stages will be conducted as randomized, subject and investigator blind, sponsor open,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, parallel design. Study enrollment will be continuous through Stage I and&#xD;
      Stage II. Stage I consists of approximately 45 completer subjects (approximately 15 per arm).&#xD;
      Stage I is an exploratory hypothesis generation stage. No multiple comparison adjustment will&#xD;
      be conducted for the Stage I analysis. The sample size in Stage I is based on operational&#xD;
      feasibility. All endpoints including the composite scores will be tested at the end of Stage&#xD;
      I. Each PF-06412562 dose (3 mg BID and 15 mg BID) will be compared to the placebo arm for&#xD;
      each endpoint. Up to 5 comparisons that meet Stage I decision criteria will be treated as&#xD;
      primary comparisons in Stage II (see Data Analysis section). Stage II is a hypothesis testing&#xD;
      stage in which multiple comparisons will be adjusted and overall type I error rate will be&#xD;
      controlled across all primary comparisons. Stage II will be formally powered to study those&#xD;
      endpoints/doses most likely to demonstrate the strongest pharmacodynamic signal. Stage II&#xD;
      will not exceed 56 completers (~21 in each PF-06412562 arm and ~14 in placebo arm). Study&#xD;
      enrollment will be continuous through Stage I and Stage II. The three treatments in both&#xD;
      stages include (i) PF-06412562 3 mg BID (ii) PF-06412562 15 mg BID, and (iii) placebo.&#xD;
      Separate placebo groups, contemporaneous with the treatment groups, will be recruited for&#xD;
      Stage I and Stage II. A total of approximately 101 subjects will be randomly assigned to one&#xD;
      of the 3 treatments. If a subject drops out before completing the study, or withdraws for&#xD;
      reasons unrelated to the safety of the test treatment, the subject will be replaced at the&#xD;
      discretion of the Sponsor in consultation with the investigator. Subjects with fMRI or ERP&#xD;
      data that does not pass imaging or ERP data QC will also be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to a specific treatment arm according to the randomization&#xD;
      schedule provided to the site by Pfizer. Two doses of PF-06412562 (3 mg and 15 mg),&#xD;
      administered as MR tablets, will be given twice daily (BID) from Day 1 through Day 6. A&#xD;
      loading dose of PF-06412562 will be administered as an IR tablet on Day 1 only to facilitate&#xD;
      rapid attainment of concentration into the target range. For subjects assigned to the 3 mg&#xD;
      BID group, one 3 mg MR tablet and one&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 mg PF-06412562 IR tablet will be administered. For subjects assigned to the 15 mg BID&#xD;
      group, one 15 mg MR tablet and one 5 mg IR dose of PF-06412562 will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 7 only the morning dose will be administered. Subject participation will be&#xD;
      approximately 12 days (and 11 nights), excluding screening and follow-up. Screening&#xD;
      activities will be completed up to 28 days prior to admission to the study on Day -3. The&#xD;
      follow-up visit is conducted approximately 7 to 10 days after the last dose of study drug&#xD;
      administration. Medically healthy, right-handed male subjects, aged 18-45 will be screened&#xD;
      for working memory capacity, psychiatric disorders and other cognitive/educational&#xD;
      constrains. Subjects who meet all entry criteria will be randomized into one of the three&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
