  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia with a prevalence of 1.5-2%. This prevalence&#xD;
      increases significantly after 80 years of age. After the appearance of first episode(s) some&#xD;
      of the patients will present frequent arrhythmia recurrences moving from the paroxysmal&#xD;
      status to the persistent and the permanent status of the continuous spectrum of the natural&#xD;
      time course of AF. In contrast some other will not present further relapses. To study and&#xD;
      predict the dynamic evolution of AF is clinically important, furthermore, the detection of&#xD;
      different sub populations risk for AF relapses will determine and different therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches.&#xD;

      Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia with a prevalence of 1.5-2%. This prevalence&#xD;
      increases significantly after 80 years of age. In the presence of the Arrhythmia the risk of&#xD;
      stroke increases five fold while the congestive heart failure and the mortality rates are&#xD;
      increasing significantly also.After the appearance of first episode(s) some of the patients&#xD;
      will present frequent arrhythmia recurrences moving from the paroxysmal status to the&#xD;
      persistent and the permanent status of the continuous spectrum of the natural time course of&#xD;
      AF. In contrast some other will not present further relapses. To study and predict the&#xD;
      dynamic evolution of AF is clinically important, furthermore, the detection of different sub&#xD;
      populations risk for AF relapses will determine and different therapeutic approaches. The&#xD;
      study will include &gt; 500 patients 30-80 years old. Inclusion criteria is one up to five&#xD;
      paroxysmal AF (PAF) episodes during the last three years. Patients during screening must&#xD;
      maintaining Sinus Rhythm. Exclusion criteria are substrate of severe valvular diseases,&#xD;
      congenital heart disease, previous heart surgery, hyperthyroidism, severe diseases of the&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system, alcoholism, diseases affecting seriously the survival and absence&#xD;
      of adequate cooperation for the study. Screening will include 12 lead surface digital ECG, 30&#xD;
      min High Resolution (1000 Hz) ECG recording from 3 pseudo orthogonal x,y,z leads system, and&#xD;
      complete ECHO study (2D, PWD, TDI, Strain).Among other indices will be analyzed: P duration,&#xD;
      P index, P dispersion, P wave signal for Late potentials, for Wavelets, PQ/RR Dynamics, Heart&#xD;
      Rate Dynamics and various markers for the autonomic nervous system status.Primary end point&#xD;
      is one or more PAF relapse(s) during a period of 12 months after recruitment in&#xD;
      study.Secondary end point is permanent AF during a period of 36 months after recruitment in&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
