    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the U.S. Efforts to improve CVD&#xD;
      risk factors often fall short in complex patients with multiple co-morbid conditions, a&#xD;
      growing, expensive, and high-risk segment of the U.S. population. The investigators are&#xD;
      testing a multi-component behavioral intervention designed to help complex patients with CVD&#xD;
      and other concurrent chronic conditions to become more effective agents of their own care.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the U.S. Despite the&#xD;
      availability of evidence-based guidelines and efficacious therapies, however, many patients&#xD;
      do not achieve the full benefit of CVD risk reduction. In particular, complex patients&#xD;
      (defined as those patients who do not respond to current disease management approaches) with&#xD;
      multiple concurrent chronic conditions represent a key segment of the population that would&#xD;
      benefit from new approaches to care. In response to PA-12-024: Behavioral Interventions to&#xD;
      Address Multiple Chronic Conditions in Primary Care, which seeks &quot;practical interventions…to&#xD;
      modify behaviors using a common approach&quot; among patients with multiple co-morbidities, the&#xD;
      investigators are testing an integrated behavioral intervention designed to improve a core&#xD;
      set of chronic disease self-management skills and to overcome common barriers to care&#xD;
      engagement encountered by this increasingly important segment of the U.S. adult primary care&#xD;
      population. This randomized trial will be conducted within Kaiser Permanente Northern&#xD;
      California (KPNC), an integrated care delivery system serving over 3.2 million members,&#xD;
      including patients insured through Medicare and state Medicaid programs. The investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate the intervention in 3 KPNC primary care practices by enrolling 576 complex&#xD;
      patients who have persistently (≥ 2 years) uncontrolled CVD risk factors (e.g. hypertension,&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia, diabetes) despite being enrolled in a CVD disease management program. This&#xD;
      behavioral intervention is designed to activate and engage patients, identify potentially&#xD;
      hidden barriers to care such as alcohol misuse or sub-clinical depression, and to develop&#xD;
      individualized care plans that are designed to catalyze more effective primary care&#xD;
      management. Randomization will be at the patient-level. The investigators will examine the&#xD;
      impact of the intervention on clinical outcomes (control of systolic blood pressure, HbA1c&#xD;
      (if with diabetes), statin treatment rates) after 12 months and patient-reported outcomes&#xD;
      (patient activation, medication adherence, and mental health status) after 6 months. By&#xD;
      focusing on core health skills and care barriers, this patient-focused intervention seeks to&#xD;
      enable complex patients to become more effective agents of their own care and to thereby&#xD;
      achieve similar clinical benefits as less complex patients.&#xD;
