      Phase I/II, Open-labeled, Prospective, Multi-center study of a Pretargeted Radioimmunotherapy&#xD;
      in metastatic colorectal cancer with ractionated injections of TF2 plus 90Y-IMP288&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study investigates a pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (pRAIT) with the&#xD;
      anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) TF2 bispecific monoclonal antibody (BsMAb) and the&#xD;
      90Y-IMP288 radio-labeled peptide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TF2 will be given once a week for 3 successive weeks at 75 mg/m2 per dose. IMP288 will be&#xD;
      given 3 times, 1 day after each TF2 injection. IMP288 will be radio-labeled with 111In&#xD;
      (imaging) for the first injection and then 90Y (therapy) for the 2 subsequent injections.&#xD;
