    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well lenalidomide improves immune response to&#xD;
      pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small&#xD;
      lymphocytic lymphoma, or monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis. Biological therapies, such as&#xD;
      lenalidomide, use substances made from living organisms that may stimulate or suppress the&#xD;
      immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Lenalidomide may also&#xD;
      improve the effectiveness of pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine that is used to prevent&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the ability of a 6 week course of low dose lenalidomide to improve the&#xD;
      proportion of patients with monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL) and chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
      leukemia (CLL) who develop an immune response to pneumococcal vaccination as measured by the&#xD;
      proportion of patients with &gt;= 4-fold rise from pre-vaccine (day 15) for &gt;= 2 of the 3&#xD;
      serotypes measured at 28 days post-vaccination by opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) of&#xD;
      antibodies from sera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate disease status by physical exam and complete blood counts in patients&#xD;
      participating in each arm of the study at the time of the 6 week assessment of immune&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate time to treatment for progressive CLL for patients on each study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate the adverse events profile in each study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the immune response to pneumococcal vaccination as measured by fold-change from&#xD;
      pre-vaccine (day 15) to 28 days post-vaccination in OPA geometric mean titers (GMT) of&#xD;
      antibodies from sera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the immune response to pneumococcal vaccination as measured by fold-change from&#xD;
      pre-vaccine (day 15) to 28 days post-vaccination in quantitative Streptococcus pneumoniae&#xD;
      immunoglobulin G (IgG) GMT of antibodies from sera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate the effect of 6 weeks of low dose lenalidomide on global immune function&#xD;
      including T-cell repertoire, T-cell immune synapse, serum immunoglobulin levels, and absolute&#xD;
      numbers of T-cell and natural killer (NK) cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-42 and&#xD;
      pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine intramuscularly (IM) on day 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine IM on day 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 28, and then every 6&#xD;
      months for up to 2 years.&#xD;

The proportion of successes will be estimated in each arm by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated in each arm based on the normal approximation.</description>

    <description>The distribution of disease status will be evaluated in each arm and will be summarized descriptively. Patients will be classified as responders (complete clinical response, incomplete marrow recovery, partial response) vs. non-responders (stable disease, progressive disease [PD]).

Patients will be classified as responders (complete clinical response, incomplete marrow recovery, partial response) vs. non-responders (stable disease, progressive disease [PD]). For MBL, patients will be classified as not PD vs PD. Differences in disease status response will be compared between the two arms using Fisher's exact test.</description>

          <title>Disease Status by Physical Exam and Complete Blood Counts</title>
          <description>The distribution of disease status will be evaluated in each arm and will be summarized descriptively. Patients will be classified as responders (complete clinical response, incomplete marrow recovery, partial response) vs. non-responders (stable disease, progressive disease [PD]). For MBL, patients will be classified as not PD vs PD. Differences in disease status response will be compared between the two arms using Fisher's exact test.</description>
