  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is an inflammatory disease involving the skin, the joints and the vascular&#xD;
      compartment. The mechanisms linking inflammation in the skin and joints and in the vascular&#xD;
      walls are poorly understood. One hypothesis for the increase in vascular inflammation&#xD;
      observed in patients with psoriasis involves circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Patients&#xD;
      with psoriasis have an increase in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha),&#xD;
      Interleukin-17 (IL-17), IL-22, IL-6 as well as a the chemokine S100A913. It is possible that&#xD;
      one of those cytokines/chemokine induces vascular inflammation in the vascular compartment.&#xD;
      The purpose of this cross sectional retrospective study is to highlight the correlation&#xD;
      between vascular wall inflammation using 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose - Positron Emission&#xD;
      Tomography (FDG-PET) fluorodeoxyglucose technology and pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokine.&#xD;

      Baseline frozen serum samples will be identified from the 107 enrolled Inno-6025 (Abbvie&#xD;
      A13-935) (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01722214) patients who also underwent a&#xD;
      pre-adalimumab FDG-PET scan for the study. Serum cytokine and chemokine levels in these&#xD;
      samples will be measured; IL-17 and IL-22 using the Singulex immunoassay platform, and&#xD;
      S100A9, IL-6 and TNF alpha using multiplex ELISA. Vascular inflammation will be measured as&#xD;
      the target to background ratio (TBR) in the ascending aorta using PET-scan technology.&#xD;
      Correlation analyses will be performed between serum levels of cytokines and a chemokine and&#xD;
      vascular inflammation.&#xD;
