  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following spinal cord injury autonomic regulation of the cardiovascular system is impaired,&#xD;
      which results in a variety of measurable abnormalities in blood pressure. Evidence of&#xD;
      causality has been documented in the general medical literature with findings of improved&#xD;
      cognitive function following acute increases in blood pressure using the anti-hypotensive&#xD;
      agent Midodrine Hydrochloride (midodrine). Additionally, a recent report documented an&#xD;
      inverse association between blood pressure and depression suggesting that low blood pressure&#xD;
      may confer greater risk than high blood pressure. Midodrine is a drug approved by the Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration to treat low blood pressure in the general population. Midodrine is&#xD;
      not approved in the United States to treat low blood pressure in persons with spinal cord&#xD;
      injury. Therefore, its use in this study is investigational. The first objective is to&#xD;
      characterize the relationship between blood pressure, cerebral blood flow velocity and&#xD;
      cognitive function after a single dose of midodrine compared to placebo. Second objective is&#xD;
      to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of midodrine administration.&#xD;

      Acute Study:The purpose of this research study is to measure a spinal cord injured&#xD;
      individual's blood pressure and blood flow to the brain at rest and during thinking tasks&#xD;
      before and after a single dose of midodrine, a drug used to treat low blood pressure (10 mg).&#xD;
      Eligible participants will complete 2 visits to the laboratory. Visit 1, the subject will be&#xD;
      given midodrine and Visit 2, the subject will be given a placebo. The order of the drug is&#xD;
      random.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational Study:The purpose of this research study is to determine how blood pressure&#xD;
      changes throughout the day in a spinal cord injured individual. There is no drug in this&#xD;
      study. This study will last about 1 month and the subject will visit the laboratory 2 times,&#xD;
      at the beginning and at the end of the month. The subject will be given a blood pressure&#xD;
      monitor and will be asked to record his/her blood pressure at least 3 times a day. The&#xD;
      laboratory visits will involve the participant discussing his/her monthly blood pressure&#xD;
      recordings and experience with blood pressure monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30-Day Crossover Study: The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of midodrine administration over a 30-day period of time. Midodrine is a drug&#xD;
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat low blood pressure in the general&#xD;
      population. Midodrine is not approved in the United States to treat low blood pressure in&#xD;
      persons with spinal cord injury. Therefore, its use in this study is investigational. The&#xD;
      subject's participation will involve about 10 weeks and the subject will be asked to visit&#xD;
      the laboratory 8 times. The subject will be asked to take midodrine for the first 30 days and&#xD;
      after the 14 day washout period, the subject will be asked to take a placebo for 30 days. The&#xD;
      order of the drug will be random. The subject and the study investigators will not know which&#xD;
      drug the subject is receiving first and second during the 30 day-treatment phase. For visit&#xD;
      1,4, 5 and 8(Initial visits-start of new drug administration and Post Visits- end of new drug&#xD;
      administration), the subject will complete many different thinking tasks while his/her blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate and cerebral blood flow is taken. The subject will also complete quality&#xD;
      of life surveys, autonomic dysreflexia surveys, and will take home a blood pressure monitor&#xD;
      to continue to monitor blood pressure. For visit 2, 3, 6, and 7, the subject's blood&#xD;
      pressure, cerebral blood flow and heart rate will be measured. Subject will also complete the&#xD;
      autonomic dysreflexia survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30-Day Crossover &amp; MRI/Functional MRI (fMRI) Study: Eligible participants will in addition to&#xD;
      completing the 30-Day Crossover study (procedure explained above), will also complete a&#xD;
      MRI/fMRI Visit 1, 4, and 8.&#xD;
