    <textblock>
      This investigation plans to initiate the healing of chronic wounds by providing a&#xD;
      concentrated platelet and growth factor therapy directly to the wound site by topical&#xD;
      delivery. This therapy will be derived from autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP), an&#xD;
      emerging surgical and wound care treatment. This investigation aims to demonstrate that&#xD;
      patients with chronic, non-healing wounds treated with autologous PRP and standard medical&#xD;
      care have a reduction in wound volume and improved healing rate that results in&#xD;
      patient-centered clinically significant health outcomes as compared to patients treated with&#xD;
      standard medical care only.&#xD;

      This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial, with a single-blind parallel design. 1,500&#xD;
      subjects are planned to enroll in the study. Each subject will be assigned to the treatments&#xD;
      in random order. The stratified permuted block randomization method will be applied to the&#xD;
      patient assignment. In addition to three study populations, i.e., DFU, VU and PU, and study&#xD;
      centers, stratification will be based on one overall variable, (1) nutritional status (Low:&#xD;
      Prealbumin &lt;12mg/d vs. moderate: Prealbumin &gt;= 12 mg/d) and one variable for each wound type.&#xD;
      Diabetic food ulcer will be based on offloading (2a) (Specialty shoes vs. Total contact&#xD;
      cast), pressure ulcer will be based on offloading (2b) (mattress vs. cushion), and venous leg&#xD;
      ulcer will be based on compression (2c)(Low: &lt;10 mmHG vs. High: &gt;=30mmHG). Randomization will&#xD;
      proceed within strata according to a permuted block scheme with a block size, or balancing&#xD;
      interval, varying randomly between 2, 4 or 6. The primary endpoint will be evaluated by a&#xD;
      blinded physician to avoid the bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total duration of each patient in the study is expected to be 20 weeks.&#xD;
