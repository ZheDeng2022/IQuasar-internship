      Background: Repeated episodes of bleeding from gastrointestinal vascular malformations&#xD;
      refractory to endoscopic or surgical therapy often pose a major therapeutic challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The investigators will perform a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study&#xD;
      of thalidomide as a retreatment therapy for recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding due to&#xD;
      vascular malformation. Patients with failure of first course treatment of thalidomide will be&#xD;
      randomly grouped, prescribed a second four-month course regimen of 25 mg of thalidomide or&#xD;
      placebo orally four times daily. All patients will be monitored for at least one year. The&#xD;
      primary end point is defined as the patients whose rebleeds decrease from baseline by ≥ 50%&#xD;
      at 12 months and the cessation of bleeding. Rebleeding is defined based on a positive fecal&#xD;
      occult blood test (FOBT) (monoclonal colloidal gold color technology) at any visit after&#xD;
      treatment. Secondary outcomes include the participants dependent on blood transfusions and&#xD;
      changes from baseline in transfused packed red cell units, bleeding episodes, and hemoglobin&#xD;
      levels at 12 months. Statistical significance is defined at P &lt; 0.05.&#xD;

      Protocol Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an exploratory, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study of thalidomide for&#xD;
      retreatment patients with failure of first course thalidomide treatment for recurrent&#xD;
      gastrointestinal bleeding from vascular malformations. Informed consent will be taken from&#xD;
      all subjects and the Institute Ethics Committee approved the study protocol. All procedures&#xD;
      are in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study is not supported by&#xD;
      pharmaceutical funding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From Dec. 2014 to Nov. 2015, patients with failure of first course thalidomide treatment and&#xD;
      repeated at least four episodes of chronic gastrointestinal bleeding a year due to vascular&#xD;
      malformations identified by oesophagogastroduodenoscopy, capsule endoscope or double-balloon&#xD;
      endoscope will be enrolled (according our enrollment criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomly assigned to receive a second four-month course of 25 mg of&#xD;
      thalidomide or placebo at daily time 6 a.m.,12 noon,6 p.m. and 10 p.m., respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization is performed through the proc plan procedure of Statistical Analysis System&#xD;
      (SAS), using the method of randomly permuted blocks of 4. Within each block, the number of&#xD;
      patients allocated to each of the two treatments is equal. Each patient who met the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be consecutively assigned a random number in chronological order, which&#xD;
      allocate him or her to one of the treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of an adverse event, the study medication will be temporarily or permanently&#xD;
      discontinued based on subject inclination and toxicity intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant therapies, such as blood transfusions and other symptomatic treatments like iron&#xD;
      supplementation, will be performed in both groups as necessary during the four-month&#xD;
      treatment and subsequent follow-up periods. Blood transfusion is indicated and recorded when&#xD;
      the hemoglobin (Hb) level reaches &lt; 7.0 g/dl. Red-cell transfusions are administered&#xD;
      according to patient Hb level as follows: 2 units will be administered for 6.1 g/dl ≥ Hb ≤&#xD;
      7.0 g/dl, 3 units for 5.1 g/dl ≥ Hb ≤ 6.0 g/dl, and 4 units for Hb &lt; 5.0 g/dl. Iron is&#xD;
      provided for patients with 7.0 g/dl ≥ Hb ≤ 11.0 g/dl. After the four-month treatment course,&#xD;
      all patients discontinued study medications except for cases where symptomatic treatments are&#xD;
      necessary as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of response and adverse events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point is defined as the patients whose rebleeds decrease from baseline by ≥&#xD;
      50% at 12 months and the cessation of bleeding. Rebleeding is defined based on a positive&#xD;
      fecal occult blood test (FOBT) (monoclonal colloidal gold color technology) at any visit&#xD;
      after treatment. Secondary outcomes include the participants dependent on blood transfusions&#xD;
      and changes from baseline in transfused packed red cell units, bleeding episodes, and&#xD;
      hemoglobin levels at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events include any unfavorable change in health, including abnormal laboratory&#xD;
      findings, during the study or follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of Patients and Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Certified research nurses collected information on the demographics and medical and&#xD;
           social histories of all patients enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After screening and baseline evaluations, the patients will be closely monitored in the&#xD;
           hospital for at least one week. They are then followed twice monthly during the&#xD;
           four-mouth course of treatment and once a month thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical follow-up is performed by qualified doctors. At all visits, the&#xD;
           bleeding-related parameters (number and duration) will be collected, a physical&#xD;
           examination will be performed and laboratory values obtained for FOBT, complete blood&#xD;
           counts, serum chemistries, and hepatic and renal function. Neuropathy and other adverse&#xD;
           events were also assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are advised to refrain from any other non-prescribed medicines, especially&#xD;
           rebleeding-related medications such as aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
           drug(NSAIDs), anti-platelet drugs, anticoagulants, and Chinese medications (with&#xD;
           salicylates), gingko, or Echinacea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, no similar such study concern on efficiency of thalidomide retreatment has&#xD;
      previously been performed, and the investigators are thus unable to refer to published&#xD;
      studies to determine our samples. According to our published study, response in the&#xD;
      iron-control group and thalidomide group reached 3.7% and 71.4%. And in our preliminary study&#xD;
      (unpublished), response of thalidomide retreatment reached 66.7%. For this study, the&#xD;
      investigators estimate that the primary outcome (the proportion of subjects whose number of&#xD;
      yearly bleeds has decreased by ≥ 50%) will occur in 3.7% of the placebo group and 66.7% of&#xD;
      the thalidomide retreatment group patients. An equally divided sample of 9 subjects is deemed&#xD;
      sufficient for detecting the primary end point, with a type I error (two-sided) of 5% and a&#xD;
      power of 90%. Assuming a 10% volunteer attrition rate to follow-up, the investigators&#xD;
      establish a target sample size of 10 per group (calculated with PASS 11). To ensure an&#xD;
      adequate power of later stratified analysis, the sample size is approximately increased to be&#xD;
      15 in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses of the responses and adverse events are performed on all registered patients&#xD;
      according to the intention-to-treat principle. Statistical analysis is performed by a blinded&#xD;
      biostatistician with the SPSS 13.0 software package. The investigators simultaneously analyze&#xD;
      the primary endpoint of the full analysis set (FAS) and per protocol set (PPS). Continuous&#xD;
      variables are compared using a two-sample independent t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test.&#xD;
      Categorical variables are compared using the chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests. The&#xD;
      Breslow-Day test is used to test for the heterogeneity of treatment effects across strata.&#xD;
      All reported P-values are two-sided. Data are reported as the mean ±Standard Deviation(SD) or&#xD;
      median (range) for continuous variables and number (%) for categorical variables. Since&#xD;
      adjustments to the control group are minimal, the investigators also report point estimates&#xD;
      and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For all outcomes, a P-value of &lt; 0.05 is considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
