      Purpose: The aim of this prospective cohort is to evaluate patients before, 6 and 12 months&#xD;
      after arthroscopic surgery for FAI and compare the results to people without hip problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods/design: Sixty patients with FAI and 30 persons without hip problems will be included.&#xD;
      Pre- and postoperatively, patients will be evaluated by CT-scans. All participants will have&#xD;
      their hip flexor and extensor muscle strength assessed and have performed kinetic and&#xD;
      kinematic analyses of daily activities with 3D motion capture. Further, self-reported&#xD;
      questionnaires on hip related pain, quality of life and sports activities will be collected.&#xD;
      Finally, participants will have their daily physical activity monitored with tri-axial&#xD;
      accelerometers for five consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives: With this prospective cohort study the outcome of arthroscopic treatment of FAI&#xD;
      within one year after surgery will be evaluated. If the patients fail to reach reference&#xD;
      values one year after surgery, altered surgical procedures or rehabilitation programs to&#xD;
      optimize treatment for the patients may be explored in future studies. Further, the&#xD;
      investigators expect to perform long-term follow up to evaluate reoperations, conversions to&#xD;
      total hip arthroplasty and development of osteoarthritis for the patients surgically treated&#xD;
      for FAI.&#xD;

      Introduction Femoral acetabular impingement (FAI) is caused by an abnormality in the&#xD;
      acetabular shape or orientation (Pincer-type) by a shape abnormality in the proximal femur&#xD;
      (Cam-type) or by a mix of the two conditions. FAI causes repeated minor damage to the labrum&#xD;
      and edge of the acetabulum. The damage to the joint is proposed to lead to early&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip, but whether FAI is a cause or result of OA is discussed.&#xD;
      Surgery can reduce symptoms caused by Cam or Pincer impingement and may prevent future damage&#xD;
      to the hip joint. However, different surgical techniques are used, and only few long-term&#xD;
      studies of the surgery exist. The latest reviews conclude that 1) the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      surgery is not clear, 2) it is not clear how surgery affects functional performance for the&#xD;
      patients and 3) it is unknown how surgery for FAI affects the patients in a long-term&#xD;
      perspective.&#xD;

      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients scheduled for hip arthroscopic treatment at Horsens Regional Hospital will receive&#xD;
      written and verbal information about the study and after informed consent included&#xD;
      consecutively. After agreeing to participate, the patients will have a pre-operative CT-scan&#xD;
      of the included hip. At Aarhus University, patients will have a clinical examination session&#xD;
      including measurement of height, weight and fat percentage. They will have their hip extensor&#xD;
      and flexor muscle strength assessed in an isokinetic dynamometer and perform walking, stair&#xD;
      climbing, stepping, sit to stand and a drop jump with 3D-motion capture. Patients will&#xD;
      complete the HAGOS-questionnaire together with the other pre specified self-reported measures&#xD;
      described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After all tests are completed, the patients will be instructed in wearing a 3-axial&#xD;
      accelerometer for five days, attached to the thigh of the non-affected leg to monitor daily&#xD;
      physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a three, six and nine month follow-up patients will complete HAGOS, pain scores and&#xD;
      self-reported measures of return to sport, work, re-operations and injections after surgery&#xD;
      and EQ5D-Visual analog scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a one year follow up, preoperative measures will be repeated. Further, at six month and&#xD;
      one year follow up the patients will report fulfillment of expectations, patient global&#xD;
      treatment outcome and patient willingness to repeat surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All controls will meet at Aarhus University for a single assessment of the same measures as&#xD;
      the patients except from CT-scans and outcome measures related to the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and controls will be compared with multiple regression analysis adjusted for age,&#xD;
      gender and body weight if the assumptions for the model is met. If not, they will be compared&#xD;
      using un-paired non-parametric statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The longitudinal measures of the patients pre, three, six, nine month and one year after&#xD;
      surgery will be evaluated in a paired set-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based upon the preoperative CT-scan, the patients will be split into subgroups: FAI will be&#xD;
      classified as Cam (alpha angle &gt; 55˚), Pincer (center edge angle &gt; 25˚ from CT and AP&#xD;
      radiograph and/or crossing sign and ishial spine sign) and Mixed when there is a combination&#xD;
      of Cam and Pincer. We will investigate how these subgroups affects outcome measures. Further,&#xD;
      we will investigate how demographics, preoperative and postoperative muscle strength and pain&#xD;
      affects the results of the surgery and rehabilitation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point for the study is one year after surgery. For the muscle strength&#xD;
      assessment, sample size is based upon pre- and post-operative values from Casartelli et al.&#xD;
      (2) with a level of significance of 0.05 and a power of 90 %, the patient group should&#xD;
      consist at least 53 persons. Taking possible drop-outs in account our goal is to include 60&#xD;
      patients. We will include 30 controls persons for comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Danish Biomedical Research Ethics Committee, Central Denmark Region (1-10-72-239-14) and&#xD;
      the Danish Data Protection Agency have approved the project (1-16-02-499-14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economy and dissemination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Financial support will be applied for at internally at our institution and externally at&#xD;
      various foundations. Both positive, negative and inconclusive results will be published in&#xD;
      international journals and presented at conferences.&#xD;

    <description>The question, &quot;what changes in the following items do you expect to experience as a result of the operation? (not your hopes and wishes, but realistic expectations!)&quot; will be asked in relation to each of six items: hip pain, walking capacity, independence in everyday activities, ability to do sport, engaging in social contacts, mental well-being. The response options will be: much better, better, somewhat better, unchanged, worse, &quot;I don't know&quot;.
