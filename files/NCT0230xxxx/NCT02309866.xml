  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is the most common form of hereditary retinal degeneration, with a&#xD;
      worldwide prevalence of 1:3500. It is one of the most genetically heterogenous conditions in&#xD;
      humans, with over 100 causative genes and loci reported to date. However, in approximately&#xD;
      40% of patients the underlying genetic causes are yet to be found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study aims to identify causative RP genes and mutations in Israeli families of&#xD;
      various ethnic backgrounds. Identification of such genes will contribute significantly to&#xD;
      disease prevention (by identification of high risk families and appropriate genetic&#xD;
      counseling) and to the investigators understanding of retinal structure and function and of&#xD;
      the etiology of RP.&#xD;

      Background: Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease,&#xD;
      which causes visual loss due to the premature death of retinal photoreceptors. Over 100 genes&#xD;
      and loci have been implicated in RP. However, the contribution of each of these genes to the&#xD;
      overall prevalence of RP is relatively small, and many of them are yet to be found. These&#xD;
      unidentified genes are likely to be very rare. The vast majority of studies on the genetics&#xD;
      of RP have been performed on the American and European populations. Based on the&#xD;
      investigators experience, the genetic makeup of the Israeli population is unique, and many of&#xD;
      the genetic alterations identified in Israeli patients are novel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working hypothesis and aims: the investigators working hypothesis is that the Israeli&#xD;
      population is unique in terms of the identity and relative contribution of RP genes.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators aim is to perform a comprehensive genetic analysis of affected&#xD;
      Israeli individuals of various ethnic backgrounds, in order to identify novel RP mutations&#xD;
      and genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: RP patients and family members will be continuously recruited to the study through&#xD;
      the Ophthalmology Department at Hillel Yaffe Medical Center, Hadera, Israel. The relatively&#xD;
      high proportion of founder mutations in the Israeli population allows us to perform a quick&#xD;
      and efficient mutation screening and identify the cause of disease in a large number of newly&#xD;
      recruited families. Patients who are negative for all relevant mutations will be studied&#xD;
      using whole exome sequencing. Bioinformatic analysis will be used to identify possible&#xD;
      pathogenic variants. Following verification, the investigators will check their&#xD;
      co-segregation with the disease in the entire family, and their frequency in the relevant&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: The immediate expected outcomes include an epidemiological overview of RP&#xD;
      distribution and etiology in the Israeli population, and identification of novel causative&#xD;
      genes and mechanisms. These genes are expected to play a crucial role in retinal development&#xD;
      and function, and hence their identification and characterization will contribute&#xD;
      significantly to the investigators understanding of retinal structure and function and of the&#xD;
      etiology of RP. The main expected long-term outcome is reduction in the frequency of RP in&#xD;
      Israel. This will be achieved by a combination of prevention (by genetic screening and&#xD;
      counseling among high-risk populations), and treatment (by identification of patient groups&#xD;
      with shared genetic diagnoses, who can be recruited to clinical trials for evaluation of&#xD;
      various treatment strategies).&#xD;
