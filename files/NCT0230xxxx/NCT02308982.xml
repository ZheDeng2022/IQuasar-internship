    <textblock>
      This is a phase III multi-centre randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial to assess&#xD;
      the role of intravenous immunoglobulin in the treatment of children with encephalitis. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to find out whether early use of IVIG treatment improves neurological&#xD;
      outcomes of children with encephalitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      308 children with encephalitis, aged 6 weeks to 16 years will be recruited in 30 hospitals in&#xD;
      the United Kingdom. Participants will be randomised to receive two doses of IVIG or matching&#xD;
      placebo in addition to other standard treatments, within the first five days of hospital&#xD;
      admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be followed up for 12 months. During this period, information on&#xD;
      clinical, radiological and laboratory investigations will be collected. Neurological outcomes&#xD;
      will be assessed by the use of questionnaires at 6 and 12 months, and a neuropsychological&#xD;
      assessment at 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Encephalitis is a syndrome of neurological dysfunction caused by inflammation of the brain&#xD;
      parenchyma, resulting in altered mental status, seizures, and/or focal neurologic deficits,&#xD;
      usually accompanied by laboratory and radiological evidence of brain inflammation. The&#xD;
      worldwide annual incidence of encephalitis ranges from 3.5 to 7.4 per 100,000, rising to 16&#xD;
      per 100,000 in children. In the United Kingdom, Public Health England (formerly the Health&#xD;
      Protection Agency) reports an annual rate of 1.5 cases per 100,000 in the general population&#xD;
      and 2.8 per 100,000 in children, with the highest incidence in infants under 1 year of age of&#xD;
      8.7 per 100,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the use of current standard treatments, mortality of 7-10% and morbidity of up to 50%&#xD;
      are still being reported. Encephalitis also imposes a substantial economic and resource&#xD;
      burden on healthcare services. Strategies to reduce the disability in patients with&#xD;
      encephalitis are therefore required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is increasing evidence from case reports of a beneficial role of IVIG treatment in&#xD;
      encephalitis. However, in clinical practice, the use of IVIG in encephalitis varies. The&#xD;
      variation in practice is in most part due to a lack of class 1 evidence to support the use of&#xD;
      IVIG in encephalitis. For the immune mediated forms of encephalitis, IVIG is typically used&#xD;
      after inevitable delay (by weeks in some cases) while alternative diagnoses are being&#xD;
      excluded, or a definitive diagnosis is obtained. In other cases, IVIG is used usually as a&#xD;
      last treatment option where clinical improvement is slow. Again, this is usually after&#xD;
      several days from hospital admission. Delays in the institution of appropriate treatment in&#xD;
      encephalitis may contribute to the high rate of morbidity and mortality, prolonged&#xD;
      hospitalisation and associated costs from encephalitis. In particular, it is currently&#xD;
      unknown whether wider use of IVIG in infectious encephalitis and earlier use in&#xD;
      immune-mediated encephalitis could alter the outcome of this group of conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will fill in the evidence gap on the potential benefit of IVIG in reducing disease&#xD;
      burden in children with encephalitis. The trial also aims to generate evidence to inform&#xD;
      clinical decision making in the National Health Service (NHS) and provide added value to the&#xD;
      NHS by addressing healthcare, quality of life and productivity costs of this expensive and&#xD;
      resource limited product.&#xD;
