    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of new cases of blindness in people aged 20 to&#xD;
      65 years worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with DR may go on to develop a more severe form of the disease called Proliferative&#xD;
      Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR), a condition in which abnormal new blood vessels may rupture and&#xD;
      bleed inside the eye. When this advanced stage of retinopathy occurs, pan-retinal&#xD;
      photocoagulation (laser treatment) is usually recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the investigators study is to find if treating patients using a single session&#xD;
      of lower intensity laser (Pascal® Pan Retinal Photo-Stimulation, P-RPhS) at an earlier stage&#xD;
      in Diabetic Retinopathy (during the severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy stage) when&#xD;
      the abnormal new vessels are not developed, will prevent diabetic patients to develop PDR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the study will be randomized in three arms (randomization). In one arm&#xD;
      patients will be treated with the normal parameters used in Pascal® laser, the second arm&#xD;
      patients will be treated with a lower intensity than normal, using the Endpoint management&#xD;
      system (a new software from the Pascal® laser which allow us to decrees the intensity of the&#xD;
      burns (invisible burns) showing some landmarks with normal intensity so the area which has&#xD;
      been treated can be viewed. And in the third arm the patients will be observed.&#xD;

      The published evidence from clinical trials in the literature has demonstrated that&#xD;
      conventional PRP using 2000-2500 burns may be used safely and effectively in PDR patients&#xD;
      over 2 or 3 sessions. A recent audit of 313 Pascal laser treatments performed at Manchester&#xD;
      Royal Eye Hospital (2007-2008) has demonstrated that 1952 burns may be used safely and&#xD;
      effectively in routine ophthalmic practice for PDR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study (PETER PAN study) which has been presented at the Association for Research in&#xD;
      Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) 2011 Annual Meeting and also submitted for publication (Am J&#xD;
      Ophthalmol) has shown that performing primary 20ms Pascal targeted retinal photocoagulation&#xD;
      (TRP) and reduced fluence/minimally-traumatic panretinal photocoagulation (MT-PRP) in a&#xD;
      single session using 2,500 burns can be safe and effective in treating PDR, without negative&#xD;
      effect on visual fields. Therefore, it seems reasonable to think that a single session of&#xD;
      3000 burns 20ms with Endpoint Management set at 70% fluence will be safe and effective to&#xD;
      treat patients with severe NPDR as similar or less total energy would be delivered to the&#xD;
      retina-RPE complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topcon's Endpoint Management (EM) software is based on a computational model of retinal&#xD;
      heating and an Arrhenius damage model to determine optimal pulse duration and laser power for&#xD;
      various levels of pulse energy. The algorithm varies the power and duration concurrently to&#xD;
      maximize the margins between visible and sub-visible photocoagulation endpoints, providing a&#xD;
      linear control over an inherently nonlinear process of coagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When utilising EM, the user first titrates to a comfortable visible endpoint. Establishing a&#xD;
      titration endpoint is important as it gives a consistent baseline, ensuring repeatable&#xD;
      results between patients. With the Endpoint Management option activated, the laser output in&#xD;
      a pattern is a percentage of this titration energy. Power and duration are both modulated to&#xD;
      make this energy adjustment, allowing for a fine gradation of laser dosage and control over&#xD;
      treatment endpoints. The visible titration endpoint can be references throughout the course&#xD;
      of treatment by enabling the Landmark feature, which crates reference lesions at the&#xD;
      titration dose at the corners of the pattern. This provides visible feedback on dosage and&#xD;
      positioning of treated areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, the EM approach to laser therapy allows the physician to consistently operate in&#xD;
      the realm of therapeutic relevance for sub-visible treatments. When no burns are visible, the&#xD;
      biggest risk becomes lack of therapeutic effect. The Arrhenius integral-based algorithms in&#xD;
      Endpoint Management adjust power and duration to provide the best &quot;path&quot; between endpoints,&#xD;
      moving smoothly from the ophthalmoscopically-visible titration point to&#xD;
      angiographically-only, OCT-only, and sub-visible/ therapeutic regimes. The Landmark feature&#xD;
      allows the user to determine the local effect of the titration dose, and make adjustments as&#xD;
      uptake varies across the treated area. The result is more predictable sub-visible laser&#xD;
      delivery with the widest window of safe, effective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pascal® system with EM utilizes 577nm laser wavelength compared to the 532nm laser&#xD;
      wavelength which was utilized in previous Pascal® laser studies. However, previous studies&#xD;
      have not been able to demonstrate that clinical effectiveness was dependent on the laser&#xD;
      wavelength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to reduce the risk of complications after PRP whilst maintaining clinical efficacy,&#xD;
      the optimal regime may be to utilize a technique of a lower intensity burn with reduced power&#xD;
      while applying a larger number of treatment burns to cover the retinal area. It may also be&#xD;
      important to &quot;target&quot; the laser treatment to the retinal area of &quot;penumbra&quot; or critically&#xD;
      hypoxic retina based on angiographic tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Ischaemic penumbra&quot; is the critically hypoxic tissue characterised by Hypoxia-inducible&#xD;
      factor-1 (HIF-1) upregulation and secretion of angiogenic proteins such as Vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In ischemic diabetic retinopathy, there are 3&#xD;
      theoretical/postulated locations of such critically hypoxic inner retina:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Along the interface between the inner retinal area still oxygenated via retinal&#xD;
           capillaries and the (more peripheral) area of capillary non-perfusion,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Alongside the medium-sized retinal arteries and hyperoxaemic retinal veins forming&#xD;
           arterio-venous anastomoses while traversing non-perfused inner retina (&quot;Krogh secondary&#xD;
           tissue cylinders&quot;), and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mid-peripheral non-perfused inner retina obtaining a degree of oxygenation from the&#xD;
           choroid via O2 penetration of the &quot;metabolic O2 barrier&quot; formed by the rod inner&#xD;
           segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fundus autofluorescence and Fourier-domain OCT imaging data suggested that a lower burn&#xD;
      intensity and reduced fluence burn could achieve effective uptake within the outer retina..&#xD;
      confirmed effective laser uptake using the Pascal® multi-spot technique at 10-20ms pulse&#xD;
      durations (Laser energy delivered to the tissue can be reduced by either reducing the&#xD;
      intensity of the laser or the duration of the burn). Furthermore, the analysis of&#xD;
      barely-visible laser titration burns showed effective thermal destruction of the inner&#xD;
      segments of the photoreceptors which, because of their highly energetic metabolism, are the&#xD;
      principal tissue target for laser photocoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the treatment of PDR, the severity of visual field loss may correlate with burn density,&#xD;
      longer pulse duration, and higher fluence. The ETDRS recommended 1 burn-widths spot-spacing,&#xD;
      however the investigators aimed to maximize retinal laser coverage in a single sitting, and&#xD;
      also to allow potential re-treatments to be safely placed between previous arrays of burns&#xD;
      thus preventing overlapping laser burns and nerve fiber layer defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual acuity, visual field (VF) testing, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are&#xD;
      important tools for quantifying the degree of visual dysfunction. Central (24 degree) visual&#xD;
      field measures in diabetic patients have been shown to correlate well with the stage of&#xD;
      retinopathy according to the ETDRS scale. Pan-retinal photocoagulation has been shown to have&#xD;
      a marked effect upon the central visual field measured with both global indices (Mean&#xD;
      Deviation and Pattern Standard Deviation) and point-by-point measures. OCT is a sensitive&#xD;
      instrument to diagnose and monitor DMO, and central retinal thickness (CRT) measures are used&#xD;
      in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a multispectral camera has been used effectively in a recent study (Manchester&#xD;
      Targeted Retinal Photocoagulation Study, MTRAP), with promising results produced that may&#xD;
      help explain the clinical effects of the study laser treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETDRS data did not show that initiating scatter photocoagulation prior to the development of&#xD;
      high-risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy in patients with type I diabetes will reduce the&#xD;
      risk of severe visual loss. However, ETDRS analyses did indicate that for patients with type&#xD;
      II diabetes, it is especially important to consider scatter photocoagulation at the time of&#xD;
      the development of severe nonproliferative or early proliferative retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ferris also showed that patients with type II diabetes, or older patients with diabetes, are&#xD;
      more likely to benefit from early scatter photocoagulation than patients with type I&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recommendation of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists is to consider PRP only once the&#xD;
      retinopathy reaches the proliferative stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reasons why scatter laser PRP is not generally recommended for severe NPDR in the UK (and&#xD;
      to prevent progression to PRD thereby) include: (i) uncertainty over desirable clinical&#xD;
      end-points of treatment (eg. whether moderate NPDR or mild NPDR), and (ii) the likelihood of&#xD;
      complications of PRP (such as DMO and visual field loss) that outweigh the potential benefits&#xD;
      of early treatment. However, all recommendation up to date are based on the experience and&#xD;
      results using argon laser as per EDTRS guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to assess the benefit of Pascal single-session subthreshold scatter&#xD;
      panretinal photocoagulation. As previously mentioned, all previous attempts of early PRP&#xD;
      involved the use of argon laser systems and different treatment strategies: full retinal&#xD;
      thickness burns, less number of burns and multiple treatment sessions. Laser treatment using&#xD;
      these parameters is currently considered to be tissue ablative. It was also not possible, at&#xD;
      the time, neither to image with as much clarity as the investigators can today the area of&#xD;
      retinal ischaemic penumbra nor to treat the peripheral retina as far anteriorly as it can be&#xD;
      done today. The investigators have shown that using Pascal20ms light burns allows for a&#xD;
      tissue healing response as shown by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Fundus&#xD;
      Autofluorescence (AF) retinal imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of minimally-traumatic high-burn dosimetry (3000 burns) Pascal Pan Retinal&#xD;
      Photo-Stimulation in Pre-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy may have implications in terms of&#xD;
      NHS diabetic eye care. Single session treatment with Pascal retinal laser may have a&#xD;
      significant cost saving effect for NHS departments, as the treatment time is significantly&#xD;
      reduced as well as the number of required sessions and outpatient clinic appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pascal system would allow larger number of patients to be safely treated per clinic&#xD;
      session. Reducing the number of patients at risk of conversion to proliferative disease could&#xD;
      not only have a significant cost saving effect for the NHS by reducing the frequency of&#xD;
      hospital visits and cost of treatment but, most importantly would offer a significant overall&#xD;
      benefit to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the Diabetic National Service Framework and English National Screening Programme&#xD;
      for Diabetic Retinopathy have outlined targets for treating PDR at within two weeks of&#xD;
      diagnosis in the eye clinic and from diabetic screening services. In current practice, this&#xD;
      target may be only achievable in around 75% of patients. If clinical hypothesis is achieved,&#xD;
      then a higher percentage would perhaps be achievable as the number of patients with&#xD;
      proliferative retinal diabetic disease that require treatment would go down.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novel P-RPhS Pascal treatment strategies may improve the comfort and safety of the patient's&#xD;
      laser journey, and increase the compliance with laser treatment and follow-up.&#xD;
