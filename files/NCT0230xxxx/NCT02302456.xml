      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the administration of a low dose of tranexamic&#xD;
      acid just after vaginal delivery can reduce the incidence of immediate postpartum hemorrhage,&#xD;
      in women who receive a prophylactic administration of oxytocin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a major cause of maternal mortality, accounting for one&#xD;
      quarter of all maternal deaths worldwide. Its incidence estimates in the literature vary&#xD;
      widely, from 3% to 15% of deliveries. Uterotonics after birth are the only intervention that&#xD;
      has been shown to be effective for PPH prevention. Tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic&#xD;
      agent, has therefore been investigated as a potentially useful complement to uterotonics for&#xD;
      prevention because it has been proved to reduce blood loss in elective surgery, bleeding in&#xD;
      trauma patients, and menstrual blood loss. Randomized controlled trials for PPH prevention&#xD;
      after cesarean (n=10) and vaginal (n=2) deliveries showed that women who had received TXA had&#xD;
      a significantly lesser amount of postpartum blood loss without any increase in severe&#xD;
      maternal adverse effect. However, overall, the quality of these trials was poor, and they&#xD;
      were not designed to test the effect of TXA on the reduction of PPH incidence, nor on the&#xD;
      incidence of rare but severe adverse effects. Large, adequately powered multicenter&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials are required before the widespread use of TXA for preventing PPH&#xD;
      can be recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a multicentre randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial,&#xD;
      with two parallel groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual information on the trial will be provided to women in late pregnancy during&#xD;
      prenatal visits. This information will be repeated when the women arrive in the delivery&#xD;
      room; the women then will confirm their participation and provide informed written consent&#xD;
      before delivery, when, in the opinion of the investigator, the woman is likely to have a&#xD;
      vaginal delivery with a minimum of 4 cm of cervix dilatation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be the intravenous administration of a 10-ml blinded ampoule of the&#xD;
      study drug (either 1g TXA or placebo according to the randomisation order), slowly (over&#xD;
      30-60 seconds), within 2 minutes after birth and prophylactic oxytocin administration, and&#xD;
      once the cord has been clamped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All other aspects of management of the third stage will be identical in both arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine prophylactic intravenous injection of 5 IU oxytocin at delivery of the anterior&#xD;
           shoulder or within 2 minutes after birth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placement of a graduated (100 mL graduation) collector bag just after birth, left in&#xD;
           place until the birth attendant judges that bleeding has stopped, and always at least&#xD;
           for 15 minutes. When a woman is included in the trial, a bag will be prepared and ready&#xD;
           to be put in place as soon as the baby is born and placed on the mother's belly; if&#xD;
           needed, a second staff person will be present to help in managing both the baby and the&#xD;
           bag. This will make it possible to collect and measure vaginal blood loss objectively&#xD;
           during the immediate postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Manual removal of the placenta at 30 minutes after birth if not expelled in absence of&#xD;
           bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rapid suturing of the episiotomy, in accordance with good clinical practices&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systematic use of uterotonic drugs after third stage of labor is not recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Controlled cord traction (CCT) will be left at the discretion of the practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If PPH occurs, standardised management will be provided according to the department's&#xD;
      protocol. In particular, the use of TXA for the treatment of PPH will be allowed and left at&#xD;
      the discretion of the practitioner according to the department's protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the participation of each patient included in the trial will be from&#xD;
      inclusion through 3 months postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned total duration of the trial will be 34 months including 23 months of patient&#xD;
      inclusion&#xD;
