      ANRS HC 33 is a pilot study to assess efficacy and safety of a DCV 3DAA therapy with&#xD;
      Asunaprevir, Daclatasvir and BMS-791325 in HCV genotype 4-infected patients after failure of&#xD;
      pegylated Interferon-Ribavirin regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proportion of patients with cirrhosis will be limited to 50% of all patients included,&#xD;
      cirrhosis being defined as a METAVIR score of F4 on the liver biopsy or an hepatic impulse&#xD;
      elastometry ≥ 14 kPa or a Fibrotest® result &gt; 0,75.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The clinical trial is multi-centre, national, Phase 2, open-label, single-arm. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to assess, in HCV genotype 4-infected patients in failure to prior&#xD;
      treatment with pegylated Interferon and Ribavirin bitherapy, the rate of sustained&#xD;
      virological response (SVR) 12 weeks after 12 weeks of treatment with an all-oral combination&#xD;
      of 3 DAAs in a Fixed-Dose-Combination (Asunaprevir 200 mg, Daclatasvir 30 mg and BMS - 791325&#xD;
      75 mg) twice a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated enrollment is 60 patients during the enrolment period (9 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule of assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      w4-w8 : screening D0 : Start of anti-HCV tritherapy (Asunaprevir + Daclatasvir + BMS-791325)&#xD;
      w12: stop tritherapy w24: Sustained virological response SVR12 assessment (12 weeks post&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint is the Sustained Virological Response Rate defined by an undetectable HCV RNA at W24, that is to say 12 weeks after the end of the DCV 3DAA therapy associating Asunaprevir, Daclatasvir and BMS - 791325 (SVR12). In case of premature total or partial interruption of HCV treatment, the primary endpoint will also be assessed at week 24.</description>
