    <textblock>
      Inflammatory Bowel diseases (IBD) include Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD's&#xD;
      precise origin is unknown until now. Today, the current hypothesis of the disease&#xD;
      pathogenesis is that IBD result from a dysregulated mucosal immune response to the gut&#xD;
      microbial flora in genetically susceptible hosts. The intestinal homeostasis depends on&#xD;
      interactions between immune and epithelial cells. Epithelial cells are the first line of&#xD;
      defense, are tightly connected to the underlying gut associated lymphoid tissue and their&#xD;
      alteration results in loss of tissue homeostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vanin-1 (Vnn1 in mice, VNN1 in humans) is an epithelial pantheinase which regulates the cell&#xD;
      response to stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This ectoenzyme hydrolyses the vitamin B5-derivative pantetheine to provide cysteamine to&#xD;
      tissues and regenerate pantothenate. Previous studies have shown that Vnn1 KO mice were more&#xD;
      resistant to experimental colitis and administration of cystamine (oxidized form of&#xD;
      cysteamine) restored their susceptibility to colitis. Furthermore, analysis of VNN1&#xD;
      expression in IBD patients show that high VNN1 expression is associated with severe clinical&#xD;
      features. Thus, analysis of VNN1 expression could represent a good prognostic marker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent published article, we characterized among a retrospective cohort of 500 IBD&#xD;
      patients and controls new SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in the VNN1 promoter and&#xD;
      showed their association with IBD incidence and high VNN1 expression. This suggested that the&#xD;
      VNN1gene might be a new predisposition marker of IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In mouse, Vnn1 expression is tightly regulated by activation of PPARa and PPARg transcription&#xD;
      factors. Interestingly, one of the SNPs identified in patients participates to a PPARg&#xD;
      binding site. Interestingly, drugs related to the family of 5-ASA which are commonly used in&#xD;
      IBD, have PPARgamma agonist potential. Therefore, quantifying VNN1 levels in patients under&#xD;
      5-ASA therapy might help predicting response to therapy and select patients with the highest&#xD;
      benefit for this therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this new project is to extend our initial analysis. The study will be&#xD;
      prospective, monocentric and controlled. Its primary objective is to evaluate the level of&#xD;
      VNN1 expression in the colonic mucosa between IBD patients and control subjects to confirm&#xD;
      the correlation between high VNN1 expression and IBD. In relation with its prospective&#xD;
      nature, we will also try to associate VNN1 expression level with specific endophenotypes&#xD;
      (severity and/or localization of the lesions, quality of the response to therapy). Finally,&#xD;
      we will screen patients for the previously identified SNPs to integrate this information in&#xD;
      the interpretation of the results of expression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is planned on 2 years. Two groups of patients will be constituted: one group will&#xD;
      include IBD patients followed in the &quot; Service de Gastro-entérologie du Pr Grimaud à&#xD;
      l'Hôpital Nord &quot; and the other group will constitute the control cohort including persons who&#xD;
      were proposed a screening colonoscopy for familial history of colon cancer or polyps, or for&#xD;
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will have to fill a questionnaire for each included patient, collecting&#xD;
      information about age, sex, past medical history, taken medicine, digestive symptoms and&#xD;
      colonoscopy indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBD patients will have a first set of biopsies (n = 10) and blood samples collected under&#xD;
      general anesthesia during a colonoscopy planned in their IBD usual follow-up; a second set of&#xD;
      similar samples will be collected within the next 12 months if an endoscopic control is&#xD;
      medically justified. The control subjects will have only one set of biopsy and blood samples&#xD;
      collected under general anesthesia during their colonoscopy. In the particular case of IBD&#xD;
      patients who require surgery, a small piece of the resection will be collected ex-vivo on&#xD;
      both healthy and pathologic areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood sample will serve for quantification of the VNN1 seric pantheteinase activity and&#xD;
      SNP's genetic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The colonic biopsies will be obtained in duplicates from 5 different ileocolonic areas, one&#xD;
      for histopathological analysis and the other for transcriptional analysis by qRT-PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical samples will be used for transcriptional activity, tissue pantheteinase activity&#xD;
      and constitution of TMA (Tissue MicroArrays) bank for immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected benefits are to validate a new IBD prognostic marker for disease severity or&#xD;
      potentially for evaluation of the therapeutic response.&#xD;
