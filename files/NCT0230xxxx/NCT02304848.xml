  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of low frequency deep brain stimulation&#xD;
      on subthalamic nucleus neural synchrony. Low frequency stimulation does not improve the&#xD;
      cardinal motor signs of Parkinson's disease, and may be beneficial only for gait and speech.&#xD;
      This study will provide insight into what the effects of low frequency stimulation are on&#xD;
      neural synchrony.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, with bilateral symptoms at Hoehn and&#xD;
             Yahr Stage greater than or equal to II.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented improvement in motor signs on versus off dopaminergic medication, with a&#xD;
             change in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor (UPDRS III) score of &gt;=&#xD;
             30% off to on medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The presence of complications of medication such as wearing off signs, fluctuating&#xD;
             responses and/or dyskinesias, and/or medication refractory tremor, and/or impairment&#xD;
             in the quality of life on or off medication due to these factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects should be on stable doses of medications, which should remain unchanged until&#xD;
             the DBS system is activated. After the DBS system is optimized (during which time the&#xD;
             overall medication dose may be reduced to avoid discomfort and complications such as&#xD;
             dyskinesias) the medication dose should remain unchanged, if possible, for the&#xD;
             duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with carbidopa/levodopa, and with a dopamine agonist at the maximal&#xD;
             tolerated doses as determined by a movement disorders neurologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with significant cognitive impairment and/or dementia as determined by a&#xD;
             standardized neuropsychological battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with clinically active depression, defined according to the Diagnostic and&#xD;
             Statistical manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria and as scored&#xD;
             on a validated depression assessment scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with very advanced Parkinson's disease, Hoehn and Yahr stage 5 on medication&#xD;
             (non-ambulatory).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 80.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with an implanted electronic device such as a neurostimulator, cardiac&#xD;
             pacemaker/defibrillator or medication pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects, who are pregnant, are capable of becoming pregnant, or who are breast&#xD;
             feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with cortical atrophy out of proportion to age or focal brain lesions that&#xD;
             could indicate a non-idiopathic movement disorder as determined by MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects having a major comorbidity increasing the risk of surgery (prior stroke,&#xD;
             severe hypertension, severe diabetes, or need for chronic anticoagulation other than&#xD;
             aspirin).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects having any prior intracranial surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects, who are immunocompromised.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with an active infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects, who require diathermy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), or transcranial&#xD;
             magnetic stimulation (TMS) to treat a chronic condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects, who have an inability to comply with study follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects, who are unable to understand or sign the informed consent&#xD;
