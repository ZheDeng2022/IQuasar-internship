      The aim of this study is to establish which of two treatment options is the preferred&#xD;
      intervention in the treatment of Morton's Neuroma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised controlled trial shall be performed. Steroid injection is the current gold&#xD;
      standard conservative treatment for this condition. Therefore, manipulation shall be compared&#xD;
      to a control group receiving a steroid injection in an equality randomised controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be compared using visual analogue pain scales (VAS), The Manchester-Oxford Foot&#xD;
      Questionnaire (MOXFQ), The Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM), the SF-36 quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire and algometric pressure threshold testing. An improvement in either groups' VAS&#xD;
      of 20mm above the other group shall be considered as the minimum worthwhile change as this&#xD;
      has been identified as the minimum clinically important difference in pain between treatment&#xD;
      groups in visual analogue pain scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is limited research evidence to support the management of Morton's neuroma with steroid&#xD;
      injection although its efficacy has only been demonstrated in the short term.&#xD;

      Proposed Randomised Single Blind Study Aims and objectives The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      establish which of two treatment options is the preferred intervention in the treatment of&#xD;
      Morton's Neuroma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives. A systematic review of the literature shall be undertaken in order to inform the&#xD;
      researchers. The Pressure Threshold Meter shall be validated for use in the foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised controlled trial shall be performed. Steroid injection is the current gold&#xD;
      standard conservative treatment for this condition. Therefore, manipulation shall be compared&#xD;
      to a control group receiving a steroid injection in an equality randomised controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be compared using visual analogue pain scales (VAS), The Manchester-Oxford Foot&#xD;
      Questionnaire (MOXFQ), The Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM), the SF-36 quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire and algometric pressure threshold testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An improvement in either group VAS of 20mm above the other group shall be considered as the&#xD;
      minimum worthwhile change as this has been identified as the minimum clinically important&#xD;
      difference in pain between treatment groups in visual analogue pain scales (Thomson et al.&#xD;
      2013). The primary question will ask whether manipulation is beneficial in the treatment of&#xD;
      MN. Secondary questions will be addressed, including, are the benefits of manipulation for&#xD;
      Morton's neuroma long lasting, and do they out-perform the current conservative interventions&#xD;
      at three months, six months and one year. Is PTM an accurate and reliable measurement tool&#xD;
      for foot pain? Furthermore, does manipulation result in changes to mechanical loading during&#xD;
      gait as seen on high resolution walkway analysis?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics The main ethical issue is in asking subjects in pain to accept an experimental&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been designed in such a way as to ensure that no volunteers are denied&#xD;
      treatment. There will also be an opportunity for those who have not benefited from their&#xD;
      allocated treatment to receive the alternative treatment or another treatment entirely. Each&#xD;
      volunteer shall have access to the standard treatment pathway at any time, should they wish&#xD;
      to avail themselves of it. This shall be fully explained to all volunteers prior to enrolment&#xD;
      in the study. At the completion of the study, all subjects shall have the treatment with the&#xD;
      strongest outcome scores made available to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Recruitment All patients from The Edinburgh foot and ankle surgical unit, QMU&#xD;
      musculoskeletal clinic, Dundee Podiatry Clinic and from The Queen Margaret Hospital,&#xD;
      Dunfermline with a suspicion of Morton's neuroma shall be invited to participate in the&#xD;
      study. A member of the patient's existing clinical care team shall check whether they meet&#xD;
      the study inclusion and exclusion criteria and make the initial approach to invite them to&#xD;
      become involved with the study. They will also give the patient the participant information&#xD;
      literature. Their active involvement in the study should amount to no more than the initial&#xD;
      six weeks followed by review appointments at six weeks, then three, six, nine and twelve&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prior to the study, the pressure algometer, the ultrasound machine and the high&#xD;
           resolution walkway will all be calibrated and validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients will be recruited from a variety of sources including Edinburgh Royal&#xD;
           Infirmary, QMU, Margaret Rose Hospital, Dunfermline and The Dundee Podiatry Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The clinicians at the above sources shall identify potential subjects and assess them&#xD;
           against the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria. Those who express an interest will&#xD;
           be given the written information in the form of a patient information sheet [appendix 1]&#xD;
           which describes the study in detail. They will then be invited to contact the chief&#xD;
           investigator (David Cashley) should they choose to become involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Detailed information about the study will be given by the chief investigator to each&#xD;
           potential subject who makes contact and they will then be given an appointment for the&#xD;
           QMU gait analysis laboratory. There will be a minimum three month wash-out period for&#xD;
           all subjects who have previously had any treatment for Morton's neuroma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Those who attend QMU will be invited to ask questions about the study and raise any&#xD;
           concerns that they may have. They will then be asked if they still want to participate&#xD;
           in the study. If they agree, they will be asked to sign a consent form [appendix 2] and&#xD;
           will have a study participation number allocated to them at this point in order to aide&#xD;
           anonymous data collection. The chief investigator will then gather further information&#xD;
           to include age, gender, duration and location of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Participants who no longer wish to be involved in the study will be directed into the&#xD;
           Musculoskeletal clinic at QMU for further assessment and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. A baseline set of VAS [appendix 3] and QoL [appendix 4] scores will then be completed by&#xD;
           all participants. All VAS and QoL questionnaires will be completed solely by the&#xD;
           subject, with no intervention from any third party. This will serve to blind the&#xD;
           researcher to the VAS and questionnaire measurements until the study is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The following clinical tests shall be performed on all participants in a predetermined&#xD;
           order that changes for each participant in order to limit the effect of hyperalgesia&#xD;
           (from repetitive testing) adversely affecting any single test. The tests are as follows;&#xD;
           Lateral squeeze test; Digital nerve stretch test; Gauthier's test; Sullivan's sign;&#xD;
           Webspace tenderness test. Maximal ankle dorsiflexion and plantar percussion (MADAPP)&#xD;
           test. Details of these tests can be found in appendix 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. All participants will undergo a dynamic ultrasound scan of the affected area. Where a&#xD;
           neuroma is identified by US, the location and size of the lesion will be recorded. In&#xD;
           instances of multiple neuromas, either bilaterally or unilaterally, only the neuroma at&#xD;
           the site of the participant's greatest discomfort shall be recorded. However, in order&#xD;
           to limit the impact of the additional neuromas on pain scores and QoL scores, all&#xD;
           neuromas will be treated. Where the US scan is negative for a neuroma the participant&#xD;
           shall be removed from the study and invited to attend the QMU MSK clinic for further&#xD;
           treatment. If the US scan identifies any other anomaly except a neuroma, the participant&#xD;
           will be informed, withdrawn from the study and referred for the appropriate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Each participant shall be measured on the HR Walkway in order to assess forefoot loading&#xD;
           patterns. The walkway mat will be set to obtain plantar pressure distribution&#xD;
           measurements and will be set up in such a manner as to ensure that none of the systems&#xD;
           cabling can interfere with the recording of each participant. Connecting the handle unit&#xD;
           to the walkway sensor should change the status from &quot;misaligned&quot; to &quot;sensor OK&quot;. The&#xD;
           sensor handle units will be held in place by Velcro strips to ensure their placing is&#xD;
           secure. The participant will be asked to walk along the mat for at least twenty steps in&#xD;
           order to accomplish the &quot;break in&quot;, after which, the computer will give live pressure&#xD;
           readings from the sensors. Data acquisition parameters will include duration, frames to&#xD;
           record, frequency and period. Once all parameters are set, data recording will commence.&#xD;
           Participants will be asked to walk the full length of the marked out walkway at their&#xD;
           normal walking pace. This will be repeated and recorded three times.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. At this point all participants shall complete their second set of VAS scores and QoL&#xD;
           questionnaires. This will be done on the same day as the first set but after the US scan&#xD;
           and HR Walkway has been completed. This is to ensure that the VAS and QoL measurement&#xD;
           tools are sufficiently robust, valid and repeatable. Allowing a time lapse with no&#xD;
           therapeutic intervention should result in similar scores being obtained on both&#xD;
           occasions, thereby inferring that the tools are measuring accurately.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. All subjects will have their first pressure threshold meter (PTM) score recorded. This&#xD;
           will be done by taking measurements of the metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ) either side&#xD;
           of the affected webspace and using the lowest scoring joint for this and all subsequent&#xD;
           measurements. Where there is ambiguity regarding the webspace, all lesser MTPJs will be&#xD;
           measured and the lowest scoring joint used for all subsequent measurements. The PTM&#xD;
           measurement will be taken in such a way that the readout display of the meter is covered&#xD;
           so that it cannot be read. This will double blind the measurement so that neither the&#xD;
           subject not the practitioner will have sight of the PTM measurement results until the&#xD;
           intervention is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Minimisation with weighted randomisation will be used to split subjects into two trial&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Those randomised to the steroid group shall receive a single injection of 1 mL&#xD;
           methylprednisolone [40 mg] and 1 mL 2% lignocaine. They shall then be asked to return&#xD;
           for review in six weeks. A second injection may be offered at this point if clinically&#xD;
           indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. Those in the manipulation group shall have the lesser MTPJs of the affected foot&#xD;
           manually manipulated using a high velocity, low amplitude thrust technique. They will be&#xD;
           asked to return once each week for a further five weeks. At each visit the VAS and PTM&#xD;
           measurements shall be repeated, as will the manual manipulation. They shall also be&#xD;
           asked to return for a review in the sixth week.&#xD;
&#xD;
       16. All subjects will receive a weekly text message asking them to rate their pain on a&#xD;
           scale of 0 - 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
       17. At the six week review the ultrasound scan, high resolution walkway, clinical tests, QoL&#xD;
           questionnaires, VAS and PTM scores shall all be repeated. Subjects will then be asked to&#xD;
           attend for a second review at three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
       18. The three month review shall follow the format of the six week review and subjects will&#xD;
           be asked to attend for a six month and one year review where the same procedure shall be&#xD;
           followed again.&#xD;
&#xD;
       19. At the end of the study, all data shall be processed and subject to statistical&#xD;
           analysis. Comparisons will be drawn between the three groups.&#xD;
