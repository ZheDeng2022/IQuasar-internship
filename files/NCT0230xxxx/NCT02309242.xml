      The aim of the proposed project is to study the long-term impact of adjuvant systemic multi-&#xD;
      agent chemotherapy (cisplatin, anthracyclines, vincristine, methotrexate, alkylating agents)&#xD;
      in survivors (treated between 1992 and 2014 in UZ Leuven) of paediatric bone or soft tissue&#xD;
      sarcomas on neurocognitive functioning using neuropsychological testing in combination with&#xD;
      advanced Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging techniques in a cross-sectional design. The majority&#xD;
      of studies focus on either neuropsychological outcomes or structural imaging. In this project&#xD;
      we want to combine both methodologies. MR will mainly focus on microstructural changes in&#xD;
      white matter and differences in brain connectivity, while with our neuropsychological tests&#xD;
      we will assess a broad range of cognitive functioning. From the obtained MR parameters and&#xD;
      neuropsychological test results, the proposed study wants to answer the following research&#xD;
      questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Are there subtle differences in neurocognitive function and behavior related to&#xD;
           chemotherapy exposure for survivors of paediatric bone or soft tissue sarcomas?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Are there differences in morphological/functional MR parameters that could relate to&#xD;
           subtle cognitive differences in cognitive functioning after chemotherapy exposure? Can&#xD;
           we detect structural treatment-induced WM injury? Can we see differences in brain neural&#xD;
           activity/connectivity during rest between the groups?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is there a correlation between the obtained morphological/functional MR parameters and&#xD;
           neuropsychological test results?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Is there a correlation between the possible difference in white matter microstructure&#xD;
           and gender, age at diagnosis and the duration of treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer these questions, we will implement the following measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From the computerized Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks (ANT) system we will test&#xD;
           simple motor reaction time, sustained, focused and divided attention, inhibitory control&#xD;
           and cognitive flexibility and motor coordination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific verbal-auditory memory and nonverbal, visual-spatial memory functioning will be&#xD;
           registered by the Children's Memory Scale (CMS) for subjects younger than 16 years and&#xD;
           with the auditory verbal learning test and the Rey visual design learning test for the&#xD;
           subjects older than 16 years. Age-adjusted standardized norms are available for each&#xD;
           test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The BRIEF (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function) explores executive&#xD;
           functioning in school (5-17 years), work (+18 years) and home (5-17 years and +18 years)&#xD;
           environments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The assessment of intellectual functioning consists of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale&#xD;
           for Children (WISC-III) for patients between 6 and 16 years and the Wechsler Adult&#xD;
           Intelligence (WAIS-III) for adolescents aged 17 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life will be investigated by the PEDSQL generic version for young adults .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Achenbach questionnaires (Child Behavior Checklist, Teacher Report Form, Youth Self&#xD;
           Report Form, Adult Behavior Checklist, Adult Self Report Form) items for internalizing,&#xD;
           externalizing, and total problems will be filled out by the parents, teacher or&#xD;
           relatives and patients themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will complete the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the&#xD;
           Beck Depression Inventory-II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the neurocognitive follow-up of paediatric bone and brain tumour patients&#xD;
      (NKP21/22c, National Cancer Plan Onkelinx) as well as children with congenital heart disease&#xD;
      (IWT-TBM, 3M110068) or treated in a paediatric intensive care unit is also based on this test&#xD;
      battery. All these tests and questionnaires have been extensively described and used to&#xD;
      quantify neurocognitive development and Quality of life in various paediatric populations.&#xD;
      The testing will be performed at least one year after the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI imaging to study the neural substrate of possible neurotoxic effects of&#xD;
      chemotherapy-treatment Advanced MR neuroimaging techniques in combination with the detailed&#xD;
      cognitive and behavioral assessment will be used. All subjects will be imaged on the same 3T&#xD;
      Philips scanner with a 32-channel phased-array head coil, located in the radiology department&#xD;
      at UZ Leuven. Neuroimaging consists of 3D T1-weighted FLAIR and advanced diffusion weighted-&#xD;
      imaging (DWI), to examine white matter (WM) microstructure, and resting state functional MRI&#xD;
      (rfMRI) to visualize neuronal activity of the brain at rest (examination with eyes closed).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. DWI - a technique enabling the visualization and characterization of the WM architecture&#xD;
           via the self-diffusion of water molecules - allows us to study potential&#xD;
           chemotherapy-induced changes in the WM microstructure. Damage to WM structures - for&#xD;
           example axonal loss or demyelination - may change quantitative DWI parameters such as&#xD;
           fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD) and diffusion kurtosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. rfMRI uses the vascular response nearby electrically active neurons to indirectly&#xD;
           visualize brain activity and allows us to determine the connectivity between the&#xD;
           different brain regions at rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the proposed scan protocol is maximum 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses Neuropsychological performance Performance on neurocognitive measures of&#xD;
      the survivors will be compared with an age-matched control group using ANOVA and simple&#xD;
      contrasts with controls as reference and STAI and BDI scores as covariates. Partial eta&#xD;
      squared (hp2) will be computed to estimate effect sizes (weak effect: ηp²≈0.03; moderate:&#xD;
      ηp²≈0.06; large: ηp²≥0.14). Cohen's d will be used for simple contrasts (small effect: 0.2 &lt;&#xD;
      d &lt; 0.3; medium: 0.3 &lt; d &lt; 0.8; large: d&gt; 0.8). Subsequent analyses are conducted only on&#xD;
      those neurocognitive measures where survivors demonstrated significantly lower values than&#xD;
      the age-matched control group. The independent effects of the predictors (treatment group,&#xD;
      gender, age at treatment, duration of treatment and socioeconomic status) on these&#xD;
      neuropsychological score will be analyzed with a repeated measures mixed effects regression&#xD;
      model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging State of the art image analysis approaches are applied to process and analyze the&#xD;
      acquired brain images and to document differences in structural white matter or resting state&#xD;
      brain activity between the study groups. DTI images will be processed and analyzed using&#xD;
      explore DTI, in-house developed software and voxel-based statistical analysis. Furthermore,&#xD;
      performance on neurocognitive measures and differences in FA and MD maps of the survivors&#xD;
      will be compared with an age and sex-matched control group using ANOVA and simple contrasts&#xD;
      with controls as reference and STAI and BDI scores as covariates. Seed-based analysis and&#xD;
      independent component analysis (ICA) will be applied to analyze the resting state fMRI data.&#xD;
      The association between the obtained MRI parameters and the performance on neurocognitive&#xD;
      tests will be investigated using (voxel-based) correlation analysis. The independent effects&#xD;
      of the predictors (treatment group, gender, age at treatment, duration of treatment and&#xD;
      socioeconomic status) on these neuropsychological and imaging scores will be analyzed with a&#xD;
      repeated measures mixed effects regression model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and power Study subjects are recruited from the paediatric haemato-oncology&#xD;
      center in UZLeuven. We expect to recruit 30 patients within the time frame of this project. A&#xD;
      healthy control group (n=30) matched for age and gender will be included. Demographic&#xD;
      characteristics such as social economic, school and work status are assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is difficult to perform a fundamental power calculation, because little is known about the&#xD;
      impact of the chemotherapy in bone or soft tissue sarcomas on cognitive functioning so far.&#xD;
      We expect to recruit 30 survivors of bone or soft tissue sarcoma in childhood. If we take&#xD;
      these numbers into account and based on a previous studies reporting white matter FA changes&#xD;
      and cognitive changes in childhood ALL patients who received chemotherapy, we would have a&#xD;
      power of 98.54% to detect a difference of 1 standard deviation on cognitive tasks (1-tailed,&#xD;
      α=0.05). For white matter FA changes, we would have a power of 98%.&#xD;
