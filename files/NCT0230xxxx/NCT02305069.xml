  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity in humans has been shown to result in the increased release of small&#xD;
      inflammatory-inducing proteins, called cytokines, from the fat cells of the body. The&#xD;
      investigators are interested in the effects of these cytokines on the mechanisms that control&#xD;
      muscle mass and metabolism in the obese human. Previous research from work in cells and&#xD;
      animals has shown the cytokines reduce the synthesis of muscle proteins and simultaneously&#xD;
      enhance their rate of breakdown, resulting in a loss of muscle mass. Furthermore, research&#xD;
      suggests that the same cytokines may inhibit carbohydrate oxidation, a pivotal step in muscle&#xD;
      metabolism. However, despite these potential negative consequences for skeletal muscle&#xD;
      function, the effect of low-level and persistent inflammation as seen in obese humans,&#xD;
      remains largely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study, the investigators plan to measure the rates of synthesis and breakdown&#xD;
      of muscle proteins in conjunction with rates of carbohydrate oxidation in obese older&#xD;
      participants, and compare them to rates determined in healthy non-obese individuals.&#xD;
      Furthermore, participants will undergo a 12-week course of either pioglitazone, an insulin&#xD;
      sensitiser often prescribed to type II diabetics, or a placebo. Pioglitazone has been shown&#xD;
      previously to normalise the levels of cytokines in the blood of chronically inflamed&#xD;
      individuals. By repeating after the 12-week intervention period the initial measurements&#xD;
      described above, and by accurately determining the levels of the cytokines, the&#xD;
      identification of the negative effects of obesity-induced inflammation in older adults on&#xD;
      muscle metabolism will be determined.&#xD;

      Recruitment of subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      24 obese (but otherwise healthy) participants with elevated cytokine levels and 24 non-obese&#xD;
      subjects with normal cytokine levels will be recruited. Following the first experimental&#xD;
      visit (see below), participants will be divided in a double-blind fashion into four groups&#xD;
      (n=12). In previous studies utilising similar low-grade inflammatory states where&#xD;
      thiazolidinediones have been administered, significant differences (P&lt;0.05) in processes&#xD;
      under investigation have been observed with group sizes of 10. Therefore group sizes of 12&#xD;
      have been selected to accommodate for the anticipated 15% dropout seen in long-term studies.&#xD;
      Participants will be male, age matched (&gt;55 years), non-smoking, live a sedentary lifestyle&#xD;
      and non-vegetarian. Before taking part in the study, all subjects will undergo medical&#xD;
      screening and complete a general health questionnaire. This will include measures of blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), blood biochemistry and a blood&#xD;
      clotting profile. For non-control subjects, inclusion into the study will be determined by&#xD;
      measures of waist circumference (&gt;100 cm), and inflammatory status (non-obese subjects with&#xD;
      C-reactive proteins (CRP) plasma levels &lt;1.35 μg.ml-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα)&#xD;
      plasma levels &lt;3.3 pg.ml-1 and obese subjects with a CRP &gt;1.35 μg.ml-1 and TNFα &gt;4.1&#xD;
      pg.ml-1). Following an explanation of the study and associated procedures, written consent&#xD;
      will be obtained and subjects made aware that they are free to withdraw at any point.&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited via press advertisements from the local population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental trials:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of a 12-week long study, muscle protein synthesis and leg protein breakdown will&#xD;
      be determined in all subjects via the administration of stable-isotopes of leucine and&#xD;
      phenylalanine concomitant to a two-stage insulin clamp to simulate going from the fasted to&#xD;
      fed state. This will establish the baseline values for these measures prior to the 12-week&#xD;
      intervention period. These measures will be achieved in a single visit with the execution of&#xD;
      an established protocol for the determination of muscle protein synthesis and leg protein&#xD;
      breakdown. In summary, to achieve this the following will be performed: a basal muscle biopsy&#xD;
      from the thigh will be obtained after which serum insulin concentrations will be held at&#xD;
      fasting levels and a further muscle biopsy obtained; once taken serum insulin concentrations&#xD;
      will be elevated and mixed amino acids administered to simulate feeding followed by the&#xD;
      taking of a third and final muscle biopsy. The taking of biopsies will allow for the&#xD;
      determination of isotope incorporation and thereby the determination of muscle protein&#xD;
      synthesis and leg protein breakdown rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the first experimental visit, subjects will start a 12 week treatment period of&#xD;
      either pioglitazone (30 mg•day-1) or a placebo, administered in a double-blind fashion.&#xD;
      Subjects will be monitored at intervals throughout the period to ensure compliance and report&#xD;
      unwanted side effects. After 12 weeks of drug or placebo administration, subjects will return&#xD;
      to the laboratory for a repeat of the measurements determined in the first experimental visit&#xD;
      (muscle protein synthesis and leg protein breakdown in response to simulated feeding).&#xD;
      Circulating levels of select cytokines will be additionally examined in blood samples&#xD;
      collected from subjects at the start of the two experimental visits (pre- and post- 12-week&#xD;
      drug intervention period), thus allowing an assessment of any associated changes between&#xD;
      systemic cytokine concentrations and muscle protein synthesis and leg protein breakdown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves two visits separated by a 12-week drug intervention period. At each of the&#xD;
      two visits muscle protein synthesis and leg protein breakdown rates in response to simulated&#xD;
      feeding are to be assessed using an established experimental protocol described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to abstain from alcohol and exercise for 48 h prior to each&#xD;
      experimental visit and to arrive on the morning of the experimental visit in a fasted state.&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to rest in a semi-supine position while a cannula is inserted&#xD;
      retrograde into a superficial vein on the dorsal surface of the non-dominant hand for blood&#xD;
      sampling. The hand will be kept in a hand-warming unit (air temperature 50-55°C) to&#xD;
      arterialise the venous drainage of the hand. A cannula will be placed in an antecubital vein&#xD;
      in each forearm for the infusion of insulin, octreotide, glucose, amino acids and&#xD;
      stable-isotope infusions of leucine and phenylalanine to simulate feeding in precise manner;&#xD;
      a catheter placed in the femoral vein will allow, in conjunction with arterialised-venous&#xD;
      (A-V) blood samples, arterial and venous blood sampling across the leg. To assess muscle&#xD;
      protein synthesis and leg protein breakdown rates in response to feeding, serum insulin will&#xD;
      initially be maintained at fasting concentrations by the administration of insulin (0.6&#xD;
      mU•m-2•min-1) for 120 minutes and, to prevent endogenous insulin production, Octreotide (30&#xD;
      ng•kg-1•min-1). Then, to simulate feeding, serum insulin concentrations will be increased&#xD;
      equivalent to the fed state for 120 minutes (~40 mU•l-1) and 20g of mixed amino acids&#xD;
      (Glamin® Fresenius-Kabi, UK) administered by infusion in conjunction with glucose to&#xD;
      stabilise blood glucose concentrations (~4.5 mmol.l-1). Infusions of stable isotope versions&#xD;
      of phenylalanine and leucine will be maintained throughout the experimental visit. Initially,&#xD;
      a single priming dose of [2H5]phenylalanine (0.33 mg•kg-1 body mass, 98 atom % excess) and&#xD;
      [1-13C]leucine (0.8 mg•kg-1 body mass, 99 atom % excess) will be administered, followed by a&#xD;
      constant infusion of 0.5 mg•kg-1•h-1 phenylalanine and 1.0 mg•kg-1•h-1 leucine. The use of&#xD;
      these two stable-isotopes in combination with muscle biopsies obtained from the vastus&#xD;
      lateralis muscle of the leg at t = 0, 120 and 240 min and blood sampling throughout the&#xD;
      visit, will allow muscle protein synthesis and leg protein breakdown rates in response to&#xD;
      feeding to be calculated. At regular intervals throughout the experimental period,&#xD;
      respiratory gas exchange will be monitored by measuring oxygen (O2) uptake and carbon dioxide&#xD;
      (CO2) production using a ventilated hood indirect calorimeter (NutrEn, UK) to calculate the&#xD;
      respiratory exchange ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the initial visit where baseline measures of muscle protein synthesis and&#xD;
      leg protein breakdown in response to feeding have been established, the 12-week drug&#xD;
      intervention period will begin. On completion of the 12-week intervention, the study visit&#xD;
      described above will be repeated to determine the effects of the intervention on the outcome&#xD;
      measures listed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of each experimental visit, 8 ml of blood will be collected from a venous&#xD;
      cannula into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) vacutainers. Following centrifugation at&#xD;
      4°C, the extracted plasma will be stored at -80°C to allow the later determination of&#xD;
      circulating levels of select cytokines. During the insulin clamp, 1 ml of A-V blood will be&#xD;
      obtained every 5 min for the monitoring of blood glucose concentration (YSI 2300 STATplus,&#xD;
      Yellow Springs Instruments, USA). A-V blood (5 ml) will be collected at baseline and at +30,&#xD;
      +75, +90, +105, +120, +150, +195, +210, +225, +240 min, allowed to clot, centrifuged, and the&#xD;
      serum stored in liquid nitrogen. Insulin will be measured in these samples at a later date&#xD;
      with a radioimmunoassay kit (Coat-a-Count Insulin, USA). Femoral venous and A-V blood samples&#xD;
      (2 ml) will be taken for blood tracer measurements at -5, +75, +90, +105, +120, +195, +210,&#xD;
      +225, +240 min, centrifuged at 4°C and stored at -80°C. Muscle biopsies will be obtained from&#xD;
      the vastus lateralis muscle at 0, +120 and +240 min using the percutaneous needle biopsy&#xD;
      technique. Muscle samples will be snap frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to the determination&#xD;
      of [1-13C]leucine incorporation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After-care of the subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auditing of the Investigator's past studies involving muscle biopsies and cannulation&#xD;
      procedures has shown the procedures to be well tolerated by subjects and to have few&#xD;
      significant complications. Scarring of the skin is minimal and invisible after a few months.&#xD;
      All muscle biopsies are obtained under sterile conditions by medically qualified staff and&#xD;
      after the injection of local anaesthetic. All subjects are carefully monitored before,&#xD;
      during, and after the procedure to ensure that they are comfortable at all times. After each&#xD;
      biopsy, the skin is closed with a sterile adhesive strip and covered with a waterproof&#xD;
      adhesive dressing. On removal of the cannulae, pressure is applied to stop bleeding, and the&#xD;
      sites dressed with a waterproof adhesive dressing. Subjects are given a leaflet before they&#xD;
      leave the laboratory containing after-care information and contact details of our clinicians&#xD;
      should they need advice. Further, subjects will be contacted by telephone on weeks 2, 6 &amp; 10&#xD;
      to confirm the absence of any adverse effects of the drug administration. Subjects will also&#xD;
      be provided with contact details that they can use should they have any concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle biopsy samples and blood samples shall be measured for tracer incorporation, allowing&#xD;
      rates of muscle protein synthesis and breakdown to be calculated. Collected blood samples&#xD;
      will be analysed for circulating levels of cytokines. By performing these measurements pre-&#xD;
      and post- pioglitazone treatment, the consequences of inflammation in aged individuals on&#xD;
      muscle metabolism will be determined. Statistical analysis shall be performed using analysis&#xD;
      of variance (ANOVA).&#xD;
