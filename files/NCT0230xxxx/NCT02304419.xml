    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to learn more about how the study drug called galunisertib&#xD;
      affects the immune system in participants with cancer. The study treatment is expected to&#xD;
      last about six months for each participant, not including screening or follow-up.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a confirmed diagnosis of advanced, refractory solid tumors and tumor progression&#xD;
             or treatment intolerance to at least 1 prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have measurable disease that is amenable to a radiographic or ultrasound-guided biopsy&#xD;
             or may be biopsied in the office without radiologic guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a performance status of ≤2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)&#xD;
             scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have discontinued all disease-modifying therapy for the primary cancer for 28 days&#xD;
             prior to initiation of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatic: bilirubin ≤1.5 times upper limits of normal (ULN), alanine aminotransferase&#xD;
             (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) ≤3.0 times ULN. For participants with tumor&#xD;
             involvement of the liver, AST and ALT equaling&#xD;
&#xD;
             ≤5.0 times ULN are acceptable. Alkaline phosphatase ≤5.0 times ULN for participants&#xD;
             with tumor involvement of the bone is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have adequate renal function, defined as serum creatinine levels ≤2.0 ULN or&#xD;
             calculated creatinine clearance &gt;45 mL/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female participants with reproductive potential must use an approved&#xD;
             contraceptive method, if appropriate (for example, intrauterine device, birth control&#xD;
             pills, or barrier device) during and for 6 months after discontinuation of study&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin&#xD;
             pregnancy test documented within 7 days prior to treatment. Have given written&#xD;
             informed consent prior to any study-specific procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;

             not within 28 days of the initial dose of study drug. May have received prior&#xD;
             radiotherapy for their malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  May have received treatment with an investigational product.&#xD;

                  medical treatments) at the investigator's discretion (for example, symptomatic or&#xD;
                  sustained atrial or ventricular arrhythmias, second- or third-degree&#xD;
                  atrioventricular block, complete bundle branch block, ventricular hypertrophy, or&#xD;
                  recent myocardial infarction).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have major abnormalities documented by echocardiography (ECHO) with Doppler (for&#xD;
                  example, moderate or severe heart valve function defect and/or left ventricular&#xD;
                  ejection fraction &lt;50%, evaluation based on the institutional lower limit of&#xD;
                  normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have predisposing conditions that are consistent with development of aneurysms of&#xD;
                  the ascending aorta or aortic stress (for example, family history of aneurysms,&#xD;
                  Marfan-Syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve, evidence of damage to the large vessels&#xD;
                  of the heart documented by computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are women who are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a serious concomitant systemic disorder (for example, active infection including&#xD;

             [ie, positive hepatitis B surface antigen [+HBsAg]]), or an autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a second primary malignancy or any history in any time frame of a prior&#xD;
             malignancy.&#xD;
