  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Foods rich in certain (poly)phenols, particularly flavonoids, such as berries and cocoa, have&#xD;
      been shown to improve measures of vascular function as well as cognitive performance in human&#xD;
      intervention studies. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel trial&#xD;
      investigating the effects of daily blueberry (poly)phenol consumption on vascular function&#xD;
      and cognitive performance in healthy elderly individuals. The study will be conducted at&#xD;
      King's College London, Franklin-Wilkins Building.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be healthy males and females aged 65-80.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date no study has investigated whether daily blueberry consumption can induce an increase&#xD;
      in cerebral blood flow, with subsequent improvements in vascular and cognitive function. In&#xD;
      this study, the investigators aim to directly link daily blueberry consumption with improved&#xD;
      vascular function, increased cerebral blood flow and positive cognitive outcomes in healthy&#xD;
      elderly individuals. The investigators will use a large group of elderly individuals'&#xD;
      representative of a healthy population, both males and females, aged 65-80 years to evaluate&#xD;
      the health effects of daily blueberry consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim is to investigate whether improvements in vascular and cognitive function&#xD;
      previously seen after blueberry consumption can be seen following 3-months daily consumption&#xD;
      in elderly individuals, and whether enhanced cognitive performance is correlated with&#xD;
      increased cerebral blood flow. The investigators hypothesise that daily consumption of an&#xD;
      anthocyanin rich blueberry drink will improve cognitive performance and vascular function,&#xD;
      increasing cerebral blood flow, in healthy older individuals.&#xD;
