      Cerebral palsy is the most common childhood disabilities affecting individual's posture and&#xD;
      movement. Cerebral palsy is a disorder that causes activity limitations attributed to&#xD;
      non-progressive disturbances of the foetal or infant brain that may also affect sensation,&#xD;
      perception, cognition, communication, and behavior. Cerebral palsy (CP) results from damage&#xD;
      to the developing central nervous system while in utero, during delivery, or during the first&#xD;
      two years of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common movement disorder in Cerebral palsy is a spastic paresis, defined as a&#xD;
      posture and movement-dependent tone regulation disorder.The most common signs of the disorder&#xD;
      are spasticity, rigidity, muscle weakness, ataxia, balance and movement disorders. Compared&#xD;
      to the typically developed children, these children have impaired sensation and increased&#xD;
      muscle tone therefore they have trouble voluntarily controlling their muscles. Cerebral Palsy&#xD;
      can be grouped based on the motor effects it has on the individual, these can include spastic&#xD;
      Cerebral palsy or non-spastic Cerebral palsy. Spastic Cerebral Palsy is the most common type&#xD;
      and is associated with tight or contracted muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral Palsy is more prevalent in more deprived socio-economic populations. Cerebral palsy&#xD;
      is a disease that globally has a prevalence of 2 to 3 cases per 1,000 live born neonates. An&#xD;
      increase in the prevalence of CP was also seen in low birth weight survivors from the Mersey&#xD;
      region of the United Kingdom for the same period. Pilot studies of severe mental retardation&#xD;
      conducted in selected populations in Pakistan and India have reported extraordinarily high&#xD;
      prevalence estimates in the range of 12-24 /1,000 Spasticity may be defined as a motor&#xD;
      disorder characterised by a velocity-dependent exaggeration of stretch reflexes resulting&#xD;
      from abnormal intraspinal processing of primary afferent input. The impaired sensation and&#xD;
      increase in tone leads to wide range in movement dysfunction. About seventy to eighty percent&#xD;
      of children with Cerebral Palsy demonstrate spastic clinical features. Many children with&#xD;
      cerebral palsy (CP) have poor walking abilities and manipulation skills. One contributing&#xD;
      factor to their problems with gait and reaching movement is poor balance control. Balance&#xD;
      control is important as it helps a child to recover from unexpected balance&#xD;
      disturbances.Currently, there are many options for the management of spasticity, balance&#xD;
      disturbances and risk of fall that includes physical modalities, oral pharmacologic agents,&#xD;
      peripheral injectables, intrathecal agents, and surgical interventions, however mostly&#xD;
      physical therapy is commonly preferable treatment that includes stretching, NDT,&#xD;
      Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitations,strength training and gait training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic mechanical loading of the skeleton is an arduous task and troublesome to induce in&#xD;
      children who suffer from severe cerebral palsy. The lack of dynamic weight bearing in this&#xD;
      population predisposes them to reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and pre-mature&#xD;
      osteoporosis. These children are also more prone to muscle weakness, which contributes to&#xD;
      pain, deformity and functional loss. Whole-body vibration training was proposed as a new&#xD;
      therapeutic modality for the treatment of the gross motor function, balance and functional&#xD;
      performance Whole body vibration (WBV), for which the participant stands on a vibrating&#xD;
      platform, delivers low-frequency, low-amplitude mechanical stimuli that enter the human body&#xD;
      via the feet. The vibrations stimulate the muscle spindles and alpha motor neuron sending&#xD;
      nerve impulses to initiate muscle contractions according to the tonic vibration reflex.&#xD;
      Compared to the repetitive passive movement, this WBV protocol adds a muscle strengthening&#xD;
      component to the anti-spastic effects. Activity restrictions in spastic cerebral palsy are&#xD;
      mainly due to poor postural control. Many interventions like resisting exercises, therapeutic&#xD;
      horseback riding, electrical stimulations leads to short term posture and balance&#xD;
      improvement. Training using vibration platforms adjunct to exercise has shown to be effective&#xD;
      in increasing strength resulting in improved balance and coordination. Whole body vibration&#xD;
      has shown to be effective in reducing lower limb spasticity after first application of WBV&#xD;
      with a vibration frequency of 12 Hz to 18 Hz ( 2-3 m of amplitude ) for 9 minutes and a&#xD;
      significant decrease in tone is observed and even the functional mobility and balance is&#xD;
      improved.. During all of the vibration-training sessions, the children will wear the&#xD;
      gymnastic shoes to standardize the damping of the vibration due to footwear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is paucity in the literature regarding evidence for the safe and effective use of&#xD;
      vibration intervention in children with or without pathology and has great effects in&#xD;
      spasticity, mobility and improving balance.Chia-Ling Chen concluded that the WBV is an&#xD;
      effective intervention for controlling spasticity and improving ambulation. Villarreal et&#xD;
      al.showed that 20-week WBV therapy had positive effects on the balance of DS adolescents,&#xD;
      although only under specific conditions, with vision and somatosensory input altered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous studies high dosage of whole body vibration has both positive and negative&#xD;
      effects. Because this type of treatment seems to improve bone health, The purpose of this&#xD;
      intervention is to ensure functional independence in cerebral palsy patients. Whole Body&#xD;
      Vibration Therapy has proven to be effective in improving balance by reducing spasticity and&#xD;
      improving muscle strength. It is essential to explore new interventions for patients&#xD;
      specially for cerebral palsy in whom functional independence is impaired thus their mobility&#xD;
      is restricted leading to secondary complications. In my study my goal is to use combination&#xD;
      of conventional physical therapy with whole body vibration which can control spasticity and&#xD;
      enhance ambulatory performance.&#xD;
