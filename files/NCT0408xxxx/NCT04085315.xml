  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of alisertib when given together&#xD;
      with osimertinib in treating patients with EGFR-mutated stage IV lung cancer. Alisertib may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking a specific protein (Aurora Kinase A) that&#xD;
      researchers believe may be important for the growth of lung cancer. Osimertinib may reduce&#xD;
      tumor growth by blocking the action of a certain mutant protein (EGFR). This study may help&#xD;
      researchers test the safety of alisertib at different dose levels in combination with&#xD;
      osimertinib, and to find out what effects, good and/or bad, it has on EGFR-mutated lung&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      Patients receive alisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17.&#xD;
      Patients also receive osimertinib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 to 6 months for up to 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

    <time_frame>From pretreatment biopsy to time of response, up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Pre-treatment tumor biopsy formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples will be stained for TPX2 expression by IHC.

The sum of staining score index (intensity + extent) will be designated as follows: 0-2, negative expression; 3-4, strong expression. The IHC score will be generated from three different areas of the slides and an average score will be calculated for each sample. We will determine whether there is a difference in TPX2 staining between responders and non-responders to alisertib + osimertinib treatment by the Fisher's exact test.</description>

             required for post-menopausal or surgically sterilized women.&#xD;
&#xD;

             medications, or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with&#xD;
             study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with&#xD;
             the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would&#xD;
             make the patient inappropriate for enrollment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 3 years of enrollment, with the&#xD;
             exception of complete resection of basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of&#xD;

             thyroid cancer after curative therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients who are currently receiving treatment with contraindicated QTc prolonging&#xD;
             medications or potent CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors, as listed in the protocol, if that&#xD;
             treatment cannot be either discontinued or switched to a different medication prior to&#xD;
             first day of study treatment. The washout period for the medication is provided in the&#xD;
             protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases who are neurologically unstable&#xD;

&#xD;
         18. Known EGFR C797S osimertinib resistance mutation, MET amplification, oncogenic fusion&#xD;
             involving NTRK, RET, ALK, ROS-1, or BRAF, BRAF V600E, or oncogenic KRAS mutation&#xD;
             determined by CLIA-approved test on osimertinib resistance biopsy or cell-free DNA&#xD;
             test performed at osimertinib resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria (Cohort B): Must meet exclusion criteria 1-16 above in addition to the&#xD;
        following:&#xD;
