    <textblock>
      Voice plays a crucial role in human communication and function. Voice production is&#xD;
      multidimensional, involving physiologic, biomechanical, and aerodynamic mechanisms that&#xD;
      produce an acoustic output that is perceived by the auditory system. So its important to&#xD;
      evaluate patients with voice disorders, whenever possible, to characterize the impact of the&#xD;
      disorder(s) on all of the pertinent mechanisms/dimensions.&#xD;

      Voice changes due to laryngeal dysfunction after thyroid surgery are very common&#xD;
      complication. However, very few data in the literatures are available which highlights the&#xD;
      impact of thyroidectomy and effects of factors, such as patient age, sex, operation type,&#xD;
      surgeons experience, laryngeal nerve injury and orotracheal intubation on voice of patients&#xD;
      undergoing thyroid surgery. Prabhat AK et al. 2018 reported that, In majority of cases voice&#xD;
      changes are transient. The voice recovery time ranges from less than one-month up to 6 months&#xD;
      in majority of cases. Transient voice changes, such as voice fatique, and voice weakness or&#xD;
      dysphonia are more common and can happen in most of the cases. The transient voice changes&#xD;
      usually occurs because one or more of the nerves are irritated either by moving them out of&#xD;
      the way during the dissection of thyroid gland or because of the inflammation or oedema that&#xD;
      happens after the thyroid surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the indices of success in thyroid surgery is the frequency of complications. The most&#xD;
      frequent postoperative complications following thyroidectomy are hypocalcemia and airway&#xD;
      complications. These are life threatening and have a significant impact on quality of life .&#xD;
      Airway complications may result from postoperative haematoma, vocal cord paralysis, laryngeal&#xD;
      oedema, and tracheomalacia .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (RLNP) is a rare but potentially catastrophic complication of&#xD;
      thyroid surgery. Damage to a recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) with resultant paralysis of the&#xD;
      sole abducting muscle (posterior cricoarytenoid) of the vocal folds can cause symptoms&#xD;
      ranging from hoarseness in unilateral lesions to stridor and acute airway obstruction in&#xD;
      bilateral damage. RLNP following thyroid surgery is one of the leading reasons for&#xD;
      medico-legal litigation against surgeons .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injury of the laryngeal nerves may not be the only cause of voice changes. Other possible&#xD;
      causes include injury of the prethyroid strap muscles and cricothyroid muscles or impairment&#xD;
      of laryngotracheal movement due to wound contracture after surgical trauma of the soft&#xD;
      tissues. A delicate surgical technique may prevent such complications, but it remains to be&#xD;
      clarified whether voice alterations may occur after thyroidectomy without any laryngeal nerve&#xD;
      injury. Computerized acoustic analysis of the patients undergoing thyroidectomy without&#xD;
      laryngeal nerve injury may help determine possible voice changes objectively .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysphagia is a typical symptom experinced preoperatively by patients with enlarged thyroid&#xD;
      due to a direct compression of the swallowing organs. In these patients, uncomplicated&#xD;
      thyroidectomy often leads to improvements in perceptions of swallowing function. However&#xD;
      impaired swallowing and neck strangling frequently occur postoperatively. Intraoperative&#xD;
      nerve injury regularly causes postoperative dysphagia, but dysphagia is also complained of&#xD;
      after uncomplicated thyroidectomies. These symptoms are usually dismissed by the clinicians&#xD;
      or attributed to orotracheal intubation. In many patients, correlations for these swallowing&#xD;
      disorders cannot be found in objective test results. Reasons for dysphagia and esophageal&#xD;
      motility changes after uncomplicated thyroidectomy could be injury of the perithyroidal&#xD;
      neural plexus, changes in the laryngeal vascular supply, postoperative adhesions, decreased&#xD;
      pressure of the upper esophageal sphincter, or changed position after thyroidectomy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigate non neurogenic causes of vocal and swallowing changes following thyroid surgery:&#xD;
      Vocal cord immobility (VCI) is defined as various spectrum of motion impairment in the vocal&#xD;
      cord. Although hoarseness is the main symptom in VCI, dysphonia, odynophonia, dysphagia,&#xD;
      chronic cough, and laryngospasm can also occur. Visual inspection by a laryngoscopy and&#xD;
      electrophysiologic study, such as laryngeal electromyography (LEMG) can help to differentiate&#xD;
      the neurogenic and non-neurogenic causes of VCI. The LEMG technique was first introduced by&#xD;
      Weddel et al., and needle electrode insertion in small muscles of larynx with assistance of&#xD;
      laryngoscopy or in-surgery was first reported in 1950s, followed by the standardized&#xD;
      percutaneous electrode insertion technique. LEMG is not only helpful in diagnosing&#xD;
      neuromuscular disorder in the larynx, but it can also be used in botulinum toxin or&#xD;
      hyaluronic acid injection in vocal cord. In the process of first diagnosing VCI, various&#xD;
      systemic diseases can be suspected from the symptoms. Viral or bacterial infections can&#xD;
      attribute to post-infectious neuropathies and a wide spectrum of malignancies or tumors&#xD;
      present as a paralysis. Also, VCI can be seen in systematic neurologic diseases such as&#xD;
      myasthenia gravis, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and multiple sclerosis. With LEMG results, it&#xD;
      aids to select other diagnostic tests and determine timing and type of treatments.&#xD;
      Furthermore, LEMG results are useful in predicting negative outcomes and their findings can&#xD;
      alter definitive treatments. It is important to diagnose VCI of neurogenic causes and to&#xD;
      affect treatment and prognosis. However, there are few research studies regarding the&#xD;
      association between the clinical characteristics in VCI and LEMG results .&#xD;
