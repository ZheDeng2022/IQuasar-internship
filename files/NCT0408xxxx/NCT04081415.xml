  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (FPIES) is a non IgE-mediated allergy, presenting&#xD;
      with vomiting, and may be complicated by hypovolemic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of FPIES is not well characterized and there is no biological marker&#xD;
      confirming the diagnosis or predicting recovery. Gut microbiota in IgE-mediated allergy is&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory and the addition of pro- or prebiotics can accelerate healing. Microbiota of&#xD;
      patients with FPIES have never been studied yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this work is therefore to analyse longitudinally the gut microbiota of patients&#xD;
      with FPIES, before and after healing, in order to predict the recovery from FPIES. The&#xD;
      cutaneous and salivary microbiota will also be analysed at the same time, in order to look&#xD;
      for a correlation between these three microbiota.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1.1 Current state of knowledge Food Protein- Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (FPIES) is a food&#xD;
      allergy with a prevalence of 0.34% and an incidence of 15.4 children per 100,000 per year. It&#xD;
      is a non-IgE-mediated allergy, manifested by vomiting 1 to 4 hours after ingestion of the&#xD;
      suspect food (major criteria), without any skin or respiratory manifestations. According to&#xD;
      the last definition (JACI 2017), at least 3 minor criteria should be required associated with&#xD;
      vomiting among the following: a second similar episode of vomiting after ingestion of the&#xD;
      same food, the appearance of repeated vomiting 1 to 4 hours after ingestion of another food,&#xD;
      lethargy, pronounced pallor, the need for emergency treatment or intravenous rehydration&#xD;
      after ingestion of a suspect food, the onset of diarrhea within 24 hours, hypotension, or&#xD;
      hypothermia at the time of reaction. The most frequently responsible foods for PFIES are&#xD;
      cow's milk, cereals, soy and fish. The triggers depend on the country, probably in relation&#xD;
      to eating habits. The median tolerant age is later than in the other forms of&#xD;
      non-IgE-mediated allergy, namely between the age of 3 to 5 years and it is later for solid&#xD;
      foods than liquid foods. The average age of acquiring tolerance for cow's milk varies in the&#xD;
      literature, around 8-10 months in Korea, around 1 year in Israel, around 5 years in the&#xD;
      United States, but much later (14 years) if specific IgE occurs during follow-up. There is no&#xD;
      data in France on the curing age of SEIPA in cow's milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first reintroduction of the responsible food is proposed at the age of 12-18 months if the&#xD;
      diagnosis was made during the first months of life, and if specific IgE are negative&#xD;
      according to the latest recommendations. Failure of the oral food challenge (OFC), a new OFC&#xD;
      is proposed every 6 months until healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the specific IgE are positive, it is then an atypical FPIES, and the methods of&#xD;
      reintroduction of the food will depend on the evolution of IgE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The link between microbiota and development of allergic diseases is now well known. The&#xD;
      intestinal microbiota varies in terms of diversity and bacterial distribution in patients&#xD;
      with food allergies compared to non-allergic patients. The microbiota plays an early role in&#xD;
      the development of the immune system, and therefore in the development or prevention of food&#xD;
      allergies involving the pro-inflammatory and pro-allergic Th17 pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intestinal microbiota is evaluated by bacterial diversity using RNA16 sequencing, in&#xD;
      particular alpha-diversity (specific to a sample), and beta-diversity (comparison between&#xD;
      several samples), bacterial richness, and by the determination of bacterial metabolites such&#xD;
      as short-chain fatty acids, such as butyrates, the measurement of fecal calprotectin, IgA,&#xD;
      and cytokines excreted in stool (eg β-defensin, TNF-α, cationic protein of eosinophils : ECP)&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certain bacterial species would tend to be predominant in case of allergy or allergic&#xD;
      sensitization, as for example certain species of Clostridium and others would play a&#xD;
      protective role by promoting the synthesis of certain short chain fatty acids, and by&#xD;
      decreasing the production of IL12, IFNγ, and IL10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of FPIES is currently poorly understood because there is no biological&#xD;
      marker to confirm the diagnosis or predict cure. There would be reversible jejunal partial&#xD;
      villous atrophy associated with non-specific inflammation in the ileum and colon but&#xD;
      digestive endoscopy is not performed in routine practice for diagnosis. In contrast to&#xD;
      IgE-mediated allergies, Th2 cytokines are not increased in patients with FPIES. Several hours&#xD;
      after exposure to the responsible food, an increase in eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) is&#xD;
      observed in stool. Gastrointestinal inflammation associated with food allergies can also be&#xD;
      studied using the fecal calprotectin or fecal lactate. This digestive inflammation could be&#xD;
      associated with an increase in intestinal permeability, and be responsible for vomiting,&#xD;
      diarrhea and hypovolemic shock by immunological reaction. If fecal calprotectin is less than&#xD;
      138 μg/g of stool, the diagnosis of FPIES could be excluded. These preliminary results&#xD;
      suggest an alteration of the gut microbiota, as observed in other forms of food allergies,&#xD;
      but the microbiota of patients with FPIES has never been studied to date to our knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our work will then constitute the first prospective study in children with FPIES linking the&#xD;
      presentation and the clinical evolution with the fecal, salivary and cutaneous microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The descriptive clinical part will determine the age at diagnosis and the age of cure based&#xD;
      on the foods in our cohort. The investigator will describe the different minor criteria for&#xD;
      diagnosis, and the associated symptoms that may be diagnostic elements not appearing in the&#xD;
      2017 international consensus. The investigator will assess the risk of IgE seroconversion&#xD;
      during follow-up. The investigator will examine the biological elements during an allergic&#xD;
      reaction to assess the severity of the reactions (polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocytosis,&#xD;
      methaemoglobinemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main hypothesis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the microbiota of allergic patients with FPIES is pro-inflammatory, as in other food&#xD;
      allergies, bacterial composition and distribution depending on the course of the disease,&#xD;
      with a return to a less inflammatory state once tolerance has been acquired should be&#xD;
      observed. A change in these results would thus make it possible to propose prognostic markers&#xD;
      of evolution of this pathology and to predict the cure of the patient, without having to&#xD;
      carry out a reintroduction test of the responsible food, which can be potentially dangerous&#xD;
      with risk of hypovolemic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Description of the population to be studied and justification of their choice The study&#xD;
      population is pediatric, less than 18 years old, mainly infants, with clinical arguments in&#xD;
      favor of FPIES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FPIES is mostly described in children's literature, and remains little known to adult&#xD;
      physicians with an underdiagnosed allergic condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for IgE-mediated allergies, the therapeutic goal is to achieve tolerance to the&#xD;
      responsible food from the pediatric age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Description of the elements covered by the study The pathophysiology of FPIES is poorly&#xD;
      understood, but the symptoms are primarily digestive. The goal is to study the intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota of patients, to seek a difference in diversity or distribution of bacterial&#xD;
      populations and their metabolites in patients with a FPIES over time, if possible at 3 times&#xD;
      of the evolution of SEIPA, namely before healing, within 24 hours after exposure to the&#xD;
      allergen responsible, and after healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The different communities of microorganisms that populate our body interact and form a&#xD;
      biological entity called holobionte. Cutaneous and digestive microbiota are linked to the&#xD;
      immune system responsible for atopic disease. This is why the investigators also want to&#xD;
      study the salivary microbiota, as well as the cutaneous microbiota, using non-invasive&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Rationale for the duration of the study The intestinal microbiota will be at INRA&#xD;
      laboratory, in Jouy-en-Josas. The various samples will be frozen for analysis at the INRA&#xD;
      laboratory in Jouy-en-Josas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microbiota will be collected at different times during the natural evolution of FPIES, in&#xD;
      order to answer the hypothesis of a modification of the intestinal microbiota during the&#xD;
      natural evolution of FPIES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the research will be 4 years, in order to collect stool samples, saliva&#xD;
      and skin swabs, in at least half of our followed cohort, because patients will likely have&#xD;
      reached the median age of healing, which is around 3-5 years of age for milk, which is the&#xD;
      major contributor to allergies in our cohort (52%).&#xD;

      Stool The required volume is about 1g, or 1 mL per pot. The first sample will be lyophilized&#xD;
      in the functional coprology laboratory of Prof. Kapel, and will be study at INRA for&#xD;
      bacterial distribution and diversity by sequencing 16S ribosomal bacterial RNAs (16S rRNA) as&#xD;
      well as the dosage of short chain fatty acids, such as butyrate. The second sample will allow&#xD;
      the determination of protein in stool, such as fecal calprotectin, ECP, EDN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva Collection of a volume of at least 250 μL, before and after the FPIES healing. Skin&#xD;
      swab The cutaneous microbiota will be collected using 4 sterile cotton swabs in the&#xD;
      ante-ulnar trough, back, nostril, and the plantar arch (according to Grice et al).Then the&#xD;
      rRNA16s will be extracted, amplified and sequenced to study the richness and diversity of the&#xD;
      microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fecal, cutaneous and salivary microbiota will be collected again 1 to 6 months after the&#xD;
      success of the last OFC, during a follow-up consultation at the hospital.&#xD;
