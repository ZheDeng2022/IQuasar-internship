  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will test the feasibility and acceptability of an enhanced individual-level&#xD;
      intervention delivered to 4th-6th graders to increase rates of walking to/from school. Up to&#xD;
      8 youth who do not already walk to school will be enrolled into the intervention. The&#xD;
      theoretically-based intervention content will be delivered over 6 weeks through family-based&#xD;
      telephone coaching sessions, ongoing short message service (SMS) text messaging, and&#xD;
      activities and content on the study website.&#xD;

    <description>Acceptability and preferences related to intervention content will be measured using a questionnaire developed for this study (&quot;satisfaction questionnaire&quot;). Both parent and child will respond to 5 items asking about satisfaction with the intervention components. Items are rated on a 10-pt scale, with higher values indicating greater satisfaction. Parent and child will respond to two additional open-ended questions asking which aspects of the intervention they liked most and least. These qualitative items will be summarized.</description>
