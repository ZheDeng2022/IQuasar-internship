  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label study of intravesical Toca 511 followed by oral&#xD;
      Toca FC in patients with high grade (HG) non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), with&#xD;
      cohort expansion at the recommended Phase 2 dose. Patients with recurrent HG NMIBC who are&#xD;
      undergoing planned transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) will be enrolled into the&#xD;
      study, subject to meeting all entry criteria.&#xD;

    <description>Doses of Toca 511 will be evaluated in sequential cohorts. Toca 511 will be administered as a single intravesical instillation. Following Toca 511 administration, Toca FC will be administered orally at a dose of 220 mg/kg/day for 7 days every 6 weeks.</description>

    <description>Toca 511 consists of a purified retroviral replicating vector encoding a modified yeast cytosine deaminase (CD) gene. The CD gene converts the antifungal drug, flucytosine (5-fluorocytosine; 5-FC) to the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in cancer cells that have been infected by the Toca 511 vector.</description>
