  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TARA is a Digital Behaviour Change Intervention (DBCI) for individuals with Chronic&#xD;
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)(IwCOPD), which has been designed using a Human-Centred&#xD;
      Design (HCD) methodology. HCD involves, among other elements, members of the target audience&#xD;
      in evaluations at multiple stages within the design process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility study is primarily designed to assess the acceptability of the DBCI test&#xD;
      asset to the target audience. Acceptability as defined for the purpose of this study includes&#xD;
      usability of the system, and perceived value and desirability to the end-user audience. As&#xD;
      such, engagement in this context is deemed to mean the degree to which the test asset&#xD;
      provides a usable, acceptable, desirable and valuable experience to its users during a&#xD;
      time-limited trial.&#xD;
