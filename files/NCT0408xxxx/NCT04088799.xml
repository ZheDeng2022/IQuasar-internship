  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease&#xD;
      (ESRD) in adolescents. The refractory nature of FSGS and a more than 30% recurrence rate&#xD;
      after kidney transplantation renders treatment of FSGS one of the most difficult challenges&#xD;
      in pediatric nephrology. A significant knowledge gap in understanding the mechanism of FSGS&#xD;
      treatment resistance and progression hampers development of successful treatment strategies.&#xD;
      Beneficial effect of removal of low-density lipoproteins by LDL-apheresis indicates that&#xD;
      lipids contribute to progression in FSGS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test the hypothesis that removal of Lp-PLA2 and lipid metabolites by&#xD;
      LDL-apheresis ameliorates proteinuria and cardiovascular comorbidities. Patients with FSGS&#xD;
      and FSGS recurrence after kidney transplantation receiving LDL-apheresis as part of standard&#xD;
      of care will be enrolled to the study. Pre-and post serum and effluent concentrations of LPC,&#xD;
      free FA, Lp-PLA2, oxidized LDL, fasting lipid profile, interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis&#xD;
      factor (TNF)-α, and IL-1β will be monitored in patients undergoing LDL-apheresis.&#xD;
      Investigators will also study the impact of LDL-apheresis on cardiovascular and clinical&#xD;
      comorbidities by monitoring degree of proteinuria, blood pressures and arterial stiffness&#xD;
      index.&#xD;

      Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease&#xD;
      (ESRD) in adolescents. The refractory nature of FSGS and a more than 30% recurrence rate&#xD;
      after kidney transplantation renders treatment of FSGS one of the most difficult challenges&#xD;
      in pediatric nephrology. A significant knowledge gap in understanding the mechanism of FSGS&#xD;
      treatment resistance and progression hampers development of successful treatment strategies.&#xD;
      Beneficial effect of removal of low-density lipoproteins by LDL-apheresis indicates that&#xD;
      lipids contribute to progression in FSGS. We have previously reported increased urinary fatty&#xD;
      acids (FA) and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC) levels with non-targeted urinary lipidomic&#xD;
      analysis in children with FSGS. Unregulated phospholipase A2(PLA2) activity causes an&#xD;
      increase in intracellular concentrations of free FA and LPC altering plasma membrane and&#xD;
      mitochondrial permeability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipoprotein associated PLA2 is a biomarker involved in oxidative modification of LDL by&#xD;
      hydrolyzing oxidative lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC) and oxidized free fatty acids (FFA) both&#xD;
      of which are proinflammatory and atherogenic. Lp-PLA2 is efficiently removed by&#xD;
      LDL-apheresis. The investigators hypothesize that LDL-apheresis ameliorates cellular injury&#xD;
      and vascular changes by removing circulating Lp-PLA2, oxidized LDL, LPC, FA and cytokines in&#xD;
      FSGS. In this proposal, the hypothesis that removal of Lp-PLA2 and lipid metabolites by&#xD;
      LDL-apheresis ameliorates proteinuria and cardiovascular comorbidities will be tested.&#xD;
      Patients with FSGS and FSGS recurrence after kidney transplantation receiving LDL-apheresis&#xD;
      as part of standard of care will be enrolled to the study. Investigators will monitor pre-and&#xD;
      post serum and effluent concentrations of LPC, free FA, Lp-PLA2, oxidized LDL, fasting lipid&#xD;
      profile, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β of patients undergoing LDL-apheresis. The impact of&#xD;
      LDL-apheresis on cardiovascular and clinical comorbidities by monitoring degree of&#xD;
      proteinuria, blood pressures and arterial stiffness index will also be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose that LDL-apheresis as a conjunct therapy to standard treatment&#xD;
      regimens is an efficient way to ameliorate progression prevent comorbidities such as systemic&#xD;
      inflammation and lipid induced vascular changes thus progression in FSGS. Furthermore,&#xD;
      removal of Lp-PLA2 and other lipids by LDL-apheresis can limit the direct toxicity caused by&#xD;
      lipid metabolites to podocytes and proximal tubule epithelial cells. The investigators&#xD;
      believe that this proposal will enhance understanding of lipid-mediated progression in FSGS&#xD;
      and will delineate the role of LDL-apheresis as part of established treatment in treatment of&#xD;
      FSGS.&#xD;
