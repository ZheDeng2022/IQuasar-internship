  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to compare two different interproximal devices, water&#xD;
      flosser and dental floss around implants in several clinical parameters&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was a randomized, controlled clinical trial in a single center. All clinical&#xD;
      measurements were taken by a single blinded investigator (Periodontal Resident) while a&#xD;
      single dental hygienist was responsible for prophylaxis and delivery of oral hygiene&#xD;
      instructions to the study participants. At each appointment 5 clinical parameters were&#xD;
      recorded: Full Mouth Plaque Score (FMPS) and Quigley-Hein plaque index (QHI) of the implants&#xD;
      after the use of a disclosing solution, Probing Depth (PD), Bleeding on Probing (BOP) of the&#xD;
      study implants recorded at 6 sites (distobuccal, mid-buccal, mesiobuccal, distolingual,&#xD;
      mid-lingual and mesiolingual) using a UNC 12 Colorvue probe and the width of the keratinized&#xD;
      tissue (KT) at the buccal surface of the study implants. Randomization between the 2 groups&#xD;
      was achieved using computerized randomization scheme&#xD;
      (https://en.calc-site.com/randoms/grouping).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A (control): patients were instructed to floss with TePe Bridge and Implant Floss once&#xD;
      a day, preferably at nighttime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B (test): patients were provided with Waterpik Water Flosser and instructed to water&#xD;
      floss around the implant once a day, preferably at nighttime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each appointment the study investigator measured clinical parameters and participants&#xD;
      received oral hygiene instructions (OHI) and supportive periodontal therapy (SPT) by a single&#xD;
      dental hygienist. Once the study was concluded patients were asked to fill-out a 2 question&#xD;
      questionnaire inquiring how much they liked their interproximal device and how easy it was to&#xD;
      be used in a scale 1 to 5.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in BOP (bleeding on probing) index around dental implants</measure>
    <time_frame>All participants have been seen at baseline, follow-up 1 (interval ranging between 3 to 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>to determine the effectiveness of a waterfloss system compared to flossing in changing the bleeding on probing (BOP) index around dental implants. BOP is a sign of inflammation and is recorded as yes/no (yes for bleeding, no for absence of bleeding). BOP is a percentage calculated by dividing the number of bleeding sites divided by the total number of sites of each implant. A lower percentage indicates lower inflammation</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Full Mouth Plaque Score (FMPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>All participants have been seen at baseline, follow-up 1 (interval ranging between 3 to 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>to determine the differences between water flosser compared to flossing in changing the Full Mouth Plaque Score (FMPS). FMPS is a percentage calculated by dividing the number of plaque containing surfaces divided by the total number of available surfaces of each tooth/implant. A lower percentage indicates lower total plaque and means better plaque control</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quigley-Hein plaque index (QHI) around dental implants</measure>
    <time_frame>All participants have been seen at baseline, follow-up 1 (interval ranging between 3 to 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>to determine the differences of a waterfloss system compared to flossing in (QHI) around dental implants. Quigley-Hein plaque index (QHI) is a scale 0 to 5.&#xD;
0 no plaque.&#xD;
separate flecks of plaque at the cervical margin of the tooth.&#xD;
a thin continuous band of plaque (up to one mm) at the cervical margin of the tooth.&#xD;
a band of plaque wider than one mm but covering less than one-third of the crown of the tooth.&#xD;
plaque covering at least one-third but less than two-thirds of the crown of the tooth.&#xD;
plaque covering two-thirds or more of the crown of the tooth.&#xD;
A lower number indicates better plaque control.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>keratinized tissue (KT) around dental implants</measure>
    <time_frame>All participants have been seen at baseline, follow-up 1 (interval ranging between 3 to 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>to evaluate the differences of a waterfloss system compared to flossing in the width of keratinized tissue (KT) around dental implants. KT is the stratified, squamous epithelium, that lines the vestibular and oral surfaces of the gingiva.</description>

    <measure>Probing Depth (PD) around dental implants</measure>
    <time_frame>All participants have been seen at baseline, follow-up 1 (interval ranging between 3 to 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>to evaluate the differences of a waterfloss system compared to flossing in Probing Depth (PD) around dental implants. PD is the measurement of the depth of a sulcus by measuring in millimeters the distance from a gingival margin to the base of the sulcus with a calibrated periodontal probe.</description>
