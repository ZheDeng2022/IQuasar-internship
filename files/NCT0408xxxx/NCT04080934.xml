  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following surgery and treatment for breast cancer, many patients experience swelling of lymph&#xD;
      nodes (lymphedema) or accumulation of fluid (seroma) that can cause pain, restrict movement,&#xD;
      and reduce quality of life. Current treatments include massage, pressure dressings, and&#xD;
      drainage, but these are often ineffective and do not last. Physical activity, in particular&#xD;
      swimming, has been linked to improvement in lymphedema/seroma symptoms, but more research is&#xD;
      required to determine whether or not this type of treatment is effective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2016, an estimated 25,700 Canadian women were diagnosed with breast cancer. With advances&#xD;
      in detection, management and treatment, the 5-year relative survival has improved to 87%.&#xD;
      Consequently, breast cancer survivors represent a significant proportion of Canadian society.&#xD;
      Research suggests that 30-60 % of women with breast cancer will experience some form of arm&#xD;
      morbidity between 6 months and 3 years after breast cancer. Both lymphedema and seroma can&#xD;
      cause substantial discomfort, chronic pain, mobility issues, and psychological distress, such&#xD;
      as social isolation, anxiety and depression. The current treatment for seroma and lymphedema&#xD;
      is drainage, massage, and the use of compression dressings, but these can be ineffective and&#xD;
      costly and the effects of the treatment do not last over time. This project will provide&#xD;
      crucial knowledge regarding the utility of a simple, swimming based exercise regimen&#xD;
      involving the breaststroke in reducing chronic pain related to post-surgical lymphedema or&#xD;
      seroma in breast cancer patients. The breaststroke uses a full range of motion in the water,&#xD;
      with the water creating a pressure back onto the seroma/damaged tissues. This study will be a&#xD;
      randomized, two-arm, pilot study. Patients allocated to the swimming group will participate&#xD;
      in 8 weeks of the swimming program, which involves three weekly swimming sessions of 30&#xD;
      minutes minimum. The control group will include patients who receive standard of care. This&#xD;
      includes the recommendation to undertake exercise and physiotherapy; however, no formal&#xD;
      exercise program will be provided. Breast cancer survivors represent a significant proportion&#xD;
      of Canadian society, with most recent data suggesting that at least 157,000 Canadian women&#xD;
      who had a breast cancer diagnosis in 1999 were still living. Many of these women still suffer&#xD;
      from long term complications of their cancer and its treatment. Given the high prevalence of&#xD;
      chronic pain in breast cancer survivors, it is unsurprising that the use of pain medications&#xD;
      is prevalent as well. A recent U.S. analysis of 10,000 breast cancer patients treated with&#xD;
      adjuvant endocrine therapy demonstrated a 56.9% crude probability of opioid use. Within the&#xD;
      context of the current opioid crisis in North America, the opportunity to reduce pain and the&#xD;
      need for pain medication is absolutely critical.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome will be pain as assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS scale is a 100mm-long horizontal line with the word &quot;no pain&quot; at one end and &quot;pain as bad as it can be&quot; at the other. This will be pain levels of patients after the swimming program in comparison with the control group who will receive no swimming program.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible participants include adult female patients, 18 years of age or higher, from&#xD;
             the Ottawa Hospital who are post-operative from a lumpectomy or a mastectomy with or&#xD;
             without full axillary dissection and radiation. They will be less than 3 years from&#xD;
             completion of their acute cancer treatment. Study subjects must have pain symptoms&#xD;
             related to chest wall pain and/or arm morbidity, seroma or lymphedema. They must have&#xD;
             approval from their medical and radiation oncologist to participate in the study upon&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with ongoing medical problems where swimming would be contraindicated will be&#xD;
             excluded from this study. Those who swam on a regular basis prior to their breast&#xD;
             cancer diagnosis will be excluded from the study, as well as those who cannot swim,&#xD;
             due to safety concerns and limited resources/time required to complete more in-depth&#xD;
             swimming instruction.&#xD;
