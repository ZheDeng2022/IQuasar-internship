    <textblock>
      CC-95775-ST-001 is an open-label, Phase 1B, dose escalation and expansion study of CC-95775&#xD;
      in subjects with advanced or unresectable solid tumors, including laBCC, and relapsed/&#xD;
      refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The dose escalation part (Part A) of the study will&#xD;
      explore escalating oral doses of CC-95775 administered on a 4d on/24d off schedule to&#xD;
      estimate the MTD of CC-95775. A mTPI-2 will help guide CC-95775 dose escalation decisions&#xD;
      with the final decisions made by an SRC. Approximately 20 subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expansion cohort (Part B) will evaluate the safety, PK, PD safety and preliminary&#xD;
      activity of CC-95775 in advanced solid tumors, including laBCC. Approximately 20 subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled.&#xD;

                  abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and&#xD;
                  withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception). Highly effective&#xD;
                  contraceptive methods are combined (containing estrogen and progestogen) or&#xD;
                  progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation&#xD;

                  effective birth control method provided that partner is the sole sexual partner&#xD;
                  of the FCBP trial participant and that the vasectomized partner has received&#xD;
                  medical assessment of the surgical success). Barrier methods are male or female&#xD;
                  latex or synthetic condom, diaphragm, cervical cap or sponge with spermicide,&#xD;
                  barrier contraceptive with spermicide. These measures should be used from signing&#xD;
                  the ICF, throughout the study, and for up to 44 days following the last dose of&#xD;
                  CC-95775.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  A negative serum pregnancy test (or Î²-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  A negative serum or urine pregnancy test (or Î²-subunit of human chorionic&#xD;
                  gonadotropin (Î²-hCG pregnancy test) on Day 1 of dosing verified by the&#xD;
                  Investigator prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the course of the study, and after the&#xD;
                  end of study treatment. This applies even if the subject practices true&#xD;
                  abstinence from heterosexual contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Male subjects must practice true abstinence (which must be reviewed on a monthly&#xD;
             basis) or agree to use a condom (a latex or non-latex synthetic condom is required)&#xD;
             during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a FCBP and will avoid conceiving from&#xD;
             signing the ICF, while participating in the study, during dose interruptions, and for&#xD;
             at least 104 days following CC-95775 discontinuation, even if he has undergone a&#xD;
             successful vasectomy. True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the&#xD;
             preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject [female partner's periodic abstinence&#xD;
             (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are&#xD;
             not acceptable methods of contraception].&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Males must agree not to donate semen or sperm for at least 104 days following&#xD;
                  CC-95775 discontinuation.&#xD;
