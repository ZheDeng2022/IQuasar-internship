  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer ranks as the fifth most common and the third most common cause of cancer&#xD;
      deaths in the world. In spite of the progresses made in the diagnosis and treatment of&#xD;
      gastric cancer in the past decades, the prognosis is still unsatisfied mainly due to&#xD;
      recurrence and distant metastasis. Surgical treatment is the first choice for the treatment&#xD;
      of early gastric cancer, but it is prone to recurrence and metastasis after surgery. There&#xD;
      are relatively few chemotherapy drugs for gastric cancer. Studies have shown that about 13%&#xD;
      of gastric cancers have HER2 gene amplification, and there are no other known driver gene&#xD;
      other than HER-2. At present, the targeted therapeutic drugs approved for gastric cancer in&#xD;
      China are only trastuzumab and apatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune checkpoint inhibitors, including PD-1 inhibitors, PD-L1 inhibitors and CTLA-4&#xD;
      inhibitors, have achieved significant therapeutic effects in a variety of tumors and are&#xD;
      expected to alter the current state of treatment of tumors. In gastric cancer, the&#xD;
      KEYNOTE-012 study demonstated the efficacy of Pembrolizumab in patients with PD-L1 positive&#xD;
      advanced gastric cancer. The study showed that 53% of patients had tumor retraction, and 22%&#xD;
      achieved partial imaging remission with a median duration of 40 weeks. At the same time,&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is also less toxic than standard second-line chemotherapy. However, Are the&#xD;
      Immune checkpoint inhibitors should be used as single-drug or in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy? Are the Immune checkpoint inhibitors should be used in the first-line or in the&#xD;
      back-line? And which is the best combination therapy? For these issues, there is no&#xD;
      conclusion yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study included all patients with gastric cancer who used Immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors in clinical practice, regardless of treatment lines and combination with different&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Through follow-up observations, the aim of this study is to analyze the&#xD;
      efficacy of Immune checkpoint inhibitors for gastric cancer in the real world, and to explore&#xD;
      the differences in the efficacy of Immune checkpoint inhibitors in different stages of&#xD;
      treatment, as well as the efficacy of different chemotherapy combinations, so as to provide&#xD;
      clinical evidence for the use of immunotherapy for advanced gastric cancer.&#xD;

        A total of 170 patients with advanced gastric cancer were enrolled. Patients need to be&#xD;
        treated with immunocheckpoint inhibitors or immunocheckpoint inhibitors in combination with&#xD;
        chemotherapy. 10ml of edta-anticoagulant blood was collected before the first treatment of&#xD;
        the enrolled patients, and the blood samples were gently reversed in the anticoagulant tube&#xD;
        for several times to fully anticoagulate. The upper plasma and the lower blood cells were&#xD;
        centrifuged at 1800g for 10 min within 4 hours, respectively, and stored at -80 â„ƒ for later&#xD;
        use and provide 10-15 tumor tissue white sheets.&#xD;
