  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the implications of providing remote physician care to home hospitalized&#xD;
      patients compared to usual home hospital care with in-person/in-home physician visits.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Home hospital care is hospital-level care at home for acutely ill patients. In multiple&#xD;
      publications, home hospital care delivered cost-effective, high-quality, excellent experience&#xD;
      care with similar quality and safety as traditional hospital care. Most home hospital models&#xD;
      require a licensed independent practitioner to see their patients physically in their home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further improve the efficiency and scalability of home hospital care, the investigators&#xD;
      propose to test remote care, where the physician would provide care via a video interaction,&#xD;
      instead of in-home/in-person care. The investigators propose a non-inferiority evaluation of&#xD;
      this intervention.&#xD;
