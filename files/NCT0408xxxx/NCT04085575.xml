      Tranexamic acid an antifibrinolytic that develops its anti-haemorrhagic action by inhibiting&#xD;
      fibrinolytic activities of plasmin and many studies confirms its effectiveness in decreasing&#xD;
      blood loss. The aim of this study was to observe postoperative bleeding with combined&#xD;
      intravenous and per - os administration with two intra - articular doses (1 g and 2 g) of&#xD;
      tranexamic acid in adult patients undergoing unilateral total knee replacement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is widely used as an effective treatment for end-stage&#xD;
      osteoarthritis and other joint diseases of the knee and it improvements in surgical materials&#xD;
      and techniques have greatly increased its effectiveness. However, TKA is an orthopaedic&#xD;
      surgical method that has a substantial perioperative blood loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classical methods for reducing blood loss and transfusion rate include the use of a pneumatic&#xD;
      tourniquet, intraoperative cell saver, hypotensive anesthesia, application of erythropoietin,&#xD;
      autologous blood transfusion, plugging of the femoral canal, cementing, drain clamping,&#xD;
      navigation and minimally invasive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tranexamic acid (TXA) an antifibrinolytic that develops its anti-haemorrhagic action by&#xD;
      inhibiting fibrinolytic activities of plasmin has been used as an adjuvant to such measure&#xD;
      and many studies with a level of evidence confirms its effectiveness in decreasing blood&#xD;
      loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibrinolysis is stimulated by surgical trauma blood loss and TKA may be related to increased&#xD;
      fibrinolytic activity. TXA inhibits fibrinolysis by blocking the lysine-binding sites of&#xD;
      plasminogen to fibrin. Plasmin, bound to tranexamic acid, has a considerably diminished&#xD;
      activity with respect to fibrin compared to that of free plasmin. Also, it appears from&#xD;
      various studies that, in vivo, tranexamic acid at high doses exerts a braking activity on the&#xD;
      activation of the complement system. So, TXA reduces bleeding in the TKA and its functional&#xD;
      repercussion has also been confirmed in assays for various dosages and routes of&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, efficacy of intra-articular TXA has also been confirmed, but what is the&#xD;
      right dosage is now unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to observe postoperative bleeding with combined intravenous and per&#xD;
      - os administration with two intra - articular doses (1 g and 2 g) of tranexamic acid&#xD;
      (Sanofi-Aventis® Gentilly, France).&#xD;
