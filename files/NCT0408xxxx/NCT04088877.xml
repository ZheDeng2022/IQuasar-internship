      The objectives of this pilot study are to determine the feasibility of a community-based&#xD;
      moderate intensity resistance exercise training (RET) program in combination with an art&#xD;
      sculpting class on body image in breast cancer survivors (BCS). The protocol will be&#xD;
      measuring recruitment; attendance; cost tracking; body image distress; body image&#xD;
      appreciation; and muscular strength. Participant feedback on the intervention will be&#xD;
      collected through a final focus group. Additionally, cognitive interviews will occur prior to&#xD;
      the intervention, where participants will be asked to &quot;think-out-loud&quot; as they answer the&#xD;
      Body Image Scale for Cancer questionnaire. The purpose of this interview technique is to gain&#xD;
      a deeper understanding of the participants' thought process behind choosing each answer. The&#xD;
      proposed pilot study will be a single prospective before and after study that will help&#xD;
      inform a future large-scale project. A minimum sample of 12 subjects will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Health Research Ethics Board of Alberta Cancer Committee will approve this study.&#xD;
      Participants will participate in RET biweekly for 12 weeks and the sculpting class weekly for&#xD;
      8 weeks. After the first week of RET, the art class will begin. Both the RET and sculpting&#xD;
      class will be between 1-2 hours in length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses: Quality of life, fitness testing and body image scales will be administered before&#xD;
      and after the intervention. Cognitive interviews will occur once before the intervention has&#xD;
      started and a final focus group will occur at the end of the intervention to get participant&#xD;
      feedback on the effectiveness of the program&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the third most frequently diagnosed cancer in Canada. Treatment of breast&#xD;
      cancer typically involves an initial surgery, followed by radiation, chemotherapy and&#xD;
      hormonal treatments. These treatments are invasive and may result in a visible change in a&#xD;
      survivor's physical appearance, which can lead to body image concerns, depression, and&#xD;
      psychological distress. Currently, many of the studies that address body image in breast&#xD;
      cancer use a biomedical model, often ignoring the need for incorporating behavioural and&#xD;
      psychosocial aspects of the construct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance exercise training (RET) holds promise as an intervention to help improve body&#xD;
      image among women in the general population. Art classes have been found to have a positive&#xD;
      impact on cancer survivors' psychological and spiritual well-being, quality of life, and&#xD;
      coping. To date, however, the evidence is limited regarding interdisciplinary approaches to&#xD;
      addressing body image in breast cancer. This study will examine the feasibility and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of combining a resistance exercise training program with a group art&#xD;
      sculpting class to address body image in breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of this project are: 1) To determine the feasibility and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of a RET program and art sculpting class on body image in breast cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) Determine if the Body Image Scale for Cancer (BIS) survey reflects the experiences breast&#xD;
      cancer survivors have with their body image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) Evaluate the patient experience through a final focus group This study will be a&#xD;
      prospective before and after pilot study with baseline measures that include: collection of&#xD;
      participant demographics, quality of life, baseline fitness tests, body image scales, and&#xD;
      cognitive interviews. After the intervention, the following measures will be collected:&#xD;
      quality of life, fitness tests, body image scales, recruitment/adherence data, and&#xD;
      intervention feedback through a final focus group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum sample of 12 subjects who previously attended the Alberta Cancer Exercise program&#xD;
      (ACE) in Edmonton will be recruited for this project. Subjects will be screened for&#xD;
      eligibility and if they meet all eligibility criteria, an information letter of the study&#xD;
      will be provided and they will be asked to contact the investigators if interested in taking&#xD;
      part in the study. All participant will be required to provide signed informed consent as per&#xD;
      the Health Research Ethics Board (HREB) of Alberta: Cancer Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will participate in a 12-week resistance exercise program, twice a week and an&#xD;
      Art Sculpting class for 8-weeks. From week 2 to 10 of the intervention, the group art&#xD;
      sculpting class take place once a week. Both the exercise and art classes will take place at&#xD;
      Wellspring Edmonton, a non-profit community center that provides supportive Wellness&#xD;
      programming for cancer survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RET: The participants will attend the exercise facility at Wellspring two times a week.&#xD;
      Sessions are completed under the supervision of an exercise physiologist and the duration of&#xD;
      each session ranges from 1.0 - 1.5 hours. Each session includes a warm up on an aerobic&#xD;
      exercise machine, a full body progressive RET program followed by balance and stretching&#xD;
      exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Art Sculpting Class: The sculpting program will take place once a week for 2 hours over an&#xD;
      8-week period. Sessions will be facilitated by an artist and registered psychologist who will&#xD;
      lead the group in art techniques and self-reflection, respectively. Each group session will&#xD;
      focus on a positive health theme related to body image, and the participants will have the&#xD;
      opportunity to reflect through their art and social interactions with one another.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Demographic and medical information will be presented using median and&#xD;
      range and percentage for interval and nominal data respectively. The primary analysis will&#xD;
      compare outcomes before and after the intervention with regard to body image perception from&#xD;
      the survey tools and the fitness testing results. This will meet the preliminary efficacy&#xD;
      objectives of the study; to determine whether the intervention demonstrates a trend towards&#xD;
      improved body image. Analyses of outcomes will be performed at the end of the intervention&#xD;
      using non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon signed rank). Point estimates and measures of&#xD;
      variability to inform future research will be calculated from parametric statistics using a&#xD;
      paired t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Analysis: Qualitative data will be collected at two separate time points - once,&#xD;
      through the cognitive interviewing of the BIS scale and the second through the focus group at&#xD;
      the end of the intervention. An abductive analytical approach using a semantic analysis from&#xD;
      Braun and Clarke (2006) will be used to understand the various participant perspectives and&#xD;
      contextualize the participants' experiences. The methodology used for the cognitive&#xD;
      interviewing will be interpretive description.&#xD;
