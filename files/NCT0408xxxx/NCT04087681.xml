  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect information from study participants who develop an&#xD;
      invasive disease caused by Extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) during a period of 12&#xD;
      months. This information will be used to support the development of a new vaccine to prevent&#xD;
      ExPEC infections.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Invasive ExPEC disease (IED) is defined as an acute illness consistent with bacterial&#xD;
      infection that is microbiologically confirmed by the isolation and identification of E. coli&#xD;
      from blood or other normally sterile body sites, or by the isolation and identification of E.&#xD;
      coli from urine in a patient with signs and symptoms of invasive disease and no other&#xD;
      identifiable source of infection. Adults aged 60 years or older have an increased risk of&#xD;
      developing IED. To date, there is no vaccine available to prevent IED. ExPEC10V is a 10&#xD;
      valent vaccine candidate in development by Janssen R&amp;D for the prevention of IED in adults&#xD;
      aged 60 years and older. A Phase 3 clinical study is planned to investigate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of this vaccine. To obtain insight in the feasibility and design of the Phase 3 study,&#xD;
      a pilot study is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study is a prospective, multicenter, observational study conducted in a maximum of&#xD;
      eight countries in Europe, North-America and Asia. Participant recruitment will be done in&#xD;
      primary care. In each participating country a local primary care network encompassing&#xD;
      approximately 40,000 persons and a local hospital, where patients are referred to in case of&#xD;
      a suspicion of IED, will participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Database screening at the primary care centers will be performed to identify and invite&#xD;
      potential eligible study participants. Upon consent, each study participant will be followed&#xD;
      for a period of maximum 12 months after enrollment in the study. At baseline, demographic&#xD;
      data and medical history data will be collected. During the follow-up period, any referral of&#xD;
      study participants to a hospital for any reason including IED will be collected. IED&#xD;
      identification and Medical Resource Utilization (MRU) during the follow-up period will be&#xD;
      performed by regular telephone calls with all study participants. At the end of the study,&#xD;
      the primary care files will also be checked for MRU. If a participant is diagnosed with IED&#xD;
      and admitted to the hospital, the following data will be collected: medical history and&#xD;
      treatment received 90 days prior to the IED, clinical and laboratory data, data on the&#xD;
      treatment and outcome of IED and data on MRU related to IED. Data will be collected on Day 1&#xD;
      of IED diagnosis (signs/ symptoms) and Day 28 after IED diagnosis.&#xD;

        The study population includes male and female participants aged 60 years or older in stable&#xD;
        health, preferably at increased risk for IED. A total of 6,000 study participants will be&#xD;
        recruited. At least 50% of the study participants will be healthy elderly aged 60 years or&#xD;
        older with a history of UTI in the previous ten years. The other 50% of participants will&#xD;
        be healthy elderly aged 60 years or older with no (known) history of UTI in the previous&#xD;
        ten years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Based on the clinical judgment of the investigator, participant must be in stable&#xD;
             health. Participants may have underlying illnesses such as hypertension, congestive&#xD;

             of the investigator, participation would not be in the best interest of the&#xD;
             participant (e.g. compromise well-being) or that could prevent, limit, or confound the&#xD;
             protocol-specified assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has history of malignancy within 5 years before screening (exceptions are&#xD;
             squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or&#xD;
             malignancy, which is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has had major psychiatric illness and/or drug or alcohol abuse which in&#xD;
             investigators opinion would compromise the participant's safety and/or compliance with&#xD;
             the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant who, in the opinion of the investigator, is unlikely to adhere to the&#xD;
             requirements of the study, or is unlikely to complete the full course of the study.&#xD;
