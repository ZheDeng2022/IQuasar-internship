  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects of atezolizumab, varlilumab, and radiation&#xD;
      therapy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places&#xD;
      in the body (advanced) and cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies such as atezolizumab may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Immunotherapy&#xD;
      with monoclonal antibodies such as varlilumab may induce changes in body?s immune system and&#xD;
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Radiation therapy uses high&#xD;
      energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving atezolizumab, varlilumab, and&#xD;
      radiation therapy may increase the amount of time the disease is not active or does not&#xD;
      spread to another part of the body.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of combined therapy with atezolizumab and varlilumab&#xD;
      in combination with radiation in adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) who have progressed on prior PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine objective response rate (excluding the irradiated lesion) of therapy with&#xD;
      atezolizumab and varlilumab in combination with radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate clinical benefit rate of the combination. III. To estimate median&#xD;
      progression-free survival of the combination. IV. To compare the frequency of immune-related&#xD;
      adverse events (irAEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive varlilumab intravenously (IV) oand atezolizumab IV every 3 weeks or each&#xD;
      cycle. Between cycle 1 and 2, patients also receive stereotactic body radiation therapy&#xD;
      (SBRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 3 months&#xD;
      for up to 1 year.&#xD;

          -  Subjects with an actionable molecular alteration (such as EGFR mutation, ALK or ROS1&#xD;
             rearrangement, BRAF V600E mutation) are eligible only after failing standard-of-care&#xD;
             targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Patients with a EGFR T790M&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Must have at least one lesion that has not previously been irradiated (and is not&#xD;
             within a previously radiated field) and for which palliative radiation is potentially&#xD;

             Patient must agree to undergo a mandatory biopsy of the non-irradiated lesion&#xD;
             pre-treatment and post-treatment (after cycle 2). Pre-treatment tissue obtained by&#xD;
             biopsy or resection performed according to standard of care may be utilized, provided&#xD;
             tissue was obtained within 8 weeks of study entry, and subsequent to the last systemic&#xD;
             anticancer therapy received&#xD;

             Females of childbearing potential are defined as sexually mature women without prior&#xD;

             women who have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of&#xD;
             childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy,&#xD;

                  doses of hormonal contraception for at least 3 months (e.g., oral, injectable,&#xD;
                  implant, transdermal) plus one barrier method; (c) 2 barrier methods. Effective&#xD;
                  barrier methods are male or female condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides (creams&#xD;
