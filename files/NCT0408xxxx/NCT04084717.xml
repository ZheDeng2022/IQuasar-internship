  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study of a drug called crizotinib in people with metastatic (the cancer has&#xD;
      spread to other parts of the body) non-small cell lung cancer with a mutation (change) in&#xD;
      genes called ROS1 or MET. The purpose of this study is to look at how effective crizotinib is&#xD;
      at treating ROS1 or MET mutated non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crizotinib, also called XALKORI, is a chemotherapy drug that is currently approved for the&#xD;
      treatment of ALK- or ROS1- positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      The study consists of a screening period, study drug period, end of study drug visit and&#xD;
      follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the screening period, participants will be asked to have tests and procedures done to&#xD;
      make sure that they are eligible to continue in the study. Screening may take several visits.&#xD;
      Participants found to be eligible to continue in the study, will then enter the study drug&#xD;
      period where they will take the study drug and have tests and procedures done about once a&#xD;
      week for safety and for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who stop the study drug completely for any reason, will be asked to return to&#xD;
      the clinic for an end of study drug visit about 28 days after their last dose of study drug&#xD;
      to have tests and procedures done for safety and for research purposes. Participants that are&#xD;
      experiencing any side effects during this time, will be closely followed by their study&#xD;
      Doctor until the side effects have resolved or stabilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who discontinue study drug for any reason other than disease progression, will&#xD;
      be asked to have radiological imaging every 8 weeks to follow up on the status of their&#xD;
      disease, until disease progression or the start a new treatment for their cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After their final visit, the study nurse will call participants approximately every 3 months&#xD;
      to check on the status of their health.&#xD;
