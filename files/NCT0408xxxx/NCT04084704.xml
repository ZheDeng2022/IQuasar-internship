  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip is one of the ten most disabling diseases in the developed&#xD;
      world. Because OA gradually worsens over time, the sooner treatment is started, the more&#xD;
      likely its impact is lessened. Hip OA is characterized by joint pain, cartilage degeneration,&#xD;
      and an increase in disability. Multiple treatments are used to manage the degenerating hip as&#xD;
      well as the associated pain. These include physiotherapy and rehabilitation, bracing, other&#xD;
      walking aids, oral medications, injections, and in severe cases, surgery. Prior research has&#xD;
      shown that injection of hyaluronic acid (HA) and corticosteroids can slow down OA&#xD;
      degradation. This study will look at the effects of injecting Cingal into the hip, which&#xD;
      expands on its current approved use in the treatment of knee OA.&#xD;

    <measure>Patient reported hip pain as measured by Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of this observational study is to determine, among individuals with hip OA ages 40-65 years, the effect of Cingal on patient-reported hip pain, as measured by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), at 6-months post-injection.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hip Function, as measured by the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The HOOS was designed to assess patient opinions about their hip and associated problems in an adult population with a hip disability with or without OA. The HOOS has been extensively validated and consists of 5 subscales for pain, other symptoms, function in activities of daily living, function in sports and recreation, and hip-related quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-related quality of life (HRQL) as measured by the Short Form-12 questionnaire (SF-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 may be self or interview-administered and can help document mental and physical components of quality of life. Points can range from 0-100, where a zero score indicates the lowest level of health and 100 indicates the highest level of health.</description>
