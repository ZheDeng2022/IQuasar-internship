  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elevated plasma triglycerides (TG) are due to an excess of TG-rich lipoproteins of several&#xD;
      different types, most commonly of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), but also&#xD;
      intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL, or VLDL remnants), chylomicrons, and/or chylomicron&#xD;
      remnants. Epidemiologic evidence that a moderate elevation in TG is often associated with&#xD;
      increased atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, and more recent evidence from&#xD;
      Mendelian randomization studies has shown that elevated TG associated with genetic variants&#xD;
      may be a causal factor for ASCVD and possibly for premature all-cause mortality.[1-6] Fasting&#xD;
      plasma TG concentrations may be categorized as: normal (&lt; 150 mg/dL ), borderline (150-199&#xD;
      mg/dL), high TG (HTG, 200-499 mg/dL), and very high TG (VHTG, ≥ 500 mg/dL).[7, 8] Risk of&#xD;
      acute pancreatitis is increased in VHTG patients, especially those with TG ≥ 1000 mg/dL.[9]&#xD;
      For VHTG, the primary goal of therapy is to reduce TG to &lt; 500 mg/dL,[10] whereas there is no&#xD;
      specific treatment goal for HTG nor prescription indication. However, the omega-3 fatty&#xD;
      acids, EPA and DHA have well-established efficacy in reducing TG in the range of 150-500 when&#xD;
      administered at doses of &gt; or = 3 g/d EPA+DHA (reviewed in Skulas-Ray et al. in press).&#xD;
      Importantly, administration of omega-3 fatty acids to people with TG in this range lead to a&#xD;
      25% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular endpoints in the recently completed &quot;Reduction&#xD;
      of Cardiovascular Events with EPA Intervention Trial&quot; (REDUCE-IT).[11]&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of REDUCE-IT provide compelling evidence for the use 3 g/d omega-3 fatty acid&#xD;
      supplementation to reduce cardiovascular risk among patients with TG 150-500 mg/dL. The&#xD;
      concentrated EPA supplement used in REDUCE-IT is just one of three long chain n-3 omega-3&#xD;
      fatty acids that influence lipids and lipoproteins and other aspects of cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most research has focused on the evaluation of EPA and DHA, which are the two predominant n-3&#xD;
      FA in fish and in n-3 agents, but docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) is present in fish oil, as&#xD;
      well, and accumulates in the blood at similar concentrations. The carbon length of the n-3 FA&#xD;
      appears important for physiological effects. EPA has a carbon length of 20, DHA has a carbon&#xD;
      length of 22, and DPA, the metabolic intermediate of EPA and DHA, is a 22-carbon n-3 FA. DPA&#xD;
      may have significant potential for treating HTG and VHTG,[12, 13] but research on this fatty&#xD;
      acid remains limited. In a 2-week open-label crossover comparison of 4 g/d of a DPA&#xD;
      concentrate (containing unspecified amounts of free DPA and EPA) vs. 4 g/d EPA concentrate in&#xD;
      people with HTG, plasma TG were reduced 33% by the DPA concentrate, which was significantly&#xD;
      more than the 11% reduction with EPA.[13] Thus, a recent scientific advisory from the&#xD;
      American Heart Association (Skulas-Ray et al, in press) concluded that more research is&#xD;
      needed to elaborate the lipid and lipoprotein effects of DPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional biomarker research suggests DPA similarly can influence health outcomes that&#xD;
      respond to EPA and DHA. For instance, decreased serum concentrations of DPA and DPA + DHA&#xD;
      have been associated with increased risk of risk of acute coronary events[14] and myocardial&#xD;
      infarction[15], respectively. Plasma DPA was also inversely associated with incident&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) in some ethnic groups.[16]&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion evidence supports a potential role of DPA in improving health, but results from&#xD;
      clinical supplementation studies are needed to clarify the effect of DPA supplementation on&#xD;
      lipids and lipoproteins as well as other cardiovascular disease risk factors-relative to&#xD;
      supplementation with EPA and DHA-to ascertain whether enrichment of omega-3 concentrates with&#xD;
      DPA could offer health benefits above and beyond concentrates that only contain EPA and DHA.&#xD;

      This is a cross-over, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study. Each&#xD;
      treatment phase will span a continuous 6-week period. Prior to the first treatment phase,&#xD;
      participants will be assigned to receive the DPA enriched n-3 supplement, conventional n-3&#xD;
      supplement, and identical placebo in random order. A computer program will be used to&#xD;
      randomly assign participants to a treatment sequence. After each treatment phase,&#xD;
      participants will have a 2-week washout period before beginning the next treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention protocol and study treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study capsules will be provided bi-weekly at the Food, Bioactives, &amp; Health Lab on the&#xD;
      University of Arizona campus or the Collaboratory. Participants may schedule pick-up times&#xD;
      that are most suitable for their schedules. A staff member will be available to meet with&#xD;
      participants at each bi-weekly pick-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatments are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 g/d DPA enriched n-3 concentrate (~980 mg DPA, 380 mg EPA, 1720 mg DHA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 g/d n-3 control (~980 oleic acid, 380 mg EPA, 1720 mg DHA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 g/d placebo control (&quot;light&quot; olive oil)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each 6-week treatment phase, participants will consume 4 g/day of the DPA-enriched&#xD;
      concentrate, n-3 matched control, or placebo control. Participants will be required to avoid&#xD;
      consuming any other food or supplements that contain n-3 FA during treatment phases. They&#xD;
      will also be asked to maintain their current dietary intake (with the exception of excluding&#xD;
      additional n-3 containing foods or supplements) and maintain their physical activity level&#xD;
      and body weight over the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each supplementation period will be at least 6 weeks in length. However, treatment periods&#xD;
      can be extended by 2 weeks (up to 8 weeks total) to accommodate scheduling challenges due to&#xD;
      illness, travel, etc. For example, should a participant be unable to come in on two separate&#xD;
      mornings for testing after 6 weeks of supplementation, they may continue the supplement and&#xD;
      schedule testing for the following week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be interviewed by telephone to determine their initial&#xD;
      eligibility. If they remain eligible after the telephone screening, they will be further&#xD;
      screened at the Collaboratory, CATS, or the Food, Bioactives, &amp; Health Lab. This screening&#xD;
      visit will consist of: filling out forms (informed consent, medical history, personal&#xD;
      information); measuring height and weight so body mass index (BMI) can be calculated; and&#xD;
      measuring blood pressure (BP). If it is determined that they are still eligible following&#xD;
      these measurements, a blood sample will be taken and a complete blood cell count, health&#xD;
      panel including liver and kidney function, and a blood fat panel will be performed&#xD;
      (approximately 15 mL of blood or ~1 tablespoon will be taken). If the initial blood draw is&#xD;
      unsuccessful, it may need to be repeated, with permission of the participant. Females of&#xD;
      child-bearing age will be given a urine pregnancy test. Study investigators will review all&#xD;
      of the screening data. Participants meeting eligibility criteria will be scheduled for&#xD;
      baseline data collection and supplementation will begin thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and endpoint visits (4 total):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo additional clinical assessments for one day at baseline (screening&#xD;
      values will be used as the second measure) and two days for each of 3 endpoint visits (at the&#xD;
      end of each 6-week treatment phase). The baseline visit will be scheduled within 2 weeks of&#xD;
      the participant's screening visit. Participants will be required to fast overnight (12 hours&#xD;
      with no food or drink except water) and abstain from alcohol for 48 hours prior to each&#xD;
      testing day. To ensure participant eligibility, a brief assessment will be administered (see&#xD;
      ScreeningForm_DPA). If a participant does not meet the requirements, their visit will be&#xD;
      rescheduled. Testing will be conducted at CATS, the Collaboratory, or the Food, Bioactives, &amp;&#xD;
      Health Lab and the procedures are described in more detail below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Blood sampling: Prior to having their blood taken, participants will be asked not to&#xD;
      consume any food or drink except water for 12 hours and to avoid alcohol for 48 hours.&#xD;
      Participants also should not engage in vigorous physical activity for 12 hours prior to&#xD;
      having their blood taken. Two blood samples will be taken at baseline and at the end of each&#xD;
      treatment phase (for a total of 8 times after eligibility screening). On two separate days, a&#xD;
      blood sample will be taken from the participant's arm after a 12-hour fast (no food or drink&#xD;
      except water). If the initial blood draw is unsuccessful it may need to be repeated, with the&#xD;
      participant's permission. Approximately 60 mL (4 tablespoons) of blood will be collected at&#xD;
      baseline and at the end of each treatment phase, over two days separated by at least 24&#xD;
      hours. This will be collected as ~52 mL on one day and ~7.5 mL on the other day. Throughout&#xD;
      the entire study, blood will be taken 8 times for a total amount of ~247 mL (~16.5&#xD;
      tablespoons), including the blood taken for screening tests prior to the start of the study&#xD;
      (~15 mL or 1 tablespoon).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of each testing period, blood will be tested for the following: glucose,&#xD;
           insulin, triglycerides, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, and concentrations of inflammatory markers.&#xD;
           Red blood cell fatty acid concentrations will also be measured to assess compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On an additional day at the end of each testing period, participants will provide a&#xD;
           blood sample (~7.5 mL) to repeat lipid measurements, which can vary day-to-day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be stored and analyzed after all participants have completed the study.&#xD;
      Study results will be available after study completion (which may take 2 years or longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Saliva Collection: Saliva samples will be collected using the passive drool technique.&#xD;
           Participants will use the collection aid to pool saliva into a specialized 2 mL&#xD;
           cryovial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine Pregnancy Testing: Female participants of childbearing age will be asked to&#xD;
           provide a urine sample for pregnancy testing at baseline and at the end of each&#xD;
           treatment phase. If a participant becomes pregnant, she will not be able to continue&#xD;
           participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulse Wave Analysis (PWA): On one of the testing days for the baseline visit and at the&#xD;
           end of each supplementation period, participants will undergo testing to measure their&#xD;
           blood pressure and pulse waveforms. This will be assessed using the SphygmoCor System&#xD;
           (AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia). SphygmoCor testing will be performed prior to the&#xD;
           fasting blood sample and at a consistent time (± 1 hour) for all baseline and endpoint&#xD;
           visits. The PWA measurement is very similar to a routine blood pressure measurement and&#xD;
           will be used to assess central blood pressure and wave reflection characteristics&#xD;
           (augmentation index). These will be derived from brachial pressure waveforms using a&#xD;
           validated generalized transfer function. PWA measurements will be taken following JNC7&#xD;
           blood pressure guidelines in a quiet, temperature-controlled, dimly lit room following a&#xD;
           5-minute seated rest period. Participants will be asked to sit quietly with their feet&#xD;
           flat on the floor for at least 5 minutes. A blood pressure cuff will then be placed on&#xD;
           the upper arm. The cuff will inflate, then deflate for 5 seconds, and then partially&#xD;
           re-inflate. Participants will be asked to remain quiet and still during this&#xD;
           measurement. The procedure will be repeated twice, for a total of 3 measurements, with&#xD;
           approximately 1 minute of rest between each measurement. The last 2 results will be&#xD;
           averaged to increase accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV): Following the PWA measurement, participants will undergo an&#xD;
           assessment of aortic stiffness, by measuring their carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity&#xD;
           (PWV). For this measurement, participants will be asked to lay flat on a hospital bed&#xD;
           without a pillow. Carotid and femoral arterial pressure waveforms will be measured&#xD;
           simultaneously via an applanation tonometry sensor manually held in place above the&#xD;
           right common carotid artery and a blood pressure cuff placed on the right common femoral&#xD;
           artery. PWV will be calculated by dividing the linear distance between the carotid and&#xD;
           femoral sites by the transit time using SphygmoCor system software. This test will be&#xD;
           performed three times with approximately 1 minute between measurements, and the last 2&#xD;
           results will be averaged to increase accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart Rate Variability (HVR): Following the PWV measurement, participants will undergo&#xD;
           an assessment of cardiovascular health, by measuring their heart rate variability (HRV).&#xD;
           For this measurement, participants will be asked to lay flat on a hospital bed without a&#xD;
           pillow. Participants will be connected to the SphygmoCor system by 3 ECG leads placed on&#xD;
           the upper torso. HRV information will be collected using SphygmoCor system software.&#xD;
           This test will be performed three times with approximately 1 minute between&#xD;
           measurements, and the last 2 results will be averaged to increase accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Midpoint Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplements will be provided every 3 weeks at a designated study site on the University of&#xD;
      Arizona campus or at the Collaboratory. Participants may schedule pick up times that work&#xD;
      best with their schedule. A study staff member will be available at each pick up visit to&#xD;
      meet with participants to answer questions or discuss side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will take approximately 22-28 weeks for participants to complete this research study. The&#xD;
      total time for study visits at the Collaboratory, CATS, or the Food, Bioactives, &amp; Health Lab&#xD;
      after initial screening, is approximately 8 hours. Times may vary and pre-menopausal females&#xD;
      will require an additional 5 minutes for a urine pregnancy test at screening, baseline, and&#xD;
      the end of each treatment period. The following is an estimate of the amount of time&#xD;
      participants will spend in study activities:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Forms, blood pressure, and blood draw: 45-60 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy testing (pre-menopausal females only): 5 minutes&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Pregnancy testing (pre-menopausal females only): 5 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second day of testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood draw: 15 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Saliva collection: 5 minutes *Day 1 and 2 measurements may be switched to&#xD;
                accommodate participant schedules&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visits every 3 weeks to pick up new supplements and return unused capsules: 15&#xD;
           minutes/visit (~90 minutes total)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily consumption logs (completed at home): ~15 minutes total&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total time commitment: ~8-9 hours (8 visits for testing and approximately 6 visits to pick-up&#xD;
      supplements, as well as completing logs at home) over the course of 22-28 weeks.&#xD;
