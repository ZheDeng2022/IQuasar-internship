  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fifty hospitalized consecutive patients with clinically suspected myocarditis (MC) who meet&#xD;
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During index hospitalization patients will undergo a standard clinical evaluation (physical&#xD;
      examination, collection of a medical history, blood tests (including troponin, N-terminal-pro&#xD;
      Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NTproBNP), C-reactive protein (CRP), Suppression of Tumorigenicity&#xD;
      2 (ST2), Galectin-3), 24-h Holter ECG, echo, coronary angiography, magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI)). Women of childbearing potential will undergo a pregnancy test prior to radiological&#xD;
      examinations. After signing the informed consent patients will undergo resting single photon&#xD;
      emission computed tomography (SPECT) to assess possible myocardial perfusion defects and then&#xD;
      18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed&#xD;
      tomography FDG-PET/CT. After MRI and FDG-PET/CT tests patients will undergo right ventricular&#xD;
      endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) (5-8 myocardial tissue samples). Blood biomarkers of fibrosis and&#xD;
      myocardial necrosis, as well as anticardiac autoantibodies will be evaluated at baseline and&#xD;
      after 3 months (serum will be stored at -80 °C for final evaluation). After 3-months from&#xD;
      enrollment follow-up visit will be performed with clinical evaluation. All patients will&#xD;
      undergo physical examination, collection of a medical history, blood tests, 24-h Holter ECG,&#xD;
      echo, MRI.&#xD;

      childbearing potential will undergo a pregnancy test prior to radiological examinations.&#xD;
      After signing the informed consent patients will undergo resting single photon emission&#xD;
      computed tomography (SPECT) to assess possible myocardial perfusion defects and then cardiac&#xD;
      FDG-PET/CT. After MRI and FDG-PET/CT tests patients will undergo right ventricular EMB (5-8&#xD;
      myocardial tissue samples). Blood biomarkers of fibrosis and myocardial necrosis, as well as&#xD;
      anti-heart autoantibodies will be evaluated at baseline and after 3 months (serum will be&#xD;
      stored at -80 °C for final evaluation). After 3-months from enrollment follow-up visit will&#xD;
      be performed with clinical evaluation. All patients will undergo physical examination,&#xD;
      collection of a medical history, blood tests, 24-h Holter ECG, echo, MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FDG-PET/CT imaging Resting SPECT will be performed one day before the FDG-PET/CT examination.&#xD;
      Physiological glucose uptake in the myocardium will be suppressed using dietary preparation&#xD;
      (low-carbohydrate high-fatty diet). 48 h before the FDG-PET/CT examination, all patients'&#xD;
      meals will be low-carbohydrate. 24 h before the FDG-PET/CT examination (the &quot;SPECT day&quot;),&#xD;
      breakfast and dinner (last meal at 4:00 PM) will be high-fat, then fasting (a patient should&#xD;
      drink only still water) until FDG-PET/CT examination in the next morning (9:00 PM).&#xD;
      Single-dose heparin will be administered intravenously at a low dose (50 IU/kg) 15 minutes&#xD;
      before the start of the FDG-PET/CT examination to increase the accuracy of the test.&#xD;
      Capillary blood glucose level will be measured 20 minutes before the FDG-PET/CT examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of radiation, for about 6 h after the scan patients should avoid contact with&#xD;
      children and pregnant women.&#xD;
