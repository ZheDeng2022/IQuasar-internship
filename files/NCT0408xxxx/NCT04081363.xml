  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the PK of centanafadine currently being evaluated in adults. The PK of extended-release&#xD;
      centanafadine may differ in children compared to adults due to physiological differences in&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal tract. The information in this trial will support pediatric dose&#xD;
      selection in future trials.&#xD;
