  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly patients residing in nursing homes are particularly at risk of experiencing urgent&#xD;
      medical problems needing admission to the Emergency Department (ED). This circumstance&#xD;
      contributes to ED overcrowding, increases the risk of ward admission of elderly patients, and&#xD;
      puts them at an even higher risk of hospitalization-related adverse events. The study&#xD;
      hypothesis is that a complex intervention, delivered directly in nursing homes by hospital&#xD;
      physicians in case of urgent medical problems, would contribute to reduce hospitalization of&#xD;
      older nursing home residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention consists in a hospital-based &quot;multidisciplinary mobile unit&quot; (MMU), composed&#xD;
      of a hospital specialist and a resident in emergency-urgency medicine who are coordinated by&#xD;
      a senior physician serving as &quot;flow manager&quot;. The team is active on work days, 8 am to 6 pm,&#xD;
      and is activated by general practitioners of nursing homes, in case of urgent medical needs&#xD;
      of one of the residents. The activation is made by a phone call to the &quot;flow manager&quot;, who&#xD;
      triages the clinical needs of the case. The output of the phone consultation may include&#xD;
      therapeutic advice provided by phone, immediate on-site visit by the MMU team (specialist and&#xD;
      resident), scheduled visit by the MMU team, or direct admission to the hospital unit where&#xD;
      MMU is based, avoiding ED visits. The MMU team is provided with a portable ultrasound system,&#xD;
      an essential set of drugs and medical devices useful in a urgency setting (central venous&#xD;
      lines, nasogastric tubes, rectal tubes, bladder catheters). During on-site visits, the MMU&#xD;
      team performs diagnosis, stabilization and therapeutic advice, with the mission of avoiding&#xD;
      ED visits and hospital admissions whenever possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MMU intervention is already active in two nursing homes, since December 2018. The aim of&#xD;
      this prospective, pragmatic, multicenter, quasi-experimental study (sequential design with&#xD;
      two cohorts) is to test the effects of the implementation of the MMU care model in terms of&#xD;
      reduction of unplanned hospitalization rates (primary outcomes), mortality, health service&#xD;
      use and costs (secondary outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two nursing homes (i.e., the ones who already benefit from the intervention) will serve as&#xD;
      study group, and two nursing homes with similar geographical location will serve as control&#xD;
      group. All residents of the participating nursing homes will be eligible for study inclusion.&#xD;
      The study will last for 18 months, and a number of 338 residents is planned for inclusion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is based in the University Hospital of Parma, which has a catchment area of more&#xD;
      than 400,000 inhabitants, of whom 22.3% is over 65 years old. It provides the only Emergency&#xD;
      service of the district, and it ranks fourth in Italy by number of ED visits (yearly average&#xD;
      of over 110,000). The average admission rate of the adult ED population is 18%, of which 65%&#xD;
      concern people older than 65.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last two decades, the University Hospital of Parma has implemented several innovative&#xD;
      initiatives to manage the hospital flow of frail multimorbid patients and their complex&#xD;
      needs. These initiatives included bed management to avoid &quot;bed-blockers&quot;, physician&#xD;
      accountability for the discharge process, and creation of a dedicated hospital unit,&#xD;
      organized by intensity of care to anticipate the needs of these patients preserving high&#xD;
      performance indices. This unit, called Internal Medicine and Critical Subacute Care Unit,&#xD;
      performs over 3,500 urgent admissions of frail multimorbid elderly patients per year, with an&#xD;
      average length of stay that in 30% of cases is lower than 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating nursing homes are public facilities which ensure the presence of nursing staff&#xD;
      24 hours a day and of a physician at least 4 hours a day (high-intensity care facilities).&#xD;
      The possible role of distance to the hospital is considered by including in each group one&#xD;
      nursing home located next to the hospital and one located &gt;5 km of distance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study follows a multimethod approach, based on the MRC framework for developing and&#xD;
      evaluating complex interventions, including the development, feasibility assessment, and&#xD;
      evaluation phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Development of the intervention First, the different types of approaches reported in the&#xD;
           literature, described above, were considered. The &quot;prevention approach&quot;, interventions&#xD;
           conducted in nursing homes, was chosen as the most suitable strategy to integrate the&#xD;
           hospital's organizational model already in place, as it can target both hospitalization&#xD;
           rates and ED overcrowding, allowing to intervene before the person accesses the&#xD;
           hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Available evidence also prompted us to opt for a multicomponent approach. In fact, data&#xD;
           from qualitative interviews reveal that the decision to transfer residents to hospital&#xD;
           may be influenced by different factors, such as staffing and skill mix in the nursing&#xD;
           homes, treatment options available in the facility, end-of-life decision-making, and&#xD;
           communication and bureaucratic requirements. This multifactorial association means that&#xD;
           a multicomponent intervention is likely to be more effective than a single-component&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The choice of employing a mobile geriatric specialist service was supported by the&#xD;
           positive results obtained by the two controlled studies which examined similar&#xD;
           interventions. One study evaluated a service where a physician did regular and on-call&#xD;
           visits intended to provide services otherwise associated with hospitalization. The other&#xD;
           study evaluated an ambulant team with a nurse and a physician, doing comprehensive&#xD;
           geriatric assessments of residents as well as reviewing medications and providing&#xD;
           support to staff. The proposed intervention does not involve a nurse, unlike the second&#xD;
           of the mentioned studies, because in the participating facilities nursing staff is&#xD;
           available 24 hours a day. Unlike the experience of the second study, moreover, periodic&#xD;
           visits on site will not be performed in the present investigation, since routine&#xD;
           clinical management and scheduled follow-up is already performed by nursing home&#xD;
           physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Finally, medical hospital staff was preferred to community geriatricians, on the&#xD;
           assumption that older patients may feel more comfortable being handled by physicians who&#xD;
           may have already cared for them at the hospital. Moreover, hospital staff enables direct&#xD;
           patient referral to the ward. Finally, this allows the use of diagnostic technologies&#xD;
           available at the hospital, which can be used immediately without the need for hospital&#xD;
           admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The MMU care model intervention The model hinges on the strong collaboration between&#xD;
           hospital and nursing home staff to provide residents with patient-centered care. It&#xD;
           entails a multicomponent intervention which is integrated in standard care and comprises&#xD;
           three steps: 1) MMU team activation, 2) on site visit by a team of physicians with&#xD;
           geriatric expertise, 3) interdisciplinary care planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Step 1: MMU team activation&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient selection is necessary to ensure that available resources are used for patients&#xD;
           who may really benefit. To this end, the nursing home physician contacts by phone the&#xD;
           &quot;flow manager&quot;, a skilled internist with strong clinical expertise, organizational&#xD;
           attitude and managerial training, during the 8 a.m.-6 p.m. time frame, Monday to Friday.&#xD;
           The phone consultation is reported on a form containing the description of the patient's&#xD;
           clinical condition and a summary of the conversation. The form also indicates which&#xD;
           decision was reached among the following 6 not mutually exclusive options:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The patient can be managed by nursing home staff, therapeutic advice is provided by&#xD;
                phone&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Remote reassessment is scheduled after a number of hours agreed upon by the team&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The MMU team is dispatched for evaluation, treatment and stabilization on site&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. A significant change in vital parameters is observed which requires immediate&#xD;
                activation of emergency services&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Direct hospital admission is considered necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Ambulatory outpatient visits or tests are planned&#xD;
&#xD;
           Step 2: on site visit by a team of physicians with geriatric expertise Visits at the&#xD;
           nursing home are performed by two members of the MMU team: an expert hospital physician&#xD;
           chosen on a case-by-case basis among the clinical staff of the Internal Medicine and&#xD;
           Critical Subacute Care Unit, which comprises internists, gastroenterologists,&#xD;
           geriatricians, specialists in clinical nutrition, depending on the disease or clinical&#xD;
           problem that must be treated, and a specifically trained resident in Emergency Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The team is provided with a car to reach the nursing homes, a portable ultrasound&#xD;
           system, and an essential set of drugs and medical devices useful in an emergency&#xD;
           setting. The ultrasound system is equipped with three probes (convex, linear, and&#xD;
           phased-array) for performing thoraco-pulmonary, cardiac, vascular, abdominal and soft&#xD;
           tissue ultrasound, when required. Available drugs include those that can be administered&#xD;
           intravenously for treating urgent conditions (e.g. loop diuretics, steroids, fluids,&#xD;
           antibiotics). Devices include central and peripheral venous lines, naso-gastric and&#xD;
           rectal tubes and bladder catheters. Blood tests can also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Step 3: interdisciplinary care planning. Based on the results of the visit and of any&#xD;
           performed investigations, the MMU team formulates personalized advice and referrals, and&#xD;
           discusses these with the nursing home physician. If stabilization on site is not deemed&#xD;
           possible, the MMU team plans a direct admission to the Internal Medicine and Critical&#xD;
           Subacute Care Unit, thus avoiding ED access. The planning and the final outcome of the&#xD;
           intervention are recorded in the second part of the form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Feasibility assessment A pilot phase of 5 months (December 2018-April 2019) was&#xD;
           conducted in two nursing homes in order to look at feasibility of the MMU care Model&#xD;
           described above. Before the intervention was introduced, meetings were held with nursing&#xD;
           home staff to agree on activation modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In this period, 99 phone calls were received, of which 84 required MMU team onsite&#xD;
           visits, and 15 were managed with remote consultancy. Of the latter, 3 required direct&#xD;
           admission after remote phone consultancy. Only 4 of the 84 patients visited onsite&#xD;
           required direct admission. One patient was sent to the ED for massive intestinal&#xD;
           bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This phase demonstrated the feasibility of the intervention, and did not highlight any&#xD;
           need for modifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluation phase Aim and objectives The study aim is to verify the effects of the&#xD;
           implementation of the MMU care model tested in the pilot phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective is to verify reduction of unplanned hospitalization rates in the nursing&#xD;
      homes of the intervention group compared to the nursing homes in the control group. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to measure the effects of the intervention in terms of mortality, health&#xD;
      service use, and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design. This study is a prospective, pragmatic, multicenter, quasi-experimental study&#xD;
      (sequential design with two cohorts), in which usual nursing home care is compared to care&#xD;
      provided by applying the MMU model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population. All residents of the participating nursing homes are eligible, regardless&#xD;
      of their clinical status. Residents who do not provide informed consent will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual Care. Patients in the control cohort receive usual care, which means the actions to&#xD;
      take are decided by the nursing home staff. Generally, this implies that patients who are&#xD;
      clinically unstable, or require urgent instrumental tests, will be sent to the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures. Baseline variables. Demographic data on gender and age are collected by chart&#xD;
      review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome variables. The primary outcome is hospitalization rate, considering at the numerator&#xD;
      all unplanned admissions occurred during a 1-year period, and at the denominator the sum of&#xD;
      the person-time of the at risk population (days of stay at the nursing home). For the&#xD;
      intervention group, the numerator corresponds to options c) and d) defined in &quot;Step 1: MMU&#xD;
      team activation&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Crude all-cause Death Rate (CDR): the number of deaths during a 1-year period on&#xD;
           person-time of the at risk population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital Mortality rate: the frequency of patients who die while in the hospital (death&#xD;
           rate/1000)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of stay (LOS): the duration of a single episode of hospitalization. Inpatient&#xD;
           days are calculated by subtracting day of admission from day of discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events or complications: frequency of events occurred within 48 hours from MMU&#xD;
           team activation and subsequent patient stabilization, for which hospital access becomes&#xD;
           necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Costs analysis, comparing the cost differences in the two groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics are collected at baseline&#xD;
      to describe the study population and determine factors associated with hospital rate.&#xD;
      Participants' files and electronic data are stored securely at the study site (e.g. locked&#xD;
      area, password protected hard- and software). Data integrity will be scrutinized with several&#xD;
      strategies (e.g. valid values, range checks, consistency checks). Patient data are only&#xD;
      identifiable with the unique participant's number. Personal information will be collected and&#xD;
      saved in a separate file (on a different server) which can only be accessed by the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator (PI). This information will be used by the PI to retrieve data on any hospital&#xD;
      admissions (length of stay, in-hospital death …) from administrative databases (discharge&#xD;
      summaries, ED data, Death Registry). Residents' identification data will be deleted once the&#xD;
      study is completed, making the dataset anonymous. All study protocol authors will have access&#xD;
      to the anonymous dataset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost analysis. The investigators will identify the changes in net costs associated with&#xD;
      one-year exposure to the intervention, consisting in the induced costs due to incremental&#xD;
      resource inputs for carrying out the intervention and hospital health service utilization&#xD;
      costs. Staffing costs will be calculated considering the time spent by the professionals&#xD;
      involved in the intervention. Non-staff running costs include expenses of MMU staff&#xD;
      travelling to and from the nursing home. The health service utilization costs will be&#xD;
      identified based on the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methodology. Sample size calculation. The number of subjects to include was&#xD;
      estimated using the findings of one study, a large quasi-experimental trial. Thus,&#xD;
      considering 56 cases vs 32 cases per 100 residents, and using a 2-sided, large-samples z-test&#xD;
      of the Poisson incidence rate difference at a significance level of 0.05, and with a power of&#xD;
      0.90, overall 338 residents should be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize patient populations&#xD;
      and will be presented as means and standard deviations (SD) when normally distributed, or as&#xD;
      medians and interquartile ranges (IQR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary analysis the investigators will used Poisson regression with robust standard&#xD;
      errors (SEs) to evaluate relative differences in hospital rates among the two cohorts while&#xD;
      adjusting for demographic characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning the secondary outcomes, the following analyses will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rates will be compared considering the quotient between the intervention and control&#xD;
           groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A lognormal model will be used to compare in-hospital LOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chi square tests will be conducted for categorical data as adverse events or&#xD;
           complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For costs, the investigators will use the following equations to summarize the annual&#xD;
           net costs associated with the implementation of the intervention. Any costs with&#xD;
           negative values mean &quot;savings&quot; and any costs with positive values mean &quot;losses&quot;. Net&#xD;
           costs ˆ A…(intervention costs) +‡ B (Costs for differences in hospital health service&#xD;
           utilization) where: A= intervention: staffing costs+intervention: non- staff costs and&#xD;
           B= Costs for differences in inpatient care utilization. Therefore, the net costs arising&#xD;
           from one-year implementation of the intervention as compared with the current practice&#xD;
           will be obtained, where a negative value of net costs represents &quot;cost-saving&quot; and a&#xD;
           positive value represents &quot;not cost-saving&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The demographic and clinical variables which influence the outcome with a p value&lt;0.20 in the&#xD;
      univariate analysis will be included in the Poisson regression model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyses will be performed using SAS 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and STATA-SE 11&#xD;
      (Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX, USA).&#xD;
