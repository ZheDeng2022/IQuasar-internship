    <textblock>
      Nerivio™ is an FDA-authorized remote electrical neuromodulation (REN) device for the acute&#xD;
      treatment of migraine with or without aura in patients 18 years old or above who do not have&#xD;
      chronic migraine. The device delivers transcutaneous electrical stimulation to the upper arm&#xD;
      to induce conditioned pain modulation (CPM) that activates a descending endogenous analgesic&#xD;
      mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, single arm, open label, multicenter trial of the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of Nerivio™ for the acute treatment of migraine in adolescents&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in three phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I - Run-in:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II - Treatment phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III (optional) - Free-use&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open label study includes 3 phases and up to 4 visits. All visits will be conducted in&#xD;
      the presence of a parent/guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First visit - enrollment: The first visit will include screening, enrollment and training on&#xD;
      the application in diary mode. The screening process will include an eligibility assessment&#xD;
      and a urine pregnancy test. Following successful screening, enrollment interview and signing&#xD;
      an informed consent by the parent/guardian and an informed assent by the participant. The&#xD;
      participants will be trained to use the electronic diary application, installed on their own&#xD;
      smartphones. The site personnel will be required to document the training session in the CRF.&#xD;
      During this visit, participants will complete baseline questionnaires that included&#xD;
      information on the frequency and severity of their migraine attacks, typical associated&#xD;
      symptoms, use of preventive and acute treatments, and the effect that their migraine attacks&#xD;
      have on their daily routine and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 - run-in phase: After the enrollment visit, participants will undergo a 4-week&#xD;
      migraine diary phase aimed to collect baseline migraine characteristics and further assess&#xD;
      eligibility. Participants will be asked to report in the application each migraine attack.&#xD;
      These reports will be transferred by the application to the electronic data collection (EDC)&#xD;
      system, where they will be collected and registered. Participants who did not have at least 3&#xD;
      migraine attacks will be excluded from the study. Eligibility will also be determined based&#xD;
      on the compliance of participants to report the attacks within one hour from attack onset and&#xD;
      report the pain level at 2 hours post-treatment in at least 66.7% of the reported attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second visit - Device training visit: Eligible participants who meet the run-in requirements&#xD;
      will receive the Nerivio™ device. The device will be registered and connected by Bluetooth to&#xD;
      their smartphone. During this visit, participants and their parent/guardian will be trained&#xD;
      to use the device, including finding the optimal individual stimulation intensity level&#xD;
      (perceptible but not painful). The site will also carefully review with the patient and&#xD;
      parent/caregiver how to identify a qualifying migraine attack (see below) and provide&#xD;
      detailed instructions on study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individual intensity level identified during this visit will be recorded, and the&#xD;
      participants will be asked to treat their migraine headaches with the device using the&#xD;
      identified intensity. If the research staff recognizes that the participant cannot tolerate&#xD;
      the feeling of the electrical stimulation, the participant may be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 -Treatment phase: Participants will be instructed to use the device for the treatment&#xD;
      of 4 qualifying migraine attacks (see below) as soon as possible and always within 60 minutes&#xD;
      of onset during a period of up to 8 weeks. Participants will be instructed to use the device&#xD;
      with the intensity level identified during the device training visit (with a range of ±5&#xD;
      units) and make sure the stimulation is perceptible but not painful. Participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to avoid taking rescue medications within 2 hours post-treatment. If medications&#xD;
      are used, participants will be instructed to record in the app when and which medication was&#xD;
      taken. The participants will use the app to record pain intensity levels (none, mild,&#xD;
      moderate, or severe) at baseline, 2- and 24-hours post-treatment, and to record the&#xD;
      presence/absence of associated migraine symptoms (nausea, photophobia, phonophobia) at&#xD;
      baseline and 2 hours post-treatment. To assess functional disability, participants will also&#xD;
      record at baseline, 2- and 24-hours post-treatment their response to the following question&#xD;
      in their diary: &quot;How do you rate your ability to do school-work or perform your usual&#xD;
      activities?&quot; using a 4-point scale ('as usual', 'some ability', 'a little ability', 'no&#xD;
      ability at all'). At the beginning of each treatment, participants will also be asked to&#xD;
      report the time elapsed from attack onset. Adverse events will be reported throughout this&#xD;
      phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who do not achieve satisfactory relief at 2 hours post-treatment may treat again&#xD;
      with the Nerivio™ device or may treat with usual care at that time or any time thereafter if&#xD;
      the headache does not resolve. Participants will also be able to treat headache recurrence&#xD;
      with the device. Attacks that are not treated with the device may be treated with usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first reported treatment will be considered a &quot;training&quot; treatment, aimed to verify that&#xD;
      the participants use the device properly, and will only be included in the safety analysis.&#xD;
      The efficacy evaluation will be performed on the first treatment of a qualifying attack (see&#xD;
      below) following the training treatment (hereby termed &quot;test treatment&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third visit - Termination of the treatment phase and free-use phase initiation: Following the&#xD;
      8-week period of the treatment phase, participants will return to the clinic to return the&#xD;
      device and fill questionnaires assessing satisfaction and user experience. All participants&#xD;
      who complete the treatment phase will be offered to participate in an additional 8-week phase&#xD;
      in which the device can be incorporate into usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 - Free-use phase: Participants will continue in an 8-week phase in which they will be&#xD;
      able to use the device according to their preferences for the treatment of their migraine&#xD;
      attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fourth (final) visit - End of study: Participants will return to the clinic following the end&#xD;
      of the 8-week free-use phase, at which time they will return the device.&#xD;

Nerivio: Nerivio™ is an FDA-authorized remote electrical neuromodulation (REN) device for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in patients 18 years old or above who do not have chronic migraine. The device delivers transcutaneous electrical stimulation to the upper arm to induce conditioned pain modulation (CPM) that activates a descending endogenous analgesic mechanism. The treatment is self-administered and controlled by a smartphone application.</description>

Nerivio: Nerivio™ is an FDA-authorized remote electrical neuromodulation (REN) device for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in patients 18 years old or above who do not have chronic migraine. The device delivers transcutaneous electrical stimulation to the upper arm to induce conditioned pain modulation (CPM) that activates a descending endogenous analgesic mechanism. The treatment is self-administered and controlled by a smartphone application.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA, the enrollment of new patients was forced to be stopped.&#xD;
An interim analysis was conducted at that point, to assess the statistical power of the data accumulated from the 60 patients enrolled which is approximately 50% of the planned sample size. Based on the results of this analysis, the data monitoring committee (DMC) determined that the study can be deemed completed for benefit</limitations_and_caveats>
