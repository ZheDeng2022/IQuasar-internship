      The objective of the study is to clinically assess the safety and effectiveness of LIQOSEAL®&#xD;
      as a means of reducing intra- as well as post-operative CSF leakage in patients undergoing&#xD;
      elective cranial intradural surgery with a dural closure procedure to show noninferiority&#xD;
      compared to a control group.&#xD;
