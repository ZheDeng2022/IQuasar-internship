  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well self-generated survivorship care plans and telehealth education&#xD;
      works in improving knowledge and self-efficacy in cancer survivors living in rural areas.&#xD;
      Patients living in rural areas often face barriers to survivorship care and report unmet&#xD;
      needs. A survivorship care plan created by the patient (self-generated) may help them to&#xD;
      better transition from oncology to primary care and improve communication between care teams&#xD;
      in order to meet these needs and create better health outcomes. Telehealth is a way of&#xD;
      delivering health care services from a distance, including patient education. Combining a&#xD;
      self-generated survivorship care plan with telehealth education may help to improve knowledge&#xD;
      and self-efficacy in cancer survivors.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete a questionnaire at baseline (paper, online, or telephone-based) and medical&#xD;
      records are reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are then randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive a self-generated SCP (i.e., generated from baseline questionnaire&#xD;
      responses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive a self-generated SCP as in Arm I. Patients also receive a 30-minute&#xD;
      telephone-based educational counseling session on survivorship care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS: Primary care providers complete a questionnaire about perceptions of&#xD;
      the SCP and self-efficacy in providing survivorship care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up at approximately 8 weeks.&#xD;
