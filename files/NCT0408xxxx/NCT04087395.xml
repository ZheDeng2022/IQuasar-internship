  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, double-blinded, within-subject (split-face), multicenter,&#xD;
      prospective study to investigate whether RHA® 4 with New Anesthetic Agent is non-inferior to&#xD;
      RHA® 4 (with lidocaine) in terms of injection site pain felt by the subject during injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening, the Treating Investigator (TI) evaluated subjects' NLF severity (using the&#xD;
      Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale; WSRS) to confirm eligibility and to establish a pre-treatment&#xD;
      score for assessing aesthetic improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 1, RHA® 4 With New Anesthetic Agent was administered in a random sequence (first or&#xD;
      second injection) and side of the face (left or right) and RHA® 4 with lidocaine was&#xD;
      administered to the other side. Study subjects and the TI injecting study devices were&#xD;
      blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after injection of each side, subjects rated injection site pain experienced&#xD;
      during injection using a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Injection site pain in each side&#xD;
      of the face was also assessed at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes post-injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluation consisted of AE assessments, a 30-day CTR (Common Treatment Response) diary&#xD;
      and a follow-up call performed by the study site at 72 hours after injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects attended Visit 2 (30 days post-injection) where efficacy and safety assessments will&#xD;
      be conducted. Subjects who present with an unresolved clinically significant device related&#xD;
      AE at Visit 2 received the optional follow-up phone call no later than 30 days after Visit 2.&#xD;
      If the clinically significant AE remained unresolved, the Investigator requested that the&#xD;
      subject attended the optional in-clinic follow-up visit (i.e., Visit 3) within 5 working&#xD;
      days. Follow-up of the clinically significant AE continued until the AE was resolved or the&#xD;
      TI determines that additional follow-up was not necessary.&#xD;

    <time_frame>During 30 days after injection</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects received a diary booklet and instructions for recording their observations of the Common Treatment Responses to the study treatments during 30 days following the injection. The diary were discussed during follow-up phone call and visit. Subjects were instructed to complete the diary at approximately the same time each day (i.e., am or pm).&#xD;
The subject diary captured the following Common Treatment Responses (CTR) that occur following the injection of a dermal filler; specifically, redness, pain, tenderness, firmness, swelling, lumps/bumps, bruising, itching, discoloration, and &quot;other&quot;.&#xD;
The 30-day patient CTR diary included a detailed glossary describing all signs/symptoms listed in the diary; an option was provided to rate &quot;other&quot; if the subject experienced a sign/symptom that is not listed.</description>

The diary were discussed during follow-up phone call and visit. Subjects were instructed to complete the diary at approximately the same time each day (i.e., am or pm).&#xD;
The subject diary captured the following Common Treatment Responses (CTR) that occur following the injection of a dermal filler; specifically, redness, pain, tenderness, firmness, swelling, lumps/bumps, bruising, itching, discoloration, and &quot;other&quot;.&#xD;
The 30-day patient CTR diary included a detailed glossary describing all signs/symptoms listed in the diary; an option was provided to rate &quot;other&quot; if the subject experienced a sign/symptom that is not listed.</description>
