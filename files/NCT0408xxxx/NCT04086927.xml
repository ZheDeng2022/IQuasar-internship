  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the difference in soft tissue swelling prior to surgery and wound&#xD;
      complications after surgery between unna boot application versus standard splint application.&#xD;
      An unna boot is an extra zinc covered wrap around your leg followed by standard splint&#xD;
      application (cotton dressing, plaster, then soft dressing). Prior to surgery the&#xD;
      participant's swelling will be measured and compared to the standard splint application&#xD;
      group. After surgery, the participant will be monitored for wound complications, pain, and&#xD;
      range of motion.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to compare preoperative swelling and frequency of wound&#xD;
      complications in ankle fractures through standard splint and an unna boot compressive&#xD;
      dressing with a splint. Quantitative and qualitative measurements will be analyzed to compare&#xD;
      edema and wound complications. Secondary goals are to evaluate the quantitative differences&#xD;
      in ankle range of motion and visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores. The hypothesis of this&#xD;
      proposed study is that there will be less soft tissue swelling and wound complications with&#xD;
      the use of an unna boot when compared to the standard splint. The investigators also&#xD;
      hypothesize that there will be improved ankle range of motion and visual analogue scale (VAS)&#xD;
      pain scores with the use of an unna boot when compared to a standard splint. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to either the standard splint or an unna boot and quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative measures will be collected. This data could change the practice for preoperative&#xD;
      management of soft tissue swelling following ankle fractures.&#xD;
