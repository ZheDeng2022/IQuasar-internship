      Individuals affected with Parkinson disease (PD), are found to be at high risk of motor&#xD;
      impairment and non-motor impairment as well. It further leads to affect the quality of life&#xD;
      in patients of PD, due to impairments in postural instability, balance impairment and gait&#xD;
      disturbances. Hence, various Physiotherapy based rehabilitation is on-demand that improves&#xD;
      their quality of life and prognosis. Emerging trends in neuro-rehabilitation are Virtual&#xD;
      reality intervention (VRI), that helps the patient to involve in a virtual environment and&#xD;
      provide rehabilitation as per need by using different software games. As a result, their&#xD;
      balance, posture and gait can improve speedily. In VRI we will be using the latest model of&#xD;
      VRI that will include an assessment tool to assess the disability and provide rehabilitation.&#xD;
      The cognitive system is also get affected due to physiological changes occur in PD, that&#xD;
      leads to impair the other functions during walking such as balance and posture. Because&#xD;
      during walking they can not perform dual task orientation to correct their posture and&#xD;
      balance. So, dual-task intervention (DTI) is helpful to train them and involve them to&#xD;
      participate actively in various activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, we will develop an innovative rehabilitation technique to improve the&#xD;
      posture, balance and gait in patients with PD. It will include VRI and additive DTI that will&#xD;
      keep the patients motivated to perform the exercise actively. To assess the problems we will&#xD;
      use standard device posturography that will be used before the intervention and after the&#xD;
      intervention to identify the changes in their condition. Additionally, we will use some&#xD;
      scales as outcome measures to assess the PD, quality of life and gait. Previous studies show&#xD;
      that VR games and dual-task intervention training are an effective method to rehabilitate&#xD;
      neurological ill patients. During the experiments, both conventional (DTI) and experimental&#xD;
      (VRI+ DTI) will be considered.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease of the brain, leads to&#xD;
      degeneration and causing the motor and non-motor symptoms. PD is characterized by&#xD;
      dopaminergic neurotransmitter deficiency. It is a progressive neurological condition that&#xD;
      affects more than 10 million people worldwide. Cardinal features of PD are bradykinesia,&#xD;
      rigidity and tremor are common symptoms. But gait, postural instability and balance are&#xD;
      common risk factors for falling in these population and have a great impact on the quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are various treatments available in the pharmacological and surgical field. However,&#xD;
      their effectiveness is not satisfying much and invasive procedures are not cost-effective.&#xD;
      With the progression of disease patent often become less responsive to medication and develop&#xD;
      various difficulties in their daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, Physiotherapy(PT) interventions are very important to rehabilitate the patients&#xD;
      affected with PD. It helps to improve movement function, motor performance and increase the&#xD;
      quality of life. There is active participation from the side of the patient will be there&#xD;
      that keeps the patients motivated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among emerging approaches in the field of PT, virtual reality(VR) has been proposed as an&#xD;
      innovative and effective method for improving gait, balance and postural instability.&#xD;
      Patients of PD faces cognitive impairment which leads to impaired attention during their gait&#xD;
      because they are unable to put attention on their posture and balance. So attention is&#xD;
      responsible for maintaining posture and gait, leads to reduce dual-task ability which is very&#xD;
      important in our daily life activities. So to improve the quality of life by correcting&#xD;
      posture and gait cognitive dual-task intervention training plays important role in&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various studies suggested single intervention to improve gait, posture and balance ability in&#xD;
      PD patients. To our knowledge, no study investigated the possibility to apply VR with&#xD;
      dual-task intervention. the current study compares the effects of VR intervention (VRI) and&#xD;
      cognitive dual-task intervention(DTI) between posture, balance and gait. To our knowledge,&#xD;
      this will be the first study to compare VRI and DTI on a variety of motor tasks in the&#xD;
      homogenous group in their OFF period of medication state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that addition of VRI with DTI can lead to improve the balance, postural&#xD;
      instability and gait in patients with PD and can slow the progression of the disease without&#xD;
      changing the medication plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Materials and Methods: Ethical statement and subject recruitment The study protocol was&#xD;
      approved by the institutional research advisory committee (RAC) and registered under the&#xD;
      Universal Trial Number (UTN). The protocol will be registered under ClinicalTrials.gov, under&#xD;
      World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and then the study&#xD;
      will be submitted for the ethical approval by the institutional ethics committee of Maharishi&#xD;
      Markandeshwar Deemed to Be University, Mullana, Haryana with a unique reference number. The&#xD;
      study will be executed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki&#xD;
      (Revised, 2013) and National ethical guidelines for Biomedical and Health research involving&#xD;
      human participants by Indian council for medical research (ICMR, 2017). The purpose of the&#xD;
      study will be clearly explained to the patient with Parkinson disease. A written informed&#xD;
      consent form will be obtained from the recruited patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Idiopathic PD (According to the united kingdom Parkinson's disease society&#xD;
      brain bank criteria) Hoehn and Yahr stage III Able to walk without any assistance Age&#xD;
      between45-70 Both sex male and female Exclusion criteria Any neurological disease other than&#xD;
      PD Vestibular disorders Urinary incontinence Musculoskeletal impairments that could affect&#xD;
      gait Inability to stand and walk unassisted Uncooperative patients Random Allocation Total of&#xD;
      X patient with Parkinson disease was screened and through convenience sampling method, n&#xD;
      patients were selected based on the inclusion criteria for the double, blind three-group&#xD;
      pretest-posttest randomized controlled design. Demographic data will be recorded for all the&#xD;
      patients. The patient with PD will be allocated in three groups, dual-task treatment group&#xD;
      (DTG), virtual reality treatment group (VRG) and daily physiotherapy group (DPG) by compute&#xD;
      generated block randomization technique. According to it, there will be n blocks, with the&#xD;
      matrix design of n Ã— N, where n being rowed. Each row could have n blocks, patients will be&#xD;
      allotted to one of the three groups based on the randomly generated number by computer. Once&#xD;
      all the first row will be allotted, then the next row block will be opened for enrolment. The&#xD;
      advantage of this method of randomization is that the number of patients assigned to each&#xD;
      group over time would have been approximately equal. By this, the unequal allocation of&#xD;
      sample size will be avoided. The outcome assessor and the participants involved in the&#xD;
      intervention will be blinded.&#xD;

    <description>The UPDRS scale refers to Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, and it is a rating tool used to gauge the course of Parkinson's Disease in patients. The UPDRS scale consist of te following five segments: (1) Mentation, Behaviour, and Mood, (2) ADL ,(3) Motor section,(4) Modified Hoehn and Yahr scale, (5)Schwab and England ADL scale. Each answer to the scale is evaluated by a medical professional that specializes in Parkinson's disease during patient interviews. Some sections of the UPDRS scale require multiple grades assigned to each extremity with a possible maximum of 199 points. A score of 199 on the UPDRS scale represents the worst (total disability) with a score of zero representing (no disability).</description>
