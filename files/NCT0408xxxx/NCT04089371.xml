  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation is a prospective, multi-center clinical investigation. It is anticipated&#xD;
      that a total of one hundred (100) subjects will be enrolled at approximately 5-10 sites. The&#xD;
      clinical investigation has been designed to follow the surgeon's standard of care for joint&#xD;
      arthroplasty patients, which entails clinical evaluation on a regular ongoing basis, or as&#xD;
      needed should the patient become symptomatic in the treated joint.&#xD;

      The objective of this clinical investigation is to demonstrate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy/performance of the ReUnion RFX System. Efficacy/performance of the procedure will be&#xD;
      measured by the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) Shoulder Score. Safety of the&#xD;
      ReUnion RFX System will be demonstrated through reporting of device-related intraoperative&#xD;
      and postoperative Adverse Events (AEs). Enrolled subjects will be assessed at Pre-Operative,&#xD;
      Operative/Discharge, and at 6 Weeks, 6 Months, 12 Months, 24 Months and annually thereafter&#xD;
      up to 10 years following the index procedure.&#xD;

    <description>This is a mixed outcome reporting measure, applicable for use in patients with shoulder pathology regardless of diagnosis and consists of a pain visual analog scale (VAS) and 10 functional questions. The primary endpoint of the clinical investigation is to demonstrate non-inferiority of the device to the selected literature controls, as measured by the ASES Shoulder Score at 24 Months post-operative.</description>

             and its fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is obese such that he/she produces a load on the prosthesis which can lead to&#xD;
             failure of fixation of the device or to failure of the device itself.&#xD;
