      Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in patients diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)&#xD;
      is nowadays common practice to provide comfort at the end stage of the disease. As complaints&#xD;
      vary there is the need of a non-invasive device to measure respiratory volume to objectify&#xD;
      complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ExSpiron© is a device for non-invasive monitoring of respiratory volume. The validation&#xD;
      of this monitor in patients with ALS is the aim of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the ExSpiron© delivers a valid assessment of respiratory volume in&#xD;
      patients with ALS&#xD;

      Rationale: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in patients diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral&#xD;
      sclerosis (ALS) is nowadays common practice to provide comfort at the end stage of the&#xD;
      disease. As complaints vary there is the need of a non-invasive device to measure respiratory&#xD;
      volume to objectify complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ExSpiron© is a device for non-invasive monitoring of respiratory volume. The validation&#xD;
      of this monitor in patients with ALS is the aim of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the ExSpiron© delivers a valid assessment of respiratory volume in&#xD;
      patients with ALS Objective: The primary objective is the validation of the ExSpiron©&#xD;
      non-invasive monitor in patients diagnosed with ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is an intervention study The validation of the ExSpiron© in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with ALS is done during admission on the Respiratory Care Unit (RCU) of the&#xD;
      University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG). At daytime, tidal volume (TV) and minute volume&#xD;
      (MV) will be measured during spontaneous breathing with the ExSpiron© simultaneously with a&#xD;
      pneumotachometer (gold-standard). After installation of the chest pad of the ExSpiron© and&#xD;
      the pneumotachometer, the first measurements are in sitting position. Three complete cycles&#xD;
      of ten breaths; normal breathing, slow-deep breathing and rapid-shallow breathing, will be&#xD;
      done. Between each cycle, a pause is allowed. After completing this breathing sequence, it is&#xD;
      repeated in supine position. If patients are not able to perform this in supine position,&#xD;
      because of orthopnea, an angle of 45º degree is adequate. After completing this cycle, the&#xD;
      chest pad should be left in place and the electromyography (EMG) equipment should be&#xD;
      installed. During the first night of admission, a full night of measurement of TV and MV will&#xD;
      be conducted using the ExSpiron©.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 10 patients diagnosed with ALS and an indication to start NIV, &gt;18 years of&#xD;
      age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): The ExSpiron© is a device for non-invasive monitoring of tidal&#xD;
      volumes and minute ventilation in non-intubated patients by using a disposable chest pad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main endpoint is the validation of the ExSpiron© in&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with ALS and screened positive for starting NIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: NIV has no known serious side effects. ALS patients differ in starting NIV is&#xD;
      done on the RCU while patients are monitored as standard care, the ExSpiron© is not an extra&#xD;
      risk complaints but those screened positive to start NIV are not associated with risks. The&#xD;
      intervention product, ExSpiron© is a non-invasive monitor with a chest pad attached to the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
