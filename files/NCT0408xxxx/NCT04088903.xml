  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether daratumumab, a drug that eliminates&#xD;
      antibody-producing plasma cells, can effectively lower the level of preformed antibodies in&#xD;
      patients awaiting heart transplantation. These preformed antibodies limit the number of donor&#xD;
      hearts that are compatible for the patients. If daratumumab can effectively remove preformed,&#xD;
      donor-specific antibodies, then highly allosensitized patients will have more compatible&#xD;
      hearts available to them, potentially decreasing transplant waitlist time and reducing&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive an intravenous infusion of daratumumab weekly for 8 doses and then every other week for 2 doses.&#xD;
For this dose-escalation study, the initial patients will receive a 2 mg/kg dose of daratumumab. In subsequent patients, the dose will be uptitrated to 16 mg/kg as tolerated.&#xD;
Participants will undergo laboratory testing, including for circulating antibodies, at baseline, prior to each infusion session, and at the end of the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is on an active list for a heart transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a high level of allosensitization, defined as a calculated PRA (panel&#xD;
             of reactive antibodies) of 50%, based on their antibody status at the time of entry&#xD;
             into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign an informed consent form prior to any&#xD;
             study-related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both male and female patients must use effective methods of birth control, must not&#xD;

             DNA by PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;

             1 second (FEV1) &lt;50% of predicted normal. Note that FEV1 testing is required for&#xD;
             subjects suspected of having COPD and subjects must be excluded if FEV1 is &lt;50% of&#xD;
             predicted normal.&#xD;
