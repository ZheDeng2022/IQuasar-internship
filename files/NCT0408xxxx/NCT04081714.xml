    <textblock>
      This is a single-center intermediate expanded access program to provide access to the&#xD;
      investigational product, CNM-Au8, up to thirty (30) participants diagnosed with ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CNM-Au8 treatment in ALS participants will&#xD;
      be evaluated. Visits will occur at MGH, remotely over telephone, or via tele-visit.&#xD;
      Collection of samples for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis may not be feasible&#xD;
      for visits completed remotely. Participants will be screened over up to a 4-week period prior&#xD;
      to treatment initiation. Participants who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the&#xD;
      exclusionary criteria may be enrolled into the EAP. Participants may initiate treatment on&#xD;
      the same day as the Screening visit, provided all inclusion and exclusion criteria have been&#xD;
      fulfilled prior to treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be four study periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A screening period over up to four (4) weeks (Screening Period);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Initial treatment period of twenty-four (24) weeks (Treatment Period 1);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Up to three consecutive optional follow-on treatment periods of twenty-four (24) week&#xD;
           duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Treatment Period 2,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Treatment Period 3,&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Treatment Period 4;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A four (4) week safety follow-up period (End-of-Study [EOS] Assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per protocol all participants will receive open-label oral treatment daily up to 24-weeks&#xD;
      during Treatment Period 1. Participants may optionally continue on open-label therapy for up&#xD;
      to three additional consecutive 24-week treatment periods (e.g., Treatment Period 2,&#xD;
      Treatment Period 3, Treatment Period 4) up to a maximum duration of ninety-six (96) weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At treatment discontinuation or following the end of the participant's final Treatment&#xD;
      Period, participants will complete an end of study (EOS) assessment 4-weeks following&#xD;
      discontinuation of the investigational drug product. Select visit assessments may be&#xD;
      collected remotely, via tele-visit with site staff.&#xD;

    <description>CNM-Au8 is a dark red/purple-colored liquid formulation consisting of a stable suspension of faceted clean surfaced elemental gold nanocrystals in buffered USP water with a concentration of up to 0.5 mg/mL of gold. The formulation is buffered by sodium bicarbonate present at a concentration of 0.546 mg/mL. There are no other excipients. The drug product is formulated to be taken orally and will be provided in single dose HDPE containers.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Able to understand and give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female participants aged 18 years or greater (inclusive) at the time of ALS&#xD;
             diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants whose conditions are defined as &quot;definite ALS&quot; or &quot;probable ALS&quot; or&#xD;
             &quot;possible ALS&quot; diagnostic criteria by the revised El Escorial Criteria as determined&#xD;
             by a neurologist specializing in ALS (e.g., the Principal Investigator or&#xD;
             subinvestigator at the site).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant is able to daily consume 60 mL of the investigational drug suspension&#xD;
             without substantial dysphagia, OR can intake the drug through a gastrostomy tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. In the judgement of the Investigator, the participant's expected survival is greater&#xD;
             than six- months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participants who have established care with a neurologist at the specialized ALS&#xD;
             center involved in the study and will maintain this clinical care throughout the&#xD;
             duration of the EAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
