      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of JNJ-61393215 as adjunctive treatment&#xD;
      compared to adjunctive placebo, as assessed by the change from baseline to week 6 on a&#xD;
      17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) in participants with major depressive&#xD;
      disorder (MDD) with anxious distress with a score greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 2 on item 26&#xD;
      or 27 of the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Clinician Rating -30 (IDS-C30), who have&#xD;
      a suboptimal response to current treatment with a standard antidepressant.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) Total Score at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>HAM-A scale measures the severity of a participant's anxiety, based on 14 parameters, including anxious mood, tension, fears, insomnia, somatic complaints and behavior at the interview. Each of the 14 items is rated by the clinician on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (severe). The total score ranges from 0 to 56, where higher score indicates worsening.
