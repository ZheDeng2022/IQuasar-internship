    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the dose of radiation therapy that is effective&#xD;
      in producing a treatment response, delivered over a shorter treatment period, is a safe&#xD;
      approach that causes few or mild side effects in women with newly diagnosed breast cancer or&#xD;
      DCIS who have had a lumpectomy procedure.&#xD;

&#xD;
        OR&#xD;

&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;

             pathologically negative nodes who decline or are ineligible for hormonal therapy OR&#xD;
             discontinue hormonal therapy within 3 months of initiating treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with distant metastasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with diffuse (&gt;1 quadrant or &gt;5cm) suspicious microcalcifications or patients&#xD;
             with known multicentric OR multifocal disease. (microscopic multifocal disease that&#xD;
             may be unifocal and/or appear multifocal due to sectioning is allowed after review&#xD;
             with PI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation therapy to the ipsilateral or contralateral breast or thorax.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological evidence of extensive lymphovascular invasion (LVI)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological evidence of extensive intraductal component (EIC), defined as the&#xD;
             presence of intraductal carcinoma both within the primary infiltrating ductal tumor&#xD;
             (comprising at least 25% of the tumo area) and intraductal carcinoma present clearly&#xD;
             beyond the edges of the invasive tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are not required to undergo BRCA1 and BRCA2 or other genetic mutation tests&#xD;
             in order to enroll on the study. Note: in the event a patient is tested and is found&#xD;
             to be a mutation carrier, she would be excluded from the study. It would be an&#xD;
             extremely rare/unlikely scenario for patients to be discovered BRCA positive after the&#xD;
             completion of PBI, as all patients with risk factors for BRCA mutations (positive&#xD;
             family history, Ashkenazi Jewish descent, ER-/PR-/her2-neu-negative receptor status)&#xD;
             are usually tested prior to radiation. Should such a situation exist, these patients&#xD;
             will be given the option of remaining on the breast conservation paradigm or opting&#xD;
             for mastectomy (as is done in this rare scenario is standard of care practice). The&#xD;
             patient will be replaced on the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cosmetic or reconstructive breast surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical condition such as uncontrolled infection (including HIV), uncontrolled&#xD;
             diabetes mellitus, or connective tissue diseases (lupus, systemic sclerosis, or other&#xD;
             collagen vascular diseases) that, in the opinion of the treating physician, would make&#xD;
             this protocol unreasonably hazardous for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin&#xD;
             cancers. Patients are not considered to have &quot;currently active&quot; malignancies if they&#xD;
             have completed therapy and are considered by their physicians to be at &lt;5% risk of&#xD;
             relapse within 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are already enrolled in or planning to enroll in other adjuvant systemic&#xD;
             therapy protocols for both non-invasive or invasive breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Expecting to conceive within the projected duration of the trials, starting with&#xD;
             screening visit through 180 days after the last dose of trial treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant anti-neoplastic treatment is not allowed during protocol treatment and&#xD;
             should be completed at least 2 weeks prior to commencement of protocol treatment, with&#xD;
             resolution of associated acute toxicities. Bisphosponates are permitted without&#xD;
             restriction even during protocol treatment. Note: This does not apply to hormonal&#xD;
             therapies such as tamoxifen or AIs, which are permitted. This does not apply to&#xD;
             anti-Her2 therapies such as trastuzumab or TDM-1, which are also permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing therapy with other investigational agents. Patients may not be receiving any&#xD;
             other investigational agents.&#xD;
