  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interest of obturator nerve block for analgesia in total hip arthroplasty remains&#xD;
      controversial. This regional anesthesia procedure could provide post-operative pain relief as&#xD;
      obturator nerve is responsible for innervation of the internal part of the hip joint capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized double-blind study aims to assess obturator nerve block for post-operative&#xD;
      analgesia in total hip arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the surgery, an ultrasound guided obturator nerve block will be performed with either&#xD;
      20cc of saline or ropivacaine 0.2% (a long-acting local anesthetics). After regional&#xD;
      anesthesia, a general anesthesia will be performed for intraoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess post-operative pain management during the first 24 hours. Ability&#xD;
      to walk the day of the surgery will also be collected.&#xD;

      The best strategy to provide post-operative analgesia in total hip arthroplasty (THA) remains&#xD;
      controversial. Many procedures have been descripted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent anatomical studies have reported that obturator nerve provide innervation of the&#xD;
      internal part of the hip joint capsule. Obturator nerve block could be of major interest as&#xD;
      it might improve post-operative analgesia without providing motor block of the quadriceps&#xD;
      muscle. This could be associated with an early ability to walk and enhanced recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized double-blind study aims to assess obturator nerve block after THA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After information, written informed consent will be obtained from all subjects before&#xD;
      inclusion. At patient arrival in the anesthetic room, the research assistant will check the&#xD;
      patient's consent. Using a computer-generated random number table, patients will be&#xD;
      randomized in two-treatment groups by resource not part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have planned to include patients aged ≥18 years who were scheduled for primary THA under&#xD;
      general anesthesia at the Elective Surgery Center, Clinique Medipole Garonne, Toulouse,&#xD;
      France. The Elective Surgery Center annually performs approximately 1500 total hip&#xD;
      arthroplasties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are revision of hip arthroplasty, pregnancy, breast feeding, significant&#xD;
      psychiatric disturbances, history of relevant drug allergy, chronic pain, current use oral&#xD;
      morphine or equivalents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obturator nerve block will be performed before general anesthesia as descripted by Nielsen&#xD;
      (RAPM, 2019). A linear transducer (X-Porte, Fujifilm SonoSite, Bothell, Washington, USA) will&#xD;
      be oriented in the transverse plane and placed in the inguinal crease. The tail of the&#xD;
      transducer will be tilted distal in order to visualize the pectineus muscle (medial to the&#xD;
      femoral vessels) at its insertion at the superior pubic ramus superficial to the external&#xD;
      obturator muscle. An 80 mm nerve block needle (SonoPlex, PAJUNK Medizintechnologie,&#xD;
      Geisingen, Germany) will be inserted in-plane from the lateral end of the transducer and&#xD;
      advanced until the tip of the needle will be inside the interfascial plane between the&#xD;
      pectineus and the obturator externus muscles. 20 milliliters of either ropivacaine 2 mg/mL or&#xD;
      isotonic saline-depending on random group allocation-will be injected in the interfacial&#xD;
      plane between the pectineus and external obturator muscles. Medication will be prepared by a&#xD;
      staff member who won't be involved in the study and delivered in unidentifiable syringes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As is common in our practice for patients undergoing THA, a standardized general anesthetic&#xD;
      technique will be used for all patients including pre-administration of dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      (1µg/kg) over 30 minutes, induction with ketamine (0.5 mg/kg), propofol (~3 mg/kg), and&#xD;
      dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg) and maintenance with continuous propofol (~7 mg/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients received a standardized intra-operative analgesic strategy including systemic&#xD;
      acetaminophen 1000mg, ketoprofen 100mg and nefopam 20mg. A local infiltration of local&#xD;
      anesthetics (ropivacaine 0.2%) will be performed by the surgeon as descripted by Kerr. The&#xD;
      first injection will be performed into the tissues around the rim of the acetabulum, focusing&#xD;
      on both the joint capsule if it remains, and around the exposed gluteal and adductor muscles.&#xD;
      The second injection will be made into the external rotators, gluteus tendon, and iliotibial&#xD;
      band. The third injection will be made into the subcutaneous tissues under the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), patients will be assessed for pain using a verbal&#xD;
      rating scale (VRS) (VRS, 0=no pain, 10=worst pain). Patients suffering from pain (VRS &gt; 4/10)&#xD;
      will receive oxycodone 2 mg intravenous boluses / 3 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative analgesic regimen for the first 24 hours' period will include acetaminophen&#xD;
      1000 mg orally every 6 hours, ibuprofen 400 mg orally every 8 hours and oxycodone 10 mg&#xD;
      orally every 6 hours in case of VRS &gt; 4/10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain and adverse effects will be assessed each 6 hours during the first 24 hours. The day of&#xD;
      the surgery, the ability to ambulate will be assessed by physiotherapists using a 4 point&#xD;
      scale (0: Unable to get up; 1: walk &lt;10m; 2: walk between 10 - 50m; 3: walk &gt; 50m).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's follow up ends at either the 24th hour of hospitalization or at patient discharge&#xD;
      in day case surgery.&#xD;
