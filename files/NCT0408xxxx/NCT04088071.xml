  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this registry is to obtain real-world clinical experience of&#xD;
      Paroxysmal (PAF) and Persistent (PsAF) Atrial Fibrillation ablation radiofrequency (RF)&#xD;
      technologies. Data from the registry will be used to assess clinical outcomes, including&#xD;
      procedural efficiency, safety, and long-term, effectiveness of catheter ablation with novel&#xD;
      RF technologies in PAF and PsAF patients.&#xD;

      The REAL AF Registry is an observational, prospective, multi-center, non-randomized registry&#xD;
      designed to obtain real-world clinical experience of Paroxysmal and Persistent ablation RF&#xD;
      technologies (e.g., THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH速, THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH速 SF). Future new contact&#xD;
      force technologies may be included as they become available in the market. Patient&#xD;
      assessments will occur at the following time points: 1) pre-ablation, 2) procedure, 3) 10-12&#xD;
      weeks, 4) 6 months (monitor only) and 5) 1 year post ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this registry is to assess clinical outcomes, including procedural&#xD;
      efficiency, safety, long-term, effectiveness of RF ablations in the treatment of patients&#xD;
      with Paroxysmal or Persistent atrial fibrillation. The outcomes of the registry are: 1) long&#xD;
      term effectiveness defined as freedom from atrial arrhythmia recurrence post 90 day blanking&#xD;
      period, and 2) acute and late onset complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sites selected for this registry will already have the following pre and post procedure&#xD;
      assessments as part of their standard of care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient assessments at the following time points: (1) pre-ablation or baseline, (2)&#xD;
      procedure, (3) 10-12 weeks, (4) 6 months (monitor only) and (5) 1 year post ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre ablation/baseline assessment should include: TTE (within 6 months of procedure),&#xD;
      CHADS2Vasc, sleep apnea, AAD status, OAC, Medical and Arrhythmia History 10-12 Week Follow-Up&#xD;
      Office Visit: Physician evaluation, AAD status, OAC usage, repeat TTE, and Arrhythmia&#xD;
      Reoccurrence and Treatment Assessment Monitoring: 96-hour continuous heart rhythm monitor&#xD;
      scheduled at 6 months and 12 months post ablation, with an event monitor ordered as needed&#xD;
      for symptomatic arrhythmias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 Month Follow up Office Visit: Physician evaluation, AF Type, AF Monitoring method, Sleep&#xD;
      apnea, Post-procedure arrhythmia treatments, AF related symptoms and QOL improvement, AAD and&#xD;
      OAC usage, CHA2DS2VASC and Arrhythmia Reoccurrence and Treatment Assessment&#xD;
