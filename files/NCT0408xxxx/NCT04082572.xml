    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works before surgery in treating patients&#xD;
      with mismatch repair deficient solid cancers that have spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes&#xD;
      (locally advanced). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help&#xD;
      the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells&#xD;
      to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety of neo-adjuvant pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      (unresectable primary cancer or resectable primary cancer with a high chance of recurrence)&#xD;
      mismatch repair protein deficiency (dMMR) solid organ tumors by Common Terminology Criteria&#xD;
      for Adverse Events (CTCAE) assessed toxicity and post-surgical complication assessment by the&#xD;
      Clavien-Dindo classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the rate of complete pathological response for patients who undergo surgical&#xD;
      resection following at least 3 doses of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To quantify the rate of organ sparing at 1 year for all patients treated with one dose of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab (intent to treat) and those patients who receive at least 3 doses of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant pembrolizumab and decline to undergo surgical resection and opt to continue&#xD;
      receiving pembrolizumab for a total of 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess radiographic tumor response to neoadjuvant pembrolizumab. III. To estimate the&#xD;
      relapse-free survival and overall survival in all enrolled participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the overall rates of pathological response to neoadjuvant pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess the rate of complete pathological response (intent to treat) for patients who&#xD;
      undergo surgical resection following at least 1 dose of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 21 days for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients who do not respond to pembrolizumab and stop the treatment after 2 doses may undergo&#xD;
      surgery within 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 6 weeks for 1&#xD;
      year, every 12 weeks, and then every 6 months for up to 2 years.&#xD;
