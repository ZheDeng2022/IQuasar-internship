    <textblock>
      According to the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes by the American Diabetes Association,&#xD;
      people with diabetes should aim for 30 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic&#xD;
      exercise at least 5 days a week or a total of 150 minutes per week and doing some type of&#xD;
      strength training at least 2 times per week in addition to aerobic activity. However, the&#xD;
      effects of different forms and intervals of exercise on glycemic control are not well&#xD;
      established. Exercise increases the risk of hypoglycemia both during and several hours after&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several strategies to avoid hypoglycemia during exercise. The most common strategy&#xD;
      is to reduce insulin and to take carbohydrates before the exercise starts. Short-acting&#xD;
      insulin analogs have a duration of approximately four hours, thus reductions need to be&#xD;
      planned and done well in advance before the exercise starts. Since different types of&#xD;
      exercise (aerobic, strength training or high intensity training) affect blood glucose in&#xD;
      different ways and most exercise sessions include a combination of the types, these&#xD;
      strategies are often associated with difficulties in obtaining stable blood glucose. The&#xD;
      American Diabetes Association guidelines do not explicitly recommend a daily workout routine&#xD;
      but outline recommendations for weekly amounts of exercise as there is currently insufficient&#xD;
      evidence on the ideal timing, frequency and duration of exercise for preventing hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: in people with type 1 diabetes, time in hypoglycemia can be reduced if exercise&#xD;
      is performed daily over five consecutive days compared to the same total amount of exercise&#xD;
      performed at 2 days with at least 2 days interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: to evaluate the impact of the same total amount of exercise split into either five&#xD;
      consecutive sessions or two sessions with at least 2 days in between on percentage of time&#xD;
      spent in hypoglycemia and other glycemic parameters in people with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;

      The participants will go through two interventions: Exercise one session per day for five&#xD;
      consecutive days and Exercise one session per day for two days within five days. The exercise&#xD;
      session will start with anaerobic (push-ups, back-curls, sit-ups, triceps-dips and jumps)&#xD;
      exercise followed by aerobic exercise (moderate intensity of running, walking or cycling).&#xD;
      Between the two intervention periods, there will be a wash-out period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: 'Exercise one session per day for five consecutive days'. Duration per session:&#xD;
      Anaerobic: 4 min, Aerobic: 30 min. Sessions per intervention period: Five. Total duration per&#xD;
      intervention period: Anaerobic: 20 min. Aerobic: 150 min. Total: 170 min&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:Exercise one session per day for two days within five days. Duration per&#xD;
      session: Anaerobe: 10 min, Aerobe: 75 min. Sessions per intervention period: 2. Total&#xD;
      duration per intervention period: Anaerob: 20 min Aerobe: 150 min Total: 170 min&#xD;
