    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients hospitalized with an acute motor or visual relapse will be&#xD;
      consented. Factor VIII-related labs will be systematically drawn for six months. During this&#xD;
      time, patients will be followed with clinical assessments including: Expanded Disability&#xD;
      Status Scale (EDSS), Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC), Low Contrast Sloan&#xD;
      Letter Chart Testing, Symbol Digital Modality Test (SDMT), and NeuroQol. MRIs of the brain,&#xD;
      cervical spine, and thoracic spine with and without contrast will be obtained. All patients&#xD;
      will be treated with 1 gram IV solumedrol daily for five days per standard care. Clinical,&#xD;
      imaging, and Factor VIII-related lab data individually or in aggregate will be correlated&#xD;
      with relapse presence, severity, and extent of recovery following standard intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      solumedrol treatment&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The identification of blood tests that detect patients having Multiple Sclerosis (MS)&#xD;
      relapses in real time could lead to a new era of MS relapse treatment. Accidental, anecdotal&#xD;
      clinical observations suggest that transient upregulation of the intrinsic coagulation&#xD;
      pathway, namely with elevated von Willebrand Factor antigen levels (vWF) and increased Factor&#xD;
      VIII activity, occur with some MS relapses and that the higher the elevated plasma values,&#xD;
      the more glucocorticoid therapy required to achieve clinical improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten adult patients with relapsing remitting MS with or without secondary progression will be&#xD;
      consented and enrolled in this longitudinal clinical trial. As a standard of care all&#xD;
      patients will be treated daily with one gram IV solumedrol for five days, and all patients&#xD;
      will have performed standard MRI's of the brain, cervical spine, and thoracic spine with and&#xD;
      without IV contrast during hospital admission, which may occur after Solumedrol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to this standard of care, patients will have a panel of labs drawn on Days: 1&#xD;
      (prior to any solumedrol treatment), 7, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 135, and 180. Neurological&#xD;
      clinical assessments, comprising of assessing the EDSS score, the MSFC index (that looks at&#xD;
      ambulation, hand/arm coordination, and cognitive function, comprised of the 25 foot timed&#xD;
      walking tests, with and without any assistive devices if possible), LCSLC test, SDMT, and&#xD;
      Neuro QoL will be conducted on Days: 1, 7, 30, 90, 180. Individual and aggregate laboratory&#xD;
      values, neurological clinical assessment results, and MRI findings will be correlated for the&#xD;
      presence of a MS relapse, severity of relapse, and extent of recovery from the relapse.&#xD;
      Patients and evaluators will be blinded to the lab results.&#xD;
