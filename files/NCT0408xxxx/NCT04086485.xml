    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A neuroendocrine tumor is a rare type of tumor. It comes from body cells called&#xD;
      neuroendocrine cells. Sometimes, these tumors develop in the gastrointestinal tract and&#xD;
      pancreas. Researchers want to find out if a combination of drugs can shrink these tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if people with certain neuroendocrine tumors can take a combination of 2 drugs,&#xD;
      Lutathera and Olaparib, without having severe side effects, and if this treatment makes the&#xD;
      tumors shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults 18 and older who have a neuroendocrine tumor in the pancreas or intestine that cannot&#xD;
      be cured by surgery and has somatostatin receptors on the cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under protocol 01-C-0129. They may have a tumor biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will get Lutathera through an intravenous (IV) infusion every 8 weeks&#xD;
      for 4 cycles. One cycle is 8 weeks. Each cycle includes a follow-up visit at week 4. For the&#xD;
      IV, a small plastic tube is put into an arm vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also take Olaparib by mouth twice a day for 4 weeks of each cycle. They&#xD;
      will use a medicine diary to track the doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants will have physical exams. They will have blood and urine&#xD;
      tests. They will fill out questionnaires about their general well-being and function. Their&#xD;
      heart function will be tested. They will have scans of their chest, abdomen, and pelvis. One&#xD;
      type of scan will use an IV infusion of a radioactive tracer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow-up visit about 4 weeks after treatment ends. Then they will&#xD;
      have follow-up visits every 12 weeks for 3 years. Then they will have yearly phone calls....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas are a rare and&#xD;
           heterogeneous, but clinically important, group of neoplasms with unique tumor biology,&#xD;
           natural history, and clinical management issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  While the treatment of localized NETs is surgical resection, a variety of therapeutic&#xD;
           options are available for patients with advanced NETs. These include medical control of&#xD;
           excess hormone levels and associated symptoms, cytoreductive surgery for patients with&#xD;
           advanced disease, radioembolization, chemoembolization, systemic chemotherapy,&#xD;
           interferon, longacting somatostatin analogs, receptor-targeted radionuclide therapy, and&#xD;
           or liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Somatostatin receptors (SSTR) have been shown to be overexpressed in a number of human&#xD;
           tumors, including neuroblastoma, prostate cancer, pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas, and&#xD;
           NETs, among many others.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lu-177-DOTATATE (Lutathera) is a SSTR-agonist agent which emits ionizing radiation that&#xD;
           causes DNA damage to its target cells through both direct and indirect mechanisms. In&#xD;
           addition, ionizing radiation has also been shown to induce cell death through what is&#xD;
           known as the bystander effect, a phenomenon where cellular signaling from irradiated&#xD;
           cells towards non-irradiated cells induces cellular damage and eventually death in&#xD;
           nearby surrounding cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Olaparib is a PARP inhibitor indicated as monotherapy in patients with deleterious or&#xD;
           suspected deleterious germline BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer who have been&#xD;
           treated with three or more prior lines of chemotherapy. Olaparib has an established&#xD;
           safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      profile and it is under investigation in several different cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The rationale behind using combination therapies in cancer stems from the potential of&#xD;
      synergistic mechanisms of action of the involved agents. Olaparib is a PARP-inhibitor which&#xD;
      blocks the repair of single-stranded DNA breaks and is especially effective when combined&#xD;
      with other agents which induces DNA damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Characterize the safety profile and tolerability of the olaparib + Lu-177-DOTATATE&#xD;
                combination&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) dose of the combination using the 3+3&#xD;
                dose escalation design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Measure the Best Overall Response Rate (BOR) by RECIST 1.1 at the MTD dose at&#xD;
                completion of 4 cycles of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical diagnosis of GEP-NET disease, histologically confirmed to be consistent with&#xD;
           neuroendocrine tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inoperable disease (metastatic, non-candidate for surgery with curative intent, locally&#xD;
           advanced into vessels or other critical structures, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &gt;=18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Must have presence of SSTR+ disease as documented by positive Ga-68-DOTATATE PET scan&#xD;
           within 12 weeks prior to anticipated treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG Performance Status &lt;= 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Open-label, single-arm, single-center, phase 1/2 study evaluating the safety and&#xD;
           efficacy of the Lu-177-DOTATATE + olaparib combination in patients with inoperable&#xD;
           GEP-NET&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For phase 1, a standard 3+3 design will be used to determine MTD. It is estimated that&#xD;
           approximately 15 to 24 patients will be required. Phase 2 will involve the use of a&#xD;
           Simon optimal two-stage design to determine sample size and interim stopping rule&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assuming a combination of inevaluable patients or loss-to-follow-up of 10%, up to 24&#xD;
           patients will be accrued to phase 1 and 15 patients to phase 2 including the 6 phase 1&#xD;
           patients at MTD, with a total accrual ceiling of 37 patients to allow for a small number&#xD;
           of inevaluable patients&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NOTE: A female is not of childbearing potential if a prior history of hysterectomy&#xD;
             with bilateral oophorectomy or other procedure has rendered the patient surgically&#xD;
             sterile, or &gt;1 years since last menstruation. Must have outside&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pre-clinical data indicate that the study drugs can have adverse effects on&#xD;
             embryofetal survival and development. It is further not known whether olaparib or its&#xD;
             metabolites are found in seminal fluid. For these reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of childbearing potential and their partners, who are sexually active, must&#xD;
                  agree to the use of 2 highly effective forms of contraception in combination&#xD;
                  (male condom plus one of the methods listed below) or must totally/truly abstain&#xD;
                  from any form of sexual intercourse. This should be started from the signing of&#xD;
                  the informed consent, throughout their participation in the study and for at&#xD;
                  least 7 month after the last dose of the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male patients must use a condom during treatment and for 4 months after the last&#xD;
                  dose of study drugs when having sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman or with&#xD;
                  a woman of childbearing potential. Female partners of male patients should also&#xD;
                  use a highly effective form of contraception (see below) if they are of&#xD;
                  childbearing potential. Male patients should not donate sperm throughout the&#xD;
                  period of taking olaparib and for 4 months following the last dose of the study&#xD;
                  drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Acceptable birth control methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Total sexual abstinence i.e., refrain from any form of sexual intercourse in&#xD;
                       line with the patients usual and/or preferred lifestyle. Abstinence must be&#xD;
                       for the total duration of the study treatment and for at least 7 month (for&#xD;
                       female patients) or 4 months (for male patients) after the last dose of&#xD;
                       study treatment. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar ovulation,&#xD;
                       symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable&#xD;
                       methods of contraception. Vasectomised sexual partner PLUS male condom. With&#xD;
                       participant assurance that partner received post-vasectomy confirmation of&#xD;
                       azoospermia.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Tubal occlusion PLUS male condom&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Normal and low dose combined oral pills PLUS male condom&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Hormonal shot or injection (e.g., Depo-Provera) PLUS male condom&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Intrauterine system device (e.g., levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine&#xD;
                       system -Mirena(R)) PLUS male condom&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol transdermal system PLUS male condom&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Intravaginal device (e.g., ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel) PLUS male&#xD;
                       condom&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Cerazette (desogestrel) PLUS male condom. Cerazette is currently the only&#xD;
                       highly efficacious progesterone based pill.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have any GEP-NET lesions that are negative by Ga-68-DOTATATE-PET imaging&#xD;
             but positive by FDG-PET imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with study drugs, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
