    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to test whether CD22-CAR T cells can be successfully&#xD;
      made from immune cells collected from pediatric and young adult subjects with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies (leukemia and lymphoma). Another purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to test the safety and cancer killing ability of a cell therapy against a new cancer&#xD;
      target (CD22).&#xD;

             other clinically significant cardiac disease within 12 months of enrollment.&#xD;

             this study.&#xD;
