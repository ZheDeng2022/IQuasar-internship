      This is a 6-month double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment for acute/subacute back pain (carbidopa/levodopa and celecoxib).The&#xD;
      dosage of carbidopa/levodopa is 25/100mg.After screening, all eligible patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to 3 different groups, with each receives a 12-week treatment of&#xD;
      &quot;carbidopa/levodopa+celecoxib (LDP+CLX)&quot;, of &quot;placebo+celecoxib (PLC+CLX)&quot;, and of&#xD;
      &quot;placebo+placebo (PLC+PLC)&quot;. For each group, a subsequent 12-week follow-up efficacy&#xD;
      evaluation will be conducted by telephone .At the end of the 24-week study, we will&#xD;
      understand the durability of the treatment. During the drug treatment period for pain, all&#xD;
      participants should return to the clinical follow-up center on week 0, 2, 6 and 12 to assess&#xD;
      pain condition, properness of treatment and side effects .In the 24-week study of drug&#xD;
      treatment and after treatment follow-up, pain and safety assessments will be conducted by&#xD;
      telephone, at week 9, 16, and 20.In addition, all participants will be assessed daily with a&#xD;
      mobile app for pain, mood and behavior.Participants will be scanned for brain structure&#xD;
      images (T1), resting functional images (RS-fMRI) and diffusion tensor images (DTI) at the&#xD;
      second follow-up visit (week 0) and at the end of study (week 24).&#xD;
