  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Doses of intrathecal bupivacaine based on patients either height or height and weight has&#xD;
      shown to lower the risk of maternal hypotension with similar quality of anesthesia compared&#xD;
      to conventional doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice there is a tendency of reducing the dose of bupivacaine as either low&#xD;
      fixed dose or using the doses based on either height and weight or height (0.06mg/cm) alone&#xD;
      in parturient with short stature. However, there is lack of evidence regarding the&#xD;
      appropriate dose required in this group of patients. Therefore, our aim is to compare the&#xD;
      height versus height and weight based intrathecal bupivacaine dose for elective caesarean on&#xD;
      maternal haemodynamics in short stature patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Spinal induced hypotension in women undergoing caesarean section (CS) is the most common&#xD;
      unwanted effect. The dose of intrathecal local anesthetic is the main determining factor that&#xD;
      balances between successful block and an incidence of maternal hypotension. Although lowering&#xD;
      the doses of intrathecal bupivacaine provides better maternal hemodynamic stability it&#xD;
      compromises the quality of anesthesia. Moreover, there is no consensus regarding the cut-off&#xD;
      at which the dose can be defined as low. Doses based on patients either height or height and&#xD;
      weight has shown to lower the risk of maternal hypotension with similar quality of anesthesia&#xD;
      compared to conventional doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice there is a tendency of reducing the dose of bupivacaine as either low&#xD;
      fixed dose or using the doses based on either height and weight or height (0.06mg/cm) alone&#xD;
      in parturient with short stature. However, there is lack of evidence regarding the&#xD;
      appropriate dose required in this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is to compare the height versus height and weight based intrathecal bupivacaine dose&#xD;
      for elective caesarean on maternal haemodynamics in short stature patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doses of intrathecal bupivacaine for elective caesarean section based on Harten chart is&#xD;
      available from the following reference- Harten JM, Boyne I, Hannah P, Varveris D, Brown A.&#xD;
      Effects of a height and weight adjusted dose of local anaesthetic for spinal anaesthesia for&#xD;
      elective Caesarean section. Anaesthesia 2005; 60: 348-53.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent for the participation in the study will be obtained during pre-anaesthetic assessment&#xD;
      visits in the evening before surgery. The investigator will also educate the patients&#xD;
      regarding the use of numeric rating scale scores. Preoperative anxiety will be recorded in&#xD;
      numerical rating scale scores where 0 is no anxiety and 10 is maximum anxiety patient&#xD;
      reported. The enrolled subjects will be randomly assigned to 2 equal groups (allocation&#xD;
      ratio, 1:1) according to the codes generated from the website (www.sealedenvleop.com) using&#xD;
      the variable block size of 4, 6 and 8. The group allocation will be concealed in sequentially&#xD;
      numbered, sealed opaque envelopes that will be opened by the anaesthesia assistant not&#xD;
      involved in the study only after the patient arrives in the operating room. The patient will&#xD;
      be fasted for at least eight hours and will receive antibiotics, ranitidine 50 mg and&#xD;
      metoclopramide 10 mg intravenously via 18-gauge cannula before transfer to the operation&#xD;
      room. In the operating table patient will be laid supine with a wedge under right buttock and&#xD;
      standard monitors (electrocardiography, pulse oximetry, and noninvasive BP) will be applied.&#xD;
      Thereafter, successive three readings of heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP)&#xD;
      will be taken at 2 minutes interval with difference not exceeding 10%. The average of these&#xD;
      recordings will be documented by the investigators as baseline parameters. To maintain&#xD;
      blinding, the investigator will leave the operating room and will return immediately once the&#xD;
      spinal injection is initiated. Subarachnoid block will be performed by the attending&#xD;
      anesthesiologist not involved in the study in the sitting position at the L3-L4 or L4-L5&#xD;
      vertebral interspace using a 25-gauge spinal needle via midline approach. The study solution&#xD;
      will be administered according to the group allocated. In Group A the dose of heavy&#xD;
      bupivacaine will be based on height and weight and in group B the dose will be based on&#xD;
      patient's height (0.06 mg/cm). 10 microgram fentanyl will be added to bupivacaine in both&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
