  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well lutathera works in treating patients with meningioma&#xD;
      that cannot be treated with surgery (inoperable) and is growing, spreading, or getting worse&#xD;
      (progressive) after external beam radiation therapy. Lutathera is a radioactive drug&#xD;
      administered in the vein that is designed to target and kill cancer cells. The goal of this&#xD;
      study is to determine whether this drug is safe and effective in treating meningiomas that&#xD;
      progress after radiation treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the efficacy of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate (LUTATHERA) treatment in patients&#xD;
      with recurrent grade 1 meningioma as measured by 6-month progression-free survival (PFS)&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the efficacy of LUTATHERA treatment in patients with recurrent grade 2 or 3&#xD;
      meningioma as measured by 6-month PFS rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall survival (by grade cohort) of patients with recurrent meningioma&#xD;
      during or after treatment of LUTATHERA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the progression-free survival (by grade cohort) of patients with recurrent&#xD;
      meningioma during or after treatment of LUTATHERA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the toxicity of LUTATHERA treatment in patients with recurrent meningioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the impact of treatment on the patient's quality of life (QOL) using the&#xD;
      Promise-10, Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), European Quality of Life Five Dimension Five Level&#xD;
      (EQ-5D-5L), and Mayo Patient Survey National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)-Functional&#xD;
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) Brain Symptom Index Questionnaire-24 (FBrSI-24) (version&#xD;
      2) instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the response assessment between standard of care brain magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) and gallium Ga 68-DOTATATE (68Ga-DOTATATE) positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
      imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the best objective response (McDonald criteria) of patients with recurrent&#xD;
      meningioma during or after treatment of LUTATHERA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the duration of local control with death as a competing risk (by grade&#xD;
      cohort) of patients with recurrent meningioma during or after treatment of LUTATHERA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To perform a quantitative dosimetric analysis of radiation dose delivered with lutathera:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Va. To determine intratherapeutic dosimetry for the target meningioma. Vb. To correlate&#xD;
      treatment response of lutathera with target dose received. Vc. To determine intratherapeutic&#xD;
      dosimetry for kidneys and other abdominal organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive gallium Ga 68-DOTATATE intravenously (IV) and undergo a PET/MRI before&#xD;
      cycles 1 and 4. Patients then receive lutetium Lu 177 dotatate intravenously (IV) over 30-40&#xD;
      minutes. Cycles repeat every 8 weeks for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      then annually for 3 years.&#xD;

    <description>Will be defined as the number of evaluable patients not having progressive disease or death within six months of the first day of treatment divided by the total number of evaluable patients. The proportion of successes in each cohort will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients.

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life (QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>QOL will be measured using the standard survey series for this population of patients, and QOL trajectory over time will be examined. The survey series includes Promise-10, Brief Fatigue Inventory, European Quality of Life Five Dimension Five Level, and Mayo Patient Survey National Comprehensive Cancer Network-Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Brain Symptom Index Questionnaire-24 (version 2). The main QOL impact will be measured with differences from baseline to 6, 12 and 24 months in patient reported outcomes via the symptom scales from the above surveys. All other QOL analyses will be exploratory and may include change from baseline to all time points using t-test and generalized linear models to test for changes at each time point and non-zero slopes, respectfully. No formal comparisons will be made among the cohorts.</description>
