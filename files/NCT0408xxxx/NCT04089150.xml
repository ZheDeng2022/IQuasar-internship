      This is a prospective, multicentre randomised, phase II clinical trial to evaluate safety and&#xD;
      activity of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in addition to chemotherapy in patients&#xD;
      with high-risk and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC) and locally advanced&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer (LAPC). High risk defined as any patient with tumour &gt;4cm, extrapancreatic&#xD;
      extension or node positive disease.&#xD;
