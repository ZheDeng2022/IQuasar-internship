  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is learn more about long-term treatment of children and teenagers&#xD;
      with ADHD for whom earlier stimulant therapy did not work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has two parts (A and B). In Part A, participants will take tablets of TAK-503,&#xD;
      atomoxetine or placebo. Participants who take placebo tablets in Part A, will take TAK-503&#xD;
      tablets in Part B. Participants who take TAK-503 or atomoxetine tablets in Part A, will be&#xD;
      treated with TAK-503 in Part B.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in two parts Part A and Part B. Part A is a double-blinded,&#xD;
      double-dummy, placebo-controlled study with an atomoxetine arm as an active reference to&#xD;
      TAK-503. Eligible participants with ADHD will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio among TAK-503,&#xD;
      atomoxetine, and placebo treatment arms for the first 18 weeks of double-blinded treatment.&#xD;
      At the end of the first 18 weeks, participants in the placebo treatment arm will rollover to&#xD;
      Part B of the study directly for an additional 52 weeks of open-label TAK-503 treatment.&#xD;
      Participants in the TAK-503 and atomoxetine treatment arms will continue in Part A at the&#xD;
      same optimized dose for the remainder of the 52 weeks. At the end of 52 weeks of&#xD;
      double-blinded treatment and evaluation in Part A, participants in the TAK-503 and&#xD;
      atomoxetine treatment arms will rollover into Part B of the study for an additional 1 year of&#xD;
      open-label TAK-503 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      26 JUNE 2020: The temporary enrollment stop of new patients into this study due to the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic has been lifted in one or more countries/sites, and the study is now again&#xD;
      enrolling new patients. However, some countries/sites may still have paused the enrollment of&#xD;
      new patients due to the pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 APRIL 2020: Enrollment of new patients into this study has been paused due to the COVID-19&#xD;
      situation. The duration of this pause is dependent on the leveling and control of the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;

The PDSS is a self-reported assessment of daytime sleepiness in children aged 11 to 15 years. PDSS questionnaire was designed to be easy to administer, score, and interpret. Sleepiness-related questions are based on previous research of situations that can be sensitive to sleep loss in this age group. The 8 questions are scored on Likert-scale from 0 to 4 (never=0; seldom=1; sometimes=2; frequently=3; always=4). The total score on the PDSS can range from 0 (never sleepy) to 32 (always sleepy). PDSS will be assessed at specified time points in both Part A and Part B.</description>

    <description>The ADHD-RS-5 (DuPaul et al., 2016) is used widely by mental health, educational, and medical practitioners in screening, diagnosis, and treatment evaluation to determine the frequency and severity of ADHD symptoms and impairments in children and adolescents. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms is measured by the investigator-administered ADHD Rating Scale-5 (ADHD-RS-5) total score and hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention symptoms as subscale scores. The ADHD-RS-5 is based on the diagnostic criteria for ADHD as described in the DSM-5 and consists of 2 symptom subscales, inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity, each with 9 items and a total scale of 18 items. Each item in the subscale is scored with a value ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms). The total score can range from 0 to 54. ADHD-RS-5 Total Score and Subscales wiil be assessed at specified time points in both Part A and Part B.</description>

    <description>The Conners 3 is a focused diagnostic tool for the assessment of ADHD and associated learning, behavior, and emotional problems in children 6 to 18 years of age. The C3PS is completed by a child's parent/guardian and is comprised of 45 items with subsets of items related to six content scales: inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, executive functioning, learning problems, defiance/aggression and peer relations. The parent rates his/her child on the first 43 items of the C3PS using a 4-point Likert scale (0-3; where 0=not at all true [never, seldom] and 3=very much true [very often, very frequently]) based on past month; the last 2 items are fill-in-the-blank and do not contribute to the raw score(s). Raw scores are converted to T-scores. Lower change from baseline T-scores (&lt;0) represent a better outcome. C3PS Total score will be assessed in both Part A and Part B.</description>
