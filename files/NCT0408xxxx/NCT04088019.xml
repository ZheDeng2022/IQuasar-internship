  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the proportion of clinical improvement, the score&#xD;
      changing of type 1 interferon selected gene expression, and analysis of transcriptomics&#xD;
      profiling in patients with idiopathic uveitis positive IGRA before and after receiving&#xD;
      Anti-Tuberculosis Therapy (ATT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hopefully, by conducting this research, we are able to provide valid data that demonstrate&#xD;
      the advantages/disadvantages usage of Anti-Tuberculosis Therapy in patients with idiopathic&#xD;
      uveitis IGRA positive that correlate with type I IFN. This research is a part of our efforts&#xD;
      in discovering bio-marker candidates of idiopathic uveitis IGRA positive clinical patients&#xD;
      who will benefit from the ATT administration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diagnostic of Idiopathic Uveitis IGRA Positive patients were still unclear. This situation&#xD;
      happens because it is still can't be explained if the uveitis from the patients was caused by&#xD;
      mycobacterium tuberculosis or not which leads to doubtfulness for Anti-Tuberculosis Treatment&#xD;
      (ATT). This study aims to help to provide evidence on whether ATT usage for Idiopathic&#xD;
      Uveitis IGRA Positive would bring beneficial impact for the patients. This study will try to&#xD;
      analyze the data from clinical improvements, Type 1 Interferon changes, and transcriptomics&#xD;
      analysis from the patients.&#xD;

    <description>Clinical improvement of uveitis patients with IGRA positive after receiving complete Anti Tuberculosis Therapy is measured by using The Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) inflammation degree. Clinical improvement definition is decreasing of inflammation degree up to two degrees or becoming 0 degree. Meanwhile, clinical failure is defined by increasing of inflammation degree or decreasing of inflammation degree up to one degree/ not becoming 0 degree or unchanged degree of first to fourth degree.</description>

    <intervention_name>Fixed drug combination (FDC) of ATT and Oral steroid</intervention_name>
    <description>In the first two week, patients receive FDC of ATT only. Oral steroid start to be given in week three.&#xD;
The ATT regiment is continued for up to 6 months or more, in accordance with WHO guidelines. In the first two months the antibiotic combination given consisted of isoniazid (INH), rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. The next four months or continuation phases, the ATT given is rifampicin and isoniazid.&#xD;
The following dosage and administration of oral steroids will be given to patients, according to guidelines from the American Journal of Ophthalmologists (Douglas A. Jabs et al, 2000):&#xD;
Initial dose: 1mg/kg/day, with maximum adult oral dose 60-80 mg/kg and maintenance dose less than or equal to 10 mg/day. The tapering schedule: Over 40 mg/day, decrease by 10 mg/day every 1-2 weeks, 40-20 mg/day, decrease by 5 mg/day every 1-2 weeks, 20-10 mg/day, decrease by 2.5 mg/day every 1-2 weeks, 10-0 mg/day, decrease by 1 to 2.5 mg/day every 1-4 weeks.</description>
