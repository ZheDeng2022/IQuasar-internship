  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a common childhood sleep disorder with&#xD;
      an incidence of 3% . Studies have confirmed that OSAHS can cause multiple systemic&#xD;
      dysfunction in children, especially affecting cognitive function . Cognitive function is an&#xD;
      important part of human advanced neurological activities, including neurobehavioral functions&#xD;
      such as orientation, attention, concentration, alertness, behavior, execution, etc., as well&#xD;
      as intelligence and verbal functions such as memory, learning, calculation, language,&#xD;
      understanding, judgment, and logic. Reasoning and many other aspects. Impaired cognitive&#xD;
      function often means poor academic performance, which is the most concern of parents.&#xD;
      However, due to the limitations of cognitive assessment tools, most studies only conduct&#xD;
      qualitative research on children's cognition, lack of quantitative research. . The underlying&#xD;
      reason is that these studies lack the guidance of systematic intellectual theory and the&#xD;
      support of cognitive quantitative assessment tools. At present, no one at home and abroad has&#xD;
      systematically and comprehensively studied the cognitive impairment caused by OSAHS based on&#xD;
      the most advanced cognitive theory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modern cognitive science believes that cognition, including human memory, decision,&#xD;
      reasoning, classification, and planning, is an ability that can be added to &quot;the treatment&#xD;
      may change.&quot; Some skill and intelligence of human beings at a certain level of cognitive&#xD;
      activity can be trained in the execution of certain practices and in the completion of a&#xD;
      plan. Scenes, situational features, and tasks, whether material or symbolic, play an&#xD;
      important role in human training techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, evaluable and scientific cognitive function training for individuals is beneficial&#xD;
      to the development of cognitive function, especially for the treatment training of patients&#xD;
      with cognitive dysfunction. At present, the treatment of OSAHS is mainly for the treatment of&#xD;
      primary disease such as oropharyngeal surgery, CPAP, etc. These treatments&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are many differences between children's OSAHS and adult OSAHS. Children's OSAHS mainly&#xD;
      causes cognitive and neuropsychological disorders, hyperactivity disorder, attention deficit&#xD;
      hyperactivity disorder, aggressive behavior, learning decline and nocturnal enuresis. At&#xD;
      present, there are many studies on cognitive impairment in children with OSAHS at home and&#xD;
      abroad. Cognitive impairment mainly affects attention, memory, especially executive function,&#xD;
      such as problem solving, planning, goal-oriented behavior and so on. Lau EY et al assessed&#xD;
      cognitive function by Wechner intelligence scale, children's auditory task, digital vigilance&#xD;
      test and so on. It was found that compared with the normal group, the language working memory&#xD;
      of OSAHS children was significantly impaired . Peng Wanda et al used routine craniocerebral&#xD;
      MRI sequence and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FIAIR) sequence perpendicular to&#xD;
      bilateral hippocampus for imaging. According to Scheltens standard and Fukudas method, the&#xD;
      severity of (PVH), which was associated with hippocampal volume atrophy and white matter&#xD;
      lesion, was evaluated. The changes of cognitive function were evaluated by Montreal Cognitive&#xD;
      Assessment scale (MoCA) and Mini Mental State scale (MMSE). The results showed that&#xD;
      hippocampal volume atrophy and white matter lesions were closely related to cognitive&#xD;
      impairment in patients with OSAHS. Craniocerebral MRI technique can provide objective imaging&#xD;
      basis for the diagnosis of cognitive impairment in patients with OSAHS . However, these&#xD;
      studies also have shortcomings. first of all, most studies do not study the cognitive process&#xD;
      of OSAHS children as a complete system, but only study the correlation between one side&#xD;
      (subsystem) or some aspects of children's cognition. Such as memory, executive function and&#xD;
      so on. Modern cognitive neuroscience holds that cognitive process is the process of&#xD;
      receiving, coding, storing, extracting and using information in the brain, that is, the&#xD;
      process of information processing. Whether OSAHS children have defects in the process of&#xD;
      information processing has not been reported at home and abroad. Secondly, due to the&#xD;
      limitations of cognitive assessment tools, there is a lack of quantitative research.&#xD;
      Adenoidectomy (adenotonsillectomy,AT) is recognized as the most commonly used treatment for&#xD;
      OSAHS . AT treatment can effectively relieve respiratory tract obstruction caused by the&#xD;
      proliferation of lymphoid tissue in the upper airway during sleep. In recent years, it has&#xD;
      been found that the inflammatory response mediated by 1eukotriene (LTS) plays an important&#xD;
      role in the pathogenesis and progress of OSAHS. It has also been found that long-term&#xD;
      continuous positive airway pressure ventilation (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure,CPAP)&#xD;
      can reduce serum inflammation and improve cognitive impairment in children with OSAHS . These&#xD;
      treatments relieve obstruction of the upper airway in children with OSAHS, relieve nocturnal&#xD;
      hypoxia exposure, and help improve damaged cognitive function, but fully restore advanced&#xD;
      brain function. That is, in the process of understanding objective things, the acquisition,&#xD;
      coding, operation, extraction and use of sensory input information need to improve their&#xD;
      cognitive function and cognitive skills through cognitive training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, DN-CAS is a system established by English background. If the system is introduced&#xD;
      directly, it may not adapt to the Chinese background. For example, Chinese phonetic training,&#xD;
      Chinese character dyslexia training, planning process training based on Chinese cultural&#xD;
      background and so on may not be applicable, so it is necessary to improve and introduce&#xD;
      Chinese background based on PASS theory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing cognitive training systems at home and abroad can not form an electronic&#xD;
      prescription system which can cooperate with the diagnostic results. The prescription form is&#xD;
      presented in the traditional paper form and lacks good confidentiality, ease of use and&#xD;
      storage management. The training system also lacks flexible support for personalized training&#xD;
      of patients. Patients are under the guidance of the doctor on the spot, in the hospital venue&#xD;
      to complete the training, the training process needs the doctor to carry on the artificial&#xD;
      treatment and guidance. It is difficult for doctors to easily customize different training&#xD;
      prescriptions for different patients, and it is also difficult to carry out the electronic&#xD;
      management of patient training data. The existing cognitive training systems are stand-alone&#xD;
      systems, and there is no integrated system of screening, diagnosis and training. The scope&#xD;
      and effect of application are greatly limited, far from being able to meet the growing needs&#xD;
      of patients. The training plan based on PASS theory should be a personalized scheme based on&#xD;
      common principles to adapt to individuals with different cognitive function levels.&#xD;
      Therefore, the system generates personalized electronic prescriptions according to the&#xD;
      training knowledge base, in which different training levels, contents and processes are&#xD;
      customized according to the level and characteristics of individual cognitive function. The&#xD;
      electronic prescription is provided to the patient in an encrypted storage medium, and the&#xD;
      patient uses it to carry out training at the telemedicine terminal. During the training, the&#xD;
      electronic prescription can automatically guide the patients to carry out the training steps&#xD;
      without artificial treatment and show the personalized training scene for the patients. The&#xD;
      training process and results are automatically monitored and recorded to the training centre&#xD;
      server for evaluation and analysis by doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The computer cloud system to be developed in this project is mainly composed of electronic&#xD;
      scale evaluation system and brain cognitive function monitoring system. The electronic scale&#xD;
      evaluation system is a semi-quantitative computer cloud system for self-evaluation of&#xD;
      clinical symptoms and physician-assisted clinical syndrome evaluation. Its working principle&#xD;
      is that the computer takes the place of doctors to conduct directional consultation with&#xD;
      patients. The results of consultation were transformed into semi-quantitative data and&#xD;
      compared with the established mathematical models to provide doctors with semi-quantitative&#xD;
      decision-making data. The advantage of the system is that because the computer performs&#xD;
      semi-quantitative consultation instead of the doctor, the patient's current history, past&#xD;
      history, general situation and symptoms can be collected in detail and semi-quantitatively.&#xD;
      At the same time, the working time of the doctor is saved and the intensity of the doctor's&#xD;
      work is reduced at the same time, to the greatest extent, the omission of consultation in the&#xD;
      consultation of the doctor is avoided, and the working time of the doctor is saved at the&#xD;
      same time. (2) because the semi-quantitative results are compared with the previous data&#xD;
      models, doctors can find diseases in more case models and help doctors find quantitative&#xD;
      evidence for qualitative diagnosis. (3) due to the detailed consultation of the computer,&#xD;
      sense of security, which brings high quality services to patients and detailed medical&#xD;
      services, has increased the compliance of diagnosis and treatment. The brain cognitive&#xD;
      function detection system is a computer cloud system laboratory, which is composed of several&#xD;
      brain cognitive function detection subsystems, which reflects the function of brain&#xD;
      information and function. The system presents the target task composed of the simplest visual&#xD;
      basic geometry through the display screen, enables the detection object to complete the&#xD;
      target task by operating the computer, and records the accuracy and time of completion. By&#xD;
      comparing the results with the established mathematical models, we can measure the&#xD;
      information plus function in 16 aspects of the human brain. Due to the introduction of time&#xD;
      and space as the evaluation index of brain cognitive function, the detection of brain&#xD;
      cognitive function gets rid of the traditional scale evaluation and enters the level of&#xD;
      objective evaluation of physics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, based on the international advanced cognitive science PASS theory, this project&#xD;
      intends to establish a digital remote DN:CAS cognitive evaluation and training (DN:CAS)&#xD;
      computer remote system under the Chinese background. The information processing process of&#xD;
      OSAHS children was quantitatively evaluated, on the basis of which the classification of&#xD;
      defects in children's OSAHS information processing process was further discussed, and a&#xD;
      cognitive prescription and remote training system with independent intellectual property&#xD;
      rights was constructed. Finally, a complete screening-diagnosis-training-reevaluation process&#xD;
      based on cloud computing is formed, in order to provide a basis for personalized clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;
