  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Zip-stitch™&#xD;
      Vaginal Cuff Closure System. This will be primarily done by measuring the frequency of&#xD;
      implant passing following system use. Also assessed will be relevant safety and efficacy&#xD;
      endpoints as compared to a two-to-one reference group (V-LOC barbed suture).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, blinded, randomized, controlled study to assess the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the Zip-stitch™ System in maintaining vaginal cuff closure following laparoscopic&#xD;
      hysterectomy. Participating subjects will be randomized and evaluated for implant passing,&#xD;
      successful cuff closure, healing, adverse events, dyspareunia, and pain. Blinded follow-up&#xD;
      will involve in-person visits at one week, six weeks, and six months. There will be an&#xD;
      additional unblinded follow-up by telephone at 12 months post operatively.&#xD;

    <description>Non-increase in reported individual subject dyspareunia from baseline to 6-month follow-up will be compared (test versus reference group) using the relevant sexual discomfort module of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). The FSFI is a validated metric of female sexual function, where lower scores indicate poor sexual function. Non-increase in sexual discomfort will be compared between test and control groups.</description>

    <description>The Zip-stitch™ system is comprised of a handheld applicator and clip loading tool compatible with standard 10mm trocars and laparoscopic surgical equipment as well as a set of bio-absorbable poly p dioxanone (PDO) clips. This system was developed specifically for closure of the vaginal cuff during laparoscopic hysterectomy as a replacement for traditionally cumbersome laparoscopic suture techniques.</description>
