  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The outcome of peripheral nerve injury is related to age, level of injury, the injured nerve,&#xD;
      the severity of injury, and the timing and the type of surgery interventions. In addition,&#xD;
      high-level peripheral nerve injury would not full recovery, and the prognosis is determined&#xD;
      by the nerve regeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional physical therapy includes electrical stimulation for denervated muscles, and&#xD;
      soft tissue massage, joint range of motion exercises to maintain the flexibility of the&#xD;
      affected joint, muscle or connected tissues. However, the nerve regeneration takes several&#xD;
      months in high-level median, ulnar or radial nerve injury. Prolonged median or ulnar nerves&#xD;
      injury may interfere intrinsic muscular function, and radial nerve injury causes drop hand.&#xD;
      Earlier nerve regeneration or motor training is essential for the patients to return to&#xD;
      normal life and increase their quality of life&#xD;

      injury may interfere intrinsic muscular function, and radial nerve injury causes drop hand.&#xD;
      Earlier nerve regeneration or motor training is essential for the patients to return to&#xD;
      normal life and increase their quality of life. This research aims to explore the effects of&#xD;
      mirror therapy for peripheral nerve injury. We will enroll 60 patients who suffer from&#xD;
      median, ulnar or radial nerve injury at the level of elbow or proximal forearm. The subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized into the mirror-therapy group or the control group. Each group will&#xD;
      receive conventional physical therapy (i.e., electrical stimulation, joint range of motion&#xD;
      exercise, muscle strengthening training, sensory reeducation training). The mirror-therapy&#xD;
      group would be supplemented by motor learning by mirror therapy. The measurements include&#xD;
      joint range of motion, pain status, sensibility, grip strength, pinch strength, hand function&#xD;
      test and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH). Demographic information will&#xD;
      be collected and analyzed by the independent t-tests. The outcome variables taken during the&#xD;
      three and six months after the interventions would be included. One-way ANOVA are used to&#xD;
      compare the difference between measurements. This study may offer an evidence based results&#xD;
      to explore the effects of mirror therapy for peripheral nerve regeneration and motor&#xD;
      learning.&#xD;
