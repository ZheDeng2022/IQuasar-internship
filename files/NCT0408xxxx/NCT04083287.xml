  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain is important following arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Postoperative&#xD;
      effective pain treatment provides early mobilization and shorter hospital stay.Ultrasound&#xD;
      (US)-guided brachial plexus blocks such as interscalen and supraclavicular block are usually&#xD;
      performed. Interscalen brachial plexus block (ISCB) is one of the most preferred techniques&#xD;
      among these.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The US-guided erector spina plane block (ESPB) is a novel interfacial plan block defined by&#xD;
      Forero et al. Local anesthetic injection is administrated into the deep fascia of erector&#xD;
      spinae. ESPB provides thoracic analgesia at T5 level, abdominal analgesia at T7-9 level, and&#xD;
      lumbar analgesia at T10-12, L3 levels. There are a few case reports about the efficacy of&#xD;
      ESPB for acute and chronic shoulder pain. However, there are no randomized clinical studies.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of the US-guided ESPB and ISCB for&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia management after arthroscopic shoulder surgery.&#xD;

      Postoperative pain is an important issue in patients underwent arthroscopic shoulder surgery.&#xD;
      Pain causes a few problems; discomfortable patients, negative outcomes and longer&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Postoperative effective pain treatment provides early mobilization and&#xD;
      shorter hospital stay, thus complications due to hospitalization such as infection and&#xD;
      thromboembolism may be reduced. Various techniques may be used for postoperative pain&#xD;
      treatment. Opioids are one of the most preferred drugs among the analgesic agents. Parenteral&#xD;
      opioids are generally performed for patients after surgery. However opioids have undesirable&#xD;
      adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, itching, sedation and respiratory depression&#xD;
      (opioid-related adverse events).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various methods may be performed to reduce the use of systemic opioids and for effective pain&#xD;
      treatment following arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Ultrasound (US)-guided brachial plexus&#xD;
      blocks such as interscalen and supraclavicular block are commonly used. Interscalen brachial&#xD;
      plexus block (ISCB) is one of the most preferred techniques among these.&#xD;
&#xD;
      US-guided interfascial plane blocks have been used increasily due to the advantages of&#xD;
      ultrasound in anesthesia practice. The US-guided erector spina plane block (ESPB) is a novel&#xD;
      interfacial plan block defined by Forero et al. at 2016. The ESPB contains a local anesthetic&#xD;
      injection into the deep fascia of erector spinae. This area is away from the pleural and&#xD;
      neurological structures and thus minimizes the risk of complications due to injury.&#xD;
      Visualization of sonoanatomy with US is easy, and the spread of local anesthesic agents can&#xD;
      be easily seen under the erector spinae muscle. Thus, analgesia occurs in several dermatomes&#xD;
      with cephalad-caudad way. Cadaveric studies have shown that the injection spreads to the&#xD;
      ventral and dorsal roots of the spinal nerves. ESPB provides thoracic analgesia at T5 level,&#xD;
      abdominal analgesia at T7-9 level, and lumbar analgesia at T10-12, L3 levels. To the best of&#xD;
      our knowledge, there have been a few case reports about the efficacy of ESPB for acute and&#xD;
      chronic shoulder pain. There are no randomized clinical studies, yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of the US-guided ESPB and ISCB for&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia management after arthroscopic shoulder surgery. The primary aim is to&#xD;
      compare perioperative and postoperative opioid consumption and the secondary aim is to&#xD;
      evaluate postoperative pain scores (VAS), adverse effects related with opioids (allergic&#xD;
      reaction, nausea, vomiting).&#xD;

    <description>In group E, ESPB will be performed. US probe will be placed longitudinally 2-3 cm lateral to the T2 transvers process. Erector spinae muscle will be visualized on the hyperechoic transverse process. The block needle will be inserted caudo-cranial direction and then for correction of the needle 5 ml saline will be enjected deep into the erector spina muscle fascia. Following confirmation of the correct position of the needle 30 ml %0.25 bupivacaine will be administered for block.</description>

    <description>In group I, ISCB will be performed with patients in the supin position. US probe will be placed in transverse plane at the level of cricoid cartilage. The prob will be moved laterally when the artery is visualized. The needle will be inserted in a medial-to-lateral direction after the brachial plexus between the scalen muscles is visualized. Then, 5 ml normal saline will be enjected for correction of the needle with in-plane technique. Following confirmation of the correct position of the needle 30 ml %0.25 bupivacaine will be administered for block.</description>

    <description>Patients will be administered A 400 mg dose of ibuprofen every 8 hours in the postoperative period. A patient controlled device prepared with 10 mcg/ ml fentanyl will be attached to all patients with a protocol included 10 mcg bolus without infusion dose, 10 min lockout time and 4 hour limit.&#xD;
Postoperative pain assessment will be performed using the VAS score (0 = no pain, 10 = the most severe pain felt). The VAS scores at rest and during cough will be recorded at postoperative 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 and 48 hours. If the VAS score will be ≥ 4, 0.5 mg/ kg meperidine IV will be administered. Sedation level will be assessed with a 4-point sedation scale (0 = awake, eyes open, 1 = sleepy but responding to verbal stimulus, 2 = sleepy and hard to evoke, 3 = sleepy, not aroused by shaking). The first time of the use of rescue analgesic, intraoperative and postoperative opioid consumption, side effects such as nausea, vomiting, itching and block related complications will be recorded.</description>
