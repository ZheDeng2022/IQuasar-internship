    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to understand the potential impact of two new FDA strategies to&#xD;
      ensure the availability of safer Alternative Nicotine Delivery Systems (ANDS) and to reduce&#xD;
      the nicotine content in combustible cigarettes to non-addictive levels. Specifically, this&#xD;
      research will examine how well ANDS and very low nicotine cigarettes (VLNCs) can work alone&#xD;
      or in combination with the current strategy of providing a safe source of nicotine via&#xD;
      nicotine replacement medications to reduce use of combustible cigarettes, in real-world&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll 180 daily adult smokers who are not planning to quit smoking&#xD;
      within the next 30 days into this mixed design study. Participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to one of three levels of the between-subjects factor: 1) VLNC cigarettes; 2) Juul&#xD;
      e-cigarettes (with nicotine); or 3) no alternative product. Participants receiving an&#xD;
      alternative product (VLNC or e-cigarettes) will be asked to use it for 4 weeks (Weeks 1&#xD;
      through 4). During Weeks 2 and 4 all participants will be asked to switch from their&#xD;
      cigarettes to use only study products (i.e., Juul e-cigarettes, VLNCs, or no alternative&#xD;
      product) and to use either an active nicotine or placebo patch (the within-subjects factor),&#xD;
      provided in double-blind fashion and counterbalanced order. During Weeks 1 through 4,&#xD;
      participants will use a smartphone to record, in the moment, each time they use their own&#xD;
      cigarettes or any alternative product. For a random daily subset of use events, participants&#xD;
      will complete additional questions about the internal and external context of their use&#xD;
      (e.g., affect, any restrictions on smoking) and their response to use (e.g., withdrawal&#xD;
      alleviation, taste, satisfaction). Using these data, the investigators will also examine the&#xD;
      effects of these products on the rewarding value of smoking and possible mechanisms driving&#xD;
      such behavior (e.g., withdrawal alleviation, satisfaction, taste).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will provide critical information regarding the potential impact of providing&#xD;
      cigarettes with non-addictive levels of nicotine and safe ANDS, with or without nicotine&#xD;
      replacement, in real-world settings on smokers' use of their usual cigarettes and other&#xD;
      outcomes. Information on the short-term effects of products that could be accessible in the&#xD;
      future will provide data that could inform regulatory policy decisions regarding the public&#xD;
      health impact of safe ANDS and non-addictive cigarettes.&#xD;

      Design and Objective: The primary goal of this research is to assess the ability of&#xD;
      alternative products (VLNCs vs. e-cigs vs. no alternative product; between-subjects factor)&#xD;
      to serve as a substitute for conventional cigarettes and how this is influenced by&#xD;
      steady-state nicotine (nicotine vs. placebo patches; within-subjects factor). In addition,&#xD;
      the investigators will explore the contexts in which participants are and are not able to&#xD;
      switch from their conventional cigarettes. Such contextual information will provide insight&#xD;
      into internal (i.e., withdrawal, expectancies) and external environments (i.e., being around&#xD;
      smokers, smoking restrictions) that promote or interfere with switching behavior. The&#xD;
      investigators will also explore person factors and beliefs that may drive alternative product&#xD;
      use and substitution success. Person factors that may influence use behavior include sex (a&#xD;
      key biological variable), education level, dependence, instrumental smoking motives (e.g.,&#xD;
      smoking for affect regulation, taste, or social experiences), and psychiatric comorbidity.&#xD;
      Beliefs that may influence use behavior include beliefs about the safety and addiction&#xD;
      potential of conventional cigarettes and the alternative products. Understanding the relation&#xD;
      of person factors and beliefs with use behavior could inform regulatory actions related to&#xD;
      product labeling and education. Finally, the investigators will explore potential mechanisms&#xD;
      that might drive use behavior and support substitution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will enroll 180 adult smokers in a mixed design study with a within-subjects&#xD;
      factor (active nicotine patch vs. placebo patch) and a between-subjects factor (alternative&#xD;
      products: VLNCs, e-cigs, or no product). Participants will be randomized to receive either 4&#xD;
      weeks of VLNCs, 4 weeks of e-cigs, or no alternative product. After one week practicing with&#xD;
      the alternative product, participants will complete the first of two 7-day switching trials&#xD;
      during which they will be asked to refrain from smoking their own cigarettes and encouraged&#xD;
      to use the alternative product to which they have been assigned (although the no alternative&#xD;
      product group will not have any other products to use). All participants will be given&#xD;
      patches (active nicotine or placebo, in counterbalanced order) to use during the Switch Week.&#xD;
      After this first Switch Week, participants will smoke normally for one week and then have&#xD;
      their second Switch Week using the other type of patch (active or placebo). Participants will&#xD;
      complete Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs) on smartphones at baseline and during the 4&#xD;
      weeks of product use. EMA targets include own cigarette use, alternative product use,&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms, rewarding value of product use (e.g., taste, buzz), and environmental&#xD;
      and affective context of any tobacco product use. The investigators will then conduct a&#xD;
      3-month follow-up to assess cigarette and e-cig use, risk perceptions, and future use&#xD;
      intentions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This design addresses the six critical methodological issues for understanding the impact of&#xD;
      alternative products outlined by Villanti et al.: 1) rigorous assessment of the key outcome&#xD;
      (conventional cigarettes smoked); 2) assessment of product use during switching; 3) use of&#xD;
      appropriate control/comparison groups; 4) measurement of product exposure/use that precedes&#xD;
      switching; 5) evaluation of the dose and duration of product exposure/use; and 6) clear&#xD;
      evaluation of the type and quality of the products used (e.g., satisfaction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Participants: Participants from the greater Madison and Milwaukee, Wisconsin&#xD;
      areas will be recruited via media recruitment methods (i.e., television, newspaper, and&#xD;
      earned media) that have recruited thousands of smokers. Investigators will also use&#xD;
      Internet/Facebook advertisements that have been successful in recent e-cig studies that&#xD;
      recruited 422 smokers willing to provide EMA data during seven 2-week assessment periods over&#xD;
      2 years and 74 dual users willing to reduce combustible cigarette use and switch to using&#xD;
      only e-cigs. Given this, it is feasible to recruit 180 smokers for this study within 18&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures and Measures: Interested smokers will complete a phone screen to determine initial&#xD;
      eligibility. Potentially eligible smokers will attend an orientation visit where, after&#xD;
      providing a breath sample to verify eligibility (CO &gt; 6 ppm), they will receive a detailed&#xD;
      description of the study and provide written informed consent, and complete baseline&#xD;
      assessments. At Visit 1, participants will be randomized to receive VLNCs, e-cigs, or no&#xD;
      alternative product and will be trained to use the product. The study database will randomize&#xD;
      participants, stratified by clinic, gender, and race [White vs. Non-White], to enhance&#xD;
      scientific rigor and reproducibility. Participants will be trained to use the smartphone to&#xD;
      complete daily assessments, using the training that was effective in prior research, and will&#xD;
      schedule future study visits. Participants will use their alternative products as they would&#xD;
      like for one week to become comfortable with the product. At Visit 2, participants will&#xD;
      complete assessments, provide a breath sample for CO assessment and a urine sample for&#xD;
      cotinine assessment, receive feedback on their compliance with the smartphone assessments,&#xD;
      and be given study patches to use during Switch Week 1 when they will be asked to abstain&#xD;
      from using their own cigarettes for the week. Participants will then attend a mid-Switch Week&#xD;
      visit (Visit 3) and an end-of-Switch Week visit (Visit 4) to assess biomarkers (a breath&#xD;
      sample for CO assessment and a urine sample for cotinine). At Visit 4, the end of Switch Week&#xD;
      1, participants will be told that they can smoke as usual for a week. Then, at the start of&#xD;
      Switch Week 2 (Visit 5), participants will be given the other type of patch (active or&#xD;
      placebo) and asked to abstain from smoking their own cigarettes for a week. As during the&#xD;
      prior Switch Week, participants will attend visits mid-week and at the end of the week to&#xD;
      assess biomarkers (Visits 6 and 7). The investigators will attempt to schedule appointments&#xD;
      at the same time of day (i.e., within a 2-hour window) for each participant so that there is&#xD;
      consistent time for product use prior to providing the biological samples across study&#xD;
      visits. Participants will complete a follow-up assessment call at 3 months. The baseline&#xD;
      visit will last 2 hours, but subsequent visits will last &lt;30 minutes. Participants will carry&#xD;
      a smartphone to complete EMAs from Orientation through all 4 weeks of product use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge to be Gained: The results from this research will provide important insight into&#xD;
      how well very low nicotine cigarettes and e-cigarettes serve as a substitute for conventional&#xD;
      cigarettes and how this is influenced by the presence of steady-state nicotine. Further,&#xD;
      these data will inform scientists and regulators about the potential mechanisms that may&#xD;
      support the use of alternative products. This information will aid scientists and regulatory&#xD;
      bodies in understanding the real-world impact of potential regulatory policies regarding&#xD;
      access to safer nicotine sources and reducing the addiction potential of combustible tobacco&#xD;
      products.&#xD;
