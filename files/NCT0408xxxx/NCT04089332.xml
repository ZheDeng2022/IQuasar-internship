  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The growing population of adolescents with insulin resistance (IR) is predicted to create a&#xD;
      large public health burden in the next few decades. This study examines the function of brain&#xD;
      blood vessels and cognitive function, to test if increasing severity of IR in adolescents is&#xD;
      related to reduced cognitive function and reduced brain blood vessel function. Findings from&#xD;
      this study may help create treatments to delay or prevent some of the negative effects of IR&#xD;
      on cognitive and vascular health.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One in five American adolescents is obese. Up to half of those are already exhibiting insulin&#xD;
      resistance (IR), a hallmark of metabolic syndrome and diabetes linked to serious&#xD;
      life-altering health disorders, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. In&#xD;
      adults, IR negatively affects brain structure and function and is reflected in lower regional&#xD;
      brain volumes, perfusion, increased white matter hyperintensities and abnormal&#xD;
      neuropsychological status, especially affecting memory and attention-all changes associated&#xD;
      with accelerated cognitive and brain aging and increased risk of dementia. In an analogous&#xD;
      fashion, a limited set of literature suggests adolescents with IR exhibit similar brain&#xD;
      changes during maturation. The investigators hypothesize that the brains of obese adolescents&#xD;
      are more susceptible to insults of IR during rapid brain development, positioning them on an&#xD;
      abnormal cognitive trajectory, and predisposing them to issues related to learning,&#xD;
      behavioral stress responses, and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the metabolic consequences of IR are well described in adolescence, the impact of IR on&#xD;
      their neurocognitive status (intelligence, memory, attention, executive function, processing&#xD;
      speed) and cerebrovascular function and their interactions remains largely unexplored. This&#xD;
      is important since in addition to its classic role as a metabolic hormone, insulin acts as a&#xD;
      vasodilator and supports neurotrophic signaling in healthy humans. Therefore, dysfunctional&#xD;
      insulin signaling may hold tremendous influence over brain health in adolescents during this&#xD;
      vital period of brain development. New insight is required to understand where, when, and how&#xD;
      IR negatively transforms brain health, including whether a dose-response exists between IR&#xD;
      severity and anomalies in brain and cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal of this research program is to determine the influence of IR on brain&#xD;
      development in adolescents through the relationships between neurocognition and cerebral&#xD;
      blood supply. The primary goal of the current project is to quantify fundamental&#xD;
      neurocognitive and cerebrovascular function in relation to the severity of IR. The central&#xD;
      hypothesis is that as IR worsens: a) subtle but meaningful neurocognitive declines emerge; b)&#xD;
      regional brain perfusion is reduced primarily in areas linked to learning and memory despite&#xD;
      preserved resting global cerebral blood flow (CBF); c) acute insulin surges exacerbate&#xD;
      regional hypoperfusion, and d) cognitive scores will be lower, mediated in part by&#xD;
      insulin-stimulated hypoperfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited primarily from pediatric and pediatric endocrinology clinics&#xD;
      via our collaborator, Dr. Aaron Carrel, and his staff in UWHC Pediatric Endocrinology.&#xD;
      Additionally, participants will be recruited from the greater Madison, WI community.&#xD;
