      administered intrathecally at higher doses to participants with spinal muscular atrophy&#xD;
      (SMA), as measured by change in Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of&#xD;
      Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP INTEND) total score (Part B); to examine the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of nusinersen administered intrathecally at higher doses to participants with&#xD;
      SMA (Parts A and C).&#xD;

    <measure>Part B Infantile-onset SMA: Change from Baseline in CHOP INTEND Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 183</time_frame>
    <description>The CHOP INTEND test is designed to evaluate the motor skills of infants with significant motor weakness. It includes 16 items (capturing neck, trunk, and proximal and distal limb strength) structured to move from easiest to hardest with the grading including gravity eliminated (lower scores) to antigravity movements (higher scores). All item scores range from 0-4.</description>

    <measure>Part A and C: Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening up to Day 389</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal assessment such as an abnormal laboratory value), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, in the view of the Investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in a birth defect.</description>
