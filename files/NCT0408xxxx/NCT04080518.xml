  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Dapagliflozin (FORXIGA) 10mg&#xD;
      (n=20) and placebo (n=20) on the renal concentration mechanism, mobilization of Na+ from&#xD;
      tissue stores, and mobilization of muscle glycogen and fat, in patients heart failure NYHA&#xD;
      classes I and II,with or w/o T2DM in a 4-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized&#xD;
      study with 2 treatment arms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are a new class of oral medications used&#xD;
      for T2DM, which lower blood glucose levels by increasing renal sodium (Na+) and glucose&#xD;
      excretion. However, their applications seem to go beyond glycemic control. Recent studies&#xD;
      have shown that treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors significantly improves cardiovascular&#xD;
      outcome, with unprecedented reductions in cardiovascular mortality and heart failure&#xD;
      hospitalizations. The underlying mechanism of this surprising effect is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that increased Na+ and glucose excretion induced by SGLT-2 inhibitors&#xD;
      predisposes to water loss, to which the body responds by increasing urea production in an&#xD;
      effort to prevent dehydration. Urea is accumulated in the renal medulla, where it provides&#xD;
      the alternative osmotic driving force for water reabsorption. However, hepatic urea&#xD;
      production is an energy-intense process, for which amino acids from skeletal muscle are the&#xD;
      ideal fuel because they provide both the nitrogen and the energy needed for urea generation.&#xD;
      Alanine is transported from muscle to the liver, where it serves as a substrate for new&#xD;
      pyruvate generation, which can then be used for the urea cycle, glucose production or ketone&#xD;
      body generation. In the same time, as increasing amounts of alanine are shuttled to the&#xD;
      liver, muscle will deplete its glucose reservoirs and reprioritize fuel utilization in favour&#xD;
      of fatty acids.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The assignment of consented patients will occur in a blinded fashion using a randomization scheme generated by a statistician who is not part of the study team and has no contact with the study subjects. Randomization assignments will be made in permuted blocks of 4. Once eligibility criteria are met, study participants will be randomly assigned to receive either Dapagliflozin 10mg or matching, identically appearing placebo. Stratified random sampling (by gender) will be performed in order to minimize selection bias. Access to the randomisation code will be controlled and documented. Relevant parties will be blinded to the treatment group assignment.</masking_description>
