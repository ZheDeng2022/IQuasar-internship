    <textblock>
      Encephalitis, an acute inflammation of the central nervous system associated with neurologic&#xD;
      dysfunction is of public health concern worldwide, because of its high mortality and&#xD;
      neurological sequelae rates. In Asia where many of the possible etiologies are of major&#xD;
      public health concerns (i.e. dengue, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile virus, EV71), acute&#xD;
      encephalitis is among the most frequent and severe causes of pediatric hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite extensive microbiological investigations, no pathogen is identified for a significant&#xD;
      proportion of encephalitis patients in both industrialized and developing countries (28-85%&#xD;
      of cases remain unconfirmed). Unknown and sometimes new emerging infectious agents may be&#xD;
      responsible for cases of currently unknown etiology and an intensive effort to identify and&#xD;
      characterize them is to be done. From this perspective, the Southeast Asian region, a&#xD;
      particularly significant biodiversity hotspot, is at high risk for new pathogen emergence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveillance and diagnostic capabilities for encephalitis remain poor and still suffer from&#xD;
      serious shortcomings in most Southeast Asian countries and beyond. Although the burden of&#xD;
      non-infectious encephalitis in this region remains to be ascertained, the best laboratories&#xD;
      only identify etiological infective agents in less than half of patients. Systematic data&#xD;
      regarding the contribution of these diseases are lacking and to define the burden of these&#xD;
      infections, to describe the full clinical spectrum and characteristics of acute central&#xD;
      nervous system infections, and to develop diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms to improve&#xD;
      patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project is an ambitious and multidisciplinary research consortium that aims to&#xD;
      reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with infectious encephalitis in Southeast Asia&#xD;
      (Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar) by improving diagnosis and medical care for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SEAe project specific objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To fill-in the biomedical knowledge gaps regarding acute encephalitis syndrome;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To strengthen hospital laboratories capacities to enhance health by improving diagnosis&#xD;
           and care for patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify unknown pathogens responsible for encephalitis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide reliable information and a sustainable regional and sub-regional surveillance&#xD;
           network to clinicians and public health stakeholders that will help them to better&#xD;
           define prevention policies, vaccination strategy, and build preparedness to emerging&#xD;
           infectious risks.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Encephalitis is defined as an acute inflammation of the central nervous system associated&#xD;
      with neurologic dysfunction. The most common etiologies are infections by either viruses or&#xD;
      bacteria although parasites and fungi can also be occasionally detected, especially in&#xD;
      immunocompromised patients. Because of high mortality and long-term neurological sequelae,&#xD;
      encephalitis is of public health concern worldwide. Reported incidences range between 3.5 and&#xD;
      7.4 cases per 100,000 patient-years with higher incidences in children than adults. Various&#xD;
      encephalitis outbreaks have recently emerged in Asia such as the fatal outbreak of&#xD;
      enterovirus 71 (EV71) that occurred in mid-2012 in Cambodia affecting very young children&#xD;
      (most below 3 years, all below 12 years). In Asia where many of the possible etiologies are&#xD;
      of major public health concerns (i.e. dengue, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile virus, EV71),&#xD;
      acute encephalitis is among the most frequent and severe causes of pediatric hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite extensive microbiological investigations and the use of the most advanced molecular&#xD;
      biology-based assays, no pathogen is identified for a significant proportion of encephalitis&#xD;
      patients in both industrialized and developing countries (28-85% of cases remain&#xD;
      unconfirmed). Previous studies support the hypothesis that unknown and sometimes new emerging&#xD;
      infectious agents may be responsible for cases of currently unknown etiology and strongly&#xD;
      argue for an intensive effort to identify and characterize them. This hypothesis is also&#xD;
      strengthened by the recent apparent increase in emerging infectious diseases, many of which&#xD;
      have been linked to human activities that impact the environment and to the spreading of&#xD;
      pathogens to new geographic regions. From this perspective, the Southeast Asian region, a&#xD;
      particularly significant biodiversity hotspot, is at high risk for new pathogen emergence.&#xD;
      Indeed, growing human populations, increasing urbanization and frequent contact with wildlife&#xD;
      and domesticated animals have created novel opportunities for the emergence of pathogens such&#xD;
      as SARS at the end of 2002, and highly facilitated the spread of infectious diseases such as&#xD;
      H5N1 high-pathogenicity avian influenza virus since 2004, and H1N1 pandemic influenza virus&#xD;
      in 2009. The population in developing Southeast Asian countries is particularly at risk for&#xD;
      the circulation of emerging or reemerging infectious agents and for this reason the&#xD;
      surveillance and investigation of acute encephalitis syndrome in this region is of utmost&#xD;
      public health importance, both locally and globally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveillance and diagnostic capabilities for encephalitis remain poor and still suffer from&#xD;
      serious shortcomings in most Southeast Asian countries and beyond. Although the burden of&#xD;
      non-infectious encephalitis in this region remains to be ascertained, the best laboratories&#xD;
      only identify etiological infective agents in less than half of patients. Moreover, because&#xD;
      of the absence of reliable microbiological diagnostic capacity in the majority of public&#xD;
      referral hospitals, local clinicians have to treat acute encephalitis syndromes mostly&#xD;
      empirically, with little evaluation of the effectiveness of their clinical approach. Even if&#xD;
      some of the most common causes of acute encephalitis syndrome may be vaccine-preventable,&#xD;
      systematic data regarding the contribution of these diseases are lacking and no reliable data&#xD;
      are available to define the burden of these infections, to describe the full clinical&#xD;
      spectrum and characteristics of acute central nervous system infections, and to develop&#xD;
      diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms to improve patient care. Besides, whatever the nature&#xD;
      and magnitude of the encephalitis burden in Southeast Asia and the criteria used to assess it&#xD;
      (i.e. morbidity, mortality, handicap, impact on families' budget or livelihood), this burden&#xD;
      is borne principally by underprivileged populations with limited access to prevention and&#xD;
      health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project partners The proposed project is an ambitious and multidisciplinary research&#xD;
      consortium associating: (i) national health authorities in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Vietnam and&#xD;
      Myanmar; (ii) local major university and clinical sites (national hospitals and provincial&#xD;
      health centers); (iii) key French stakeholders of life and health sciences with research&#xD;
      activities carried out in the Southeast Asian region such as: Institut Pasteur and the&#xD;
      Institut Pasteur International Network, Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche&#xD;
      Médicale (Inserm), Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le&#xD;
      Développement (Cirad), Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD) - Aix-Marseille&#xD;
      University - Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Santé Publique (EHESP); and (iv) teams from the&#xD;
      Southeast Asian Wellcome Trust Oxford University Major Overseas Programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SEAe project aims to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with infectious&#xD;
      encephalitis in Southeast Asia by improving diagnosis and medical care for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SEAe project specific objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To fill-in the biomedical knowledge gaps regarding acute encephalitis syndrome;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To strengthen hospital laboratories capacities to enhance health by improving diagnosis&#xD;
           and care for patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify unknown pathogens responsible for encephalitis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document and analyze factors related to clusters of encephalitis cases integrating&#xD;
           human health, animal health and environment through a &quot;One Health&quot; approach;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To provide reliable information and a sustainable regional and sub-regional surveillance&#xD;
           network to clinicians and public health stakeholders that will help them to better&#xD;
           define prevention policies, vaccination strategy, and build preparedness to emerging&#xD;
           infectious risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population study: patient with suspected encephalitis hospitalized in in 4 different&#xD;
      Hospitals, Kantha Bopha IV children's Hospital, Phnom Penh, Cambodia, National paediatrics&#xD;
      Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam and Mahosot Hospital, Vientiane, Lao PDR, Yangon Children Hospital,&#xD;
      Yangon, Myanmar. Inclusion criteria were adapted from the International Encephalitis&#xD;
      Consortium 2013: all patients should be older than 28 days and presenting an altered mental&#xD;
      status (i.e. confusion or inability to talk, decreased or altered level of consciousness or&#xD;
      personality change) lasting more than 24 hours without alternative cause identified. These&#xD;
      criteria should be associated with at least one of the following: (i) fever (&gt;=38°C axillary)&#xD;
      for less than 72 hours before or after presentation; (ii) seizure (febrile seizure excluded);&#xD;
      (iii) focal neurologic finding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data entries are required for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data entries:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single data entry person (a medical doctor) enters clinical information and fill in a paper&#xD;
      form at admission, at 24 hours, at discharge and one year after discharge and enter the data&#xD;
      into an OpenClinica (hosted in CIRAD server, Montpellier, France ) anonymized online&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory data is entered into a customized ACCESS (Microsoft database). The results are&#xD;
      entered into dedicated tabs for the different techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A data manager dedicated to the study is in charge of the database. The CIRAD and the&#xD;
      Institut Pasteur share the co-ownership of the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First statistical analysis will be performed in Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, Phnom Penh,&#xD;
      under epidemiology unit responsibility. Continuous data will be described with descriptive&#xD;
      statistics, including mean ±SD and/or median (range) as appropriate and categorical data with&#xD;
      frequencies (%). Categorical data will be analyzed by univariate analysis with χ2 or Fisher&#xD;
      exact test as appropriate and continuous data by nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. Statistical&#xD;
      analyses will involve use of R software. Relationships between clinical, biological,&#xD;
      radiological variables, etiologies and outcome will be assessed by using a univariate and&#xD;
      multivariate logistic regression analyses to identify determinants for poor outcome.&#xD;
