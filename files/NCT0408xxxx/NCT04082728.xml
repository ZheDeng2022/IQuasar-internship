  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate if the addition of metamizole to the standard&#xD;
      post-operative treatment, i.e. paracetamol and ibuprofen, is superior in reducing&#xD;
      post-operative pain on day 1 after ambulatory surgery compared to the standard post-operative&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, a mono-center, prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled superiority trail&#xD;
      will be designed in order to investigate superiority of metamizole compared to the standard&#xD;
      post-operative treatment in patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Ambulant surgery has been expanding substantially in the past decade, primarily because it is&#xD;
      associated with lower costs and it is believed to be as safe as surgery in the in-patient&#xD;
      setting. Moreover, it seems that early discharge can contribute to a faster recovery and a&#xD;
      decreased incidence of hospital-associated complications. In view of the relative absence of&#xD;
      major complications, post-operative pain and quality of recovery should be considered the&#xD;
      principal endpoints after day surgery. The quality of recovery after different types of&#xD;
      surgery is of major importance since the evaluation of recovery allows a discrimination&#xD;
      between a normal and pathological health trajectory. A disadvantage in the ambulatory setting&#xD;
      is related to the absence of postoperative surveillance by professionals. This implicates&#xD;
      that the individual patient has to assess, without any support, if his/her quality of&#xD;
      recovery is normal or not. There is limited information on procedure-specific quality of&#xD;
      recovery after day surgery, however, different tools such as the 1-tem Global Surgical&#xD;
      Recovery (GSR) index and the 5-dimensional European Quality of Life (EQ5D) questionnaires can&#xD;
      be addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Particularly in the ambulant setting, good post-operative analgesia is challenging because&#xD;
      patients have to control pain at home by themselves, in the absence of hospital staff.&#xD;
      Moreover, there is a limit in the type of analgesia that is available (i.e. no strong&#xD;
      opioids) as well as in the route of administration (i.e. no epidural, intravenous,&#xD;
      subcutaneous or intramuscular route) at home. Nowadays a multimodal approach to control pain&#xD;
      has been advocated in the ambulatory setting. This approach is based on a combination of&#xD;
      paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and, if necessary, weak opioids.&#xD;
      A local and regional anesthesia also have been advocated in the ambulatory setting to relieve&#xD;
      pain for 8 to 24 hours after surgery. Despite this multimodal pain therapy, the prevalence of&#xD;
      outpatients suffering moderate to severe acute postoperative pain at home still remains high&#xD;
      and varies from 9 to 40%. More specific, patients undergoing haemorrhoid surgery,&#xD;
      arthroscopic shoulder and knee surgery, and inguinal hernia repair seem to be at highest risk&#xD;
      to develop moderate to severe pain on the fourth postoperative day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to this relatively high prevalence and due to the fact that NSAIDs are not always&#xD;
      sufficiently effective, can have numerous contraindications and therefore are not suitable in&#xD;
      up to 25% of all patients; there is a need for an alternative pain therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metamizole (dipyrone) is a non-opioid compound with strong analgesic, antipyretic and&#xD;
      spasmolytic effects. The analgesic efficacy of intravenous or intramuscular metamizole for&#xD;
      pain relief after inpatient surgery is well described. Recently, we showed in a prospective,&#xD;
      double-blind, randomized controlled trial that the combination of paracetamol and metamizole&#xD;
      is equally effective in treatment of acute post-operative pain at home after ambulatory&#xD;
      surgery compared to paracetamol and ibuprofen. Moreover, patient satisfaction was equal in&#xD;
      both groups, as well as the reported side effects.&#xD;
