  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an adaptive design study. During the first phase of the study, participants will be&#xD;
      randomized in 2:1 ratio to receive either MNTX 450 milligrams (mg) once daily (QD) or&#xD;
      placebo. An interim analysis will be performed for futility and at that point a higher dosage&#xD;
      regimen may be utilized for the active treatment group if the futility criteria are met. For&#xD;
      the second stage of the study, interim analyses will be conducted for futility and sample&#xD;
      size reassessment.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive methylnaltrexone bromide (MNTX) 450 mg (3 tablets of 150 mg each) QD orally. If the initial interim analysis suggests a lack of efficacy, subsequent participants will receive 450 mg MNTX twice daily (BID) or three times daily (TID). Treatment will continue until participant's death or early withdrawal from study or study completion at Day 168.</description>
