  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite knowledge about the effect of preventive measures in lifestyle, smoking,nutrition,&#xD;
      alcohol and physical activity (SNAP), there is a lack of systematic assessment of the overall&#xD;
      lifestyle of the patient before surgery and knowledge about how lifestyle interventions can&#xD;
      be organized in connection with cancer surgery. The intention with prehabilitation is to&#xD;
      optimize the individual's risk factors and personal burdens that can affect the clinical and&#xD;
      patient reported outcomes after surgery. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      intensive SNAP interventions compared to treatment as usual (TAU) in ptt undergoing&#xD;
      urological cancer surgery on surgical risk reduction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project contains three clinical intervention studies including 100 urological cancer&#xD;
      patients screened positive for at least 1 SNAP factor:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Efficacy and preferences of intensive SNAP-Interventions among patients with at least one&#xD;
      SNAP factor and undertaking neo-adjuvant chemotherapy before radical cystectomy. A randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial with nested interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Implementation and preferences of intensive SNAP-Interventions among patients with kidney&#xD;
      cancer undergoing nephrectomy/partial nephrectomy. An implementation feasibility study&#xD;
      including interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Reach out and effect as well as preferences of perioperative intensive smoking cessation&#xD;
      intervention via the municipality clinic compared to the surgical department among smokers&#xD;
      with non-invasive bladder cancer treated with Trans-Urethral Resection of the Bladder&#xD;
      (TUR-B). A randomised controlled trial with nested interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention groups receive minimum five educational sessions tailored to individual&#xD;
      needs over six weeks perioperatively. The control groups receive standard care.&#xD;

    <description>Intervention: Patients allocated to the intervention group receive weekly counselling sessions in 6 weeks as an integrated prehabilitation program tailored to meet the individual patient's need for risk reduction at surgery. It is introduced via the surgical 'Engage in the process of change'. The smoking and alcohol cessation intervention follows the Gold Standard Programme and patients in the intervention group are introduced to a standardized exercise training programme taking individualized needs into account. Nutritional support is also individualized.</description>
