  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study evaluates the efficacy and safety of anlotinib in patients with&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma who have progressed on lenvatinib treatment. It is a single arm,&#xD;
      open-label clinical trial conducted in China, and plan to recruit 28 patients. Primary&#xD;
      endpoint of the study is Progress Free Survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anlotinib is a novel multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for tumor angiogenesis and&#xD;
      proliferative signaling. The prime targets of anlotinib include receptor tyrosine kinases&#xD;
      vascular endothelial growth factor receptor1 to 3 (VEGFR1-3), fibroblast growth factor&#xD;
      receptor 1 to 4 (FGFR1-4), platelet-derived growth factor receptor α and β (PDGFR α, β), and&#xD;
      stem cell factor receptor.&#xD;
