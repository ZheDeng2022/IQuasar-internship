  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine cultural and disease-related barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators to following the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern&#xD;
      among Black Americans with moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) and test the impact of a&#xD;
      behavioral diet counseling intervention on DASH diet adherence, blood pressure, and&#xD;
      CKD-relevant outcomes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Excess cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality among Black Americans with CKD is a significant&#xD;
      US public health disparity. Compared to their White counterparts, Blacks develop CKD earlier&#xD;
      in life and Blacks with CKD are 3 times more likely to progress to kidney failure&#xD;
      necessitating dialysis or kidney transplantation, and are 1.5 times more likely to die&#xD;
      prematurely from CVD. Hypertension, which is also more prevalent, more severe, and less often&#xD;
      controlled in Blacks with CKD compared to Whites, is a leading cause of CKD and CVD, and a&#xD;
      major contributor to the racial disparity in CVD mortality. Thus, improving hypertension in&#xD;
      Blacks with CKD could have a profound positive impact on an important minority health issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DASH diet lowers BP and reduces CVD risk in patients with hypertension and has a greater&#xD;
      effect on BP in Blacks compared to Whites. However, the effect of the DASH diet on BP in&#xD;
      Blacks with CKD has not been established. First, investigators will conduct a qualitative&#xD;
      study to identify self-perceived barriers and facilitators of DASH diet adherence among&#xD;
      Blacks with moderate CKD. Then, investigators will conduct feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy testing of a disease-sensitive, culturally-appropriate diet counseling&#xD;
      intervention on DASH adherence and blood pressure in Blacks with CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the clinical trial portion of this project Qualitative Focus Groups were held to&#xD;
      identify self-perceived barriers and facilitators of DASH diet adherence among African&#xD;
      Americans with CKD. Three to 4 groups of 6-8 participants were asked semi-structured&#xD;
      questions to determine self-perceived sociocultural barriers and facilitators of DASH diet&#xD;
      adherence and disease-specific factors that may influence their ability and willingness to&#xD;
      follow a DASH-style diet. The information in the rest of this record pertains to the clinical&#xD;
      trial portion of the project.&#xD;
