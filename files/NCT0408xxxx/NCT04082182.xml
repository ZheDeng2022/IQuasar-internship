  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MIDRIX4-LUNG is a novel tetravalent autologous dendritic cell vaccine in metastatic non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer patients. This first-in-human study aims to primarily establish maximal&#xD;
      tolerated dose of MIDRIX4-LUNG administered i.v.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy, in the shape of immune checkpoint inhibitors, is transforming the therapeutic&#xD;
      landscape of non-small cell lung cancer. Checkpoint inhibitors can deliver durable tumor&#xD;
      regressions, however only a minority of patients derive this kind of benefit, even with&#xD;
      recent combinatorial approaches. It is clear from these clinical results that the full&#xD;
      anti-tumoral power of the immune system is not being leveraged yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccination aims to prime and/or expand tumor antigen-targeting T-cells and induce&#xD;
      immunological memory against later disease relapse. Whereas immune checkpoint blockade boosts&#xD;
      inactivated responses of effector T cells, vaccination can potentially activate naive T cells&#xD;
      with tumor specificity and in this way broaden the tumor-specific immune responses that are&#xD;
      the target of immune checkpoint inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the optimal vaccination modality for NSCLC still needs to be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized antigen presenting leukocytes that are now recognized&#xD;
      as the central controllers of the immune response. The DCs unique capacity to induce robust,&#xD;
      highly antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses has led to the use of in vitro-generated&#xD;
      autologous DCs as cancer vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed a method for the rapid production of DCs with all the&#xD;
      required features for the induction of anti-tumor immunity. The cells are particularly potent&#xD;
      in inducing type 1-polarized T-helper cell and antigen-specific cytolytic T-cell responses.&#xD;
      The DCs are loaded with a proprietary selection of 4 antigens that cover &gt;90% of all NSCLC&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the objective of ultimately combining this DC vaccine with immune checkpoint inhibition,&#xD;
      the investigators will first establish feasibility and maximal tolerated dose of DC&#xD;
      vaccination as monotherapy using an intra-patient dose escalation scheme.&#xD;
