  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to investigate the effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      decitabine and THU in healthy adults when administered as a modified release formulation of&#xD;
      the 2 drugs in combination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the relative pharmacokinetics of oral decitabine and&#xD;
      tetrahydrouridine (THU) after a high-fat, high-calorie (FDA standard) meal as compared to&#xD;
      decitabine and THU under fasting conditions in healthy adult male and female subjects. In&#xD;
      addition, this study is to compare the pharmacokinetic parameters between male and female&#xD;
      subjects, and also to capture safety information for the decitabine and THU combination in&#xD;
      healthy subjects after oral dosing.&#xD;

             study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any serious medical condition, clinically significant laboratory abnormality, or&#xD;

             end-of-study visit. Subjects will be instructed not to consume any of the above&#xD;
             products; however, allowance for an isolated single incidental consumption may be&#xD;
