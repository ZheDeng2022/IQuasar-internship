  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maximum fatty acid oxidation is known to occur at exercise intensities between 45 and 65%&#xD;
      VO2max and in the fasting state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the optimal level may depend on various unknown factors. Glycerolemia is a good&#xD;
      marker of the fatty acid metabolism but its evolution remains poorly described, maybe due to&#xD;
      the difficulty of the measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new device allows an easy measurement of glycerolemia during exercise and could enable&#xD;
      personalization strategies to optimize exercise efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators plan to test three different exercise types and three&#xD;
      different fasting conditions with three replicates each to evaluate the variability of&#xD;
      glycerolemia and its evolution during exercise.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The metabolism of mobilized fatty acids as an energy reserve during physical exercise&#xD;
      produces glycerol, which makes it a marker of the intensity of lipolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This measurement of the intensity of lipolysis in humans can be carried out according to&#xD;
      several methods. Since glycerol is a product of lipolysis, its rate of appearance (Ra) in the&#xD;
      blood represents a physical quantity naturally associated with lipolysis activity.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, its quantification requires the use of a tracer isotope (deuterated glycerol),&#xD;
      which limits its applicability. The alternative is the determination of glycerolemia in the&#xD;
      blood or in the interstitial fluid via a microdialysis probe placed in subcutaneous adipose&#xD;
      tissue;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a measuring device has been proposed which makes it possible to measure&#xD;
      glycerolemia from capillary blood, in the manner of measuring blood glucose in diabetic&#xD;
      patients. This device has the advantage of being used repeatedly after a physical exercise.&#xD;
      This flexibility also makes it possible to consider the personalization of the sports program&#xD;
      by identifying the circumstances associated with an increase in lipolysis such as the type of&#xD;
      meal preceding the exercise or its intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence suggests that moderate-intensity exercise (about 45% -65% VO2max) performed under&#xD;
      fasting conditions maximizes lipid metabolism as a source of energy, compared with&#xD;
      carbohydrate metabolism. But these data conceal a likely significant variability in&#xD;
      individual outcomes, including levels of training, gender, age, and nutritional intake prior&#xD;
      to exercise. Our hypothesis is that the current recommendation to the diabetic patient, or&#xD;
      with a metabolic syndrome, to exercise moderate intensity fasting physical activity could be&#xD;
      adapted individually to each patient in order to optimize the benefits of such a practice. In&#xD;
      this sense, the easy access to a measurement of capillary glycerolemia could make it possible&#xD;
      to identify in a personalized way the type of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project aims to accurately describe the evolution of capillary glycerolemia in&#xD;
      several configurations of physical exercise (variable intensity) by controlling the effect of&#xD;
      the previous meal. It will also seek to identify situations associated with a greater&#xD;
      increase in capillary glycerolemia to pave the way for personalization of the sports activity&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
