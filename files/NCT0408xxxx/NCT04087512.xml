  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls in old age can lead to severe physical and psychological restrictions. Training&#xD;
      interventions for fall prevention can therefore improve the quality of life considerably.&#xD;
      With perturbation-based balance training (PBT), which addresses the reactive balance control&#xD;
      after a perturbation, a large reduction in the fall rate seems possible. In this study, we&#xD;
      are comparing the effects of an Instrumented PBT (on a perturbation treadmill) and a&#xD;
      conventional PBT (training under unstable conditions on different balance devices). In&#xD;
      addition, both approaches will be compared with a passive control group. 111 participants&#xD;
      aged 65 years or older will be randomly assigned to the three arms of the study. As the main&#xD;
      outcomes, we will use the prospective rate of falls in a 12-months follow-up period and the&#xD;
      Brief BESTest for assessing the fall risk. Secondary outcomes include balance performance,&#xD;
      force capacity, and neuromuscular control during perturbations. We hypothesize that both&#xD;
      interventions lead to a significant reduction in falls compared to the control group.&#xD;
      Additionally, we explore whether instrumented PBT is superior to the conventional PBT or vice&#xD;
      versa.&#xD;

    <description>Perturbations into different directions are induced during static and dynamic tasks on a treadmill. Perturbations include announced and unannounced perturbations. Intensity and number of perturbations increases over the course of the intervention based on judgement of participant. Intervention duration: 6 weeks, 3 sessions a week, each session approx. 30 minutes.</description>

    <intervention_name>Exercises of dynamic stability under unstable conditions</intervention_name>
    <description>The mechanisms of dynamic stability recovery are trained under unstable conditions. Different unstable undergrounds are used to stand on, perform lunges or jumps. Additionally, balance is challenged by different restrictions (e.g. decreased base of support, closed eyes) or therapist-applied perturbations. Intervention duration: 6 weeks, 3 sessions a week, each session approx. 45 minutes.</description>
