  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the phase 1 portion of the study, the primary objectives are to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and to determine a recommended phase 2 dose&#xD;
      regimen (RP2DR) of REGN5459 as monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple&#xD;
      myeloma (MM) who have exhausted all therapeutic options that are expected to provide&#xD;
      meaningful clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase 2 portion of the study, the primary objective is to assess the preliminary&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity of REGN5459 as measured by objective response rate (ORR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase 1 and phase 2 portion, the secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of REGN5459 as measured by duration of&#xD;
           response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), rate of minimal residual disease (MRD)&#xD;
           negative status, and overall survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of REGN5459&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the immunogenicity of REGN5459&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effects of REGN5459 on patient-reported quality of life (QoL), symptoms,&#xD;
           functioning and general health status&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase 1 portion of the study only, the secondary objective of the study is to assess&#xD;
      the preliminary anti-tumor activity of REGN5459 as measured by ORR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase 2 portion of the study only, the secondary objective of the study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of REGN5459.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 12 Weeks After the Last Dose</time_frame>
    <description>Phase 1 and phase 2&#xD;
The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item subject self-report questionnaire composed of both multi-item and single scales, including global health status/quality of life, functional Scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social) , symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Participants rate items on a 4-point scale, with 1 as &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 as &quot;very much.&quot;</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 12 Weeks After the Last Dose</time_frame>
    <description>Phase 1 and phase 2&#xD;
The EORTC QLQ-MY20 is a self-administered instrument to assess QoL in persons with MM. This 20-item questionnaire measures the following domains: symptom scales, including disease symptoms (6 items) and symptoms related to side effects of treatment (10 items); function scale and future perspective (3 items); and body image (1 item). A high score represents a high level of symptoms or problems.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 12 Weeks After the Last Dose</time_frame>
    <description>Phase 1 and phase 2&#xD;
The EQ-5D-3L is a self-administered generic standardized health status measure, consisting of an EQ-5D descriptive system and an EQ visual analog scale. The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system assesses 5 dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is rated on a 3-level scale: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. The EQ visual analog scale component is a vertical visual analog scale used by patients to rate their health.</description>
