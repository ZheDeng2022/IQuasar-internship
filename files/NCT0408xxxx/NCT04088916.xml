      In summary, in this project the investigators propose to study the proviral DNA genotyping to&#xD;
      implement a lower cost and wider than the commercial systems currently in use, in order to&#xD;
      analyze all HIV genes that are therapeutic targets of antiretroviral drugs. Using HIV&#xD;
      proviral DNA we can obtain information for: HIV-1 Viral Tropism, Mutations associated to&#xD;
      Integrase Inhibitors, Mutations associated to Transcriptase reverse Inhibitors, Mutations&#xD;
      associated to Protease Inhibitors, and Mutations associated to GP41 Inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with this the investigators propose to validate the proviral DNA as starting material&#xD;
      for genotyping which is independent of the patient's viral load and achieve a greater number&#xD;
      of patients living with HIV have access to this important test that is essential in&#xD;
      monitoring the HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 RESEARCH QUESTIONs Is proviral DNA a genetic compartment suitable for carrying out a&#xD;
      genotypic resistance test in patients with low or undetectable viral load? Does proviral DNA&#xD;
      have the same clinical validity that RNA? 3.3.- HYPOTHESIS A resistance genotyping test&#xD;
      carried out by Proviral DNA detects the same mutations associated to resistance that viral&#xD;
      RNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4.- OBJECTIVES: General/Specific General objective Develop a methodology to assess the&#xD;
      proviral HIV-1 DNA or RNA as the genetic material for genotyping assays in genes that are&#xD;
      targets of pharmacological interest as TR reverse transcriptase and protease (PRO), Integrase&#xD;
      or GP41 Inhibitors and HIV tropism. Specific Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Carry out genotyping by proviral DNA and compare it with the same genes genotyping&#xD;
      performed with viral RNA. 2. Once the correlation between proviral DNA and RNA has shown,&#xD;
      standardize a method to use the technique for clinical use in monitoring HIV patients&#xD;
      according to each patient's needs. RNA for patients with viral load above 1,000 copies/mL.&#xD;
      Proviral DNA for patients with low or undetectable viral load.&#xD;

      A prospective longitudinal observational study, the objective is to observe and describe the&#xD;
      prevalence of INRT, INNRT, Protease and INIS mutations detected by proviral DNA in patients&#xD;
      with virologic failure and low level viremia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/Exclusion: Our Study will include only patients with HIV that had been confirmed by&#xD;
      &quot;Instituto de Salud Pública de Chile&quot; (ISP-Chile). Children less than 18 years are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Patients: A total of 1,200 patients will be included in a period of three years&#xD;
      (Including statistical justification, if appropriate).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Only patients who have signed informed consent will be admitted to our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - The admitted patients will have a blood sample taken for an HIV genotypic resistance&#xD;
           test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - from the clinical record of each patient admitted, some relevant clinical data will be&#xD;
           taken to interpret the results such as CD4 T lymphocyte count, Viral Load, date of HIV&#xD;
           diagnosis, date of initiation of therapy in addition to number and type of treatments&#xD;
           antiretrovirals&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - By way of genotype control, a second blood sample will be taken every year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed Description&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detection of Resistance Mutations in Proviral DNA in HIV-1 Infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background The genetic test HIV proviral DNA (HPD) for resistance to antiretroviral drugs is&#xD;
      very useful to detect mutations in patients under antiretroviral therapy who has failed to&#xD;
      achieve undetectable viral loads levels or with low level viremia (LLV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HPD allows the detection of circulating resistant variants and archived which could not be&#xD;
      detected in the plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HPD is independent of the viral load of patients. This makes it very useful for studies of&#xD;
      primary resistance as it can detect resistance mutations in recently diagnosed patients with&#xD;
      low baseline viral loads (&lt;1,000 copies/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HPD is recommended by the European AIDS Clinical Society EACS for cases where there is not&#xD;
      HIV RNA for analysis (Barcelona, October 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HPD is able to analyze resistance to all antiretroviral drugs currently available in the&#xD;
      market. Therefore, with the HPD innovation we can carry out the following genetic resistance&#xD;
      tests: HIV Tropism (Maraviroc), resistance to Integrase Inhibitors (Dolutegravir) and&#xD;
      resistance to Transcriptase reversa/Proteasa (Abacavir).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Size Sample and Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a period of two years, we will study a population of 1,200 patients. These include all&#xD;
      patients we have analyzed in our HIV center until December 2012. The methodology includes&#xD;
      nucleic acid extraction, amplification of HIV-1 genes that are targets of therapeutic&#xD;
      interest and sequencing by traditional and new generation sequencing methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Recruitment: a Total of 1.200 (400 by year)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtaining blood samples: two samples: sample to the start and one sample to the end after one&#xD;
      year&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA and viral RNA extraction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      RT-PCR amplification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrophoresis visualization in agarose gels&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sending samples to Macrogen for sequencing services&#xD;
&#xD;
      Automatic sequencing by Sanger method in Macrogen USA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequencing by deep sequencing (NGS) in Chile or Macrogen USA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Analysis and assemble of raw sequences in software ReCall&#xD;
&#xD;

      Results Report and Publications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary results Preliminary analysis of 100 patients with viral load &lt;1,000 copies/mL,&#xD;
      detected 10% of patients with mutations of resistance to drugs that inhibit reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase and viral protease. This valuable information enabled earlier therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention by changing the drug scheme before they reach higher levels of viral load with&#xD;
      consequent improvement in the clinical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Projections Project Due to the success and immediate application of this preliminary study,&#xD;
      we believe it become very important to validate this technique as a daily routine genetic&#xD;
      testing for HIV clinic patients in the public health system. Permanent financing for this&#xD;
      genetic HIV test for HIV proviral DNA should be given by the Ministry of Health, Government&#xD;
      of Chile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, at present HPD is very useful tool to study virologic failure and LLV in order&#xD;
      to an early change of the antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
