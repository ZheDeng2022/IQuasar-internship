      Without blood flow, bone cannot maintain its integrity. Bone blood flow responds to various&#xD;
      local and systemic factors, however, bone perfusion in humans remains relatively unstudied.&#xD;
      The investigators will study key mechanisms that regulate bone perfusion in able-bodied and&#xD;
      contrast responses to those with spinal cord injury (SCI). SCI is a model of chronic reduced&#xD;
      loading with loss of sympathetic regulation. In tibial cortical bone, the investigators will:&#xD;
      1) determine the impact of compressive loading with and without muscle contractions; 2)&#xD;
      determine the impact of vascular sympathetic activity and systemic perfusion pressure; 3)&#xD;
      compare the response between able-bodied and those with SCI. Acute metabolic needs of bone&#xD;
      due to loading increase flow substantially. In addition, the bone vasculature is innervated&#xD;
      by a rich network of sympathetic nerves that serve a functional purpose in the control of&#xD;
      blood flow. A critical limitation to the study of bone blood flow in humans has been the lack&#xD;
      of non-invasive assessments. Previously, the investigators developed a near infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy (NIRS) device to non-invasively assess blood content in bone and assessed tibial&#xD;
      perfusion in response to exercise. Here, the investigators will test the hypothesis that bone&#xD;
      blood flow increases proportional to loading conditions in both able-bodied individuals and&#xD;
      those with SCI. The investigators will also test the hypothesis that there are decreases in&#xD;
      blood bone flow that are proportional to increases in leg vascular sympathetic outflow in the&#xD;
      able-bodied, but that changes in bone blood flow are proportional to changes in blood&#xD;
      pressure in those with SCI. The proposed research will be some of the first to determine the&#xD;
      control of bone flow in humans.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All tissues of the human body require adequate perfusion to provide oxygen and nutrients to&#xD;
      meet metabolic demands. It has long been known that the arterial system in bone is of&#xD;
      overwhelming importance and that without blood flow, bone cannot maintain its integrity.&#xD;
      Indeed, there is an extensive network of arteries, arterioles, and capillaries that supply&#xD;
      human bone. Moreover, blood flow to bone is responsive to various local and systemic factors&#xD;
      that can determine the overall health of bone. However, bone perfusion in humans remains&#xD;
      relatively unstudied and so the underlying mechanisms that regulate bone blood flow are not&#xD;
      well understood. The investigators propose to study key mechanisms that regulate bone&#xD;
      perfusion in able-bodied individuals and to contrast them with spinal cord injured (SCI)&#xD;
      individuals. SCI represents a human 'model' of chronic reduced loading with loss of&#xD;
      sympathetic regulation below the level of injury that likely alters control of bone&#xD;
      perfusion. Accordingly, our aims are to: 1) Determine the impact of compressive loading with&#xD;
      and without associated muscle contractions on tibial perfusion; 2) Determine the impact of&#xD;
      vascular sympathetic activity and systemic perfusion pressure on tibial perfusion; 3) Compare&#xD;
      the changes in tibial perfusion in response to local and systemic factors between able-bodied&#xD;
      and those with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of work in bone blood flow has been in animals and/or has focused on the&#xD;
      association between adequate or inadequate perfusion and bone health. For example, inadequate&#xD;
      flow has been associated with bone loss, impaired growth, and delayed fracture healing.&#xD;
      However, the acute metabolic needs of bone due to loading either with or without associated&#xD;
      muscle contractions increase flow substantially. Indeed, within two minutes of isolated&#xD;
      muscle contractions alone, tibial perfusion has been shown to increase significantly.&#xD;
      Furthermore, when there is compressive loading with associated muscle contractions, flow to&#xD;
      bone can double. Similarly, skeletal unloading for as short as ten minutes cuts femoral&#xD;
      perfusion by half. Although it is unclear what specific local factors (e.g., metabolic&#xD;
      by-products) with loading might be responsible for regulation of blood flow, these data&#xD;
      strongly suggest that perfusion to bone is highly responsive to skeletal loading. Indeed, it&#xD;
      appears that similar regulatory mechanisms may be at play in control of flow to bone and&#xD;
      skeletal muscle during exercise. In addition, the bone vasculature is richly innervated by&#xD;
      sympathetic nerves. Application of norepinephrine decreases blood flow to both intact bone&#xD;
      and isolated bone. Likewise, sympathetic stimulation decreases flow to bone via&#xD;
      alpha-adrenergic receptor activation. Moreover, smooth muscle of arterioles in bone respond&#xD;
      as expected to vasodilators and vasoconstrictors. Hence, sympathetic innervation of the bone&#xD;
      vasculature serves a functional purpose in control of flow. If this were not the case,&#xD;
      independent of the link between bone metabolism and bone flow, the arterial network in bone&#xD;
      would act as a simple pressure passive system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A critical limitation to the study of bone flow in humans has been the lack of noninvasive&#xD;
      assessments. Thus, it has been difficult to elucidate the mechanisms that control perfusion&#xD;
      to bone. The dense nature of bone makes it difficult to investigate perfusion and the&#xD;
      techniques used to quantify circulation in other tissues are either difficult or impossible&#xD;
      to apply to bone in vivo. the investigators recently demonstrated the efficacy of a near&#xD;
      infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) system to non-invasively detect changes in hemoglobin content in&#xD;
      the tibia. Although our preliminary work showed the utility of NIRS, it was not designed to&#xD;
      provide insight to blood flow regulation and disentangle the various possible contributors to&#xD;
      bone perfusion. Here the investigators propose to study different mechanisms that control&#xD;
      blood flow to bone in both able-bodied and spinal cord injured (SCI). The SCI population will&#xD;
      offer valuable insights to the mechanisms of perfusion as several contributors (i.e. loading&#xD;
      and vascular sympathetic control) are either reduced or disrupted.&#xD;
