    <description>Remission is defined as a score of 4 or below as assessed by The Severity Measure for Depression-Adult measure (adapted from the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]). The Severity Measure for Depression-Adult measure is a 9-item scale, and each item on the measure is rated on a 4-point scale. The total score ranges from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater severity of depression.</description>

    <description>MST will be performed with the MagPro XP (120 V) device under anesthesia 2-3 times a week up to 15 sessions.Treatment is performed by magnetic stimulation of both hemispheres inducing a focal stimulation above vertex, using a serial of pulse trains with a frequency of at least 25 Hz but up to 100 Hz for 4-6 s (up to 10 s), which is sufficient to induce a tonic clonic seizure.</description>

    <description>ECT will be performed with MECTA 5000Q, 4th generation ECT devices provided by MECTA Corporation under anesthesia 2-3 times a week up to 15 sessions.For initial procedure Seizure Threshold (ST) will be estimated by empiric titration in the first session of each participant. ST will be then determined as by the manufacturer of ECT Device by the titration schedule for the initial titration session.The subsequent treatment sessions were dosed at 6 times the charge of the seizure threshold.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are diagnosed by Bipolar I or II, current episode depressed who require a&#xD;

             participation and for an additional one week after the end of ECT/transcranial&#xD;
             magnetic stimulation (TMS) administration. Of note, ECT is indicated in depression&#xD;
             during pregnancy and has been safely used for decades but MST's effects on fetus are&#xD;
             still unknown&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For males of reproductive potential: use of condoms or other methods to ensure&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has sufficient English in completing self-rated scales&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Good general health evidenced by obtained medical clearance before the procedures from&#xD;
             another provider&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On a stable drug regimen of psychotropic medication for at least 6 weeks at the time&#xD;
             of entry into the study. Medication changes can be made during patient's study&#xD;
             participation but would be limited to the clinical judgment of the PI&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have an implanted device that is activated or controlled in any way by&#xD;
             physiological signals (examples: pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators&#xD;
             [ICD's], vagus nerve simulators (VNS) and wearable cardioverter-defibrillators&#xD;
             (WCD's),ocular implants, deep brain stimulators, implanted medication pumps,&#xD;
             intracardiac lines, even when removed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have conductive, ferromagnetic or other magnetic sensitive metals&#xD;
             implanted in their head or within 30 cm of the treatment coil such as stents and&#xD;
             bullet fragments).Standard amalgam dental fillings are not affected by the magnetic&#xD;
             field and are acceptable in patients&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of severe personality disorder, where, based on the judgment of the&#xD;

             complete the follow-up protocol,example,borderline personality disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Imminent risk of suicide (based on the judgment of the investigators; e.g. patient has&#xD;

             suicide, patient exhibits the presence of current suicidal ideation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not able to comply with the operational and administrative requirements of&#xD;
             participation in the study (based on the judgment of the investigators)&#xD;
&#xD;

             succinylcholine, methohexital, ketamine, propofol, ketorolac&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another drug, device, or biologics trial within the preceding 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disallowed concomitant medications: antiepileptics and benzodiazepines as they are&#xD;
             against seizure therapies, short or mid acting benzodiazepines such as alprazolam,&#xD;
             temazepam, midazolam, lorazepam will be allowed but they should be skipped at least 10&#xD;
             hours before the procedures. Medications that are supposed to have weak antiepileptic&#xD;
             features such as lamotrigine, topiramate, gabapentin will be reviewed by the PI and&#xD;
             either tapered down or discontinued based upon clinical judgment. Lithium will be&#xD;
             tapered off before the procedure because of the increased risk of postictal&#xD;
