  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies the barriers associated with timely chemotherapy given after surgery&#xD;
      (adjuvant) in patients with invasive breast cancer. Meeting with patients and asking&#xD;
      questions may help doctors to learn about factors that can cause delays in the start of&#xD;
      chemotherapy after surgery in patients with breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To comprehensively and qualitatively assess and identify the determinants of time to&#xD;
      chemotherapy (TTC) delays in a vulnerable population using qualitative methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. To describe the health literacy/numeracy, social support and level of trust in physicians&#xD;
      of the study participants. (Exploratory)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete questionnaires and participate in an interview to answer questions about&#xD;
      the information patients received before starting the chemotherapy, any medical problems&#xD;
      after the surgery that could have been related to the start of the chemotherapy, how the&#xD;
      chemotherapy affected patients' life, and anything else patients may remember between the&#xD;
      time when the breast surgery ended and the first dose of chemotherapy started. Patients'&#xD;
      medical records are also reviewed.&#xD;

Qualitative analysis will be done in partnership with a qualitative research consulting group (ResearchTalk, Inc.). Transcripts of the semi-structured interviews will be de-identified by removing 18 protected health information (PHI) identifiers from the transcripts.</description>
