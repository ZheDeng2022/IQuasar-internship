  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Students who live off campus at the University of Vermont will be recruited to participate in&#xD;
      the study which will begin in Fall 2019 and run through May 2020. The intervention is a&#xD;
      randomized-controlled trial where students will be randomized into one of four conditions: 1)&#xD;
      Active cooking classes followed by meal kits and recipes, 2) Active cooking classes followed&#xD;
      by no further instruction, 3) No cooking classes followed by meal kits and recipes, or 4) No&#xD;
      intervention. Assessments will be conducted at baseline and following each phase.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot study is a randomized trial to evaluate whether cooking classes produce&#xD;
      greater gains in cooking skills, food agency, and cooking frequency than meal kits or no&#xD;
      intervention. There will be three phases to the study intervention and four study conditions&#xD;
      (as outlined below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1- Cooking classes. All participants will attend 1 kitchen intensive session followed&#xD;
      by 1 cooking class per week for 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2- Meal Kits. Assigned participants will receive meal kit deliveries once per week for&#xD;
      6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3- Recipes. Assigned participants will receive 5 healthy recipes by email once per week&#xD;
      for 6 weeks. This phase was planned, but was canceled due to disruptions caused by the&#xD;
      COVID-19 outbreak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will randomize 64 students to one of four intervention conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A (n=16) - Active cooking classes followed by meal kits and recipes Group B (n=16) -&#xD;
      Active cooking classes followed by no further instruction Group C (n=16) - No cooking classes&#xD;
      followed by meal kits and recipes Group D (n=16) - No intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will be conducted at baseline, and following each phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cooking Classes: Subjects in the cooking class conditions will begin with a brief lecture on&#xD;
      the day's lesson followed by a demonstration from the chef instructor. Subjects will then&#xD;
      work with a partner to prepare the recipe with guidance from the chef instructor. All&#xD;
      participants will receive printed copies of the weekly recipe(s). At the end of the class&#xD;
      period all subjects will take part in a sensory experience led by the chef instructor in&#xD;
      which they will observe the appearance, smell, taste, and texture, of the meal they have just&#xD;
      prepared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meal Kits: With the meal delivery service, participants will get all the ingredients they&#xD;
      need to make a meal as well as a recipe for the meal which includes step-by-step photos. They&#xD;
      are then responsible for doing the actual cooking of the meal. Students will all receive kits&#xD;
      for 3 meals per week from the same delivery service and will have the option to select meals&#xD;
      that fit their dietary needs (vegetarian, gluten free, etc.). Meal kits are designed to serve&#xD;
      two individuals therefore students should have enough food for six meals, though they will&#xD;
      only need to cook three times. The service used is open to the public, therefore students who&#xD;
      enjoyed the meal kit service could opt to continue service and pay for it themselves.&#xD;
      However, students will be instructed to wait until study completion to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipes: Recipes will be designed by the research team, which includes three registered&#xD;
      dietitians and a trained chef. Students will receive recipes for five healthy meals per week.&#xD;
      Participants will need to shop, budget, and plan on their own. Recipes will accommodate major&#xD;
      dietary preferences including vegetarian and gluten-free.&#xD;

    <description>Difference in diet quality change between groups from baseline, end of phase 1, and end of phase 2. Measured by Healthy Eating Index scores.&#xD;
The HEI includes 13 components that capture recommendations of the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. There are two groupings of components:&#xD;
Adequacy components are encouraged. Higher scores reflect higher intakes.&#xD;
Moderation components should be limited. Higher scores reflect lower intakes. A higher total HEI score reflects higher diet quality as defined by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&#xD;
Components are weighted equally and assigned a score of either 5 or 10. Scores as summed to determine total score. Score range is 0 - 100.&#xD;
Adequacy Components:&#xD;
Total Fruits 5 Whole Fruits 5 Total vegetables 5 Greens and beans 5 Whole grains 10 Dairy 10 Total protein foods 5 Seafood and plant proteins 5 Fatty acids 10&#xD;

    <measure>Cooking and Food Practices at Baseline and Change From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, end of phase 1, and end of phase 2, up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cooking and Food Practices score at baseline and change at phase 1 and phase 2, will be measured by The Cooking and Food Provisioning Action Scale (CAFPAS) measures food preparation skills and capacities. The CAFPAS contains 28 items administered with a 7-point bipolar Likert scale. There are three subscales: Self-Efficacy (measures whether an individual thinks their cooking ability and skills are adequate), Attitude (measures an individual's affective stance towards food, cooking and provisioning in different areas), and Structure (measures the ways in which external factors can either hinder or support an individual's cooking and provisioning actions). Subscales are scored by coding responses from 1-7, reversing them as necessary, summing the items and dividing by the standard deviation of the sample population's scores on the subscale. The total CAFPAS score is the sum of the three subscales. The total score range is 3-196. A higher score is associated with improvement.</description>

    <measure>Stress Level at Baseline and Change From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, end of phase 1, and end of phase 2, up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale is a reliable and valid measure of perceived stress in adults including college students. Ten questions assess how often one perceives various forms of stress such as feeling unable to control important events, being upset by something unexpected, and feeling nervous. Individual scores on the PSS can range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress.&#xD;
Scores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress. Scores ranging from 14-26 would be considered moderate stress. Scores ranging from 27-40 would be considered high perceived stress</description>

The HEI includes 13 components that capture recommendations of the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. There are two groupings of components:&#xD;
Adequacy components are encouraged. Higher scores reflect higher intakes.&#xD;
Moderation components should be limited. Higher scores reflect lower intakes. A higher total HEI score reflects higher diet quality as defined by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&#xD;
Components are weighted equally and assigned a score of either 5 or 10. Scores as summed to determine total score. Score range is 0 - 100.&#xD;

            <description>Participants will attend a weekly 2-hour cooking class to learn how to prepare meals. Participants cook and sample the meal at the end of class and the chef will walk them through a sensory exercise. At the end of each class, participants will be provided with the recipe for the next class and asked to create a timeline for the various steps of preparation. Participants will bring this timeline to class and discuss as a group before preparing the meal.&#xD;
Following 6 weeks of cooking classes, participants will receive 6 weeks of home-delivered meal kits.</description>

            <description>Participants will attend a weekly 2-hour cooking class to learn how to prepare meals. Participants cook and sample the meal at the end of class and the chef will walk them through a sensory exercise. At the end of each class, participants will be provided with the recipe for the next class and asked to create a timeline for the various steps of preparation. Participants will bring this timeline to class and discuss as a group before preparing the meal. Unlike the previous arm, no further instruction will be given once cooking classes end.&#xD;
Active Cooking Classes: 6 cooking classes will be held every week for 6 consecutive weeks. The lessons are patterned after Dr. Amy Trubek's cooking pedagogy and will be tailored for those cooking for themselves for the first time. Classes begin with a brief lecture on the day's topic. Students will work in teams of 2 in the foods lab to actively practice skills and cook a meal. Students receive recipes and information sheets that cover pantry supplies, grocery lists, knife skills and cooking equipment. All students attend a 2 hour kitchen intensive demonstration as an orientation.</description>

        <description>Cooking and Food Practices score at baseline and change at phase 1 and phase 2, will be measured by The Cooking and Food Provisioning Action Scale (CAFPAS) measures food preparation skills and capacities. The CAFPAS contains 28 items administered with a 7-point bipolar Likert scale. There are three subscales: Self-Efficacy (measures whether an individual thinks their cooking ability and skills are adequate), Attitude (measures an individual's affective stance towards food, cooking and provisioning in different areas), and Structure (measures the ways in which external factors can either hinder or support an individual's cooking and provisioning actions). Subscales are scored by coding responses from 1-7, reversing them as necessary, summing the items and dividing by the standard deviation of the sample population's scores on the subscale. The total CAFPAS score is the sum of the three subscales. The total score range is 3-196. A higher score is associated with improvement.</description>

        <description>The Perceived Stress Scale is a reliable and valid measure of perceived stress in adults including college students. Ten questions assess how often one perceives various forms of stress such as feeling unable to control important events, being upset by something unexpected, and feeling nervous. Individual scores on the PSS can range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress.&#xD;
Scores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress. Scores ranging from 14-26 would be considered moderate stress. Scores ranging from 27-40 would be considered high perceived stress</description>

Active Cooking Classes: 6 cooking classes will be held every week for 6 consecutive weeks. The lessons are patterned after Dr. Amy Trubek's cooking pedagogy and will be tailored for those cooking for themselves for the first time. Classes begin with a brief lecture on the day's topic. Students will work in teams of 2 in the foods lab to actively practice skills and cook a meal.

    <limitations_and_caveats>The final planned 6-week intervention phase, Recipe Provision, was cancelled due to disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following spring break, the university transitioned to remote instruction and the majority of the study participants moved back home to live with parents or guardians. As the study was designed to measure cooking behaviors and outcomes in a population of students preparing food independently, the study intervention and data collection could not continue.</limitations_and_caveats>
