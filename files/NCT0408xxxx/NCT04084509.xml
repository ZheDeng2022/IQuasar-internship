  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized clinically&#xD;
      by bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. The hallmark&#xD;
      pathophysiological alteration is a loss of dopaminergic transmission across the nigrostriatal&#xD;
      pathway. According to Braak's neuropathological staging of disease, the pathological process&#xD;
      in PD occurs in a gradual ascending fashion, starting from the olfactory bulb and progressing&#xD;
      to the brainstem, with preferential involvement of the raphe nuclei, which contain&#xD;
      serotonergic nuclei, and the noradrenergic locus coeruleus, before involving the substantia&#xD;
      nigra and thereafter the whole brain. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      neuronal degeneration in PD and currently, no treatment is available to halt disease&#xD;
      progression in PD. The pathophysiological characterisation of phenomena occurring in the time&#xD;
      window between the pathological start of the disease and the onset of motor symptoms is&#xD;
      crucial to develop potential neuroprotective agents. Several genes causing, the so-called&#xD;
      monogenic parkinsonism, have been discovered providing important insights on the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to characterize the molecular phenomena underlying genetic&#xD;
      forms of parkinsonism and, therefore, providing further insights about the possible&#xD;
      mechanisms taking place in PD and help identify targets for disease-modifying therapeutics,&#xD;
      by using PET imaging with [11C]DASB (a marker of Serotonin transporter), SPECT imaging using&#xD;
      [123I]FP-CIT (a marker of the presynaptic Dopamine transporter), and multi-modal MRI imaging,&#xD;
      clinical markers (motor and non-motor symptoms and neuropsychological battery), blood and CSF&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria (for all subjects):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects must be judged by the investigator able to understand the nature, design,&#xD;
             and procedures of the study and must be able to provide a signed and dated informed&#xD;
             consent in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), International Conference on&#xD;
             Harmonization (ICH), and local regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, required study&#xD;
             procedures and laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects must be able to travel to the research sites for the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For female subjects: They must be either of non-childbearing potential (either&#xD;
             surgically sterile or post- menopausal - defined as 12 months of spontaneous&#xD;
             amenorrhea), or, if of childbearing potential, subjects must demonstrate to be&#xD;
             non-pregnant (as demonstrated by negative urine Î²-HCG test at screening),&#xD;
             non-breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects must comply with highly effective contraceptive measures. A highly&#xD;
             effective contraceptive measure is defined as a measure that can achieve a failure&#xD;
             rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly. These methods are&#xD;
             listed in more detail below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Oral, intravaginal, or transdermal combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal&#xD;
        contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Oral, injectable, or implantable progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with&#xD;
        inhibition of ovulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Intrauterine device (IUD) Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS) Bilateral tubal&#xD;
        occlusion Vasectomised partner Sexual abstinence&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For sexually active male subjects, they must agree to use condoms to protect their&#xD;
             partners from becoming pregnant for the duration of the study and for 3 months after&#xD;
             the last administration of PET or SPECT ligands. They must also agree to ensure that&#xD;
             they and their partners are routinely using a medically approved contraceptive method.&#xD;
             It is important that male subjects not impregnate others for the duration of the study&#xD;
             and for 3 months after the last administration of PET or SPECT ligands.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects must have adequate visual and auditory acuity according to investigator's&#xD;
             judgement to complete the psychological testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects must have no use of medications with known interaction with serotonergic&#xD;
             transmission (e.g. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressant,&#xD;
             triptans, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For subjects taking any drugs that might interfere with dopamine transporter SPECT&#xD;
             imaging (neuroleptics, metoclopramide, alpha methyldopa, methylphenidate, reserpine,&#xD;
             or amphetamine derivative) must be willing and able from a medical standpoint to hold&#xD;
             the medication for at least 5 half-lives prior to screening DaTSCAN imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria (for all subjects):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects lacking capacity according to investigator judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of dementia as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current treatment with anticoagulants (e.g. coumadin, heparin) that might preclude&#xD;
             safe completion of the lumbar puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Condition that precludes the safe performance of routine lumbar puncture, such as&#xD;
             prohibitive lumbar spinal disease, bleeding diathesis, or clinically significant&#xD;
             coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any of the following drugs that might interfere with dopamine transporter SPECT&#xD;
             imaging: neuroleptics, metoclopramide, alpha methyldopa, methylphenidate, reserpine,&#xD;
             or amphetamine derivative, within 5 months of Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of investigational drugs or devices within 60 days prior to Baseline (dietary&#xD;
             supplements taken outside of a clinical trial are not exclusionary, e.g., coenzyme&#xD;
             Q10).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of cancer within the last 5 years, with the exception of non-metastatic basal&#xD;
             cell carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with current or recent history of drug or alcohol abuse/dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindication to MRI, such as presence of metal devises or implants (e.g.&#xD;
             pacemaker, vascular- or heart- valves, stents, clips), metal deposited in the body&#xD;
             (e.g. bullets or shells), or metal grains in the eyes;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Claustrophobia or history of back pain that makes prolonged laying on the PET or MRI&#xD;
             scanner intolerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously obtained MRI scan with evidence of clinically significant neurological&#xD;
             disorder (in the opinion of the Investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other medical or psychiatric condition or lab abnormality, which in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator might preclude participation.&#xD;
