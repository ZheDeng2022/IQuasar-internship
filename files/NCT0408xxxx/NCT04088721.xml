      A single center, double-blind, randomized, dose-escalation study to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and efficacy of 3 doses of AD17002 in comparison to placebo. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized at 3:1 ratios in each of 3 cohorts to receive AD17002 or placebo. The following&#xD;
      treatment cohorts are featured in a dose-escalating manner:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Cohort 1 will comprise 16 subjects who will receive, in a double-blind manner, either 20&#xD;
      μg AD17002 (n=12) or placebo (n=4) on Study Day 1, 8, and 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Cohort 2 will comprise 16 subjects who will receive, in a double-blind manner, either 40&#xD;
      μg AD17002 (n=12) or placebo (n=4) on Study Day 1, 8, and 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Cohort 3 will comprise 16 subjects who will receive, in a double-blind manner, either 60&#xD;
      μg AD17002 (n=12) or placebo (n=4) on Study Day 1, 8, and 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 16 subjects in cohort 1 will receive the assigned study preparation before the&#xD;
      remainder of the Cohort. Study drug administration to the next subject for the first 8&#xD;
      subjects in the cohort 1 will be separated for at least one day elapse (at least 24 hrs). The&#xD;
      progression to the next cohort will take place after the SRT review the whole follow-up&#xD;
      period safety data of previous cohort.&#xD;

             symptoms score more than 6, at least on 5 of 7 consecutive calendar days in screening&#xD;
             period. A subject receiving anti-allergy medication is required to washout of their&#xD;
             medication before and during screening period of the trial until the required symptom&#xD;
             threshold is met.&#xD;
&#xD;

             their partner use) an acceptable method of birth control within the projected duration&#xD;
             of the trial. Acceptable methods of birth control are: intrauterine device, hormonal&#xD;
             contraception, diaphragm with spermicide, contraceptive sponge, condom, vasectomy, as&#xD;
             per local regulations or guidelines. Female subjects of childbearing potential must&#xD;

                  determined by the laboratory, or 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea),&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Six weeks postsurgical documented total hysterectomy and/or bilateral&#xD;
                  salpingo-oophorectomy, or&#xD;

          9. Provide written informed consent for the trial and willing to adhere to dose and visit&#xD;
             schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             and/or asthma caused by mold, animal hair and dander, or other allergens (except HDM)&#xD;

             history of allergy other than to HDM, but show any positive result (on CAP test)&#xD;
             towards the allergens could be accepted in the judgement of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;

             corticosteroids intermittently must undergo at least 5 half-lives of washout prior to&#xD;
             the Screening visit.&#xD;

             the effectiveness of the investigational product. Subjects who are non-chronic users&#xD;
             of these medications must undergo at least 5 half-lives of washout prior to the&#xD;
