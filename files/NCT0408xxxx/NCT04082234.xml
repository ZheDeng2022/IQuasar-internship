  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to address a decisional dilemma faced by health system&#xD;
      officials, policy makers, and clinical leaders: &quot;Does it make sense to integrate behavior&#xD;
      therapy into primary care practice to treat children with ADHD from low-income settings? More&#xD;
      specifically, does integrated care improve access to services and patient-centered outcomes&#xD;
      for underserved children with ADHD?&quot; Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two&#xD;
      groups: Behavior therapy integrated into primary care (Partnering to Achieve School Success;&#xD;
      PASS program) to treatment as usual (TAU) informed by American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)&#xD;
      guidelines for ADHD practice and facilitated by electronic practice supports.&quot; Participants&#xD;
      will be 300 children (ages 5-11) with ADHD and their caregivers served at Children's Hospital&#xD;
      of Philadelphia Care Network Locations (primary care offices). Participants are drawn from&#xD;
      primary care locations that serve primarily low-income and racial/ethnic minority population.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Context: Families of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often have&#xD;
      difficulty getting access to behavior therapy for their children. This project focuses on&#xD;
      children and families of low-income, racial/ethnic minority background, who have particular&#xD;
      difficulty getting access to behavior therapy. This study will compare enhanced behavior&#xD;
      therapy integrated into primary care (known as Partnering to Achieve School Success [PASS])&#xD;
      to treatment as usual (TAU) informed by American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines for&#xD;
      the treatment of ADHD. In this study, behavior therapy will include components to address the&#xD;
      unique needs of low-income families of minority status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: This project is designed to improve family use of services for ADHD; improve&#xD;
      children's academic achievement, behavioral compliance, interpersonal relationships, and life&#xD;
      satisfaction; and reduce ADHD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: The study is a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting/Participants: The study is being conducted in five CHOP primary care practices&#xD;
      serving a high percentage of families of low-income, racial/ethnic minority status.&#xD;
      Participants will be children ages 5 to 11 with ADHD and in kindergarten through grade 5.&#xD;
      Children will be randomly assigned to PASS or TAU plus family education, with 150 per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Interventions and Measures: PASS is a behavioral intervention for childhood ADHD that&#xD;
      includes behavior therapy strategies and enhancements to promote family engagement in&#xD;
      treatment, team-based care, and high-quality therapy. PASS uses a fully integrated service&#xD;
      model that includes regular collaboration between the PASS provider and primary care provider&#xD;
      (PCP). The primary outcomes are patient-centered outcomes pertaining to child academic&#xD;
      achievement, behavior compliance, interpersonal relationships, and life satisfaction, as&#xD;
      assessed by parent/legal guardian (or caregiver), child, and teacher rating. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes are informant ratings of ADHD symptoms.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in Homework Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16-weeks (post-treatment), 32-weeks (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The Inattention/Task Avoidance factor of the Homework Problem Checklist (HPC) will be used as a parent-report measure of academic performance. This 12-item scale has strong psychometric properties and is responsive to family-school intervention programs.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Academic Progress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16-weeks (post-treatment), 32-weeks (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The Academic Progress Report (APR) is a teacher-report measure of academic achievement. The APR assesses proficiency in academic subjects relative to standard expectations (1=Well below standard; 3=At standard; 5=Well above standard). The sum of ratings across academic subjects is the unit of analysis. Reliability is acceptable (alpha = .84), and this measure is sensitive to the effect of behavioral treatments.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Academic Grades</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16-weeks (post-treatment), 32-weeks (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The study team will obtain Academic Grades from student's elementary schools. We will obtain student report card grades for students in both conditions. We will calculate students' grade point average based on report card grades.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Behavior Compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16-weeks (post-treatment), 32-weeks (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Behavior compliance will be determined by assessing the severity of disruptive behavior using the eight items pertaining to oppositional-defiant disorder from the Vanderbilt parent scale and four items pertaining to oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD) from the Vanderbilt teacher scale. Both parents and teachers will complete this measure. The psychometric properties of parent and teacher reports on this measure have been shown to be adequate.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Symptoms of ADHD and Emotional and Behavioral Problems</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16-weeks (post-treatment), 32-weeks (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of ADHD symptoms will be assessed using the 18 ADHD items on the Vanderbilt Scales. This measure will be completed by parents and teachers. Parent and teacher ratings of ADHD symptoms have been demonstrated to have excellent psychometric properties and to be sensitive to change in response to treatment. A total symptom score will be used in this study. A child self-report measure of ADHD symptoms will not be included because children with ADHD have been shown to substantially overestimate their competence with regard to paying attention and regulating their behavior.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Peer Relationships</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16-weeks (post-treatment), 32-weeks (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) peer relationships scales will be used to assess child relationships with their peers. The child-report version consists of 8 items and the parent-report measure has 7 items. These measures assess the quality of children's relationships with peers including the degree of peer acceptance. The scales have been shown to produce scores that are both reliable and valid based on analyses using item response theory.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Life Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16-weeks (post-treatment), 32-weeks (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS life satisfaction scale consists of a 4-item child-report measure and a 4-item parent-report measure. It assesses children's and parents' evaluations of the quality of the child's life. Using analyses based in item response theory, these scales have been shown to be reliable with a wide range of life satisfaction levels [from 2.5 standard deviations (SDs) below the mean to 1 SD above the mean].</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Service Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16-weeks (post-treatment), 32-weeks (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Service use for emotional and behavioral problems will be measured via a service use measure adapted for this study designed to gather information on the child's use of services to treat ADHD. In this study, we will collect data on service utilization in outpatient mental health settings and school settings, and treatment with medication.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Parent-Child Relationship</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16-weeks (post-treatment), 32-weeks (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The Parent-Child Relationship Questionnaire (PCRQ) will assess parent perceptions of their parenting practices. The Positive Involvement factor (22 items) and Negative/Ineffective Discipline factor (12 items) have been shown to be internally consistent and sensitive to the effects of behavioral intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Family Empowerment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16-weeks (post-treatment), 32-weeks (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Parent empowerment with regard to their knowledge of how to obtain services for their children will be assessed using the Service System factor of the Family Empowerment Scale. This twelve-item scale has been shown to have adequate reliability (alpha=.87; test-retest=.77) and validity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Perceptions of Team-Based Care</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16-weeks (post-treatment), 32-weeks (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate parental perceptions of team-based care, a seven-item scale was derived from the Clinician and Group Survey, Version 3.0 of the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS, https://cahps.ahrq.gov/surveys-guidance/cg/about/index.html). The scale includes four Communication and three Care Coordination items.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Parent-Teacher Involvement</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16-weeks (post-treatment), 32-weeks (follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Items from the Quality of Parent-Teacher Relationship subscale of the Parent-Teacher Involvement Questionnaire (PTIQ) will be used to evaluate the quality of the family-school relationship. The parent version of the form includes 6 items and the teacher version consists of 5 items. Subscales have been validated in families of youth with ADHD and have demonstrated acceptable internal consistency and validity.</description>
