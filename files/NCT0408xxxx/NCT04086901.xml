  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Denmark, 1000 new cases of esophageal and gastro-esophageal junction cancer occur every&#xD;
      year. Surgery is the primary treatment for patients with localized disease who are considered&#xD;
      medically and technically operable. For patients deemed non-resectable, definitive&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy is the treatment of choice, but despite treatment with curative intent,&#xD;
      these patients have a poor prognosis, with a median survival of less than 20 months and a&#xD;
      5-year survival at 15-25% in clinical studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the effect of escalation of increasing the radiation dose to the most&#xD;
      Positron Emissions Tomografi (PET) avid part of the tumour and lymph nodes compared to a&#xD;
      standard uniform dose distribution.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Denmark, there are almost 900 new cases of oesphageal and gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ)&#xD;
      cancer per year, with a 5-year survival rate below 20% for the entire group and a 5-year&#xD;
      survival rate of approximately 40% for the curatively treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery is the primary treatment for patients with localized disease who are considered&#xD;
      medically and technically operable. For patients deemed non-resectable, definitive&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy is the treatment of choice, but despite treatment with curative intent,&#xD;
      these patients have a poor prognosis, with a median survival of less than 20 months and a&#xD;
      5-year survival at 15-25% in clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival is affected by several factors like stage, gender and comorbidity, but also by lack&#xD;
      of local and regional tumour control. Several studies examined pattern of failure in patients&#xD;
      with oesophageal cancer treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy. Most patients experience&#xD;
      local failure, and most local failures were located in the Gross Tumor volume (GTV). These&#xD;
      findings imply that future therapeutic strategies should focus on improving local control in&#xD;
      order to increase successful treatment outcome, although care should be taken to ensure that&#xD;
      this does not come at the cost of excess treatment related toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategies to overcome in-GTV failures include radiotherapy-sensitizing agents and dose&#xD;
      escalation, the latter has been evaluated in several studies with heterogeneous results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of Positron Emissions Tomografi/ComputerTomografi (PET/CT) in radiotherapy planning&#xD;
      has been examined and the diagnostic value of PET/CT in oesophageal cancer is widely&#xD;
      accepted, whereas the role in assessing tumour response to treatment is less well&#xD;
      established. Flour-Deoxy-Glucose (FDG)-PET scans allow for measurement of changes in tumour&#xD;
      cell metabolism that precede changes in tumour size, and reduction in FDG uptake during&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy has been correlated with favourable outcomes in patients with oesophageal&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET-positive areas have been suggested as suitable targets for dose-escalation strategies,&#xD;
      since studies suggested that high FDG uptake on pre-treatment PET/CT identifies tumour&#xD;
      sub-volumes that are at greater risk of recurrence after chemoradiotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced oesophageal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major concern in a dose escalation study is severe and potentially lethal normal tissue&#xD;
      complications. Oesophageal cancer irradiation usually results in irradiation of the&#xD;
      oesophagus, lungs and heart due to the anatomical tumour location, which may result in acute&#xD;
      toxicities dominated by radiation pneumonitis and esophagitis (leading to inappropriate&#xD;
      nutricial intake). Late toxicities include oesophageal fistula/ulcers, cardiac events,&#xD;
      pulmonary fibrosis, or even deaths related to radiation exposure. Dose gradients between the&#xD;
      target and normal tissue may be sharp, in order to limit the norml tissue dose and hence the&#xD;
      risk of unacceptable toxicity, while maintaining high doses to the tumour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current study Previous studies have suggested that escalating the radiation dose to the GTV&#xD;
      may provide improved local control, but requires great caution in relation to normal tissue&#xD;
      irradiation to avoid unacceptable side effects. The investigators propose a study approach&#xD;
      where both requirements will be met. FDG-PET scans will be used to identify and delineate the&#xD;
      tumour sub-volumes with the highest tracer uptake to guide the dose-escalation. The dose to&#xD;
      the GTV will be escalated to a high dose (63Gray (Gy) in the FDG-PET avid areas in the&#xD;
      primary tumour and 60 Gy in the lymph nodes) while Clinical target volume (CTV) and Planning&#xD;
      target volume (PTV) will be treated with standard dose. The patients will be randomized&#xD;
      between this dose-escalated arm and a standard arm with 50Gy in 25 fractions. The total&#xD;
      number of fractions will be 25 in both arms. Dose escalation will be limited by normal&#xD;
      tissues constraints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted with modern state-of-the-art radiotherapy techniques, including&#xD;
      advanced dose calculation algorithms, daily image guidance, and adaptation of the treatment&#xD;
      plan during treatment if needed. The participating centres must implement and comply with a&#xD;
      quality assurance program in order to maintain high treatment quality in the study.&#xD;
