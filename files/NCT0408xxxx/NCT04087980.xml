    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to collect information on a new treatment of prostate&#xD;
      tissue participants with intermediate risk prostate cancer using a medical device called the&#xD;
      Poseidon System. The Poseidon System is intended to ablate prostate tissue in areas of the&#xD;
      prostate where cancer has been identified. The medical device delivers thermal energy in the&#xD;
      form of water vapor to the prostate tissue through the urethra. Previous research has shown&#xD;
      successful prostate tissue ablation. Additional research may help show successful ablation of&#xD;
      the prostate tissue where cancer is located.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  45-80 years old&#xD;

          -  Biopsy confirmed unilateral, adenocarcinoma of the prostate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Minimum of 12 biopsy cores obtained ≥4 weeks and ≤12 months before treatment. Targeted&#xD;
             fusion biopsy is preferred if there is a MRI PI-RADs ≥3 lesion. It is preferred a&#xD;
             standard 12 sector biopsy is mapped. MRI required if biopsy was completed &gt;6 months&#xD;
             prior to treatment date to confirm no MRI progression of disease that would be&#xD;
             considered exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≤4 of 6 standard sector biopsy cores positive for prostate cancer (unilateral);&#xD;
             positive core(s) from a targeted lesion count as one positive core.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gleason score of 7 (3+4) / International Society of Urological Pathologists (ISUP)&#xD;
             Gleason Grade Group (GGG) 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical Stage less than or equal to T2b N0 M0&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) less than or equal to 15ng/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prostate size 20-80cc&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malignant tumors identified by extraprostatic extension, sphincter involvement/lesion&#xD;
             abutment seminal vesicle invasion or lymph node invasion or metastasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Narrow Peripheral Zone&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MRI identified PI-RADs ≥4 lesion contralateral to the side that has biopsy confirmed&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma&#xD;
