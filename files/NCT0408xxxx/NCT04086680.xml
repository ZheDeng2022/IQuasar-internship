      This study will investigate whether liquid based cytology specimens are a feasible&#xD;
      alternative to formalin-fixed paraffin embedded histology samples for detection of epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in lung adenocarcinoma using the Biocartis Idylla&#xD;
      platform. The Biocartis Idylla is a fully automated, real-time PCR based molecular&#xD;
      diagnostics system. The Idylla carries out the entire analytical process from sample to&#xD;
      result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be based in the cytology department at Royal Cornwall Hospital as part of a&#xD;
      service improvement. It will use residual material from existing samples sent to the&#xD;
      laboratory as part of the routine service. It will use existing material from patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma by cytology using the current, validated procedure which&#xD;
      uses formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples over a 10 month period. EGFR mutation&#xD;
      results obtained using the validated procedure (formalin fixed paraffin embedded) will be&#xD;
      compared to those produced using liquid based cytology samples.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The presence of activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations identifies&#xD;
      patients with lung adenocarcinoma in which EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) can be a&#xD;
      potential first-line treatment. The TKIs currently available are erlotinib, gefitinib and&#xD;
      afatinib, which work by blocking receptor tyrosine kinase activity, thereby halting cell&#xD;
      proliferation and causing cell death. Several studies have found that first-line TKI&#xD;
      treatment prolongs progression free survival in comparison to standard chemotherapy, and is&#xD;
      also associated with a more favourable tolerability and less adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples for EGFR mutation analysis are collected from patients by endobronchial&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) and bronchial brushings and&#xD;
      washings. EBUS-TBNA provides a minimally invasive method for tissue sampling from&#xD;
      radiologically suspicious lymph nodes in the chest using a fine-gauge needle. Samples&#xD;
      obtained are collected and sent to the laboratory for processing. At present, laboratories&#xD;
      rely on the use of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples for EGFR testing,&#xD;
      therefore clots are produced in the laboratory using the collected tissue fragments. The&#xD;
      clotted sample must then be fixed in formalin before being processed in the histology&#xD;
      laboratory to produce slides for microscopic examination by the consultant pathologist. Once&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma is diagnosed, FFPE samples are then sent for EGFR mutation analysis. The&#xD;
      current laboratory process takes approximately 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liquid based cytology (LBC) specimens obtained through the same sampling procedures are also&#xD;
      prepared in the laboratory and fixed using a methanol based solution (PreservCyt). Previous&#xD;
      research has been carried out to determine whether LBC samples can be used instead of FFPE&#xD;
      samples for the detection of EGFR mutations with favourable results. Examples of this include&#xD;
      research by Zhao et al (2017), Satouchi et al (2017), De Luca et al (2017) and Malapelle et&#xD;
      al (2016). A switch to the use of LBC samples for EGFR testing would remove multiple&#xD;
      processing steps in the sample pathway to mutation testing. Immunocytochemistry will be&#xD;
      required in the majority of cases for confirmation of adenocarcinoma. This faster pathway&#xD;
      would be beneficial in cases of already confirmed adenocarcinoma for second line EGFR&#xD;
      treatment testing (T790M) and in cases where the residual cytology sample, that would&#xD;
      normally be discarded, can be utilised for testing, optimising the potential of the sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate whether LBC specimens are a feasible alternative to FFPE samples&#xD;
      for detection of EGFR mutations using the Biocartis Idylla platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If liquid based cytology samples are found to be a feasible alternative this could result in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quicker turnaround time of results in cases of unequivocal adenocarcinoma. This would&#xD;
           provide earlier access to TKIs allowing for optimal patient management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Easier sample preparation within the laboratory&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Would allow for efficient use of all material acquired from the sampling procedures. For&#xD;
           example additional testing could be performed on the FFPE tissue in place of EGFR&#xD;
           testing which could aid in diagnosis. Increase in efficient use of material could also&#xD;
           prevent repeats of the EBUS procedure on patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methanol has been found to be a superior fixative than formalin. Use of liquid based&#xD;
           cytology samples may allow for better results from molecular testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Would provide support to the idea that molecular testing for other cancers may be able&#xD;
           to be carried out on liquid based cytology samples for example BRAF mutation testing for&#xD;
           melanoma. Also provides support of the use of other liquid samples for molecular testing&#xD;
           such as blood samples which could be tested for circulating tumour cells (less invasive&#xD;
           sampling).&#xD;
