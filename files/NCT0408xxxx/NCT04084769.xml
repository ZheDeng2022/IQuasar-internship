      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate the vaccine seroresponse sufficiency of meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and&#xD;
      W following the administration of a booster dose of meningococcal Polysaccharide (Serogroups&#xD;
      A, C, Y and W) Tetanus Toxoid (MenACYW) Conjugate vaccine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Group 1 participants who were first vaccinated with 1 dose of MenACYW Conjugate&#xD;
           vaccine 3-6 years before the booster dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Group 2 participants who were first vaccinated with 1 dose of Menveo vaccine&#xD;
           (meningococcal [Groups A, C, Y and W135] Oligosaccharide Diphtheria CRM197 Conjugate&#xD;
           vaccine) 3-6 years before the booster dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The vaccine seroresponse, seroprotection (serum bactericidal assay using human&#xD;
           complement [hSBA] titer greater than or equal to [&gt;=]1:8), and antibody responses&#xD;
           (geometric mean titers [GMTs]) of meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W measured using&#xD;
           hSBA in serum specimens collected 6 days (±1 day) after vaccination in a subset of 50&#xD;
           participants per group (Groups 1 and 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The vaccine seroresponse, seroprotection (hSBA titer &gt;=1:8), and antibody responses&#xD;
           (GMTs) to serogroups A, C, Y, and W measured using hSBA on Day (D)0 (pre-vaccination)&#xD;
           and D30 (+14 days) after vaccination with MenACYW Conjugate vaccine alone (Groups 1 and&#xD;
           2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The antibody persistence (GMTs and vaccine seroprotection; hSBA titer &gt;=1:8) of&#xD;
           meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W before a booster dose in participants who&#xD;
           received either MenACYW Conjugate vaccine or Menveo vaccine 3-6 years earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The antibody persistence (GMTs and vaccine seroprotection; hSBA titer &gt;=1:8) of&#xD;
           meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W in participants who received either a single&#xD;
           dose MenACYW Conjugate vaccine (participants randomized to MET59 Groups 1, 3, and 4) or&#xD;
           Menveo vaccine (participants assigned to MET59 Group 2), as part of study MET50, or&#xD;
           MET43 (participants randomized to MET59 Groups 1, 3 and 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the vaccine seroresponse, seroprotection (hSBA titer &gt;=1:8), and antibody&#xD;
           responses (GMTs) to the antigens present in MenACYW Conjugate vaccine, when MenACYW&#xD;
           Conjugate vaccine was given concomitantly with meningococcal serogroup B (MenB) vaccine&#xD;
           (Groups 3 and 4), compared to those when it was given alone (Group 1).&#xD;

      Study duration per participant was approximately 6 months including: 1 day of screening and&#xD;
      vaccination, 1 or 2 additional visits at Day 6 and Day 30, 2 phone calls and a safety&#xD;
      follow-up/end of study visit, at Day 8 and Day 180 after vaccine administration,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessment included solicited reactions within 7 days after vaccination, unsolicited&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs) up to 30 days after vaccination, serious adverse events (SAEs)&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;

          -  Chronic illness (e.g., Human immunodeficiency viruses, hepatitis B, hepatitis C) that,&#xD;
             in the opinion of the investigator, was at a stage where it might interfere with trial&#xD;
             conduct or completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to investigator judgment) on the&#xD;
             day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature &gt;= 100.4 degree Fahrenheit). A&#xD;
             prospective participant should not be included in the study until the condition had&#xD;
             resolved or the febrile event had subsided.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of oral or injectable antibiotic therapy within 72 hours prior to the first&#xD;
             blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Identified as an Investigator or employee of the Investigator or study center with&#xD;
             direct involvement in the proposed study, or identified as an immediate family member&#xD;
             (i.e, parent, spouse, natural or adopted child) of the Investigator or employee with&#xD;
             direct involvement in the proposed study.&#xD;
