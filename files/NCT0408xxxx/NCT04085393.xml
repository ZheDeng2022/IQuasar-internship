  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) adversely affects patients' quality of life&#xD;
      and may affect patients' treatment decisions. The emetogenicity of the chemotherapy&#xD;
      administered and specific patient characteristics such as female gender, age, and history of&#xD;
      low alcohol intake can increase a patients' risk for CINV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GERSC is a new, subcutaneously (SC) administered polymeric formulation of Granisetron that&#xD;
      was developed to provide slow, controlled, and sustained release of Granisetron to prevent&#xD;
      both acute and delayed CINV associated with moderately emetic chemotherapy (MEC) and highly&#xD;
      emetic chemotherapy (HEC)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients eligible for the study receiving moderately emetogenic (MEC) chemotherapy will&#xD;
      receive GERSC receptor antagonist on day one. All patients eligible for the study receiving&#xD;
      highly emetogenic Chemotherapy (HEC) chemotherapy will receive GERSC receptor antagonist on&#xD;
      day one including dexamethasone and NK-1 Receptor antagonist during cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to measure the Complete Response (no emetic episodes, no use of&#xD;
      rescue medications) in patients receiving GERSC as a replacement for the second generation 5&#xD;
      HT3 receptor antagonist palonosetron used in the first chemotherapy cycle for those patients&#xD;
      receiving MEC or HEC and developed Breakthrough CINV. Complete response would be recorded&#xD;
      specifically for the acute (0-24 hours post-chemotherapy), delayed (24-120 hours&#xD;
      post-chemotherapy), and overall periods (0-120 hours post-chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 (HEC) will receive GERSC, dexamethasone and NK-1 antagonist prior to&#xD;
           chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 (MEC) will receive GERSC and dexamethasone prior to chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be completing questionnaires on day 1 prior to treatment and at&#xD;
      approximately the same time treatment was given each day for the next seven days. Participant&#xD;
      will be assessed each day on the amount of nausea, vomiting, and/or sedation experienced in&#xD;
      the previous 24-hour period. The assessment should take less than 5 minutes to complete each&#xD;
      day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be registered for Quality of Life measurement. Validated QOL measurements&#xD;
      of fatigue and overall perception of QOL will be assessed upon registration in this study.&#xD;
      Fatigue and overall well-being clearly can impact how well patients will do in terms of being&#xD;
      able to tolerate and experience nausea and vomiting&#xD;
