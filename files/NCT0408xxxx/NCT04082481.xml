  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of TAK-988 following&#xD;
      single and multiple oral doses in healthy non-Japanese and Japanese adult participants and&#xD;
      healthy elderly (HE) participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-988. TAK-988 is being tested to evaluate&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of single and multiple oral doses in healthy non-Japanese&#xD;
      and Japanese adult participants and HE participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 156 healthy participants. The study consists of 5 parts&#xD;
      and up to 19 cohorts as mentioned below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-988, Part A: Single-rising dose (SRD) design to assess the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
           PK of TAK-988 and effect of food on the PK of the TAK-988&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-988, Part B: MRD design to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of TAK-988&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-988, Part C: MRD design to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of TAK-988 and&#xD;
           also central nervous system penetration relative to plasma concentrations of TAK-988&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-988, Part D: MRD design to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of TAK-988 for&#xD;
           HE participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-988, Part E: SRD and MRD design to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of&#xD;
           TAK-988 for Japanese origin participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in each cohort will be randomized to receive treatment with TAK-988 or matching&#xD;
      placebo which will remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study&#xD;
      (unless there is an urgent medical need).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall duration of the&#xD;
      study is approximately 10.5 months. Participants will make a final visit 7 days after&#xD;
      receiving their last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Takeda makes patient-level, de-identified data sets and associated documents available for all interventional studies after applicable marketing approvals and commercial availability have been received (or program is completely terminated), an opportunity for the primary publication of the research and final report development has been allowed, and other criteria have been met as set forth in Takeda's Data Sharing Policy (see www.TakedaClinicalTrials.com for details). To obtain access, researchers must submit a legitimate academic research proposal for adjudication by an independent review panel, who will review the scientific merit of the research and the requestor's qualifications and conflict of interest that can result in potential bias. Once approved, qualified researchers who sign a data sharing agreement are provided access to these data in a secure research environment.</ipd_description>
