      Patients with IDA and for whom fast replenishment of iron stores is necessary, e.g. if its&#xD;
      not appropriated to postpone surgery, will be identified within 28 to 42 days before surgery.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised to receive either Polyglucoferron intravenously (i.v.), Ferric&#xD;
      Carboxymaltose i.v. or oral iron substitution with Ferrous sulfate.&#xD;
