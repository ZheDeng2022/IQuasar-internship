      Aim of the study is to compare prostate artery embolization (PAE) to the established surgical&#xD;
      treatment for patient acceptance, morbidity, complications, and the functional outcomes. To&#xD;
      compare length of stay, hospital costs and time for recovery. 140 patients will be randomized&#xD;
      to PAE or surgery. Patients should suffer from lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), be&#xD;
      candidates for both treatments and willing to undergo both procedures. Before randomization&#xD;
      computed tomography angiography of the pelvic arteries is done to select eligible patients.&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging of prostate rules out possible cancer. The PAE is done in the&#xD;
      angio suite in the radiology department injecting small particles into the prostate arteries.&#xD;
      The surgery is done in the operation room in the urology department according to established&#xD;
      procedures. Clinical follow-up include clinical visit after 3 months, 1 and 5 years. Acute as&#xD;
      well as long term complications will be recorded.&#xD;

      Background: Prostatic artery embolization (PAE) has recently been described as a promising&#xD;
      alternative to surgery for treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to an&#xD;
      enlarged, benign prostate. The treatment has not been implemented into international&#xD;
      guidelines and has only been introduced to few patients in Norway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To compare PAE to the established surgical treatment for patient acceptance,&#xD;
      morbidity, complications, and the functional outcomes. To compare length of stay, hospital&#xD;
      costs and time for recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: 140 patients will be randomized to PAE or surgery. Patients should&#xD;
      suffer from LUTS, be candidates for both treatments and willing to undergo both procedures.&#xD;
      Before randomization computed tomography angiography of the pelvic arteries is done to select&#xD;
      eligible patients. Magnetic resonance imaging of prostate rules out possible cancer. The PAE&#xD;
      is done in the angio suite in the radiology department injection small particles into the&#xD;
      prostate arteries. The surgery is done in the operation room in the urology department&#xD;
      according to established procedures. All patients stay in the urology unit after the&#xD;
      procedure. Clinical follow-up include clinical visit after 3 months, 1 and 5 years. Acute as&#xD;
      well as long term complications will be recorded. The patients fill in the form of quality of&#xD;
      life from urologic disease. Urodynamic examination will record functional outcome. Length of&#xD;
      stay, procedure costs and recovery time will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of the study: Contribute to establishment of new treatment and help to select the&#xD;
      right patients for the alternative treatments. Randomized study will give important&#xD;
      information to the international community. It is possible to run this study in Norway&#xD;
      because it is still in limited use.&#xD;
