  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test how well a new medicine called concizumab works in the body of people&#xD;
      with haemophilia A or B with inhibitors. The purpose is to show that concizumab can prevent&#xD;
      bleeds in the body and is safe to use. Participants who usually only take medicine to treat&#xD;
      bleeds (on-demand) will be placed in one of two groups. In one group participants will get&#xD;
      study medicine from the start of the study. In the other group participants will continue&#xD;
      with their normal medicine and get study medicine after 6 months. The group will be decided&#xD;
      by chance. Participants who usually take medicine to prevent bleeds (prophylaxis treatment)&#xD;
      or who are already being treated with concizumab (study medicine) will receive the study&#xD;
      medicine from the start of the study. Participants will have to inject themselves with study&#xD;
      medicine every day under the skin. This can be done at home. The study doctor will hand out&#xD;
      the medicine in the form of a pen-injector. The pen-injector will contain the study medicine.&#xD;
      The study will last for about three years. Participants will have to come to the clinic for&#xD;
      up to 33 times. The time between visits will be approximately 4 weeks for the first 6 to 12&#xD;
      months depending on the group participants are in and approximately 8 weeks for the rest of&#xD;
      the study. At all visits, blood samples will be taken. Participants will be asked to record&#xD;
      information into an electronic diary during the study and may also be asked to wear an&#xD;
      activity tracker.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be randomised to concizumab prophylaxis (ppx) or no ppx or assigned into the non-randomised treatment arms, based on their treatment regimen before entering the trial. The main part of the trial is completed for a patient when the patient has completed at least 24 weeks of participation (screening period not included) for patients in arm 1 or 32 weeks of participation (screening period not included) for patients in arms 2,3 and 4. After the main part of the trial, all patients will be offered to continue in the extension part of the trial and receive treatment with concizumab for up to an additional 128 weeks (arms 2-4) or 136 weeks (arm 1). After up to 128/136 weeks in extension part the patient will enter the safety follow-up part of the trial. The patient will receive his last dose at home on the day of visit 26a (week 160). The follow-up part of the trial lasts for 7 weeks and the patient will continue to report bleeding episodes until visit 27a (week 167).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Concizumab will be administered daily subcutaneously (s.c., under the skin). When patients are randomised to concizumab prophylaxis they will receive a loading dose of 1.0 mg/kg concizumab at visit 2a (week 0: arm 2, 3 &amp; 4) or visit 9a (week 24: arm 1) followed by an initial daily dose of 0.20 mg/kg concizumab from treatment day 2. Within an initial 5-8-week dose adjustment period on 0.20 mg/kg concizumab, the patients can be increased or decreased in dose to 0.25 mg/kg or 0.15 mg/kg concizumab. A potential dose adjustment will take place at visit 4a.1 (week 6: arm 2, 3 &amp; 4) or 9a.3 (week 30: arm 1) and will be based on the concizumab exposure level measured at the previous visit 4a (week 4) or 9a.2 (week 28). Patients who have concizumab exposure levels of 200-4000 ng/mL will stay at 0.20 mg/kg concizumab. Patients in arm 1 will continue on-demand treatment with their usual bypassing product until visit 9a (week 24: end of main part for arm 1).</description>
