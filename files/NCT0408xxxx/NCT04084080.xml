      The SCD-CARRE trial is a Phase 3, prospective, randomized, multicenter, controlled, parallel&#xD;
      two-arm study aimed to determine if automated exchange blood transfusion and standard of care&#xD;
      administered to high mortality risk adult SCD patients reduces the total number of episodes&#xD;
      of clinical worsening of SCD requiring acute health care encounters (non-elective infusion&#xD;
      center/ER/hospital visits) or resulting in death over 12 months as compared with standard of&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) live to adulthood, the chronic impact of sustained&#xD;
      hemolytic anemia and episodic vaso-occlusive events take their toll, with the progressive&#xD;
      development of cardiopulmonary organ dysfunction. This culminates in the development of&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension, left ventricular diastolic heart disease, dysrhythmia, chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease and sudden death, all major cardiovascular complications of SCD for which there are&#xD;
      no approved or consensus therapies. The risk of having pulmonary hypertension and diastolic&#xD;
      heart disease can be non-invasively assessed by laboratory tests (NT-proBNP) and&#xD;
      Doppler-echocardiography (estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure). A recent&#xD;
      meta-analysis of approximately 6000 patients with SCD demonstrated that patients with&#xD;
      elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV), which is an Doppler-echocardiographic&#xD;
      measurement that estimates the pulmonary artery systolic pressure, walked an estimated 30.4&#xD;
      meters less in a 6 minute walk test than those without elevated TRV, and elevated TRV was&#xD;
      associated with high mortality (hazard ratio of 4.9). In two large registry cohorts of adult&#xD;
      patients with SCD, the investigators found that approximately 20% of the adult SCD population&#xD;
      have high values for both biomarkers, defined as a TRV ≥ 2.5 meters per second AND a&#xD;
      NT-proBNP ≥ 160 pg/mL, and that the 12-month mortality rate is 7.9% in this group as compared&#xD;
      to 0.5% in patients with normal TRV or NT-proBNP values, with a risk ratio for&#xD;
      hospitalization of 1.6. This suggests that a simple screening profile of TRV and NT-proBNP&#xD;
      can identify about 20% of patients with SCD at the highest risk of death and hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the increased mortality and early loss of functional capacity associated with&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease in SCD adults, it is important to test effective therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions in such patients. Red blood cell transfusions are administered by either simple&#xD;
      or exchange transfusion, the latter removes the patients blood and replaces it with&#xD;
      transfused red blood cells. Exchange transfusions have proven effective for acute treatment&#xD;
      of almost all SCD complications, including severe acute chest syndrome, stroke, splenic or&#xD;
      hepatic sequestration, and multi-organ failure, and are also used chronically for stroke&#xD;
      prevention and recurrent acute chest syndrome. In this study the investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that monthly exchange transfusion will limit disease progression, improve exercise capacity,&#xD;
      and prevent interval episodes of vaso-occlusive painful crisis and the acute chest syndrome&#xD;
      that acutely increases pulmonary pressures and cause right heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to perform a clinical trial to evaluate the effects of automated&#xD;
      exchange blood transfusion on patient morbidity and mortality, compared to standard of care&#xD;
      among 150 adult high risk SCD patients. The trial will leverage existing coordinating center&#xD;
      infrastructure at the University of Pittsburgh and will involve 22 experienced clinical&#xD;
      sites. Despite the safety and wide utilization of erythrocytapheresis in adult patients with&#xD;
      SCD, there is no consensus or quality efficacy data on its use to improve outcomes in our&#xD;
      aging high-risk SCD patients with progressive end-organ dysfunction.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Results from research conducted under this project will be shared in several ways. Manuscripts will be submitted for publication in high-quality peer-reviewed journals, following the NIH Public Access Policy guidelines. Findings will be presented at relevant national conferences, public lectures, scientific institutions and meetings. The timeline for participant recruitment, data collection and analysis will foster publication, facilitated by the investigators' Publications Committee, of critically important and clinically relevant data throughout the trial. The study datasets will be archived and made available to qualified individuals after a period of exclusive use by the SCD-CARRE trial research team and after publication of the primary manuscripts, following NIH guidelines.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_info_type>Clinical Study Report (CSR)</ipd_info_type>
    <ipd_time_frame>At the end of the trial, study de-identified datasets will be submitted for permanent archive in the NHLBI BioLINCC repository. The trial will also produce deliverables that will be freely available to the sickle cell community including a description of the protocol for automated red blood cell exchange transfusion.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>All publications based on the SCD-CARRE trial will adhere to the NIH Public Access Policy (Notice NOT-OD-08-033). All study data will be de-identified. At the end of the trial, study de-identified datasets will be submitted for permanent archive in the NHLBI BioLINCC repository.&#xD;
The investigators also will work closely with regional and National SCD Foundations to promote recruitment for this study and communicate our results.</ipd_access_criteria>
