  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll participants with a non-infected, corneal persistent epithelial defect&#xD;
      (PED) resulting from an ocular chemical and/or thermal ocular injury which is non-responsive&#xD;
      or refractory to current standard of care for at least 14 days. It will assess the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of NEXAGON plus standard of care versus NEXAGON-vehicle (placebo) plus standard of&#xD;
      care. The recovery of the corneal epithelium will be the primary outcome measure, defined as&#xD;
      a cornea that re-epithelializes by Day 28 of treatment and remains re-epithelialized for at&#xD;
      least a further 28 days.&#xD;
