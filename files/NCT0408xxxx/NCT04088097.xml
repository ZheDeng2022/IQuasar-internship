  <brief_summary>

      This study will develop and test a cognitive-behavioral intervention for adolescents with&#xD;
      binge/loss-of-control eating.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Youth who engage in binge eating or loss-of-control eating are at high risk for physical and&#xD;
      mental health impairment, as well as excess weight gain. As there are few evidence-based&#xD;
      treatments for adolescents with binge/loss-of-control eating, assessment and treatment have&#xD;
      received minimal attention for adolescent patients. Among adults, cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      therapy (CBT) has a strong evidence base for binge-eating disorder. Adolescents have unique&#xD;
      social, cognitive and emotional needs because of their developmental stage; unique treatment&#xD;
      approaches are essential to meet these unique needs. This study will develop a new CBT&#xD;
      treatment for adolescents with binge eating or loss-of-control eating (modifying adult CBT&#xD;
      for binge-eating disorder, conducting interviews with adolescents about aspects of treatment&#xD;
      that need to be modified, conducting an open series of patients who receive the active&#xD;
      treatment). This study will also test the efficacy of the newly-developed CBT for adolescents&#xD;
      with binge/loss-of-control eating versus a control group in a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
