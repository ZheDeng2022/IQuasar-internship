  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a targeted therapy as a possible treatment for acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia (AML) that has returned or not responded to standard treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for&#xD;
      further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved LY3214996 as a treatment for any&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LY3214996 is an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor that is being developed&#xD;
      as a treatment for patients with advanced cancer. ERK inhibitors stop the signal that a&#xD;
      cancer cell receives telling it to grow. In this research study, the investigators are&#xD;
      testing to see if LY3214996 is a safe treatment for AML that has returned or not responded to&#xD;
      standard treatment. Several doses of the study drug will be explored in this study.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically confirmed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) diagnosed&#xD;
             per WHO criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have relapsed or refractory AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants must have adequate organ function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Direct Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST (SGOT) and ALT(SGPT) ≤ 2.5 × institutional ULN, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 5 × institutional ULN if elevation is a result of&#xD;
                  leukemia&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine Clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (calculated via the Cockcroft-Gault&#xD;
                  equation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of LY3214996 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             and because anti-cancer agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method&#xD;
             of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or&#xD;
             her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately. Men and women treated or enrolled on this protocol must agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation,&#xD;
             and 4 months after completion of LY3214996 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to swallow and retain oral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have resolution of adverse events related to prior anti-cancer&#xD;
             therapies to ≤ CTCAE Grade 2 or baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Considerations of concurrent use of CYP3A4 inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
        Dose escalation phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ARM A: Participants must not be receiving any concurrent antifungal agents that are&#xD;
             moderate/strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. These include but are not limited to:&#xD;
             isavuconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, and&#xD;
             voriconazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ARM B: Participants must be receiving concurrent antifungal agents that are&#xD;
             moderate/strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. These include but are not limited to:&#xD;
             isavuconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, and&#xD;
             voriconazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Expansion Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants not receiving concurrent antifungal agents that are moderate/strong CYP3A4&#xD;
        inhibitors are eligible to enroll at MTD determined upon completion of dose-escalation&#xD;
        cohort Arm A. Participants receiving concurrent antifungal agents that are moderate/strong&#xD;
        CYP3A4 inhibitors are eligible to enroll at MTD determined upon completion of&#xD;
        dose-escalation cohort Arm B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy, other investigational therapy, immunotherapy,&#xD;
             or radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study medication. ATRA&#xD;
             treatment is permitted with no required washout if treatment duration was for less&#xD;
             than 1 week. Hydroxyurea is allowed with no required washout. For participants with an&#xD;
             absolute peripheral blast count &gt; 20 K/µL, hydroxyurea may be administered up to day&#xD;
             14 of protocol therapy with a maximum allowed dose of 6 g per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have received oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) within 5&#xD;
             half-lives of the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had major surgery within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had a prior stem cell transplant (SCT) within 90 days prior to&#xD;
             the first dose of study medication. Additionally, participants having undergone prior&#xD;
             SCT must be off calcineurin inhibitor therapy for at least 28 days prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with active &gt; Grade 1 acute or chronic Graft v. Host Disease (GvHD) who&#xD;
             are receiving immunosuppressive therapy other than prednisone. Use of prednisone is&#xD;
             permitted only if participants have been maintained at a steady dose of &lt; 20 mg/day&#xD;
             for at least 5 days prior to the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known active CNS leukemia involvement. Participants with no known&#xD;
             history of CNS leukemia are not required to undergo lumbar puncture (LP) for trial&#xD;
             eligibility unless the participant is symptomatic as judged by the treating&#xD;
             investigator. Participants with a history of CNS leukemia involvement are eligible&#xD;
             provided that the CNS disease has been adequately treated and cleared prior to study&#xD;
             enrollment as judged by the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to LY3214996.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to: ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because LY3214996 is an agent with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with LY3214996, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with LY3214996. A negative serum pregnancy test is required for women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are known to be seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
             or hepatitis B or C. Testing is not required for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history or findings of central or branch retinal artery or venous&#xD;
             occlusion with significant vision less, or other retinal diseases causing visual&#xD;
             impairment as determined by an ophthalmologist.&#xD;
