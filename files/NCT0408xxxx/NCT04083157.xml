  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has witnessed a rising incidence globally and in Hong Kong,&#xD;
      an area where chronic hepatitis B (CHB) remains endemic. IBD patients are usually&#xD;
      immunocompromised due to the disease itself and secondary to the use of medications including&#xD;
      immunosuppressants and biologics, predisposing them to various opportunistic infection&#xD;
      including hepatitis. Vaccination against hepatitis B virus (HBV) is recommended to prevent&#xD;
      CHB and its related complications including flare up of acute hepatitis, cirrhosis and&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma. However, it is reported that efficacy with conventional&#xD;
      intramuscular hepatitis B vaccination in IBD patients is suboptimal, especially among those&#xD;
      receiving biologic therapies. Various strategies in boosting vaccine immunogenicity including&#xD;
      the utilization of higher vaccination dose, shorter dosing interval, or alternate route of&#xD;
      vaccine administration have been studied.6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intradermal route of vaccination has been recently shown to be an effective way in augmenting&#xD;
      immune response in specific patient groups who are known poor responders, including elderly&#xD;
      and immunocompromised patients. In addition, topical imiquimod, a synthetic agonist of&#xD;
      toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), has been shown to further boost up the immunogenicity response&#xD;
      when applied to the site before intradermal vaccination. The proposed study is the first&#xD;
      clinical trial comparing the efficacy of intradermal hepatitis B vaccination with adjuvant&#xD;
      topical application of imiquimod cream with the conventional intramuscular hepatitis B&#xD;
      vaccination in IBD patients.&#xD;

      Aim of study To compare the efficacy of intradermal hepatitis B vaccination with adjuvant&#xD;
      topical imiquimod with conventional intramuscular hepatitis B vaccination in IBD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Patient recruitment IBD patients newly referred to or currently followed up at&#xD;
      Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital will be screened for CHB status&#xD;
      (HBsAg/Anti-HBs/Anti-HBc). Patients without CHB infection and evidence of prior HBV&#xD;
      vaccination i.e. HBsAg -ve /Anti-HBc-ve/ Anti-HBs -ve will be recruited into the study.&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either intradermal vaccination with Engerix B&#xD;
      with topical imiquimod or intramuscular vaccination with Engerix-B with topical aqueous cream&#xD;
      as the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Eligible patients will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive intradermal&#xD;
      hepatitis B vaccination (Engerix B) with topical imiquimod cream (as the study arm) or&#xD;
      intramuscular hepatitis B vaccination (Engerix-B) with topical aqueous cream (as the control&#xD;
      arm). Computer generated random number is used for randomization. Randomization sequences&#xD;
      will be kept in opaque envelope and kept by a research staff not directly involved in this&#xD;
      study. Once the patient has consented to the study, that research staff will open the&#xD;
      envelope and notified the study nurse only of the vaccine allocation. In case of medical&#xD;
      emergency or severe adverse reaction to the study medication, unblinding can be performed&#xD;
      after notification of the principal investigator who will break the randomization code by&#xD;
      revealing the randomization sequence assigned to the concerned study subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccine administration Vaccination schedule is identical between the two arms with 3 doses&#xD;
      given at 0, 1, 6 month. Participants in the study arm will receive 20 mcg intradermal&#xD;
      Engerix-B at two separate sites (10 mcg/0.5 ml) with topical imiquimod ointment pre-treatment&#xD;
      5 minutes before injection. Participants in the control arm will receive 20 mcg intramuscular&#xD;
      Engerix-B at two separate sites (10 mcg/ 0.5 ml) with topical placebo aqueous cream&#xD;
      pretreatment 5 minutes before injection. The topical treatment will be given in a 4x4cm2&#xD;
      marked at the deltoid on each arm. Vaccination will be administered at clinic by dedicated&#xD;
      study nurse, who is not involved in subsequent management of the participants. Both the&#xD;
      investigators and the participants will be blinded to the result of randomization as only the&#xD;
      study nurse know the route of administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Follow up visits will be arranged at 1,6,12 month after first dose of vaccine.&#xD;
      Blood will be taken during each follow up visits for anti-HBs titres.&#xD;
