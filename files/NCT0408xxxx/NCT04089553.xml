      This is an open-label Phase II modular study in patients with prostate cancer which will&#xD;
      assess safety, efficacy, and tolerability of AZD4635 in combination with other therapeutic&#xD;
      agents in different treatment arms (referred to as modules).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combinations to be studied include: 1) Module 1: AZD4635 plus durvalumab; 2) Module 2:&#xD;
      AZD4635 plus oleclumab; 3) Module 3: AZD4635 plus durvalumab plus oleclumab.&#xD;

      This is an open-label Phase II modular study in patients with prostate cancer which will&#xD;
      assess safety, efficacy, and tolerability of AZD4635 in combination with other therapeutic&#xD;
      agents in different treatment arm (referred to as modules).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combinations to be studied include: 1) Module 1: AZD4635 plus durvalumab; 2) Module 2:&#xD;
      AZD4635 plus oleclumab; 3) Module 3 (if conducted): AZD4635 plus durvalumab plus oleclumab.&#xD;
      The protocol may be amended to include other combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be allocated into a module using an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS).&#xD;
      Randomization will occur when patients meet eligibility criteria for two or more modules that&#xD;
      are currently recruiting. If patients only meet the criteria for one currently recruiting&#xD;
      module, they will be allocated to that module without randomization taking place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the clinical study is to evaluate the efficacy of each combination&#xD;
      therapy by: 1) assessing the objective response rate (ORR) of patients with measurable&#xD;
      disease [response will be determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST&#xD;
      1.1)]; 2) assessing the PSA confirmed response rate of each combination therapy (PSA&#xD;
      confirmed response rate is defined as the proportion of participants with a reduction in the&#xD;
      PSA level of ≥50% measured from baseline to the lowest post-baseline PSA result measured&#xD;
      twice, at least 3 weeks apart by the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 criteria PCWG3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety endpoints include assessment of adverse events and serious adverse events,&#xD;
      physical examinations, vital signs, and collection of clinical chemistry/hematology&#xD;
      parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be approximately 30 PSA evaluable patients in each module, and at least 20&#xD;
      patients will have RECIST measurable disease at baseline in each module. If any of the&#xD;
      required patients for PSA and/or ORR are not evaluable for PSA response or tumor response,&#xD;
      respectively, they may be replaced at the sponsor's discretion.&#xD;

             analysis. Accessible lesions are defined as those which are biopsiable (at screening)&#xD;
             and amenable to repeat biopsy (after 2 weeks of AZD4635 therapy), unless clinically&#xD;
             contraindicated. The provision of paired biopsies will be closely monitored to ensure&#xD;
             the desired number of biopsiable patients are enrolled and investigators are aware of&#xD;
             this requirement at all times.&#xD;
&#xD;

             with non-measurable disease must have measurable PSA ≥1.0 ng/mL if the confirmed rise&#xD;
