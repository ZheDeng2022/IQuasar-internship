  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are evaluating the immediate effect of a dental mouthpiece on gait and&#xD;
      balance among people with Parkinson disease as well as longer-term feasibility use and the&#xD;
      effect of the mouthpiece on sleep and quality of life.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a pilot study with participants who have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      Parkinson disease recruited from the community. Participants will attend one in-person visit&#xD;
      and be custom fitted with a dental mouthpiece. Participants will be asked to wear the&#xD;
      mouthpiece as much as possible for one month including while sleeping and during the day,&#xD;
      except while eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to return for a second in-person visit to repeat gait and balance&#xD;
      (motor) measures.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BESTest)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline in-person visit</time_frame>
    <description>Balance will be measured with the Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BESTest) with and without the mouthpiece. The assessment includes 14 items each of which is rated on a three-point scale (2: Normal, 1: Moderate, 0: Severe). The 14 item scores are summed for a total score. The range of scores is 0 to 28, and higher scores indicate better balance function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Parkinson Disease Sleep Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and One month</time_frame>
    <description>Indicators of sleep quality will be measured before and after wearing mouthpiece for one-month. The visual analog scale has 15 commonly reported symptoms associated with sleep disturbance (e.g., overall quality of nights sleep, restlessness, daytime dozing). Participants mark a cross along a 10 cm line labelled worst to best state. Items are scored by measuring the distance along each line to the intersection with the cross in centimeters. Each item score can range from 0 - symptom severe and always experienced to 10 - symptom-free. The items are summed and the maximum cumulative score is 150 (free of all symptoms).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Parkinson Disease Questionnaire-39</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and One month</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured before and after wearing mouthpiece for one-month. This scale has 39 questions with 5 possible answers (0 = never, 1 = Occasionally, 2 = Sometimes, 3 = Often, 4 = Always). There are eight dimensions: Mobility questions (q)1-10; Activities of Daily Living q11-16; Emotional well-being q17-22; Stigma q23-26; Social Support q27-29; Cognitive impairment q30-33; Communication q34-36; and Bodily Discomfort q37-39. Dimensions are calculated on a scale of 0 to 100, 0 is no problem at all and 100 is maximum level of a problem. The formula for scoring each dimension: (sum of scores of each question in dimension/4 (max.score per question) x nos. questions in dimension)x100. The formula for a total score (called single index) is sum of dimension scores/8.</description>

          <title>Movement Disorders Society - United Parkinson Disease Rating Scale III</title>
          <description>Thirty-three items on the Movement Disorders Society - United Parkinson Disease Rating Scale Part III Motor Examination are rated using five response options of 0: Normal, 1: Slight, 2: Mild, 3: Moderate, 4: Severe. The items are summed for a total score indicating overall severity of motor signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The minimum score is 0 reflecting normal motor functioning and the maximum score of 132 reflecting severe motor impairment. In other words, higher scores represent worse outcomes.</description>

        <description>Indicators of sleep quality will be measured before and after wearing mouthpiece for one-month. The visual analog scale has 15 commonly reported symptoms associated with sleep disturbance (e.g., overall quality of nights sleep, restlessness, daytime dozing). Participants mark a cross along a 10 cm line labelled worst to best state. Items are scored by measuring the distance along each line to the intersection with the cross in centimeters. Each item score can range from 0 - symptom severe and always experienced to 10 - symptom-free. The items are summed and the maximum cumulative score is 150 (free of all symptoms).</description>

        <title>Changes in Parkinson Disease Questionnaire-39</title>
        <description>Quality of life will be measured before and after wearing mouthpiece for one-month. This scale has 39 questions with 5 possible answers (0 = never, 1 = Occasionally, 2 = Sometimes, 3 = Often, 4 = Always). There are eight dimensions: Mobility questions (q)1-10; Activities of Daily Living q11-16; Emotional well-being q17-22; Stigma q23-26; Social Support q27-29; Cognitive impairment q30-33; Communication q34-36; and Bodily Discomfort q37-39. Dimensions are calculated on a scale of 0 to 100, 0 is no problem at all and 100 is maximum level of a problem. The formula for scoring each dimension: (sum of scores of each question in dimension/4 (max.score per question) x nos. questions in dimension)x100. The formula for a total score (called single index) is sum of dimension scores/8.</description>
