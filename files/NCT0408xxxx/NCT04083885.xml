  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seniors are at risk for reduced independence and lowered quality of life after injury or&#xD;
      illness. Gains in strength, stamina, balance, cardiovascular fitness and confidence resulting&#xD;
      from regular exercise can help seniors to maintain (or improve) their functional ability,&#xD;
      independence, and quality of life. However, seniors experience many barriers to exercise. The&#xD;
      objective is to assess the use of virtual reality (VR) as a motivating way to encourage&#xD;
      seniors to do regular rehabilitative exercise. Seniors who are eligible for Extra-Mural&#xD;
      rehabilitation for mobility issues and who live in two situations, a) long-term care and b)&#xD;
      independently in their homes, will be recruited. Participants will be randomized to usual&#xD;
      Extra-Mural rehabilitation (control) or usual Extra-Mural rehabilitation plus VR exercise.&#xD;
      Long-term care residents will do VR with the assistance of care staff under the direction of&#xD;
      the research team. Independent-living participants will do VR in their homes, under the&#xD;
      direction of the research team. All participants will be asked to do VR 3 times a week for 8&#xD;
      weeks. Mobility (balance, gait, physical function), health outcomes (falls, hospital&#xD;
      admissions) and health system outcomes (caseload, number of homecare visits) will be assessed&#xD;
      and compared over time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decreased physical conditioning can occur after injury or illness, particularly in seniors.&#xD;
      Frail and physically vulnerable seniors have greater risk for loss of independence and&#xD;
      lowered quality of life. They are more likely to need long-term residential care. Seniors&#xD;
      also have an increased risk of falls, which are the leading cause of injuries and&#xD;
      injury-related hospital admissions among older Canadians, accounting for 85% of seniors'&#xD;
      injury-related hospitalizations. Further, falls are associated with over 1/3 of admissions to&#xD;
      long-term care facilities after release from the hospital. In 2004, the direct cost of falls&#xD;
      to seniors in Canada was estimated to be $2 billion; this number will be much higher today,&#xD;
      as health-care costs have increased and the number of seniors has increased as well. Among&#xD;
      the many risk factors for falls include physical considerations such as balance and gait&#xD;
      deficits, muscle weakness &amp; reduced physical fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seniors would like to live in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. They&#xD;
      also would like to maintain (or improve) their independence, ability to function and quality&#xD;
      of life. Gains in strength, stamina, balance, cardiovascular fitness and confidence resulting&#xD;
      from regular exercise can help seniors to achieve these goals, reduce the risk of falls and&#xD;
      increase social engagement. However, seniors experience many barriers to doing exercise,&#xD;
      including a lack of motivation, pain or injury, lack of knowledge, fear of falling,&#xD;
      transportation difficulties, no one to exercise with, poor weather and high cost. In fact,&#xD;
      only 11% of Canadians between the ages of 60 and 79 meet Canada's physical activity&#xD;
      guidelines. For those who live in rural locations, further barriers exist, like isolation,&#xD;
      safety (cannot go for a walk on busy highways or dark roads) and lack of access to&#xD;
      community-based services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual reality (VR) is proposed as a motivating and enjoyable way to encourage seniors to do&#xD;
      regular rehabilitative exercise, either as part of a home-based rehabilitation plan after&#xD;
      injury or illness, or as a part of a plan to enhance mobility and decrease falls in a&#xD;
      residential long-term care home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the impact of adding home-based VR exercise to the rehabilitation programs of&#xD;
           clients receiving home-care rehabilitation services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the impact of adding facility-based VR exercise to the rehabilitation programs&#xD;
           of residents receiving rehabilitation services or maintenance for physical conditioning&#xD;
           in long-term care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the impact of 8 weeks of home-based VR as an addition to home-care&#xD;
           rehabilitation on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. balance, physical function, community integration and quality of life;&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. number of falls, number of emergency room visits, hospital admissions and long-term&#xD;
                care admissions;&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. quantity of VR exercise, number of health care professional visits for&#xD;
                rehabilitation, health care professional caseload numbers and length of wait lists&#xD;
                for home-care rehabilitation services.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. the cost of providing home-care rehabilitation services;&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. acceptance of VR for exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the impact of 8 weeks of facility-based VR as an addition to the&#xD;
           rehabilitation and maintenance programs of residents in long-term care on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. balance, physical function and quality of life;&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. number of falls, number of emergency room visits, hospital admissions;&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. quantity of VR exercise, number of health care professional visits for&#xD;
                rehabilitation, health care professional caseload numbers and length of wait lists&#xD;
                for facility-based rehabilitation services;&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. the cost of providing residential rehabilitation services;&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. acceptance of VR for exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two separate, but related studies are included; A) Randomized controlled trial studying the&#xD;
      addition of home-based VR to homecare rehabilitation, compared to homecare rehabilitation&#xD;
      (usual care) only for participants living independently in their homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Multi-site randomized controlled trial studying the addition of facility-based VR to&#xD;
      homecare rehabilitation, compared to homecare rehabilitation (usual care) only for&#xD;
      participants living in long-term care facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Home-based study participants will undergo a 1-1 1/2 hour physical assessment of balance,&#xD;
      gait, physical function, activities of daily living and quality of life, given by the&#xD;
      Research Assistant (RA), either in their home or at the Centre for Innovation and Research on&#xD;
      Aging (CIRA). The Research Therapist (RT) will assess the participant's 10 foot walk test&#xD;
      (used to assess gait speed; Appendix U), then randomize the participant into either the&#xD;
      control or experimental groups using an online randomization tool, stratified according to&#xD;
      gait speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the control group will be told to continue on as normal with their&#xD;
      Extra-Mural homecare rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the experimental group will be introduced to the Jintronix VR platform and&#xD;
      will discuss with the RT their abilities and therapy goals. The RT will consult with the&#xD;
      participant's Extra-Mural health care professionals and create a customized VR program of&#xD;
      approximately 20-30 minutes. The RT will then install the VR system in the participant's home&#xD;
      and train the participant and study partner on the use of VR. Safety considerations will be&#xD;
      reviewed (the study partner is not to assist or guard the participant, just be in the home&#xD;
      during VR). A photograph is taken of the set-up, to document that the location is safe, in&#xD;
      case the participant re-arranges furniture etc. into an unsafe position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to perform the VR session 3-5 times a week for 8 weeks. The&#xD;
      RT will contact the participant (preferably by phone) twice in the first week and at least&#xD;
      once a week thereafter, and participants will be invited to contact the RT as needed. The RT&#xD;
      will also monitor VR usage remotely. The RT can modify the games remotely as required.&#xD;
      Further home visits can be made as required, preferably once during week 2, to assess&#xD;
      exercise technique and answer questions. Personal Support Workers (PSW) attending the&#xD;
      clients' homes will also monitor the home situation for safety and unexpected changes in&#xD;
      physical condition using a short check-list. The PSW will report any changes to the RT&#xD;
      immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 8 weeks, the participant will return to CIRA to be reassessed by the RA and then the VR&#xD;
      system will be removed from the home. The first 10 participants (and their study partners)&#xD;
      will also provide a 10-minute interview on their experience with VR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One month later, the participant will return to CIRA for a final reassessment with the RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All assessments can be performed in the participant's home rather than having them come to&#xD;
      CIRA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Facility-based study participants will undergo a 1 - 1 ½ hour physical assessment of&#xD;
      balance, gait, physical function, activities of daily living and quality of life, given by&#xD;
      the Research Assistant (RA). This assessment will be done at the participant's long-term care&#xD;
      facility. The Research Therapist (RT) will assess the participant's 10 foot walk test (used&#xD;
      to assess gait speed; Appendix U), then randomize the participant into either the control or&#xD;
      experimental groups using an online randomization tool, stratified according to gait speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the control group will be told to continue on as normal with their&#xD;
      Extra-Mural homecare rehabilitation program and any other activities that they normally do.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the experimental group will be introduced to the Jintronix VR platform and&#xD;
      will discuss with the RT their abilities and therapy goals. The RT will consult with the&#xD;
      participant's Extra-Mural health care professionals and with the facility staff (particularly&#xD;
      recreation therapists and rehabilitation assistants), and create a customized VR program of&#xD;
      approximately 20-30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehabilitation assistants and recreation therapists/coordinators working at the long-term&#xD;
      care sites will be trained on the use of Jintronix VR during a 2-hour workshop. The&#xD;
      rehabilitation assistants or recreation therapists/coordinators will be instructed on each&#xD;
      participant's individual program and any safety or technique requirements and will assist and&#xD;
      supervise long-term care participants to perform their VR programs. Participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to perform the VR session 3-5 times a week for 8 weeks. The RT will contact the&#xD;
      participant and the rehabilitation assistant or recreation therapist (preferably in person)&#xD;
      twice in the first week and at least once a week thereafter, and participants and&#xD;
      rehabilitation assistant/recreation therapist will be invited to contact the RT as needed.&#xD;
      The RT will also monitor VR usage remotely. The RT can modify the games remotely as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 8 weeks, all participants will be reassessed at their long-term care facilities by the&#xD;
      RA. The first 10 residents will also provide a 10-minute interview on their experience with&#xD;
      VR. One month later, the participant will have a final reassessment with the RA.&#xD;
