      Previously characterised PAH patients, including idiopathic, heritable and other forms of&#xD;
      group 1 PAH with and without BMPR2 mutation which have already been analysed and are&#xD;
      regularly seen in the Center for Pulmonary Hypertension may be contacted to participate in&#xD;
      the study. Clinical and laboratory values will be collected prospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with IPAH/HPAH and other forms of PAH who are newly diagnosed within the duration of&#xD;
      the trial will receive routine diagnostic workup including the routine information about a&#xD;
      possible BMPR2 mutation analysis for IPAH/HPAH patients according to guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During their routine visit the patients' medical history will be obtained and physical&#xD;
      examination will be conducted. Moreover, an electrocardiogram (ECG), determination of World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO)-functional class, laboratory testing (NT-proBNP and routine&#xD;
      laboratory), echocardiography will be routinely carried out. BMPR2 expression levels will be&#xD;
      measured in blood samples. Additionally, laboratory samples will be collected for analysis of&#xD;
      further parameters reflecting iron metabolism such as hepcidin, ferritin, iron levels, IL6&#xD;
      and circulating soluble transferrin receptor Levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, healthy controls will be invited to participate in this study to obtain&#xD;
      comparable levels of hepcidin and BMPR2 pathway members.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease characterized by an increase in&#xD;
      pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, which result in right heart&#xD;
      hypertrophy and decompensation. It crucially affects exercise capacity, quality of life and&#xD;
      prognosis. Idiopathic and heritable forms of PAH (IPAH and HPAH) are often associated with&#xD;
      mutations of the bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2) accompanied by disease&#xD;
      development at an earlier age, more severe hemodynamic phenotype and a higher mortality rate.&#xD;
      Other forms of PAH also show reduced expression levels of BMPR2, even if no BMPR2 mutation&#xD;
      has been identified in these patients. Moreover, the balance of iron metabolism was shown to&#xD;
      be disturbed in IPAH patients. IPAH patients suffered from iron deficiency with low levels of&#xD;
      serum iron concentrations and while at the same time displaying high levels of the iron&#xD;
      uptake regulating hormon hepcidin. The hormone hepcidin, which inhibits iron absorption from&#xD;
      the intestine, is upregulated by the BMPR2 signaling pathway (via BMP6). The impact of BMPR2&#xD;
      expression on iron homeostasis, however, has not been investigated yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mutation and non-mutation carriers with invasively diagnosed PAH by right heart catheter and&#xD;
      under optimized medical therapy will be enrolled in this study. An explicit exclusion&#xD;
      criterion is intravenous iron supplementation in the last 2 months to capture their natural&#xD;
      iron metabolic status. Subjects will be recruited at the Center for Pulmonary Hypertension at&#xD;
      Thoraxklinik Heidelberg University Hospital. The measurement of BMPR2 expression will be&#xD;
      performed with real-time polymerase chain reaction. In addition, routine laboratory&#xD;
      parameters of iron metabolism and clinical parameters will be statistically correlated with&#xD;
      the BMPR2 expression of BMPR2 mutation carriers and non-mutation carriers. Clinical&#xD;
      examinations will comprise of routine diagnostic workup. No study specific clinical&#xD;
      assessments will be performed. For diagnostic workup, an extended blood analysis for BMPR2&#xD;
      expression will be performed, which is mentioned in the informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, healthy controls will be invited to participate in this study.Healthy controls&#xD;
      will only receive a blood collection to obtain control values for hepcidin, BMPR2 expression&#xD;
      rate and levels of BMPR2 pathway members such as Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2 and 6 (BMP2 and&#xD;
      BMP6). They will not receive any further examinations. BMPR2 mutation status will not be&#xD;
      investigated. The control group will be age and gender matched to non-BMPR2 mutation&#xD;
      carriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether PAH patients with a reduced expression rate&#xD;
      of BMPR2 have altered serum levels of hepcidin and further iron related metabolites compared&#xD;
      to PAH patients with normal expression levels and whether these patients present with more&#xD;
      pronounced limitations in clinical parameters. This study could help to understand iron&#xD;
      metabolism in PAH and generate new therapeutic targets for the treatment of the disease.&#xD;
