  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the MatHealth project is to improve maternal health using an enhanced&#xD;
      mobile phone-based multimedia application among illiterate women in rural southwestern&#xD;
      Uganda. Building on a prototype of a mobile maternal health support technology developed as&#xD;
      part of the on-going PhD research by one of our team members, The investigators will redesign&#xD;
      the prototype to make it suitable for illiterate populations by engaging the local&#xD;
      communities/prospective users to incorporate multimedia components such as videos and audios.&#xD;
      Using the enhanced prototype, the investigators will carry out a reasonably large scale field&#xD;
      study in Uganda, where the investigators will empirically implement the prototype among the&#xD;
      rural community and assess its preliminary impact on maternal health. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that implementing the enhanced prototype will result in increased access to high&#xD;
      quality, relevant local and culturally acceptable maternal health information that can enable&#xD;
      mothers and families demonstrate improved health-seeking and preventative behaviors,&#xD;
      including early uptake and adherence to antenatal check-ups and care including HIV testing,&#xD;
      good nutrition, birth preparedness, dealing with danger signs, among others; all of which&#xD;
      should ultimately contribute to improved maternal and child survival. The investigators will&#xD;
      contribute to and benefit from a culture of continuous learning by engaging with the&#xD;
      local/user communities, policy makers, and researchers to share lessons learned and best&#xD;
      practices.This will potentially facilitate the translation of our research findings into&#xD;
      medical care.&#xD;

      Conceptual model development: Between June 2018 and November 2018, 14 pregnant women and 6&#xD;
      healthcare professionals in the antenatal clinic in Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH)&#xD;
      will be recruited. Focus group discussions will be used to assess the optimal intervention in&#xD;
      terms of the preferred content of multimedia messages, length, number, and strategies to make&#xD;
      messages appropriate to illiterate population and protect confidentiality and patient&#xD;
      privacy. The Investigators will also assess the predicted barriers to appropriate response to&#xD;
      the multimedia messages, preferences and perceptions of using multimedia messages,&#xD;
      understanding of messages, barriers to adoption of the multimedia prototype. Additionally,&#xD;
      the investigators will explore the prevailing maternal health challenges experienced and how&#xD;
      multimedia applications can best address the identified challenges. The output from the focus&#xD;
      group discussion will be a conceptual model for content development, which will guide the&#xD;
      development of the prototype. Dr. Musiimenta, in collaboration with the Research Assistant&#xD;
      Mr.Wilson Tumuhimbise will take a lead in facilitating the focus group discussions in&#xD;
      collaboration with all the team members. The purpose will be to inform the development the&#xD;
      multimedia application, therefore this phase will be done concurrently with prototype design&#xD;
      and development phase. Specifically, there will be prototype enhancement after the focus&#xD;
      group discussion. A manuscript will be written documenting a conceptual framework for using a&#xD;
      mobile phone-based multimedia technology to support maternal health in Uganda. This&#xD;
      manuscript will be published in a peer reviewed health-informatics related journals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prototype design and development: After getting research ethics approval presumably in May&#xD;
      2018, the investigators will start on designing and developing the mobile phone-based&#xD;
      prototype in June 2018, which will be completed by November 2018. In collaboration with other&#xD;
      team members, Ms Jane Katusiime and two Masters students will carry out the&#xD;
      development/enhancement of the prototype, supervised by Prof. Pinkwart and Dr. Musiimenta.&#xD;
      The prototype will be developed using Java which is the default development language for&#xD;
      android, while the database will be built using SQlite database-an open source stand-alone&#xD;
      SQL database which will securely host the multimedia messages. Prototype refinements will&#xD;
      include making it suitable as a standalone application (i.e., also functional in case of no&#xD;
      network access) and making it more appropriate to illiterate women by incorporating&#xD;
      multimedia video and audio messages. Due to the high costs of internet services and the&#xD;
      limited financial capacity of the participants, the prototype will be made a stand-alone&#xD;
      application that can also run without internet connection (while of course maintaining the&#xD;
      communication functions that work only in case of network connection). The development of the&#xD;
      prototype will follow an iterative and an interactive approach involving 20 women and&#xD;
      healthcare providers in focus group discussions as described in the conceptual development&#xD;
      work package above.This approach will facilitate the gathering of design/user requirements&#xD;
      and testing for usability and functionality. The prototype will be re-designed until the&#xD;
      investigators are sure that users are comfortable with it. Generally, the prototype design&#xD;
      and development will follow a user centered approach which emphasizes involvement of users in&#xD;
      all phases of the design process in order to come up with a system that is useful, usable and&#xD;
      acceptable to the users. The research team will hold weekly meetings to review the developed&#xD;
      prototype and suggest potential refinements if need be.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formulation of multimedia messages: Between June 2018 and October 2018, multimedia messages&#xD;
      will be developed by Quadral Products Uganda Limited (see letter of support), a multimedia&#xD;
      development company with extensive experience in multimedia development in rural southwestern&#xD;
      Uganda. The messages will be developed in collaboration with the prospective messages&#xD;
      recipients, healthcare practitioners in the field of maternal health, and a nutritionist.&#xD;
      Messages will cover relevant maternal health topics such as identifying danger signs,&#xD;
      nutrition, birth preparedness, and attending antenatal care which will be based on the&#xD;
      Ugandan Ministry of Health approved maternal health-related messages. The prototype will also&#xD;
      have a functionality for setting antenatal visit reminders. Our MatHealth project team&#xD;
      member-Dr. Mugyenyi Godfrey who is an experienced gynecologist and obstetrician (working with&#xD;
      Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) will coordinate message development in consultation&#xD;
      with Richard Ninsiima a qualified a nutritionist working with MRRH where the MaHealth project&#xD;
      will recruit its participants. The development of the multimedia messages will also be guided&#xD;
      by the conceptual model developed from the 20 participants as described in the conceptual&#xD;
      development phase above. Messages will be developed in the local language (runyankole) of the&#xD;
      prospective users, who will be heavily involved in message development e.g. as video actors&#xD;
      in order to facilitate ownership, adoption, and usability. Each message will not exceed one&#xD;
      minute in length and in total approximately 15 audio and 15 video messages will be developed.&#xD;
      The multimedia video messages will be of quality mp4 ranging between 3 and 8mb per second.&#xD;
      The messages will be compressed to reduce their size for easy transmission and storage on the&#xD;
      memory cards of relatively low cost smart phones with limited processing power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementing the prototype in practice: The study will be conducted at the antenatal clinic&#xD;
      in Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) in Mbarara, Uganda, which is located&#xD;
      approximately 268 kilometers southwest of the capital, Kampala. MRRH is the largest hospital&#xD;
      in rural southwestern Uganda, which handles about 800 deliveries per month. The investigators&#xD;
      will test the prototype with 80 pregnant mothers randomly assigned to two conditions: 1) the&#xD;
      intervention condition, and 2) the control condition. 80 pregnant illiterate women receiving&#xD;
      antenatal services at MRRH will be recruited in the study between December 2018 and February&#xD;
      2019. It should be noted that these women will be different from the 14 women involved in the&#xD;
      conceptual model development phase above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 9 months, each of the 40 women in the intervention condition will use their phones to&#xD;
      access the multimedia-based antenatal videos and audios tailored to their pregnancy stages.&#xD;
      The 40 women in the control condition will receive the usual standard care of antenatal&#xD;
      check-up and counselling but no multimedia intervention. Participants in the intervention&#xD;
      condition will use the prototype until six weeks after giving birth. The intervention&#xD;
      implementation is estimated to take 9 months including a 6 weeks follow-up after delivery,&#xD;
      which implies that the implementation will be completed by November/ December 2019. The six&#xD;
      weeks follow-up is important since maternal morbidity and mortality relate to illness or&#xD;
      death occurring during pregnancy or childbirth, or within 1 to 2 months of the birth or&#xD;
      termination of a pregnancy. Recruitment will be ongoing until all 80 participants are&#xD;
      enrolled. All study subjects will be reimbursed up to of 2 Euros which is the standard&#xD;
      remuneration rate for research participants in Uganda. This will be done to compensate for&#xD;
      their time during data collection, and is often given in form of sugar or soap or rice.&#xD;
      Participants will also be given up to 5€ to refund their transport if they come to the&#xD;
      research offices for study-related activities. The investigators will install the final&#xD;
      prototype on a phone and give each participant in the intervention group a phone with a&#xD;
      prototype installed, and explain how it works. Women will get support in resolving technical&#xD;
      issues that may arise with the application between March and May 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection for prototype evaluation: Between January 2019 and December 2019, the&#xD;
      investigators will collect data for prototype evaluation which will follow a three-phased&#xD;
      approach: baseline-assessment, midline assessment and endline assessment. During&#xD;
      pre-assessment phase, the investigators will collect the following data at enrollment, which&#xD;
      will be used to both track participants and to understand factors that may influence their&#xD;
      maternal health: Age, education level, pregnancy stage, date of birth, phone numbers, home&#xD;
      address, next of kin, cellphone ownership and use practices, stigma, socioeconomic status,&#xD;
      and alcohol use&#xD;
&#xD;
      At endline assessment which is anticipated to take place six weeks after a participant has&#xD;
      given birth, the investigators will again administer the questionnaire for capturing&#xD;
      participants' maternal-health knowledge, attitudes and behaviors to both the intervention&#xD;
      group and the control group to see if there are significant differences in the two groups.&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators will assess participants' experiences of using the multimedia&#xD;
      application in order to document the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention and&#xD;
      also their experiences in using the intervention through qualitative in depth interviews.&#xD;
      Acceptability and feasibility data will be collected drawing from the UTAUT (Unified Theory&#xD;
      of Acceptance and Use of Technology) model (Venkatesh et al. 2003). This will include data&#xD;
      about the perceived usefulness of the intervention, perceived ease of use, social norms, and&#xD;
      facilitating conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators will consult participants' maternal health records at the&#xD;
      MRRH for maternal-health related outcomes such as the number of maternal and newborn deaths,&#xD;
      number of missed antenatal, number of maternal complications, and number of women delivering&#xD;
      at MRRH.&#xD;
