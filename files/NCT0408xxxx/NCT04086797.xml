  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main study objective is to evaluate the efficacy of IQP-AE-103 in reducing body weight in&#xD;
      overweight and moderately obese subjects, in the context of an energy restricted diet.&#xD;
      Further objectives are to evaluate the beneficial potential of IQP-AE-103 on waist&#xD;
      circumference, blood pressure and blood glucose and lipid levels, quality of life, as well as&#xD;
      its safety and tolerability&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair&#xD;
      health. Obesity is a substantial public health problem throughout the world, with the&#xD;
      prevalence increasing rapidly in numerous developing and developed nations. In 2014, about&#xD;
      13% of the world's adult populations were obese and 39% were overweight. The worldwide&#xD;
      prevalence of obesity has more than doubled in over 30 years (WHO, 2016). Obesity and&#xD;
      overweight pose major risks for serious diseases, such as dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes,&#xD;
      hypertension, coronary heart disease and stroke (Haslam &amp; James 2005) and average life&#xD;
      expectancy is reduced in obese people (Fontaine et al. 2003). Dietary fat plays a major role&#xD;
      in the development of overeating and obesity (Bray et al. 2004); thus fat uptake should be a&#xD;
      main target to reduce energy intake and achieve a loss of body weight (Svendsen &amp; Tonstad,&#xD;
      2011). It has been shown that nutrients such as protein and fibre reduce lipid absorption&#xD;
      (e.g. Chong et al., 2014; Hosomi et al., 2010; Tsujita et al., 2007). The main components of&#xD;
      the IQP-AE-103 are okra (Abelmoschus esculentus (L.) Moench) pod powder and inulin. Okra pod&#xD;
      powder contains a combination of dietary fibre and protein, which may have an important role&#xD;
      in fat binding (Kumar et al., 2013). Dehydrated powder derived from okra pod has further been&#xD;
      shown to have substantial swelling capabilities when added to water (Bakre &amp; Jaiyeaob, 2009),&#xD;
      which can potentially provide satiety effects. Inulin is a fermentable fructan, derived from&#xD;
      plants such as asparagus, garlic, leak, onion etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      and serves as an important source of soluble dietary fibre (Jaundzeikare and Beitane, 2014),&#xD;
      to further enhance the effect of fat binding. The efficacy of IQP-AE-103 in body weight&#xD;
      reduction during intake of 12 weeks has been shown recently in a clinical trial with 108&#xD;
      overweight and moderately obese subjects (Uebelhack et al., 2019). The present study aims at&#xD;
      a broader evaluation of the beneficial effects of IQP-AE-103 for use in weight management,&#xD;
      including its impact on waist circumference, blood pressure and blood glucose and lipid&#xD;
      levels as well as quality of life, in overweight and moderately obese subjects.&#xD;
