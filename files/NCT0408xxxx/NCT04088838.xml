  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic abdominal pain is highly prevalent in patients undergoing abdominal surgery.&#xD;
      Adhesions are reported to be one of the most common causes of chronic pain after surgery.&#xD;
      There is little epidemiological data on the natural course and risk factors of pain. In this&#xD;
      study the investigators will assess risk factors for chronic pain and natural course by&#xD;
      tracking pain scores through an app in a cohort of 1,500 patients undergoing abdominal&#xD;
      surgery. In part two of the study patients with persistent abdominal pain at 12 months, that&#xD;
      meet IASP criteria for chronic pain will have clinical investigations to determine the cause&#xD;
      of their pain. This investigation includes cineMRI for diagnosis and mapping of adhesions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Chronic abdominal and pelvic pain are highly prevalent in among patients who had&#xD;
      abdominal surgery in history. An estimate of 11-20% of all patients undergoing different&#xD;
      kinds of abdominal surgery will develop chronic abdominal pain. Adhesions (a form of internal&#xD;
      scar tissue) are the most common pathology found in patients undergoing diagnostic&#xD;
      laparoscopy for pain. Other factors that might be associated with chronic post-operative pain&#xD;
      are anxiety, depression, and female sex. Little is known about the natural course of pain&#xD;
      after abdominal surgery, risk factors for developing chronic pain, and the mechanisms causing&#xD;
      pain in patients with adhesions. In this longitudinal study the investigators will&#xD;
      prospectively study the natural course of pain through repeated measurements, and predictive&#xD;
      factors for chronification of pain after different types of abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: In Phase 1 the investigators will study the natural course of pain following&#xD;
      abdominal surgery. Primary objective for phase 1 is to assess risk factors for chronic pain&#xD;
      at 12 months after surgery; where chronic pain is defined as daily continues or intermittent&#xD;
      pain with maximal pain scores of 4 or higher during more than 3 months in accordance to IASP&#xD;
      criteria. As a pivotal secondary outcome we will describe and model the duration (days) of&#xD;
      moderate (worst pain score 4 to 6) to severe pain (worst pain score 7 or higher), and assess&#xD;
      factors that impact the chance in painscore using mixed models. In phase two the&#xD;
      investigators will assess the impact of adhesions on chronic pain. Primary objective for&#xD;
      phase two is to compare incidence and extent of adhesions on cineMRI between patients who&#xD;
      developed chronic pain and patients who did not develop chronic pain at 12 months after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is prospective cohort study, including 1,500 patients scheduled for&#xD;
      elective abdominal surgery. In phase one, patients are asked to fill a comprehensive&#xD;
      questionnaire, including quality of life assessment and a comprehensive assessment of&#xD;
      potential predictive factors for chronic pain prior to surgery. Post-operatively pain&#xD;
      symptoms will be monitored using short daily and weekly questionnaires taken by m-health and&#xD;
      e-health techniques to study natural course of pain. A comprehensive assessment of pain,&#xD;
      quality of life, and medical consumption will be taken at 3,6, and 12 months&#xD;
      post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase two of the study patients who developed chronic pain will be invited for mapping of&#xD;
      adhesions using cineMRI. Results of mapping of adhesions using cineMRI in patients with&#xD;
      chronic abdominal pain will be compared to mapping of adhesions in 100 patients matched for&#xD;
      type of surgery and risk factors who did not develop chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 1,500 patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery from different&#xD;
      surgical subspecialties (e.g. colorectal, upper-GI, and gynaecological surgery), aged 18&#xD;
      years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Main study outcome for phase one are risk factors for&#xD;
      development of chronic pain at 12 months post-operative. Pivotal secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      description of the median duration (days) of moderate to severe abdominal pain following&#xD;
      abdominal surgery, and modelling of factors that impact change in abdominal pain after&#xD;
      surgery. Other secondary outcomes include health-related quality of life, healthcare&#xD;
      utilization, and return to daily activity or work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcomes for phase two is the percentage of patients with adhesions on cineMRI as&#xD;
      compared between patients with and without chronic pain. Secondary outcomes relate to the&#xD;
      appearance of adhesions on cineMRI, and included extent and the loss of shear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: In phase one of this cohort study patients will be asked to fill repeated&#xD;
      questionnaires on pain and potential risk factors for chronic pain. The intake questionnaire&#xD;
      prior to surgery will take approximately 60 minutes to fill. Post-operatively we will send&#xD;
      short questionnaires that take 2-5 minutes to fill. These questionnaires will be send daily&#xD;
      during the first 60 days after surgery and weekly afterwards. A more comprehensive&#xD;
      questionnaire on abdominal pain and complaints that takes 45 minutes to complete will be send&#xD;
      at 3,6, and 12 months post-operative. There are no risks related to participation in this&#xD;
      study, nor are there direct benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participating in part two of this cohort will undergo cineMRI to evaluate if pain&#xD;
      symptoms might relate to adhesions form previous surgery. The MRI will take approximately 20&#xD;
      minutes to perform. MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique without health risks. However,&#xD;
      there is a risk of incidental findings that do not relate to the subject of this study&#xD;
      (adhesion formation). Patients who do not want to be informed about incidental findings will&#xD;
      be excluded from phase two. In a subset female patients who had pelvic surgery and resection&#xD;
      of the uterus an additional transvaginal ultrasound will be made. Like MRI, this is a&#xD;
      non-invasive diagnostic test without health risks. There is some additional inconvenience by&#xD;
      the use of a transvaginal ultrasound prove. The test will take approximately 15 min.&#xD;

        Patients with undergoing different types of abdominal surgery (laparotomy and laparoscopy).&#xD;
        Included are all patients undergoing elective surgery. Patients undergoing laparoscopic&#xD;
        cholecystectomy and caesarean section are excluded because both are very frequent&#xD;
        procedures with a low risk of chronic post-operative pain and low risk of adhesions. These&#xD;
        procedure could therefore significantly impact the power of the study. Although patients&#xD;
        after laparoscopic cholecystectomy frequently report pain, these pain symptoms are often&#xD;
        attributable to persistence of pre-existing pain. There are known difficulties in&#xD;
        differential diagnosis of symptomatic cholelithiasis and dyspepsia, that might interfere&#xD;
        with indication for cholecystectomy&#xD;
