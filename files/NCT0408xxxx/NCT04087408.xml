  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is still controversy over the best LPS agent and protocol and its dose and duration as&#xD;
      well as the time of initiation and cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many protocols of luteal support in assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles.&#xD;
      Luteal phase support with progesterone is a standard approach for ART cycles .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial studies in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) patients&#xD;
      have demonstrated that the use of a GnRH agonist (GnRHa) trigger, followed by fresh transfer&#xD;
      and a standard luteal phase support (LPS) was associated with unacceptably high rates of loss&#xD;
      in early pregnancy compared to hCG trigger, particularly in normal responder (NR) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During IVF and fresh embryo transfer, the luteal function is disrupted and the success of the&#xD;
      treatment is critically dependent on exogenous luteal phase support&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last decade, two different modified LPS strategies have been proposed to overcome&#xD;
      the mentioned luteal phase deficiency. One of these approaches has been called the &quot;European&#xD;
      approach&quot; in which the endogenous steroid (progesterone and estradiol) production by the&#xD;
      corpora lutea is boosted by exogenous LH activity, i.e., LH or hCG after GnRHa trigger. The&#xD;
      other approach has been called the &quot;American approach&quot; in which luteal progesterone and&#xD;
      estradiol are administered exogenously, thus, disregarding the function of the corpora lutea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been subsequently concluded that this early pregnancy loss was caused by luteal phase&#xD;
      (LP) insufficiency, despite the use of a standard LPS package of progesterone (P) and&#xD;
      estradiol (E2). The LP defect was primarily caused by reduced early-mid-luteal luteinizing&#xD;
      hormone (LH) activity, resulting in a significant reduction in progesterone output by the&#xD;
      corpora lutea (CL) as no adverse effects were seen with respect to the maturity rate of&#xD;
      oocytes, fertilization rates, embryo quality, and reproductive outcomes during the subsequent&#xD;
      replacement of frozen embryos derived from women who had received a GnRHa trigger .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transvaginal progesterone is commonly used for luteal phase support. Progesterone&#xD;
      administration is initiated on the oocyte pick-up (OPU) day and continued for 12 days, until&#xD;
      the serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) measurement day. However, there are&#xD;
      conflicting results regarding the dose, route of administration (oral, subcutaneous,&#xD;
      transvaginal), duration (until the ultrasound demonstration of heartbeat in an intrauterine&#xD;
      gestational sac, until 10 weeks of gestation, until 12 weeks of gestation), and formulations&#xD;
      such as synthetic or micronized types of progesterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A bolus of GnRHa, when administered 6 days after OPU in GnRH antagonist cycles, is able to&#xD;
      induce a surge of pituitary gonadotropins (FSH and LH), eliciting an increase in steroid&#xD;
      production (E2 and P) by the CL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact mechanism behind the presumed beneficial effect of LP GnRHa administration remains&#xD;
      poorly defined. It has been hypothesized that GnRHa either supports CL function by inducing&#xD;
      LH secretion by the pituitary gonadotrophic cells or stimulates the endometrial GnRH&#xD;
      receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tesarik postulated a direct effect of GnRHa on the embryo, as suggested by an increase in&#xD;
      Î²-HCG secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, there are significant differences in the early-mid-LP endocrine pattern when&#xD;
      GnRHa triggers and hCG triggers are compared, especially in terms of LH levels. From this, it&#xD;
      could be hypothesized that the GnRHa-triggered IVF cycle could benefit more from the addition&#xD;
      of a bolus of GnRHa to boost the circulating endogenous LH and thus, progesterone levels&#xD;
      around the time of implantation than the hCG triggered cycle. No studies previously&#xD;
      investigated this issue. Therefore, the aim here was to explore a possible fine-tuning of the&#xD;
      LPS of GnRHa-triggered IVF/ICSI cycles, using the previously suggested protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significantly increased implantation rates (IRs) were previously reported in oocyte&#xD;
      recipients as well as in patients who were triggered with hCG, if they received a single&#xD;
      mid-luteal bolus of GnRHa in addition to standard LPS .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A beneficial effect of a single dose of GnRH agonist administration as a luteal phase&#xD;
      supporting agent is yet to be determined because of the wide heterogeneity of data present in&#xD;
      literature. Well-designed randomized clinical studies are required to clarify any effect of&#xD;
      luteal GnRH agonist addition on pregnancy outcome measures with different doses, timing, and&#xD;
      administration routes of GnRH agonists .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of 0.1 mg of the GnRH agonist triptorelin on day 3 after embryo transfer led&#xD;
      to a significant improvement in implantation rate (12.3% vs. 7.3%) and clinical pregnancy&#xD;
      rate (25.5% vs. 10.0%) as compared with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Luteal phase support with single-dose GnRHa might be as efficient as three doses of hCG.&#xD;
      Large prospective, randomized-controlled studies are required comparing GnRHa and hCG for&#xD;
      luteal phase support.&#xD;

      Type of the study: Open labelled randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting: ART Unit, Women's Health Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      c. Sample Size Calculation: Sample size calculation was calculated using Epi Info software&#xD;
      (version 7). Based on previous study the pregnancy rate was 25.5% with GnRHa and 10% with&#xD;
      control. Based on these percentages and with a confidence level of 95% and power of 80%, the&#xD;
      sample size needed for the study was estimated to be 200 women (100 in each group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study tools :&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women scheduled for ICSI cycles in the AUH -ART unit and fulfil the above criteria will&#xD;
      be invited to participate in the study, and subjected to the following&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A Thorough history will be taken with special emphasis on age and parity of the&#xD;
           patients, age and duration of marriage, menstrual pattern, contraceptive history (with&#xD;
           stress on type and duration of use), type and duration of infertility and type of&#xD;
           previous delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood sampling will be performed for baseline evaluation FSH, LH, TSH and AMH on 2nd day&#xD;
           of menses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ovarian stimulation will be initiated from the day 2 of the menstrual cycle using&#xD;
           recombinant gonadotropins 150-450 IU depending on patient age, BMI, antral follicle&#xD;
           count and basal serum FSH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. After 5 days, doses will be adjusted according to ovarian response. Once the leading&#xD;
           follicle will reach a size of 14 mm, co-treatment with a GnRH antagonist will initiated&#xD;
           and continued up until at least three follicles reached a size of 17-18 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Trigger will be done using HCG followed by OPU 36 h later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Retrieved oocytes will be fertilized by ICSI depending on sperm quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. According to the local regional policy and after an agreement between the patient and&#xD;
           the medical team, one to three embryos will be transferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. For LPS, all patients will receive micronized P (400 mg/day) vaginally beginning on the&#xD;
           day of oocyte retrieval and continuing until either end of first trimester by ultrasound&#xD;
           or a negative pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. For the study group GnRH agonist 0.1 mg will be given 6 days after OPU.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Blood sampling will be performed for progesterone within 24 h following the GnRH agonist&#xD;
           0.1 mg injection particularly in the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Blood sampling will be performed 14 days after OPU for Quantative BHCG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be accomplished by using cards at the time of embryo transfer; two hundred&#xD;
      will sequentially divide into two groups. Opaque sealed envelopes will used containing 100&#xD;
      cards labelled control group and 100 cards labelled study group. All of envelops will mixed&#xD;
      together randomly in a box. The cards will be pulled randomly.&#xD;
