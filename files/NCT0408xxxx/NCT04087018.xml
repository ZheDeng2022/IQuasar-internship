  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b open-label study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of&#xD;
      zimberelimab (AB122) in biomarker-selected participants with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The activity of zimberelimab every 3 weeks (Q3W) will be evaluated in molecularly defined&#xD;
      patient populations as described by the StrataNGS test (to be performed outside of this study&#xD;
      protocol). Participants with any advanced tumor type will be stratified evenly by tumor&#xD;
      biomarker status as follows: TMB-H or Strata Immune Signature positive. Each cohort may&#xD;
      enroll approximately 40 participants. Following completion of and/or discontinuation from&#xD;
      investigational product and follow-up, all participants will be followed for survival.&#xD;
