  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular and myocardial inflammation are significantly increased in Acute Coronary Syndrome&#xD;
      (ACS) patients, are closely correlated to LDL-C levels, and are associated with these adverse&#xD;
      consequences in the post-ACS patient population. Serum proprotein convertase subtilisin/kerin&#xD;
      type 9 (PCSK9) levels are also increased in ACS, may raise LDL-C, and the investigators'&#xD;
      pre-clinical studies indicate that PCSK9 is also a potent inducer of vascular inflammation.&#xD;
      The addition of the PCSK9 antibody evolocumab, currently approved to lower LDL-C in certain&#xD;
      patient populations, to current medical therapies would appear to be of particular benefit in&#xD;
      patients with an ACS by markedly reducing LDL-C, stabilizing vulnerable plaque, and limiting&#xD;
      inflammation-associated myocardial cell loss and resultant dysfunction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite aggressive early intervention and current secondary prevention strategies, many&#xD;
      patients who survive hospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) experience&#xD;
      subsequent unfavorable outcomes, including recurrent ischemic events and unfavorable cardiac&#xD;
      remodeling associated with progressive left ventricular dysfunction and congestive heart&#xD;
      failure. Vascular and myocardial inflammation are significantly increased in ACS patients,&#xD;
      are closely correlated with LDL-C levels, and are associated with these adverse consequences.&#xD;
      Serum proprotein convertase subtilisin/kerin type 9 (PCSK9) levels are also increased in&#xD;
      patients with ACS, may raise LDL-C, and the investigators' pre-clinical studies indicate that&#xD;
      PCSK9 is also a potent inducer of vascular inflammation. The addition of evolocumab to&#xD;
      current medical therapies may therefore be of particular benefit in these patients, by&#xD;
      markedly reducing LDL-C, stabilizing vulnerable plaque, and limiting inflammation-associated&#xD;
      myocardial cell loss and resultant dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators propose to test the effects of PCSK9 inhibition with&#xD;
      evolocumab on LDL-C reduction, vascular and myocardial inflammation, cardiac function, and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in an ACS patient cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a double-blind randomized study of 100 patients presenting with an&#xD;
      ACS (ST-Elevation- and Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction). One hundred ACS patients will&#xD;
      be randomized to evolocumab, 420 mg or to placebo (50 in each group) during early&#xD;
      hospitalization and will also receive current guideline-directed ACS therapy. Lipid profiles,&#xD;
      including LDL-cholesterol levels, and traditional and novel serum markers of inflammation and&#xD;
      endothelial function will be measured at presentation, during the index hospitalization, and&#xD;
      at 30-day and six-month follow-up. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans to measure&#xD;
      myocardial and vascular inflammation and echocardiograms will be performed during the early&#xD;
      post-infarction period and at thirty days (PET and echocardiogram) and six-month&#xD;
      (echocardiogram) following randomization. Clinical outcomes, such as angina class, will also&#xD;
      be collected at the six-month follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol and the primary and secondary lipid and inflammatory outcomes in this study are&#xD;
      identical to those in NCT03515304 and therefore the data in the two studies may be analyzed&#xD;
      together.&#xD;
