  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In African-Americans, the incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is ~14%. Adherence to crucial&#xD;
      diabetes self-management (DSM) behaviors, such as engaging in physical activity (PA) is&#xD;
      dangerously low among AA women living in disadvantaged neighborhoods. These women manage&#xD;
      numerous chronic challenges (daily discrimination, poverty, and violence), which drain the&#xD;
      internal energy needed for DSM. The ability to self-regulate (modify one's behaviors based on&#xD;
      the requirements of a situation) has been associated with adherence to health behaviors,&#xD;
      including diet and PA. This 6-week ecological momentary intervention (EMI) feasibility study&#xD;
      has been developed to reduce energy needs of DSM through use of self-regulation strategies&#xD;
      delivered in real-time, in the real-world setting. Twenty-six AA women will receive&#xD;
      personalized diabetes education over two days. They will be given a personalized activity&#xD;
      prescription and a Fitbit wrist activity monitor. During the following two weeks, they will&#xD;
      get a personal continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and individualized &quot;cue cards&quot; for simple&#xD;
      behaviors they can try when glucose levels are too high. The intervention is grounded in&#xD;
      self-regulation theory, and targets core self-regulation components, including&#xD;
      self-monitoring/assessment, mental contrasting of target values with actual values, and&#xD;
      goal-setting/review. The aim for this application is to Determine the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of an ecological momentary intervention, consisting of continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitoring, activity tracking, and personalized cue cards with behavioral choices&#xD;
      (eating/activity) driven by the results of glucose levels. Impact: Real-time feedback on the&#xD;
      effects of activity and eating behaviors will enable patients to make choices and see results&#xD;
      immediately. Our intervention will offer low-income African-American women opportunities to&#xD;
      enact behaviors in their momentary environment, and will encourage autonomous motivation for&#xD;
      PA uptake, and improving blood glucose control. Findings from this study will have an&#xD;
      important positive impact on our ability to create tailored, EMIs among low-income adults who&#xD;
      have limited access to diabetes specialty care and education.&#xD;

      All visits will take place at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) College of Nursing&#xD;
      Clinical Diabetes and Exercise Laboratory. At time 1 (T1), participants will complete&#xD;
      baseline assessments. Participants will complete health and biological assessments, including&#xD;
      measures of glucose control (A1C), body mass index (BMI) and a diabetes health history,&#xD;
      including, diabetes knowledge, and current DSM behaviors. The investigators will collect&#xD;
      assessments of autonomous motivation, diabetes distress, depression, self-efficacy for&#xD;
      diabetes self-care, and neighborhood related stress at baseline (T1) and upon completion of&#xD;
      the 6-week intervention at time 2 (T2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Week 1. Education and Fitbit set-up/instructions. The women will begin the&#xD;
      intervention as soon as five women are enrolled and T1 assessments are completed. The&#xD;
      investigators chose the group setting for the education to encourage social interaction and&#xD;
      support, which has been associated with DSM in a similar population to ours. The education&#xD;
      will consist of two 2-3-hour blocks of interactive diabetes education that will be&#xD;
      personalized in response to the cluster members' DM knowledge, health, and self-care history.&#xD;
      Education will follow the 2017 National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management and Support.&#xD;
      Education sessions will be culturally adapted to reflect needs of AA participants, including&#xD;
      feelings of powerlessness, access to care and family roles. Dr. Fritschi (PI) is a certified&#xD;
      diabetes educator (CDE) and has worked with low-income, urban diabetes patients since 1994.&#xD;
      She will adapt and deliver the education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1 (2-3 hours): Diabetes self-management education (DSME) will include target glucose&#xD;
      ranges, medications, foot care, and dietary and exercise effects on glucose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 2 (2-3 hours): At the start of the session, subjects will be given a wrist-worn&#xD;
      activity tracker (Fitbit Charge 3 accelerometer) that will be able to assess real-time steps&#xD;
      and heart rate. The Fitbit will also be able to track specific activities (e.g., cycling,&#xD;
      yoga) that the participant may choose to track. Participants will be taught how to download&#xD;
      the Fitbit app into their smart phones and set up personal accounts. The Fitbit Charge 3 was&#xD;
      chosen because it has a larger screen and easier app than other devices, and Co-investigator&#xD;
      Dr. Ulf Bronas has used the Fitbit extensively in his prior research. Group education will&#xD;
      include interactive, hands-on learning about performing foot checks prior to walking;&#xD;
      stretching exercises; and creative methods for accumulating steps when the weather or&#xD;
      environment doesn't permit walking outside. Participants will individually meet with the&#xD;
      exercise physiologist (Dr. Bronas) for a practical educational session using a&#xD;
      treadmill-walking bout to determine heart rate goals for moderate and brisk walking. They&#xD;
      will be given a written, personalized exercise plan for steps and target heart rate. The&#xD;
      group will be coached in setting SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and&#xD;
      time-bound) goals for the following week. The goals may include Fitbit data, such as goals&#xD;
      for step counts, stairs climbed, or minutes of activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Fitbit is a cost-effective wrist-worn activity tracker that is commercially available.&#xD;
      Fitbit data provide information on daily level of physical activities and heart rate.&#xD;
      Measures include number of steps taken, four levels of activity (sedentary, light, moderate,&#xD;
      and moderate-vigorous), distance traveled, and an activity score. Fitbits have been shown to&#xD;
      be reliable and valid for step counts and total daily energy expenditure in free-living&#xD;
      conditions. The advantages of using a Fitbit tracker are its cost-effectiveness and its&#xD;
      ability to measure walking unobtrusively. The investigators are using it as a motivator and&#xD;
      an option for individuals to set activity goals. Because patients are more likely to wear the&#xD;
      Fitbit continuously, There will be fewer missing data, and activity bouts can be tracked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 2. The women will return to the laboratory for review of their goals and problem-solving&#xD;
      sessions with a team member. They will be given a personal-use Freestyle Libre (Abbott Labs,&#xD;
      Alameda, CA) Personal CGM (FDA approved). The Libre CGM differs from similar systems in that&#xD;
      it is affordable and does not require fingerstick glucose samples for calibration so is not&#xD;
      dependent on the user. A small, discrete, water-resistant glucose sensor will be placed on&#xD;
      the upper arm by a trained study staff member. The sensor is accurate and stable for up to 14&#xD;
      days. Participants will use a small hand-held &quot;reader&quot; to scan glucose readings whenever they&#xD;
      want to, or when prompted. While wearing the CGM, the women will never need to perform a&#xD;
      finger stick blood glucose test. Participants will be taught how to use the CGM and how to&#xD;
      interpret the graphs that will appear on the reader. Glucose data will be downloaded by our&#xD;
      team for analysis of patterns in response to use of the cue cards and Fitbit activity data.&#xD;
      Data will also be analyzed for averages of glucose levels by time of day and day; and glucose&#xD;
      variability (Standard Deviation). Dr. Fritschi has extensive experience with use of CGM and&#xD;
      its data. At the end of the session the women will review their prior goals and may choose to&#xD;
      set new goals. The women will work with a member of the team to create a personalized &quot;cue&#xD;
      card&quot; that they can carry with them in their pocket or purse. The cue card will be a living&#xD;
      document. It will be developed by the study team and the participants and may be revised as&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cue cards will be approximately the size of a small index card and laminated for&#xD;
      durability. One side of the card will have the participants' medications and personal goals.&#xD;
      The reverse side of the card will contain a reminder of their target glucose range (80-130&#xD;
      mg/dL), and a list of strategies for activities or eating behaviors they can accomplish&#xD;
      within the context of their daily lives. These behavior options will be developed with help&#xD;
      from a research team member and other women in their group. At any time during the study,&#xD;
      participants may meet with a team member to revise the cue cards. The women will wear their&#xD;
      Fitbit and personal CGM continuously for 14-days while using their cue cards. The women will&#xD;
      be encouraged to contact the research team for additional problem-solving or questions during&#xD;
      this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 4. The women will return to the laboratory for goal review and problem solving as a&#xD;
      group. Data from the Fitbits and CGMs will be downloaded to assess frequency of use, and any&#xD;
      device-related problems. Since the CGM sensor is approved for 14-day use only, a new sensor&#xD;
      will be attached. At this meeting, the investigators will review and revise the goals based&#xD;
      on personal preferences and abilities to meet goals by the women. The goals will be revised&#xD;
      as needed. The behaviors may also change. As the women gain experience with the behavior&#xD;
      choices, they may decide that the options are too difficult or too easy and thus want to&#xD;
      change them. They may have new behavior options they want to try from suggestions made by&#xD;
      other women in the group. At the conclusion of the session, new laminated cards will be given&#xD;
      to the women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weeks 4-6. The women will wear the CGM and Fitbit devices while maintaining their normal&#xD;
      routines. Data from each device will be downloaded to assess frequency of use, and any&#xD;
      device-related problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 6. At the end of Week 6, the women will complete T2 assessments and final interviews.&#xD;
      The women will be allowed to keep the personal CGM and the Fitbit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final Assessments (T2) will include all of the surveys from T1 (excluding health history and&#xD;
      eligibility screening). Additionally, the investigators will conduct structured interviews.&#xD;
      about the acceptability of the study procedures and suggestions for changes in the&#xD;
      intervention for future, larger trials. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed&#xD;
      by an outside agency. Content analysis will be performed for common themes.&#xD;
