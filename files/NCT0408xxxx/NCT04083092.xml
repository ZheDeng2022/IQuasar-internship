  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain information from patients diagnosed with a skin and&#xD;
      soft tissue infection (also known as an abscess or 'boil' or 'rising') and determine whether&#xD;
      or not MRSA is present in the child's different surface skin areas or nose. We also plan to&#xD;
      compare how these infections look in the lab, by identifying in detail parts of the germ that&#xD;
      caused the infection or is found on the skin/nose areas&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients come into the Emergency Department for skin and soft tissue infections, which could&#xD;
      be caused by a germ not treatable with common medications. This germ is a bacterium called&#xD;
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). MRSA is a bacterium that has become&#xD;
      resistant to certain antibiotics. Scientists and doctors are not sure what causes individuals&#xD;
      to develop these infections, but it is believed to be related to the bacteria that might be&#xD;
      on a patient's skin or in their nose. Patients will be interviewed by someone from the&#xD;
      research team to gather more details about possible risk factors related to MRSA infections.&#xD;
      Th interview is expected to last between 10-20 minutes. Nasal (nose), axillary (armpit),&#xD;
      throat, and around rectum swabs will be obtained by the research team as follows: Culture&#xD;
      swabs (similar to a large Q-tip) will be inserted gently into the front half of each nostril&#xD;
      (nare), under each arm, in the throat area, and around the perirectal area (surface skin&#xD;
      around rectal opening) either before or after being seen by the emergency room physician.&#xD;
      Another culture swab of the patient's skin and soft tissue infection might be taken as part&#xD;
      of their usual care for the child's condition or a swab culture will be taken from the&#xD;
      infection site by research personnel. A 'culture' swab is a sterile Q-tip like swab which is&#xD;
      used to collect potential bacteria from the skin and nose, and then can be used in the&#xD;
      laboratory to grow the bacteria collected.&#xD;

        Children's is the largest pediatric clinical care provider in the country. Currently,&#xD;
        across the three hospitals (Hughes Spalding, Egleston, and Scottish Rite), there are 561&#xD;
        licensed beds. In 2013, CHOA managed more than 860,849 patient visits, with over 218,231&#xD;
        Emergency Department visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Enrolled patients will be tested for colonization by CA-MRSA and CA-MSSA by standard&#xD;
        swabbing of specified sites (nares, axilla, oropharyngeal, and perirectal areas). A culture&#xD;
        swab will also be taken of an enrolled patient's wound infection (skin and soft tissue&#xD;
        infection).&#xD;
