  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled, phase II trial. Initial safety run&#xD;
      phase is designed to establish the safety and tolerability of venetoclax, atezolizumab and&#xD;
      obinutuzumab combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no dose-finding step. The doses of obinutuzumab and atezolizumab in lymphomas were&#xD;
      previously clearly established in combination (Till BG et al. Blood 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has also been shown that in a balance between efficacy and toxicity, the recommended dose&#xD;
      of venetoclax single-agent in Follicular Lymphoma (FL) and DLBCL was 800 mg daily (Davids MS&#xD;
      et al. JCO 2017 ). The investigators chose the lower dose level (400 mg) for this study, also&#xD;
      corresponding to the registered one for patients with CLL, in association with two other&#xD;
      drugs. Nine patients having achieved 9 weeks (=3 cycles) of treatment (6 doses of&#xD;
      obinutuzumab, 3 doses of atezolizumab, 7 weeks of venetoclax) or having discontinued&#xD;
      treatment within the first 9 weeks of treatment will be enrolled in this cohort for safety&#xD;
      profile. If one of these 9 patients prematurely discontinue at least one of study drugs for a&#xD;
      reason other than safety (e.g. for disease progression), he/she will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All AEs occurring during the course of the study will be captured, regardless of their&#xD;
      intensity / grading. Grading of AEs will be completed according to the National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTC-AE), version 4.0. Based&#xD;
      on known safety profile of the 3 drugs, some adverse events of special interest will be&#xD;
      assessed. During the initial safety run phase, all haematological toxicities and&#xD;
      immune-related toxicities whatever the grade, and grade ≥ 2 for other toxicities will be&#xD;
      monitored and, in this case, safety review meeting will be organized with Independent Data&#xD;
      Monitoring Committee (IDMC) members. In case of more than 3 non-infective and non-hematologic&#xD;
      grade ≥4 adverse events in the initial safety run cohort that according to the experience of&#xD;
      the investigators are considered related to the combination treatment, inclusions will be&#xD;
      stopped and IDMC members will evaluate the possibility of an early enrollment termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment schedule applied to the initial safety run cohort will be employed for the&#xD;
      remaining patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 9 patients from the safety run will be included in the efficacy analysis. A response&#xD;
      evaluation according with Lugano criteria for aggressive lymphomas (Cheson et al. JCO 2014)&#xD;
      will be performed at the end of the sixth cycle to define treatment efficacy and, in case of&#xD;
      achievement of 16 responses, treatment will be considered successful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned enrollment for this study is 28 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive 35 cycles of treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From cycle 1 to cycle 8 patients will receive a combination of obinutuzumab,&#xD;
           atezolizumab and venetoclax&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From cycle 9 to cycle 18 patients will receive atezolizumab and venetoclax&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From cycle 19 to cycle 35 patients will receive venetoclax monotherapy.&#xD;
