  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This case control study will investigate the physiological effect of nociceptive input in&#xD;
      individuals with temporomandibular disorders. To do so, the investigators will compare the&#xD;
      development of secondary hyperalgesia following high frequency electrical stimulation (HFS)&#xD;
      of skin nociceptors in the forearms for up to 48 hours in individuals with chronic TMD (as a&#xD;
      main complain) and in healthy controls. Furthermore, the investigators will evaluate the&#xD;
      association between the response to HFS and various factors, such as demographic,&#xD;
      psychosocial and pain-related clinical factors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This control study is designed to compare the development of secondary hyperalgesia following&#xD;
      high frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) of skin nociceptors in the forearms in&#xD;
      individuals with chronic TMD (as a main complain) and in healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first part of the experiment (time1, day 1), all potential participants will fill&#xD;
      a basic demographic questionnaire concerning their age, weight, height, and current&#xD;
      medications (appendix 2). Participants with TMD will be diagnosed according to the Diagnostic&#xD;
      Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD). The DC/TMD includes the following&#xD;
      questionnaires: the Graded Chronic Pain Scale, the Jaw Functional Limitation scale, the&#xD;
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and -15 and the Oral&#xD;
      Behaviors Checklist. In addition, participants will be asked to fill the Central&#xD;
      sensitization inventory questionnaire, as well as the symptom Severity Scale. Lastly, the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate the distribution of pain by asking participants to draw the pain&#xD;
      that they felt during the past 7 days on a digital tablet. This will allow us to determine&#xD;
      the total area of pain of each participant, as well as the Widespread Pain Index. Subjects&#xD;
      will also be asked to provide a rating of their average pain for the last 24h&#xD;
&#xD;
      The psychophysical evaluation will be conducted later on the same day (day1). Subjects will&#xD;
      be asked to provide a rating of their average pain at present time (time 2). Then,&#xD;
      participants will be familiarized with the different procedures involved in the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure pain thresholds will be assessed on the temporalis muscle, the masseter muscle,&#xD;
      temporomandibular joints, trapezius muscle, and lateral epicondyles (time 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intensity of pain resulting from pinprick stimulation and allodynia in the area&#xD;
      surrounding the electrode (&quot;test area&quot;) will be assessed, as well as on the homologous site&#xD;
      of the contralateral control arm before HFS (time 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then HFS will be applied (time 5) on the left or right volar forearm (10 cm distal to the&#xD;
      cubital fossa). HFS will consist in trains of transcutaneous electrical stimuli consisting of&#xD;
      42 Hz trains (pulse width: 2 ms) lasting 1 s each. The trains will be repeated 12 times. Each&#xD;
      train will be separated by several 10 seconds of rest. The intensity of each stimulus will be&#xD;
      set to 5 milliampere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The of pain resulting from pinprick stimulation and allodynia in the area surrounding the&#xD;
      electrode (&quot;test area&quot;) will be assessed 30 min after HFS (in a counterbalanced order) on the&#xD;
      homologous site of the contralateral control arm (time 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extent of secondary hyperalgesia will be assessed approximately 45 min following HFS&#xD;
      (time 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, they will be asked assess the presence of secondary hyperalgesia in the test-site 24&#xD;
      (time 8, day 2) and 48 hours (time 9, day 3) following HFS with with calibrated neurological&#xD;
      examination pins (Neuropen, Owen-Mumford Ltd, Oxford, UK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 months after their initial assessment (time 10, day 180), if they gave their consent for&#xD;
      long-term follow-up, patients will be asked to fill the following questionnaires again&#xD;

    <description>High-frequency stimulation will be applied on the volar forearm (6-10 cm distal to the cubital fossa). To avoid any confounding effect of handedness, the arm onto which HFS will be applied twice (dominant vs nondominant) will be counterbalanced across participants. HFS will consist of 12 trains of 42 Hz electrical pulses lasting 1 s each. The time interval between each train will be 10 s. The intensity of stimulation will be milliampere. Electrical pulses will be delivered to the skin using a specifically-designed electrode designed: the cathode consists of 16 blunt stainless-steel pins with a diameter of 0.2 mm protruding 1 mm from the base. The 16 pins are placed in a circle with a diameter of 10 mm. The anode consists of a surrounding stainless-steel ring having an inner diameter of 22 mm and an outer diameter of 40 mm. This procedure induces secondary pinprick hyperalgesia (an increase in pinprick sensitivity in a large area of the skin).</description>
