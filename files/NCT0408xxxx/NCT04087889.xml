  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The drug for this submission is Hope Biosciences' allogeneic, first blood relative,&#xD;
      adipose-derived culture-expanded mesenchymal stem cells (HB-adMSCs) for the treatment of a&#xD;
      single patient with Pancreatic Cancer (PC). PC is an extremely infiltrative neoplasm that&#xD;
      usually presents with vascular and perineural invasion in surgically resected tumors.&#xD;
      Metastases to lymph nodes, liver and distant sites are all very common. Its incidence has&#xD;
      markedly increased over the past several decades and ranks as the fourth leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer death in the United States. Despite the high mortality rate associated with pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer, its etiology is poorly understood. PC patients experience physiological symptoms such&#xD;
      as anemia, ascites, severe fatigue, pain, cachexia, weakness, insomnia, confusion, and memory&#xD;
      loss. The aggressive nature of PC leads to rapid deterioration of patients' quality of life&#xD;
      and diminished ability to participate in treatment.&#xD;

      Once the eligibility is confirmed, approximately 1-3 weeks after the screening/baseline&#xD;
      visit, the subject will return for the first infusion. Subsequent treatments will occur&#xD;
      weekly for the first 8 infusions, followed by 4 infusion that occur 2 weeks apart. The total&#xD;
      number of infusions will be 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each of these visits, the subject will receive one allogeneic HB-adMSC infusion of 200&#xD;
      million (2 x 10^8 cells) total cells suspended in 250 mL normal saline for IV infusion. Every&#xD;
      infusion visit will include the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Review of medical history,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Complete Physical exam (Week 1, 4, 10, 20, and 52),&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Vital signs (Heart Rate, BP, Respirations, Temp., SpO2),&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Weight measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A verification of patient consent will be verbally performed&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. *When applicable (Week 4, 7, 10, 14, 20 and 52): A urine and blood sample for clinical&#xD;
           labs including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CBC with diff.,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CMP,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Coagulation Panel,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  TNF-a&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  IL-6&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CA 19-9&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  LDH&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The HB-adMSC infusion will be given via IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. The subject will then be monitored for a minimum of 2hr after infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. 24-hour telephone assessment for adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Video Documentation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs will be continuously monitored during the infusion and recorded at 15 minutes&#xD;
      intervals during the first hour. Vital signs will be recorded at the end of the infusion and&#xD;
      every 30 minutes x 2 hours or more frequently if clinically indicated. The subject will be&#xD;
      contacted by telephone 24hr. after the infusion visit to determine if any adverse events have&#xD;
      occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Please note that blood and urine sample during the intervention period will only be required&#xD;
      for the visits corresponding to weeks 4, 7, 10, 14, 20 and 52. During these visits, these&#xD;
      samples will always be taken before the infusion is started. Refer to Table 1. Schedule of&#xD;
      assessments for more details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visits week 4,7, 10, 14, 20, and 52&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will undergo the following procedures at each follow-up visit without infusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Review and update medical history,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Update concomitant medications list&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Vital signs (Heart Rate, BP, Respirations, Temp., SpO2),&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Complete physical exam (Week 1, 4, 10, 20, and 52)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. A urine and blood sample for clinical labs including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CBC with diff.,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CMP,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Coagulation Panel,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  TNF-a&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  IL-6&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CA 19-9&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  LDH&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Adverse event monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, visits 13 and 14 (week 20 and 52) will include CT Scans of the chest, abdomen&#xD;
      and pelvis. This procedure could be done up to 7 days before or after the actual visit day,&#xD;
      depending on availability and schedule of the imaging center. If a CT Scan has been done as&#xD;
      standard of care within 30 days of these visits, it would meet the requirement for this&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
