  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial cannulation is a necessity for installation of cardiopulmonary bypass in&#xD;
      minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS). In the vast majority of cases, the femoral artery&#xD;
      is the preferred arterial cannulation site. Distal limb hypoperfusion and ischemia can occur&#xD;
      in the cannulated leg since antegrade perfusion is not routinely provided. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      diameter of the cannula required to maintain adequate cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) flow is&#xD;
      often approaching that of the patient's femoral artery diameter, compromising distal blood&#xD;
      flow. The possibility of distal leg ischemia is often raised as a criticism to peripheral&#xD;
      cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass and by extent to minimally invasive cardiac surgery.&#xD;
      Ischemia of the lower limb is of high incidence in patients undergoing extracorporeal&#xD;
      membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy, in which the same femoral cannulation technique is used.&#xD;
      Therefore this complication has extensively been described in ECMO literature. However, no&#xD;
      clinical trials have been performed in patients undergoing MICS, despite the same cannulation&#xD;
      and perfusion route. ECMO patients often differ from MICS patients in morbidity as well as in&#xD;
      duration of cannulation. Up to now, one could not observe any clinical sequelae of limb&#xD;
      ischemia in MICS patients but a formal study of distal leg perfusion in MICS is recommended&#xD;
      to screen its safety and to identify possible risk factors.&#xD;

      Study design and setting Single-center prospective observational cohort study in patients&#xD;
      undergoing minimally invasive cardiac surgery with peripheral arterial cannulation. This is&#xD;
      the standard of care in the institution of the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population All consecutive patients presenting for minimally invasive cardiac surgery will be&#xD;
      screened for participation to the study. Eligible participants fulfill all inclusion criteria&#xD;
      and no exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Patients undergoing minimally invasive cardiac surgery older than 18 years .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. History of leg amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Calf muscle atrophy due to neuromuscular disorder or muscle diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stanford type A aortic dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. BMI &gt; 40.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Allergy for NIRS electrode.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Revision surgery &lt; 72h after primary surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Postoperative need for intra-aortic balloon pump and/or ECMO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIRS Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is currently accepted as the golden standard&#xD;
      monitoring tool for tissue oxygenation and for early detection of ischemia. The NIRS measures&#xD;
      and displays a percent tissue oxygenation (StO2). This value quantifies the percentage of&#xD;
      regional hemoglobin oxygen saturation. It is measured by an electrode placed on the skin, and&#xD;
      is therefore totally non-invasive. NIRS originally has been used to measure brain saturation,&#xD;
      but its indications have been extended to any region of interest. Multiple studies validated&#xD;
      NIRS as a useful monitor for detection of ischemia of the lower extremities in various&#xD;
      settings (ECMO patients, patients with peripherally vascular disease). Patton-Rivera at al.&#xD;
      showed StO2 differentials &gt; 15% had a 100% sensitivity and specificity for the detection of&#xD;
      clinically markable hypoperfusion of the cannulated leg in ECMO patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Patient demographics and medical history will be collected together with the&#xD;
      EuroScore II i.e the estimated risk of in-hospital death after cardiac surgery. NIRS values&#xD;
      will be coded and anonymously recorded onto a Universal Serial Bus (USB) device and saved on&#xD;
      a pc with limited access. Tissue oxygenation (StO2) differentials between the cannulated and&#xD;
      non-cannulated leg and StO2 differentials from baseline in the cannulated leg will be noted&#xD;
      (%). After completion and publication of the study all data will be deleted from the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data for analyses of variables will be extracted from the anesthetic and perfusion charts.&#xD;
      These charts are stored in the patients individual record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions On arrival in the operating room, oximeter pads of a NIRO-200NX&#xD;
      (NIRO,Hamamatsu® , Japan) NIRS monitor will be placed on the muscles of the calf bilaterally.&#xD;
      Lower extremity NIRS is an added monitoring tool as it is currently not being used in our&#xD;
      institutional clinical management. Neither anesthetic nor surgical plans will be altered by&#xD;
      the study and are left to the discretion of the attending consultant. Also, perfusion goals&#xD;
      may not be altered to the results of the leg NIRS. Therefore, the NIRS display will be&#xD;
      covered in the operating room throughout the surgery.&#xD;
