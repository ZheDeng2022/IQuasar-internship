  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently physicians and nurses rely on their own clinical skills and experience to diagnose&#xD;
      and record 'delirium' in the Electronic Health Records (EHR). This study aims to determine&#xD;
      how delirium as a diagnosis is documented by clinicians in the EHR at Hadassah Hospital. The&#xD;
      knowledge gained from this study will support the design of a better surveillance approach to&#xD;
      monitoring delirium events in postoperative patients using electronic healthcare recorded&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is considerable uncertainty surrounding the quality of 'delirium' records in the&#xD;
      Electronic Health Records (EHR). The reliability of this chart estimation has become&#xD;
      questionable in the absence of an objective definition of 'delirium' and a lack of highly&#xD;
      accurate diagnostic tools in the hospital setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the difficulty of accurately identifying delirium and the deficiency in the quality of&#xD;
      EHR documentation, it is not surprising that delirium is grossly underestimated,&#xD;
      undertreated, not properly recorded in the EHR or misreported. Data concordance plays a major&#xD;
      role in documentation quality, especially for data-mining and knowledge extraction analysis,&#xD;
      and therefore it is essential to address the reliability of 'delirium' labeled data within&#xD;
      the EHR system.&#xD;

      Clinical Background::&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative encephalopathy known as &quot;delirium&quot; is a deleterious, potentially risky, and&#xD;
      often preventable complication representing a serious &quot;brain failure&quot; condition, commonly&#xD;
      seen in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of postoperative delirium (POD) is likely to be a consequence of the&#xD;
      physiological and biochemical derangement induced by the underlying surgical pathology,&#xD;
      surgical trauma, pain, analgesia, and anesthesia. Common pathophysiological factors,&#xD;
      processes, and conditions leading to delirium are multifactorial and could involve&#xD;
      neurotransmitters, inflammatory processes, drugs, and oxygenation impairment. Multifactorial&#xD;
      perioperative factors, such as anesthesia and adjuvant drugs, also play important roles in&#xD;
      contributing to postoperative delirium. Perioperative care is, therefore, a potential focus&#xD;
      for investigation of data-driven evidence to understand the POD prior to developing effective&#xD;
      intervention tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delirium Burden::&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delirium creates distinct emotional distress in patients, family and caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The burden of illness due to delirium is significant, with a higher incidence of&#xD;
      postoperative complications, prolonged length of ICU and hospital stay, resulting in 30-day&#xD;
      mortality and unplanned readmission when compared to patients without delirium. The long-term&#xD;
      prospects of delirious patients show poor quality of life ('QoL') indicators related to&#xD;
      functional decline, new institutionalization, persistent cognitive impairments and higher&#xD;
      mortality, with persistent cognitive impairments in 12% of previously &quot;cognitively well&quot;&#xD;
      patients, and an even higher percentage in elderly, obese, and previously admitted patients.&#xD;
      The postoperative delirium is associated with longer-term cognitive decline and potentially&#xD;
      'portends descent to dementia' .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mortality rate associated with delirium is approximately 40% , as high as acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction. The total cost estimates attributable to delirium ranged from $16,303&#xD;
      to $64,421 per patient, implying that the national burden of delirium on the health care&#xD;
      system ranges from $38 billion to $152 billion each year in US. This cost is highly&#xD;
      comparable to the substantial costs of falls and diabetes, which emphasizes the need to&#xD;
      address this costly disorder with increased timeliness and urgency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of Care::&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efforts to detect delirium have relied upon two major methods , both of which fall short of&#xD;
      the practical needs of a modern hospital environment. Screening instruments, largely based&#xD;
      upon chart review, well-investigated risk factors and patient interview, have been&#xD;
      unsuccessful due to the challenges of implementing these into clinical workflows and&#xD;
      providing ongoing training for healthcare providers to use such instruments. In addition,&#xD;
      they exhibit poor sensitivity in routine use. While the early detection of delirium provides&#xD;
      clear and significant advantages in effective treatment, the screening tools available for&#xD;
      the disorder are not efficient or effective enough to do so. Delirium is often&#xD;
      underrecognized and misdiagnosed, exemplified in a 2014 study that found that the successful&#xD;
      detection of the disorder by staff was only at 23%, even after extensive multimodal education&#xD;
      about the disorder and how best to detect it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite its importance for patient safety and public health, delirium is often unrecognized&#xD;
      by clinicians, therefore the effective strategies of intervention remain elusive. Moreover,&#xD;
      the presentation of delirium is heterogeneous and multifaceted, and measurement of delirium&#xD;
      and its severity pose unique challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unmet Need::&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need exists for an objective, affordable and reliable modern assessment with the ability&#xD;
      of early recognition, improved screening, and continuous monitoring of postoperative&#xD;
      encephalopathy. The potential impact of such a tool has been recognized as highly important&#xD;
      for the establishment of evidence-based data for better tracking prognosis, monitoring&#xD;
      response to treatment and estimating the burden of care both during and after&#xD;
      hospitalization. Nurses themselves recognize this unmet need. Many have argued that the&#xD;
      current screening tests are too subjective and rely on each tester's interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concept Creation::&#xD;
&#xD;
      The era of &quot;Medical Big Data&quot; and next-generation health analytics is well upon us.&#xD;
      Conceptually, &quot;Big Data&quot; may include data-driven clinical features considered to be hidden,&#xD;
      uncertain, unrecoverable and unmanageable for human interpretation without the help of&#xD;
      computerized data processing and advance data-driven algorithms. As delirium in post-surgical&#xD;
      patients is often hard to recognize and remains a largely untreated condition, it is&#xD;
      hypothesized that an exploratory analysis of historical medical records by using an advanced&#xD;
      algorithm could reveal novel and improved knowledge about the nature of delirium. However,&#xD;
      the quality, computability, reliability, accuracy and completeness of the data are&#xD;
      questionable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore this study aims to perform a retrospective exploratory analysis of historical&#xD;
      records locked in one or more clinical databases (i.e. Metavision, EHR, AIMS, etc.), and/or&#xD;
      in one or more hospital settings.&#xD;
