      This study evaluates continous infusion of low-dose ketamine during intraoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative periods at three different doses to provide postoperative analgesia in total&#xD;
      knee arthroplasty cases. Patients enrolled randomly into one of 2, 4, 6 μg / kg / min&#xD;
      perioperative ketamine groups. All groups were given spinal anesthesia and intravenous&#xD;
      patient controlled anesthesia. Ketamine was started when sensorial block reached T10&#xD;
      dermatome level before the skin incision. By the end of the operation, in all groups,&#xD;
      ketamine infusions were reduced by half doses. Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia&#xD;
      device was set to 2 mg bolus morphine with no basal infusion for 48 hours during the&#xD;
      postoperative period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Multimodal analgesia, which involves the administration of two or more analgesic agents&#xD;
      targeting different levels of pain pathways, is used to improve pain control while also to&#xD;
      reduce opioid use and related side effects. Pain can be treated at various neurophysiological&#xD;
      levels, including peripheral, spinal and cortical targets. One of the agents used in the&#xD;
      multimodal analgesia technique is ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketamine acts on the central nervous system (CNS) and has local anesthetic effect. Ketamine&#xD;
      is an N-methyl D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, which appears to be the main mechanism&#xD;
      of anesthetic and analgesic action at CNS and spinal cord receptors. Other mechanisms of&#xD;
      action of ketamine include the interaction with opioid receptors, particularly mu and kappa&#xD;
      receptors. Another effect is that it has local anesthetic effect in high doses. Studies have&#xD;
      shown that ketamine is an effective agent in the treatment of postoperative pain. Continuous&#xD;
      infusion of low-dose ketamine after total knee arthroplasty significantly reduced morphine&#xD;
      consumption, and provided early rehabilitation without increasing side effects. However, when&#xD;
      these studies are considered, there is no information about the optimal dose of ketamine that&#xD;
      reduces opioid consumption at the highest level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, continuous infusion of low-dose ketamine at different doses was planned to&#xD;
      provide postoperative analgesia. Therefore, our first aim in this study was to find out the&#xD;
      optimal dose that reduced morphine consumption for postoperative analgesia after TKA with&#xD;
      continuous ketamine infusion at different doses. The secondary objectives are to evaluate&#xD;
      early and late period pain, side effects, length of hospital stay, patient satisfaction, and&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
