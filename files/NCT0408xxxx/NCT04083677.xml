  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents is uncommon in the elective, surgical populations,&#xD;
      but highly prevalent in trauma patients who requires emergency surgery as trauma impair&#xD;
      gastric motility and emptying.1 Presence of residual gastric volume at the time of anesthetic&#xD;
      induction is an important risk of aspiration pneumonitis.2 Routine use of non-invasive&#xD;
      bedside ultrasound gives information about the volume and nature of gastric volume.&#xD;
      Determination of gastric content volume preoperatively will help the anesthetist in the&#xD;
      assessment of pulmonary aspiration risk 3, 4 Ultrasongraphic measurment of antral CSA (cross&#xD;
      sectional area) can diagnose risk stomach during the preoperative period defined by a gastric&#xD;
      volume at risk of pulmonary aspiration (ie presence of Solid particles and/or gastric volume&#xD;
      &gt;1.5 ml/kg)5 The aim of our study is to allow routine use of point of care ultrasound (pocus)&#xD;
      of gastric contents in order to inform an assessment of aspiration risk and guide anesthetic&#xD;
      mangment&#xD;

      A prospective randomized study will be conducted in Ain Shams University Hospital-Emergency&#xD;
      Department. Institutional Research Ethics Committee approval will be obtained and written&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained from all participants before enrollment. The study included&#xD;
      forty five polytrauma patients (18-65 years old of both sexes) admitted for emergency&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On admission, ABC protocol will be applied, (GCS) Glasgow coma scale assessment, complete&#xD;
      laboratory investigations and radiology and complete clinical examination with assessment of&#xD;
      fasting hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are patients with obesity (BMI&gt; 35kg/m2), pregnancy, a history of upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal diseases including gastroesophageal reflux disease, hiatus hernia,&#xD;
      gastroeosphgeal cancer or upper GIT surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A curved low- frequency (2-5 MHZ) probe and (simens ACUSON x 300) ultrasound system will be&#xD;
      used. All patient will be first scanned in the supine position, followed by the right lateral&#xD;
      decubitus (RLD) position. The gastric antrum was identified in a sagittal scanning plane in&#xD;
      the epigastrium immediately inferior to xiphoid and superior to umbilicus. The liver&#xD;
      anteriorly and the aorta, inferior vena cava and pancreas posteriorly were used as anatomical&#xD;
      reference points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fig. (1): Sagittal/parasgittal scanning plane for gastric assessment&#xD;
&#xD;

      = superior mesenteric artery; Ao = aorta. B Schematic representation of sagittal sonoanatomy.&#xD;
      A = antrum; L = liver; P = pancreas; SMA = superior mesenteric artery; Ao = aorta&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;empty&quot; antrum appeared collapsed and &quot;flat&quot; with the anterior and posterior walls very&#xD;
      close to each other or round to ovoid in shape resembling a &quot;bull's eye&quot; target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antrum appeared distended with a round shape when filled with a clear fluid. Multiple gas&#xD;
      &quot;bubbles&quot; appeared as punctuate hyperechoic areas within the hypoechoic fluid, mimicking a&#xD;
      &quot;starry night&quot; appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The antrum appeared distended with a contents of mixed echogenicity when filled with a solid&#xD;
      contents give the antrum &quot;frosted glass&quot; appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the stomach contains clear fluid, a volume assessment can help differentiate a&#xD;
      negligible volume consistent with baseline secretions vs a higher than baseline volume. So,&#xD;
      the antral cross sectional area (CSA) was calculated after measuring the two dimensions of&#xD;
      the antrum (D1 an D2) according to the following equation: Ï€ (D1 x D2)/4 and the volume of&#xD;
      clear fluid was calculated using a cross- sectional area CSA of the antrum measured in the&#xD;
      RLD and a previously published mathematical model: volume (ml)= 27.0+(14.3 x Right - lat&#xD;
      (CSA) - (1.25 x age). This equation accurately predicts gastric volume up to 500 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasogastric ryle will be inserted (if there is no contraindication) to confirm gastric&#xD;
      ultrasound volume calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the antrum as classified according to a 3-point grading system (perlas grade&#xD;
      0-2) that is based on the absence or presence of clear fluid in the supine and RLD positions.&#xD;
      Grade 0 refers to the absence of gastric content in the antrum in both supine and RLD&#xD;
      positions. Grade 1 refers to antral clear fluid that is appreciable only in the RLD. Grade 2&#xD;
      refers to clear fluid that is documented in both the supine and RLD positions.&#xD;
&#xD;

      The low risk result will suggest that the risk of aspiration is low and it may be safe to&#xD;
      proceed with surgery with a slowly titrated induction of anesthesia as dictated by the&#xD;
      patient's cardiac condition using laryngeal mask or E.T.T.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high risk result will suggest that the risk of aspiration is high, and this finding would&#xD;
      support: 1, postponing surgrery, till completion of fasting hours 2 loco-regional anesthesia;&#xD;
      neuraxial anesthesia, and 3, general anesthesia with rapid sequence induction, up to awake&#xD;
      fibro-optic intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will record the incidence of change in anesthetic technique and change in timing of&#xD;
      surgical procedure (as a primary outcome) and incidence of perioperative aspiration (as a&#xD;
      secondary outcome) when we use gastric ultrasound preoperatively in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using medical program setting alpha error at 5% &amp; power at 90% we calculated our sample size&#xD;
      based on the result of (sabry et al., 2018) which showed very good correlation between&#xD;
      gastric volume using ultrasound and volume of aspirated gastric content with an assumed&#xD;
      (r=0.5). Based on this the needed sample is 45 cases taken in account 10% drop out rate.&#xD;
