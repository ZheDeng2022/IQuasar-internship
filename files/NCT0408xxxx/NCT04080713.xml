  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Budesonide is a well-known and well-characterised locally acting glucocorticosteroid with&#xD;
      comparable efficacy to that of conventional glucocorticosteroids, but with fewer systemic&#xD;
      side effects due to its low bioavailability following oral administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no benefits for subjects participating in this pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and&#xD;
      safety study. This is an open-label study to investigate the PK profile and safety of single&#xD;
      oral dose of budesonide prolonged release tablets (9 mg, Cortiment® MMX [multi-matrix&#xD;
      system]) in healthy subjects in Indian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two study visits are planned: One out-patient visit (screening) and one residential session&#xD;
      consisting of three consecutive nights (admission to the clinical investigation unit at least&#xD;
      12 hours before dosing and discharge approximately 60 hours after dosing). End-of-study&#xD;
      assessments will be performed before discharge from the clinical investigation unit in the&#xD;
      single dosing period. Subjects should be in the fasted state for at least 10 hours pre-dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects planned in total in the study are 24 men and women, with a minimum&#xD;
      requirement of 7 women. The safety assessments comprise of adverse events (AEs), vital signs,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory variables. Adverse events will be collected&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;
