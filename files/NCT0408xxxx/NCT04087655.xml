  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impaired endothelial function is observed in disease states related to obesity, such as&#xD;
      atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and diabetes. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#xD;
      production and resultant oxidative stress contribute to the development of these&#xD;
      obesity-related diseases. The enzyme NADPH-oxidase is a major source of oxidative stress&#xD;
      within the vasculature, and has been linked with the Metabolic Syndrome. In the&#xD;
      investigator's previously funded studies, the investigators demonstrated for the first time&#xD;
      that: 1) in vivo ROS were elevated in skeletal muscle of obese as compared to lean or&#xD;
      overweight human subjects, 2) perfusion of the NADPH-oxidase inhibitor apocynin locally into&#xD;
      muscle normalized ROS levels and reversed local microvascular endothelial dysfunction in the&#xD;
      obese individuals, and 3) aerobic exercise training was effective at attenuating in vivo&#xD;
      hydrogen peroxide production and reversing microvascular endothelial dysfunction in the obese&#xD;
      individuals. The investigators will investigate in this R15 renewal application the mechanism&#xD;
      of exercise training-induced alterations in ROS production and action on endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction in obesity using our newly developed microdialysis methodology of monitoring ROS&#xD;
      production, in combination with analysis of muscle biopsy samples obtained before and after&#xD;
      our previously tested 8-week intervention of aerobic interval exercise training. The&#xD;
      objectives of this study are to determine the impact of in vivo NADPH oxidase activity on&#xD;
      endothelial function in obese individuals, and to determine the mechanism of training-induced&#xD;
      improvements in endothelial function. The investigator's unique microdialysis methodology&#xD;
      will allow monitoring of microvascular/endothelial function and ROS generation, as well as&#xD;
      the administration of pharmacological agents directly into muscle. The central hypothesis is&#xD;
      that it is upregulation of both mitochondrial ROS and NADPH oxidase-derived ROS that results&#xD;
      in endothelial dysfunction in obesity, and that exercise training down-regulates&#xD;
      mitochondrial-derived ROS, and NADPH oxidase 4, thereby improving endothelial function. The&#xD;
      aims of this proposal are to: 1) determine the contributions of mitochondrial ROS and&#xD;
      specific NADPH oxidase isoforms to the NADPH oxidase dependent endothelial dysfunction in&#xD;
      skeletal muscle of obese individuals; 2) determine the mechanism of ROS reduction and&#xD;
      improved endothelial function resulting from an 8-week aerobic interval training program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-five sedentary class 2 and above obese [body mass index (BMI) &gt;35 kg/m2, waist&#xD;
      circumference &gt;40 inches (men) or &gt;35 inches (women)] men and women (18-45 yrs) will&#xD;
      participate in these experiments. Individuals under 18 years of age will not be investigated&#xD;
      due to the invasive nature of the protocol. Individuals greater than 45 years of age will not&#xD;
      be investigated due to the age-related decline in endothelial function. There will be no&#xD;
      restrictions with regard to race, sex, or socioeconomic status. Women will be premenopausal,&#xD;
      will be on combined estrogen/progestin hormonal contraceptive therapy (oral pill, transdermal&#xD;
      patch or vaginal ring) and will be studied within the seven day inactive (placebo) phase of&#xD;
      hormonal contraceptive therapy (comparable to the early follicular phase in the normal&#xD;
      menstrual cycle; verified by blood estradiol analyses). Ensuring consistency in studying the&#xD;
      women during the phase of hormonal contraceptive therapy with lowest plasma estradiol&#xD;
      concentrations is important due to the known positive effects of estradiol on endothelial&#xD;
      function. Sedentary obese individuals will have been weight stable for the preceding 6&#xD;
      months, and will have the Metabolic Syndrome. The Metabolic Syndrome will be defined&#xD;
      according to the most widely used criteria for the Metabolic Syndrome from the Third Report&#xD;
      of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and&#xD;
      Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III). Individuals with&#xD;
      the Metabolic Syndrome have at least three of the following:1) Central obesity as measured by&#xD;
      waist circumference (men &gt;40 inches; women &gt;35 inches); 2) Fasting blood triglycerides &gt; 150&#xD;
      mg/dL; 3) Blood HDL cholesterol in men&lt;40 mg/dL and women &lt;50 mg/dL; 4) Blood pressure &gt;&#xD;
      130/85 mmHg; 5) Fasting blood glucose &gt; 110 mg/dL, and (not per ATP III) a 2-hour GTT glucose&#xD;
      of 140-200 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before participating in this study, subjects will undergo a medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination, and screening for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Evaluations&#xD;
      consist of a graded treadmill stress test, a blood chemistry, body composition analysis by&#xD;
      Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and a minimum waist circumference (between the xiphoid&#xD;
      process and the umbilicus) measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusions Subjects participating in purposeful endurance exercise training (&gt;20 min/day, &gt;1&#xD;
      day/week) will be excluded. Pre-menopausal female subjects must not be pregnant or lactating,&#xD;
      and must have had regular menstrual cycles for the past year. All subjects will be screened&#xD;
      for cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease. Individuals taking medications that may&#xD;
      affect central or peripheral circulation, are on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or&#xD;
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors, who smoke or chew tobacco, have diabetes (fasting blood&#xD;
      glucose &gt;125 mg/dL), hypertension &gt;160/95 mmHg (individuals with diabetes and high degree of&#xD;
      hypertension will be excluded to keep a more uniform group of individuals with the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome), congestive heart failure, angina, or peripheral vascular disease. Individuals with&#xD;
      evidence of serious arrhythmias and/or acute myocardial ischemia reflected in ST-segment&#xD;
      depression of 1 mm or greater at rest or during exercise will be excluded. Individuals with&#xD;
      chronic infections, paralysis due to stroke, advanced Parkinson's Disease, severe rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis or other serious orthopedic problems that would prevent performance of the exercise&#xD;
      training tasks will be excluded. Subjects will not be allowed to take antioxidant, herbal or&#xD;
      vitamin supplementation for at least 2 weeks prior to investigation since some of these&#xD;
      agents have been shown to improve endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. Subjects will not be&#xD;
      allowed to ingest caffeine the day of the experiment. Subjects will be excluded if weight&#xD;
      changes by more than 5% during the training program or if their exercise adherence is below&#xD;
      90% of the exercise sessions or total exercise time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeframe: Subjects will be recruited, screened, enrolled, and tested during months 3-28 of&#xD;
      this grant. Subject recruitment procedures and procurement of needed supplies will occur&#xD;
      during the first 2 months of the project. Additional recruitment, as well as screening and&#xD;
      testing of subjects will occur in 1-month cycles over the ensuing 25 months at a rate of&#xD;
      approximately 1 per cycle. Twenty-five microdialysis experiments will therefore be performed&#xD;
      on participants both before and after 8 weeks of exercise training, for a total of 50&#xD;
      microdialysis experiments. This plan will therefore require 2 microdialysis tests per month&#xD;
      on average during the testing months. Testing of these subjects includes six hours for the&#xD;
      microdialysis procedure. Biochemical analysis of samples requires approximately six hours per&#xD;
      experiment, and data reduction another five hours per experiment. Additional time (five hours&#xD;
      per week) is required for subject recruitment, preliminary testing and follow-up. The&#xD;
      recruitment and testing goals are therefore realistic in light of the personnel and&#xD;
      percentage efforts allocated, coupled with personnel and resources not charged to the grant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microdialysis (Before and after exercise training):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will report to the Hickner laboratory following an overnight fast. While subjects&#xD;
      are quietly resting, an overnight fasted blood draw will be obtained from an antecubital vein&#xD;
      to be analyzed for traditional (insulin, glucose, lipids, c-reactive protein) and&#xD;
      non-traditional [(cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-13, intercellular adhesion molecule-1&#xD;
      (ICAM-1), vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and P-selectin] cardio-metabolic disease&#xD;
      risk/inflammatory markers in blood using ELISA's from EMD Millipore, or our clinical analyzer&#xD;
      (Beckman Access systems). In addition, plasma glutathione (GSH/GSSG) will be analyzed as a&#xD;
      marker of systemic oxidative stress using a kit from Percipio Biosciences (Bioxytech&#xD;
      GSH/GSSG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microdialysis Procedure Seven microdialysis probes (CMA 20: 10mm * 0.5 mm 20kilodalton cutoff&#xD;
      membrane, 5 cm probe shaft length, inlet tubing and outlet tubing 20cm; CMA/Microdialysis,&#xD;
      Stockholm, Sweden) will be percutaneously inserted, 3 cm apart, into the vastus lateralis of&#xD;
      the quadriceps femoris muscle group (3-4 probes per leg) using sterile technique under local&#xD;
      anesthesia (1% lidocaine). The probes will be perfused with the appropriate solution at a&#xD;
      rate of 2.0 µL/min using CMA/102 microinfusion pumps (CMA/Microdialysis, Stockholm, Sweden)&#xD;
      according to the schedule in Table 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control perfusion solution will consist of a sterile saline solution containing 5 mM&#xD;
      ethanol (for blood flow/microvascular exchange measures). Two of the probes will initially be&#xD;
      perfused with this control solution while the other probes will be perfused with NADPH&#xD;
      oxidase inhibitors. Subjects will rest while seated for 60 minutes to allow for recovery from&#xD;
      probe insertion and equilibration of the perfusate with the local environment. Phase 1: Three&#xD;
      10-minute dialysate samples will be collected over the subsequent 30 minutes in capped 150 µL&#xD;
      polyethylene collection vials to determine basal nutritive flow in the absence (probe 1) and&#xD;
      presence (Probes 3-7) of the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, and to serve as an intra-probe control&#xD;
      period prior to SNP perfusion (Probe 2). Phase 2: The perfusate solutions in the second probe&#xD;
      will then be changed to contain the control solution plus 50 mM sodium nitroprusside (SNP: to&#xD;
      control for non-endothelium dependent changes). 100 µM Amplex UltraRed and 1 U/mL horseradish&#xD;
      peroxidase (HRP) will be added to the perfusate in the other probes for measurement of in&#xD;
      vivo H2O2 production. Three twenty-minute dialysate samples will then be collected over the&#xD;
      subsequent 60 minutes to provide these measures in the absence of superoxide dismutase. Phase&#xD;
      3: 10 U/mL superoxide dismutase (SOD) will then be added to the Amplex UltraRed/HRP&#xD;
      containing perfusates. Three twenty-minute dialysate samples will then be collected over the&#xD;
      subsequent 60 minutes to provide measures of the effects of SNP, 1 mM apocynin, 100nM&#xD;
      MitoTempo,100uM MitoTempo+Apocynin, 100nM GKT 137831, or 100nM GKT 137831+Apocynin in the&#xD;
      absence of SOD. Phase 4: The perfusate solutions in probes two through seven will then be&#xD;
      changed to contain the control solution plus either 50 mM Ach (to determine&#xD;
      endothelium-dependent changes), or 50 mM ACh + either 1 mM apocynin, 100nM MitoTempo,100uM&#xD;
      MitoTempo+Apocynin, 100nM GKT 137831, or 100nM GKT 137831+Apocynin (to determine if&#xD;
      inhibition of NADPH oxidase or mitochondrial ROS production improves the&#xD;
      endothelium-dependent response). The probes will then be perfused for 60 minutes to allow for&#xD;
      equilibration with the local environment. Three ten-minute samples will then be collected&#xD;
      over the subsequent 30 minutes to determine the nutritive flow effects of ACH in the presence&#xD;
      and absence of NADPH oxidase or mitochondrial ROS inhibition. For each sample where Amplex&#xD;
      UltraRed and HRP are added to the perfusion medium, 30 µL of dialysate will immediately be&#xD;
      measured for H2O2 in the laboratory fluorometer. For each sample where blood flow is&#xD;
      measured, dialysate will be stored at 4 °C and analyzed for ethanol (for blood&#xD;
      flow/microvascular exchange) within 24 hours. All perfusates and dialysates will be protected&#xD;
      from light exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microdialysis ethanol outflow/inflow ratio Ethanol (5 mM) will be included in the perfusion&#xD;
      medium to monitor nutritive blood flow/microvascular exchange in the area of the&#xD;
      microdialysis probe as described in our previous publications 30-32.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of peak aerobic capacity (before and after exercise training):&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will perform a standardized maximal exercise test on a treadmill upon enrollment&#xD;
      in the study and again upon completion of the training program. Subjects will individually&#xD;
      adjust speed and incline (3-6 km·hr-1, 0-5%) for a 5-minute warm-up period. After the warm-up&#xD;
      period, the subject's expired O2 and CO2 will be continuously monitored via open circuit&#xD;
      spirometry (TrueOne 2400; Parvomedics; Salt Lake City, UT). The VO2peak test will be&#xD;
      performed using a ramp protocol where the speed will be constant and the incline will be&#xD;
      increased 2% every two-minutes until VO2peak is reached. The starting speed will be&#xD;
      individually adjusted based on the warm-up speeds and heart rates, with the intention of&#xD;
      obtaining VO2peak within 8-12 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training Protocol All participants will perform aerobic interval exercise training three&#xD;
      times per week on non-consecutive days for eight weeks. Exercise will consist of&#xD;
      walking/running up an incline on a treadmill. Subjects will warm up for 10 minutes at 70% of&#xD;
      maximal heart rate (HRmax as determined during the VO2peak test) before performing four&#xD;
      4-minute intervals at 90% of HRmax with a 3-minute active recovery at 70% of HRmax between&#xD;
      intervals and a 5-minute cool-down period, yielding a total exercise time of 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of body composition Fat-free mass, fat mass, and percent body fat will be&#xD;
      determined using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA; GE Lunar Prodigy Advance, Madison&#xD;
      WI). Body mass and height will be measured for the calculation of body mass index (BMI:&#xD;
      kg/m2). Minimum waist and maximum hip circumferences will be also measured to potentially be&#xD;
      used as a covariate in statistical analyses due to the relationship of w/h ratio and waist&#xD;
      circumference with cardio-metabolic disease risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle markers of oxidative stress:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsies will therefore be taken in the resting state before and after training in those&#xD;
      participants agreeing to the biopsy procedure. Percutaneous muscle biopsies will be obtained&#xD;
      from the vastus lateralis of the quadriceps femoris muscle group (undergoes adaptations to&#xD;
      the proposed exercise training) using sterile procedures and after administration of local&#xD;
      anesthesia (1% lidocaine).&#xD;
