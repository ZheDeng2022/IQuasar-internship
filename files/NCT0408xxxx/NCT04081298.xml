  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how to improve the diet quality and physical activity level of&#xD;
      Latino cancer survivors living in rural areas. The recommendation to eat a high-quality diet&#xD;
      and engage in moderate-to-vigorous physical exercise may reduce cancer risk, improve cancer&#xD;
      survival rate, and reduce associated conditions. However, it is not well understood how best&#xD;
      to teach cancer survivors, especially Latino cancer survivors living in rural areas, to&#xD;
      achieve and maintain diet and physical activity. Understanding how to build a culturally&#xD;
      appropriate education that is effective may improve the diet quality and physical activity&#xD;
      level of Latino cancer survivors.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete questionnaires, undergo 3 24-hour dietary recalls over 3 days, and wear an&#xD;
      Actigraph over 7 continuous days. After 2-3 weeks, patients receive a FitBit to monitor&#xD;
      physical activity. Patients are then assigned to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients attend 6 online nutrition and physical activity (PA) education classes,&#xD;
      cooking sessions, and participate in physical activities over 120 minutes each. Patients wear&#xD;
      a FitBit and Actigraph to monitor physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive motivational text messages 2-3 times per week and access to a&#xD;
      nutrition website for 3 months. Patients wear a FitBit and Actigraph to monitor physical&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;

             group sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must self-identify as having a medical history of hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must self-identify as having a medical history of cardiovascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must self-identify as having a medical history of diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must self-identify as having a medical history of obesity, as defined by&#xD;
             a body mass index (BMI) of &gt; 30 kg/m^2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must self-identify as having a medical history of cancer (excluding&#xD;
             non-melanoma skin cancer). All other cancer types will be included provided&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There is no evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has not received a bone marrow, stem cell, or cord blood transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For cancer survivors, participants must self-identify as being at least 60 days post&#xD;
             final chemotherapy, biologic therapy, or radiation therapy treatment and/or surgery.&#xD;
             Current use of hormonal therapy is permitted (e.g., tamoxifen and aromatase&#xD;
             inhibitors)&#xD;
&#xD;

             participants to stop smoking than it is to change their dietary patterns. If&#xD;

             in &lt; 150 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous physical activity, as assessed by&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale of&#xD;
             performance status score of 0 or 1 for performance status. These scales and criteria&#xD;

             living abilities. These scales and criteria are commonly used by doctors and trained&#xD;
             research staff to assess a person's daily living abilities. Scores of 0 and 1&#xD;
             corresponds to being fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance&#xD;
             without restriction; and restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory&#xD;
             and able to carry our work of a light or sedentary nature, respectively&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women must not be pregnant at time of enrollment&#xD;
