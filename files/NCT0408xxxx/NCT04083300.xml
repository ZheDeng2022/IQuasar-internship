  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is a 6-8-years follow-up of a randomized controlled trial testing a stepped care&#xD;
      stress management program. The main goal is to examining differences in long-term effects on&#xD;
      cancer-related stress reactions and emotional reactivity between the intervention and control&#xD;
      group. Secondary objectives is to investigate consequences of cancer and its' treatment over&#xD;
      time, such as long term quality of life, objectively physical activity and experiences&#xD;
      concerning follow-up and the transition from specialist health services to municipal health&#xD;
      services.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major improvements in cancer detection and treatment lead to longer life expectancy among&#xD;
      cancer survivors. This may in turn lead to more late effects and many have to deal with&#xD;
      long-term consequences of the disease and its' treatment. Returning to everyday life and to&#xD;
      work is often an important part of returning to normal life for cancer survivors. There is&#xD;
      increasing knowledge concerning late effects, but there is still lack of knowledge concerning&#xD;
      the life of those experiencing late effects. There is a need for more knowledge about late&#xD;
      effects' impact on the return to work prosess, physical activity and quality of life over&#xD;
      time. Both quantitative and qualitative methods will be utilized. Standardized questionnaires&#xD;
      will provide information on the effect of the intervention over time, in addition to quality&#xD;
      of life over time. Sensewear armband will provide information about their physical activity&#xD;
      over time. Official register data from the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (the&#xD;
      NAV administration) will provide us information about the work- and benefit situation through&#xD;
      the whole follow-up period of 6-8 years. The register data include information about type of&#xD;
      social benefits (sick-leave benefit, work assessment allowance (WAA), disability pension,&#xD;
      unemployment benefit and retirement pension), as well as information about occupation, income&#xD;
      and sick leave diagnosis. Focus group interviews will give us insight in the cancer survivors&#xD;
      own experiences with quality of life over time, the transition from the specialist health&#xD;
      services to the primary health care and the follow-up in the municipalities.&#xD;
