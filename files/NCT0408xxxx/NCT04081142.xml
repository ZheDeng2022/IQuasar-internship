  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an observational study. Investigate the relationship of oxgenation and lung&#xD;
      regional ventilation and perfusion assessed by the indicator based-EIT method in the&#xD;
      critically ill patients in ICU&#xD;

      1. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients or next of kin before data were&#xD;
           included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. When the research team was available, adult patients within 1w, who were sequentially&#xD;
           admitted to the Department of Critical Care Medicine and required central venous&#xD;
           catheters for resuscitation were eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Information collected at enrollment included demographic characteristics such as age,&#xD;
           sex, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (APCHEII); . The global&#xD;
           hemodynamic, respiration condition and PaO2 were measured. At the same time, the lung&#xD;
           regional ventilation and perfusion assessed by the indicator based-EIT method(injection&#xD;
           10%NaCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The 10%NaCL was injected by the central venous catheter.&#xD;
