      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy for subjects with chronic&#xD;
      stroke after GXNPC-1 injection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single center, sequentially study in subjects with chronic stroke.&#xD;
      Considering 20% dropout rate (based on evaluable versus treated patients), approximately 15&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled, and at least 12 subjects will be evaluable. Cohort 1 will recruit&#xD;
      the first 3 evaluable subjects assigned to receive low dose of GXNPC-1. The following 3&#xD;
      evaluable subjects will be enrolled sequentially and treated with high dose of GXNPC-1 in&#xD;
      cohort 2. In cohort 3, another 6 evaluable subjects will be enrolled to take high dose of&#xD;
      GXNPC-1. There will be 2 parts of this study including GXNPC-1 preparation and GXNPC-1&#xD;
      treatment in chronic stroke subjects, respectively.&#xD;
