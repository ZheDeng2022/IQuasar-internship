  <brief_summary>

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major changes in female sex hormone concentrations influence the development of depressive&#xD;
      symptoms in women. This hypothesis has been thoroughly investigated with regard to the&#xD;
      menopause, the postpartal phase and also premenstrual dysphoric disorder. However, much less&#xD;
      is known regarding the impact of female sex hormone fluctuations on depression during the&#xD;
      regular menstrual cycle. There are indications that during the luteal phase, women might be&#xD;
      more vulnerable to the development of depressive symptoms, while during the follicular phase&#xD;
      and at ovulation, hormone concentrations might present a protective factor against depressive&#xD;
      symptomatology. Subjective stress could mediate the relationship between depressive symptom&#xD;
      development and the menstrual cycle phases. The complex interaction between sex hormones and&#xD;
      psychological symptoms in the course of menstrual cycle phases is still understudied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      74 women (37 with and 37 without current depressive episode), will take part in a&#xD;
      smartphone-based ambulatory assessment. Women will provide daily ratings of depressive&#xD;
      symptoms and perceived stress for a period of one menstrual cycle (approx. 26-30 days). Three&#xD;
      menstrual cycle phases will be assessed - the follicular phase, ovulation and the luteal&#xD;
      phase. An ambulatory assessment will be used for these daily assessments. To assess the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle phase participants will use ovulation tests on five days in the late&#xD;
      follicular phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following research questions will be investigated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question 1: Do depressive symptoms (number and severity) change in the course of the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle within the two groups? Research question 2: Which depressive symptoms are&#xD;
      particularly sensitive to changes in the course of the menstrual cycle phases? Research&#xD;
      question 3: Does the subjective stress change in the course of the menstrual cycle within the&#xD;
      two groups? Research question 4: Are there differences between depressive and healthy women&#xD;
      in terms of changes in depressive symptoms and subjective stress experience?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to investigate women-specific psychobiological factors influencing&#xD;
      depression. Therefore, fluctuations in depressive symptoms and subjective stress experience&#xD;
      will be investigated as a function of the respective menstrual cycle phases. The&#xD;
      identification of cycle phases associated with increased or reduced vulnerability to&#xD;
      depressive symptoms will support the development of women-specific prevention and treatment&#xD;
      programs.&#xD;
