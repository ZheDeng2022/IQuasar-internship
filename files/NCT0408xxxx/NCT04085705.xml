    <textblock>
      Rationale: Foot ulcers among diabetics are common. The presence of a contact allergy limits&#xD;
      the healing process. Contact allergies for wound dressings are common among patients with&#xD;
      ulcers caused by venous insufficiency but less is known about contact allergies in diabetic&#xD;
      patients with ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine the prevalence of contact allergies for wound dressings in patients&#xD;
      with diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A prospective multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients (n=139) with diabetic foot ulcers caused by type 1 or 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus treated at Rijnstate Hospital Arnhem, the Netherlands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary study parameter is the presence of contact&#xD;
      allergies for wound dressings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: An allergy test is standard procedure at Rijnstate Hospital, there is no direct&#xD;
      technique-related burden or risk for the patient. In addition, wound dressings can be&#xD;
      adjusted in patients where a contact allergy is determined which will benefit the prognosis&#xD;
      of these patients. The data of this study will give insight in the prevalence of contact&#xD;
      allergies for wound dressings in patients with diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Foot ulcers among diabetics are common. In 2015, around 20,000 patients in the Netherlands&#xD;
      had a diabetic foot ulcer.1 A study using data from Dutch general practices found a&#xD;
      prevalence rate of 0.50% and a 4-year prevalence rate of 2.85%.2 For Europe, Zhang et al.&#xD;
      estimated a pooled prevalence of 5.1% (95%CI: 4.1-6.0%).3 Prevalence rates increase with age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying mechanism of diabetic foot ulcers is most often solely neuropathy (60 to 70%),&#xD;
      15 to 20% have peripheral artery disease (PAD) only, and 15 to 20% have a mixture of both.4&#xD;
      Diabetic foot is more prevalent in males and more prevalent in type 2 diabetes than in type 1&#xD;
      diabetes3. Ulcers in patients without diabetes are mostly caused by venous insufficiency.5&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ulcers have a slow healing tendency. Around 15 percent of diabetic patients with an ulcer&#xD;
      eventually have to amputate (a part of) the leg.1 Good wound care is therefore important.&#xD;
      However, wound care can be delayed in the presence of a contact allergy. Contact allergy&#xD;
      (synonym for contact sensitivity) is defined as an altered immune status of an individual&#xD;
      induced by a particular sensitizing substance, a contact allergen. An individual in whom&#xD;
      contact allergy has been induced will develop a secondary immune response if there is skin&#xD;
      exposure to the same (or cross-reacting) allergen. This process is called elicitation, and&#xD;
      will manifest as allergic contact dermatitis (type IV hypersensitivity).6 Allergic contact&#xD;
      dermatitis, also termed allergic contact eczema, is defined as an inflammatory skin reaction&#xD;
      caused by direct contact with noxious agents in the environment as a result of contact&#xD;
      allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among patients with venous leg ulcers contact allergies is seen in around 50 percent of which&#xD;
      10-20% for wound dressings.7-10 The prevalence of contact allergies is getting higher and&#xD;
      also increasing with the duration of the ulcer. 8,10 Wound dressings can cause allergic&#xD;
      contact eczema (allergic contact dermatitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the prevalence of contact allergies for wound dressings in diabetic patients with&#xD;
      foot ulcers is unknown. With this study we want to gain insight in the prevalence of contact&#xD;
      allergies in patients with diabetic foot ulcers and investigate if the prevalence of contact&#xD;
      allergies among diabetic patients is as high as the prevalence in patients with venous leg&#xD;
      ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of contact allergies in&#xD;
      patients with diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multi-centre study.&#xD;

      multidisciplinary consultation hour for diabetics at the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic patients are patients diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;

      The presence of contact allergy for wound dressings&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secundary study parameters/outcome of the study (if applicable):&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Doses corticosteroid or antihistaminic therapy (not during PATCH testing)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of eczema&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters to define if there are other mechanisms besides diabetics underlying the ulcer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ankle brachial index , toe pressure measurement or Transcutaneous oxygen pressure&#xD;
           (TcPo2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venous insufficiency which is measured by a venous duplex, if applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters related with contact allergy or parameters that can influence the development of a&#xD;
      contact allergy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known allergy. If yes, which allergy/allergies?&#xD;
&#xD;
