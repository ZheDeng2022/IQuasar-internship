    <textblock>
      This multicenter double-blinded placebo-controlled randomised trial aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation prior to IVF on the live birth rate in women with&#xD;
      PCOS. Women with PCOS scheduled for IVF will be enrolled. Eligible participants will be&#xD;
      randomised 1:1 to receive oral capsules of 4000IU vitamin D per day or placebo for around 12&#xD;
      weeks until the day of triggering.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the leading causes of female infertility,&#xD;
      affecting around 5% of women with a child-bearing age in China. Vitamin D insufficiency is&#xD;
      common in women with PCOS and is associated with lower live birth rates in these women.&#xD;
      However, evidence regarding the effectiveness of vitamin D treatment in women with PCOS is&#xD;
      inconclusive. This multicenter double-blinded placebo-controlled randomised trial aims to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation prior to IVF on the live birth rate&#xD;
      in women with PCOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to enroll women with PCOS scheduled for IVF. Eligible participants&#xD;
      will be randomised 1:1 to receive oral capsules of 4000IU vitamin D per day or placebo for&#xD;
      around 12 weeks until the day of triggering. All IVF procedures will be carried out following&#xD;
      a routine method in each center. Women will be followed up until six months after&#xD;
      randomisation for those who fail to get pregnant after the completion of the first embryo&#xD;
      transfer or delivery for those who get pregnant after the first embryo transfer. The primary&#xD;
      outcome is live birth after the first embryo transfer. Primary analysis will be by&#xD;
      intention-to-treat analysis. The investigators plan to recruit 860 women to demonstrate women&#xD;
      treated with vitamin D have a higher live birth rate than those treated with placebo (48%&#xD;
      versus 38%), accounting for 10% loss to follow-up with a significance level at 0.05 and a&#xD;
      power of 80%.&#xD;
