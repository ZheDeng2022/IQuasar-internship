    <textblock>
      This study is a human challenge study to assess the feasibility and safety of controlled&#xD;
      human malaria infection (via P. vivax sporozites) in healthy volunteers, and to develop a&#xD;
      bank of P. vivax-infected blood for use in future controlled human P. vivax malaria infection&#xD;
      studies. Additional objectives are to obtain data on host immune response to P. vivax&#xD;
      infection and pre-treatment gametocytaemia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Six healthy, malaria-na√Øve Thai adults, aged between 18 and 55 years will be recruited at the&#xD;
      Clinical Therapeutics Unit (CTU) in the Hospital for Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Tropical&#xD;
      Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok. The overall period of participation will be 15 months:&#xD;
      a 3-month screening process prior to the Day 0 challenge, followed by 1 year after challenge.&#xD;
      All inclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked to ensure eligibility criteria have been&#xD;
      met prior to Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be admitted as inpatients to the CTU on Day -1 ( a day prior to the challenge&#xD;
      day). Challenge (bites from 5 infected mosquitoes) will be administered at the Insectarium&#xD;
      unit, Department of Entomology, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University. The&#xD;
      infected mosquitoes will be prepared by the Malaria Vivax Research unit (MVRU, Faculty of&#xD;
      Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University). Following successful feeding by the infectious&#xD;
      mosquitoes, volunteers will be monitored daily as inpatients for parasitemia and clinical&#xD;
      presentation of malaria infection (Days 1-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning on Day 6, volunteers will be assessed twice a day and, at a timepoint that will&#xD;
      depend upon the level of parasitaemia and/or degree of the volunteer's symptoms, up to 250 mL&#xD;
      of blood will be drawn and then antimalarial treatment will be prescribed. The standard&#xD;
      malaria radical cure according to Thai national guideline will be chloroquine, followed by a&#xD;
      2-week course of direct observed oral primaquine (PQ). Upon confirmation of clinical&#xD;
      recovery, completion of chloroquine treatment and laboratory absence of infection, volunteers&#xD;
      will be discharged and followed daily as outpatients through completion of oral primoquine&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of antimalarial therapy, all volunteers will continue to be followed for 1&#xD;
      year after Day 0:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outpatient CTU visits on Days 45, 90, and 365 post-challenge. Procedures to be performed&#xD;
           during these visits will include review of symptom diary cards, medical history,&#xD;
           physical examination and assessment of adverse events. Blood samples will also be&#xD;
           obtained to detect malaria antigens and assess immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volunteers will be contacted by study staff every 2 weeks between visits until Day 365,&#xD;
           to inquire for malaria symptoms or other adverse events.&#xD;
