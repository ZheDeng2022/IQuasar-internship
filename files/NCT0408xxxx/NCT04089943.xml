  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MicroRNA-210 (miR-210) can be a potential therapeutic target of patients with peripheral&#xD;
      artery disease (PAD). Recent evidence suggests the role of miR-210 and oxidative stress in&#xD;
      the pathophysiology of PAD and its association with mitochondrial function, oxidative&#xD;
      metabolism, walking distances and quality of life. The protocol evaluates the mechanisms&#xD;
      which miR-210 regulates oxidative stress and provides evidence of potential therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will randomize 180 PAD patients that undergoing a revascularization&#xD;
      operation in two groups: (1) an endovascular procedure or (2) an open bypass procedure. They&#xD;
      are also planning to recruit 50 non-PAD healthy control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to answer the main hypothesis that miR-210 gene expression is a master regulator&#xD;
      of oxidative stress and is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative metabolism,&#xD;
      walking function and quality of life.&#xD;
