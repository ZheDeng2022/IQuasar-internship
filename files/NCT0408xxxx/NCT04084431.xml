  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with solid cancers may develop cerebral metastases, requiring whole brain&#xD;
      radiotherapy (WBRT). Furthermore, in several cases, a secondary course of WBRT might be&#xD;
      required due to intracerebral recurrence and limited options for alternative treatments,&#xD;
      besides optimal supportive care (OSC). There have been few reports on re-irradiation of the&#xD;
      whole brain, but further evaluation especially of the optimal dose concept is warranted.&#xD;
      Especially, the efficacy compared to OSC has to date not been evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present trial aims at evaluating the efficacy of a repeated WBRT with a total dose of 20&#xD;
      Gy in 10 fractions compared to OSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint is time to WHO performance status (PS) deterioration to more than 3&#xD;
      (duration of functional independence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are quality of life, overall survival, radiation-induced toxicity and&#xD;
      functional independence assessed by the Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living (ADL)1.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to Nussbaum et al., 24-45% of cancer patients develop cerebral metastases during&#xD;
      their disease. Brain metastases are generally associated with a poor prognosis and high&#xD;
      morbidity2. Published median survival rates after WBRT are between 2 and 7 months3. Standard&#xD;
      of care in multiple BM is WBRT delivered as total dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions, leading to&#xD;
      modest palliation with a median survival of 3 to 5 months 4-6. Prognostic factors include the&#xD;
      RPA-classification, performance status, response to steroids and evidence of systemic&#xD;
      disease3,6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, intracerebral recurrence happens 7-9. For example, in the cohort of Meyners et&#xD;
      al. (2010) on WBRT in relatively radio-resistant tumours, median time to recurrence was 4.5&#xD;
      months and the local control rates at 6 and 12 months after radiotherapy were 37% and 15%,&#xD;
      respectively10. Furthermore, the treatment of intracerebral recurrence after previous WBRT is&#xD;
      challenging. In case of ≤ 3 recurrent BM, surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are&#xD;
      options. One other option, especially in case of &gt;3 recurrent BM is repeated WBRT. In this&#xD;
      setting, one of the first reports on repeated WBRT was published by Cooper et al. in 199011.&#xD;
      The authors reported on repeated WBRT (n=52) consisting of a total dose of 25 Gy in 10&#xD;
      fractions. Response to re-irradiation was seen in about 40% of the patients. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      patients improved by at least one level in their neurologic function status. Survival after&#xD;
      second therapy averaged 5 months. In the report by Wong et al. (1996) median dose of&#xD;
      retreatment (n=86) was 20 Gy12. Resolution of symptoms was achieved in 27% of patients,&#xD;
      partial improvement in 43% and no improvement or worsening of symptoms was seen in 29% of&#xD;
      patients. The majority of patients had no significant toxicity in consequence of&#xD;
      re-irradiation. Five patients had radiographic abnormalities of their brain consistent with&#xD;
      radiation-related changes. One patient had symptoms of dementia that was thought to be caused&#xD;
      by radiotherapy. Sadikov et al. (2007) reported on 72 patients who underwent repeated WBRT&#xD;
      for recurrent or progressive BM13. The median survival after re-irradiation was 4.1 months.&#xD;
      One patient was reported having memory impairment and pituitary insufficiency after 5 months&#xD;
      of progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the report by Mayer et al. on re-irradiation tolerance of the human brain (this analysis&#xD;
      was focused on recurrent glioma), the authors concluded that radiation-induced brain tissue&#xD;
      necrosis is likely to occur at normalized tolerance doses of cumulative &gt; 100 Gy14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent QUARTZ trial investigated the efficacy of WBRT vs. OSC in patients with non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer and low performance status. The results suggest that WBRT, even in the&#xD;
      primary situation, offers no substantial benefit to most patients with brain metastases from&#xD;
      NSCLC in terms of improved survival, overall quality of life, or reduction of steroid use in&#xD;
      this cohort15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present trial, the primary endpoint (time to WHO PS deterioration to more than 3) as&#xD;
      well as the secondary endpoints QoL, overall survival, radiation-induced toxicity and&#xD;
      functional independence assessed by the Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) in&#xD;
      patients previously treated with WBRT requiring repeated WBRT for intracerebral tumour&#xD;
      progression will be evaluated.&#xD;
