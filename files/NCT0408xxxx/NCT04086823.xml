  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-Eight (28) subjects (12 for cohort 1 and 16 for cohort 2 ) will be included in the&#xD;
      study. Subjects in each cohort will be injected with a different dose of RZL-012. The total&#xD;
      of 28 subjects will be enrolled in 2 clinical sites.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, 2-cohort clinical study in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. Cohort 1 will be comprised of 8 active (RZL-012) and 4 placebo subjects. Cohort 2&#xD;
      will be comprised of 16 subjects wuth at least 4 placebo subjects. All subjects will receive&#xD;
      a single dose of RZL-012 or vehicle into the submental area, after which they will be&#xD;
      monitored for safety and efficacy during 84 days of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be blinded to study treatment while physicians will not be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be composed of 2 treatment cohorts, 12 in cohort 1 and 16 in cohort 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 2 clinical sites. Per each study cohort, subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive active or placebo treatment according to a randomization program that&#xD;
      will be prepared prior to study initiation. Each clinical site will have at least one active&#xD;
      and one placebo treatment subject per each study cohorts. In case of slow enrollment in one&#xD;
      of the sites, other sites may complete the enrollment of subjects in each cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 (N=12) - Each subject will be dosed with up to 120 mg RZL-012 (depending on&#xD;
      submental fat area) or vehicle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 (N=16) - Each subject will be dosed with up to 240 mg RZL-012 (depending on&#xD;
      submental fat area) or vehicle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of cohort 2 will start following cohort 1 day 28 data. An independent Data Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety and tolerability data for cohort 1 subjects, 28&#xD;
      days after injection, and decide whether it is safe to increase the dose for the next study&#xD;
      cohort. The decision to proceed to the cohort 2 will be made within 30 days (28 days + 2&#xD;
      days) after injection of the last dosed subject in cohort 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DSMB will be comprised of two independent MDs with expertise in the aesthetic area and in&#xD;
      conduction of clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of serious safety concerns (e.g. prolonged severe swelling or severe pain following&#xD;
      injection) among cohort 1 subjects receiving the 120mg dose, sponsor and DSMB may decide to&#xD;
      reduce or stay with the 120mg/subject dose level for cohort 2 subjects.&#xD;
