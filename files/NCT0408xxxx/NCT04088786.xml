      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of intraperitoneal&#xD;
      administration of heated nanoliposomal Irinotecan in cytoreductive surgery (CRS), which is&#xD;
      surgery designed to remove as much of the cancer as possible, and heated intraperitoneal&#xD;
      chemotherapy (HIPEC) procedures.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cytoreductive surgery and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy consists of two parts: the&#xD;
      first is the surgical removal of all grossly visible deposits of cancer from the abdomen; and&#xD;
      the second is application of heated chemotherapy in salt water at the same time as the&#xD;
      removal of the visible cancer. HIPEC is an alternative method of delivering chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Traditional chemotherapy is injected into a vein, while HIPEC applies chemotherapy drugs&#xD;
      warmed up by an FDA-approved machine to 108 degrees Fahrenheit directly into the abdomen&#xD;
      during surgery, making it an option for cancers that originated in or have spread to the&#xD;
      abdominal cavity. Standard treatment in this manner usually includes Mitomycin C or Cisplatin&#xD;
      as its chemotherapy agents. In this study, the investigators will use nanoliposomal&#xD;
      irinotecan as the chemotherapy agent. Irinotecan is FDA approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

    <description>The starting dose of nal-IRI will be 70 mg/m2 (cohort level 1) applied for 30 min using a closed HIPEC technique following completion of cytoreductive surgery. If there is dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in cohort level 1, then the dose will be reduced the dosage of the next cohort to 50 mg/m2 (cohort level 0). If there is no DLT, the dose of nal-IRI will be increased to 140 mg/m2, 210 mg/m2 and 280 mg/m2 . If one of the patients experiences DLT, then the cohort will expand to 6 patients and accrual to the current dose level and dose escalation will stop if 2 or more patients experience a DLT at a given dose level.</description>
