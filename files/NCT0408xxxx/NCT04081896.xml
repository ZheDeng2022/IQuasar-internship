  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SpineZone is an innovative physical therapy program with its focus on treatment of cervical,&#xD;
      thoracic, and lumbar conditions through the use of a multi-disciplinary, technology enabled&#xD;
      platform. Standard physical therapy modalities including psychologically informed physical&#xD;
      therapy are employed in addition to online coaching with a fundamental tenant of core&#xD;
      strengthening. Treatments are tracked and modified in a multi-disciplinary format taking all&#xD;
      radiographic studies into direct consideration. The goal of this study is to utilize a&#xD;
      registry of participants undergoing either in-clinic or online rehabilitation treatment for&#xD;
      spine pain at the SpineZone clinical in order to understand the clinical outcomes and costs&#xD;
      of different rehabilitation modalities in this patient population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The key objectives for this registry are to 1) identify magnitudes of clinical improvements&#xD;
      with this specific specialized rehabilitation program in its various formats (in-clinic vs&#xD;
      online), in individuals with or without spine pain for comparison to literature-based&#xD;
      standard of care values for other conservative care protocols, 2) to identify average value&#xD;
      of this treatment approach based on cost assessment, 3) to identify which patients (based on&#xD;
      patient-specific predictors) are most likely to succeed with this specialized program and 4)&#xD;
      to identify targets for improvement and optimization of patient care any necessary&#xD;
      modifications to the industry's standard for care protocol. The goal of this project is to&#xD;
      assess the impact of a standardized program based on core strengthening using technologic&#xD;
      monitoring in a multidisciplinary format.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This registry of data will not contain individual identifiers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population is comprised of skeletally mature patients, both male and female, from a&#xD;
      wide variety of ethnicities representative of the typical population presenting with spinal&#xD;
      conditions, pain, or seeking prevention of future injury. There are no child participants, as&#xD;
      they are not candidates for the type of programs under investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data relating to the patient's physical therapy, diagnosis, co-morbidies, medical&#xD;
      history, medications etc., will be used for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe how the data will be identified:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Approved SpineZone staff will extract relevant outcomes data from the Electronic Medical&#xD;
           Records system housed on a secure server. Identifiers will be stripped from the data,&#xD;
           and claims will be indexed using Coding processes. Investigators will not have access to&#xD;
           the pre-coded identifiers. Age, but not date of birth will be used, but no patients over&#xD;
           the age of 89 will be included, thus it will not be an identifier. All systems used to&#xD;
           store and view the data will be secure, with password protections and login access&#xD;
           required. Once initial data extraction and de-identification is complete, the&#xD;
           de-identified data will be stored on secure servers in a HIPAA compliant environment,&#xD;
           and only transferred for biostatistics analytics through encrypted and password&#xD;
           protected email to approved individuals (i.e. research biostatisticians) following a&#xD;
           data use agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data that will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome variables: Validated questionnaire-based outcomes including but not limited to: VAS&#xD;
      (visual analogue scale), ODI (oswestry disability index) for Low Back Pain, NDI (neck&#xD;
      disability index) for neck pain, PSFS (patient specific functional scale), SBST (STarT Back&#xD;
      Screening Tool), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), medication usage (type,&#xD;
      frequency), number of visits, progression to surgery (yes, no), dropout rates and reasons,&#xD;
      Online compliance matrix(including access to educational material, log in rates, and&#xD;
      self-reporting of compliance with workout regimen); physical examination measurements:&#xD;
      strength and ROM measurements, and cost (based on procedural codes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictor variables: Demographic, medical history, and treatment-specific variables including&#xD;
      but not limited to: age, gender, ethnicity, diagnosis code (ICD-9/10), SpineZone&#xD;
      rehabilitation diagnosis, treatment type, treatment history, radiologic diagnosis, duration&#xD;
      of symptoms, postural factors, questionnaire-based pre-treatment disability, psychosocial&#xD;
      status, prior treatments, concurrent treatments (e.g., nutrition, mindfulness), and pain&#xD;
      scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      d) Who will identify data to be reviewed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SpineZone clinical staff and Principal Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONFIDENTIALITY OF DATA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data that is identified by the primary investigator for review will be additionally checked&#xD;
      for any identifiers and stripped prior to analysis by biostatisticians. This data will be&#xD;
      stored in two places. Initially, the de-identified data will be stored in the&#xD;
      biostatistician's system for analysis. Once initial analysis is complete, the data will be&#xD;
      loaded into a secure server with physical 24-hour security preventing unauthorized access to&#xD;
      the hardware, with access to data only allowed through HTTPS login or through a direct and&#xD;
      secure tunnel. Only investigators will have access to the login information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within two months of completion of the study, biostatisticians copy of the data will be&#xD;
      destroyed. The data will be maintained in the secure hosted environment indefinitely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be transmitted with either password protection or PGP encryption on biostatistician&#xD;
      computers. These computers and associated hardware are maintained in a secured facility with&#xD;
      no public access. Computers are password protected and after 30 minutes of inactivity require&#xD;
      the user to login again. Data and programs are backed up on a daily basis during the active&#xD;
      phase of any project. Internet access is firewall protected. Anti-virus software is&#xD;
      maintained (McAfee) with all incoming and outgoing documents scanned for viruses.&#xD;
      Additionally, a scan of all files is performed daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data storage will be on secure servers at a 24-hour guard facility, on windows server systems&#xD;
      with updated enterprise virus protection software from Symantec. The database will only be&#xD;
      accessible through an HTTPS log-in, with user-based access levels that ensure only personnel&#xD;
      authorized by the principal investigator can gain access to the system. Any access will be&#xD;
      tracked through a log of historical events that will track what user viewed or manipulated&#xD;
      what data at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systems, security policies, and access logs will all be available for audit and review by the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent will be obtained in clinic, or through a form on an online portal for patients&#xD;
      participating in the online treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISKS AND BENEFITS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks: A confidentiality breach is a risk associated with data review research, however every&#xD;
      measure will be instituted to ensure that patient information is kept confidential. Data&#xD;
      analysis worksheets will be kept separate from EMR records. No subject PHI will be collected&#xD;
      or shared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits: The participants are not likely to receive any benefit from the proposed research;&#xD;
      however, society and investigators will benefit from the knowledge gained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is intended to be a data registry, no current statistical analyses are being&#xD;
      proposed. Independent sub-studies utilizing data from this registry will be required to&#xD;
      provide power analyses and proposed sample sizes necessary to carry out the objectives of the&#xD;
      individual research question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed for individual sub-studies by biostatisticians located at the&#xD;
      University of California, San Diego. All individuals participating in data analysis will be&#xD;
      trained in research compliance, ethics, and will follow regulations according to the approved&#xD;
      data use agreements in place.&#xD;

    <description>Exercise prescribed to participants includes spine-specific strengthening exercises targeting core musculature (i.e. Multifidus, Erector Spinae, Transversus Abdominus, Obliques, and Rectus Abdominus). The in-clinic exercise program recommends a minimum of 20 visits at 2 visits/week, with a goal of 24 total visits over a 12-week period. Exercise is progressed by 5-10% of their exercise load once they are able to do &gt;20 repetitions. If they are able to reach &gt;10 but &lt;20 repetitions, exercise load remains the same. If they are unable to reach 10 repetitions, exercise load is decreased 5-10% at their next visit.&#xD;
The online exercise program includes non-machine based home exercises targeting the same muscles of interest, and are personalized to each participant based on their home resources and comfort level.&#xD;
Concurrent interventions may or may not include nutrition education, mindfulness, cognitive behavioral therapy.</description>
