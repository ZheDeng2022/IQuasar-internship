  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the the ability of BFR to reduce muscle loss and&#xD;
      improve strength after ACL reconstruction. It is hypothesized that BFR training will&#xD;
      significantly reduce muscle loss and improve strength after ACL reconstruction. It is also&#xD;
      hypothesized that BFR will result in improved patient reported outcomes and rates of return&#xD;
      to sport.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, many patients experience weakness&#xD;
      of the quadriceps (thigh muscles) and loss of muscle mass due to inactivity following&#xD;
      surgery. Recent research has demonstrated that blood flow restriction (BFR) training can help&#xD;
      reduce the loss of muscle mass and strength after surgery. Blood flow restriction training&#xD;
      uses an inflatable cuff that prevents blood from flowing out of the leg while patients&#xD;
      perform physical therapy exercises. This allows patients to use lighter weights while&#xD;
      reducing muscle loss and building strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing ACL&#xD;
      reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) autograft. Half the subjects will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the BFR group and half will undergo sham BFR therapy after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Assumptions: To sufficiently power (80%) the investigation to detect a difference&#xD;
      (alpha = 0.05) in quadriceps muscle strength (isokinetic contraction) following the&#xD;
      completion of the BFR rehabilitation program, 19 subjects per group (38 total) would be&#xD;
      required. However, accounting for a 20% attrition rate and an additional 20% potentially&#xD;
      screened out at the time of surgery due to other pathology (i.e. repairable meniscus tears,&#xD;
      cartilage defects, etc.) that alters the prescribed physical therapy protocol, this study&#xD;
      will aim to recruit and enroll 54 subjects (27 per group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following ACL reconstruction surgery, subjects will complete a standardized postoperative&#xD;
      rehabilitation program with or without BFR. The rehabilitation program will be broken into 4&#xD;
      phases including (1) protection, range of motion, and proprioception; (2) strength and&#xD;
      endurance; (3) power and agility; and (4) return to sport training. Physical therapy will&#xD;
      occur 2 times per week for 20 weeks. Subjects will attend follow-up visits at 1, 3, 6, and 12&#xD;
      months. Physical exam and muscle mass measurements will be performed at all visits, while&#xD;
      strength testing will be performed at 3, 6, and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to determine the efficacy of BFR therapy in improving muscle&#xD;
      strength and reducing loss of muscle mass following ACL reconstruction, in addition to&#xD;
      determining the effect of BFR on patient reported outcomes and return to sport. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that BFR will significantly reduce the loss of muscle mass and improve muscular&#xD;
      strength compared to standard therapy. It is also expected that these subjects will have&#xD;
      improved patient reported outcomes and greater rates of return to sport.&#xD;

    <description>Patients in this group will complete the standardized postoperative rehabilitation program with sham BFR, which is pressure of 20 mmHG. Exercises will be performed for 4 sets of 30/15/15/15 repetitions with a 30 second rest period between each set. The tourniquet cuff will remain inflated for all sets and rest periods for the selected exercise. A cadence of 2-second concentric and 2- second eccentric contractions (4 second time under tension) will be maintained for each BFR repetition. Upon completion of the exercise, the tourniquet cuff will be deflated, and a 1 minute minimum rest period will occur before moving on to another BFR exercise.</description>
