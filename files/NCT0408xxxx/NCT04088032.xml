  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a combination&#xD;
      of immunotherapy and anticancer drugs presurgery in patients with hormone-receptor positive&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis is that a Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitor combined with a Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor will be well&#xD;
      tolerated in early stage, hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer patients treated with&#xD;
      neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET). The secondary hypothesis and biomarker based endpoint is&#xD;
      that patients with HR positive locally advanced breast cancer with low to intermediate&#xD;
      stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) will demonstrate an increase in stromal TILs&#xD;
      following NET when combined with abemaciclib and durvalumab for 4 cycles (16 weeks).&#xD;
