    <description>Patients will receive 12 weeks of meals on wheels meal delivery consisting of 3 meals per day during the weekdays with 6 frozen meals to cover the weekends.They will also receive an exercise kit on the first visit by the meal delivery driver with 2 tennis balls,2 1-pound hand weights, and one towel.Every week,the driver will give them 3 exercises from the National Institute on Aging's Go4Life Workout-to-Go book,1 exercise from each of 3 categories:strength/endurance, balance, and flexibility. They will be asked to do the 3 exercises every day.The meal delivery drivers will ask daily questions about physical activity and any potential injuries and the participants will be asked to track their own weekly exercise and physical activity as well as their monthly progress on a standardized log. All participants will also be asked to wear a fitness activity tracker which will monitor heart rate, activity level, and sleep habits for the duration of the study.</description>
