    <textblock>
      This study will probe the function of collections of neurons deep in the brain termed the&#xD;
      basal ganglia It will investigate the role of the basal ganglia in how and why movement is&#xD;
      disrupted in conditions like Parkinson's disease, Dystonia and Essential Tremor. Deep brain&#xD;
      recording and stimulation will be used to probe the basal ganglia's contribution. Patients&#xD;
      with relatively severe movement disorders may have electrodes implanted in the basal ganglia&#xD;
      so that stimulation can be delivered chronically as a form of therapy. Studying these&#xD;
      patients allows researchers (a) to record brain activity from these electrodes in the basal&#xD;
      ganglia during symptoms related to abnormal motor control and (b) to stimulate the same&#xD;
      electrodes while patients experience symptoms. Like this they can see what aspects of the&#xD;
      activity of groups of nerve cells in the basal ganglia are associated with which symptoms and&#xD;
      also establish that these aspects of activity help cause linked symptoms. This means studying&#xD;
      patients just after electrode implantation, while the leads from the electrodes may still be&#xD;
      available for hooking up to external recording and stimulating devices. Understanding how the&#xD;
      activity of groups of nerve cells in the basal ganglia controls movement may help us develop&#xD;
      improved treatments.&#xD;

      This study investigates how the basal ganglia contribute to motor symptoms like tremor,&#xD;
      bradykinesia and muscle spasm. The basic research approach is to record from sites in the&#xD;
      basal ganglia whilst patients are symptomatic, so that brain waves can be correlated with&#xD;
      symptoms/signs. Once a brain wave is implicated in an aspect of abnormal movement, the&#xD;
      researchers can try and confirm its central role in function or dysfunction by triggering&#xD;
      stimulation whenever the brain wave is picked up. For stimulation the researchers will use&#xD;
      the same high frequency stimulation (130 Hz) as used clinically, as this is thought to&#xD;
      effectively suppress neural activity at the stimulation site. Thus, if a given brain wave is&#xD;
      important in, for example, slowing movement, then by triggering stimulation whenever this&#xD;
      brain wave is big it can be expected that movement speed will be increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope to follow this two-stage procedure to document the role of the&#xD;
      different brain activities picked up from basal ganglia sites in driving tremor, muscle spasm&#xD;
      and slowness of movement in patients with Parkinson's disease, dystonia and essential tremor.&#xD;
      This study is important, as if the researchers can alter brain function and specific symptoms&#xD;
      with stimulation they can use the same form of feedback-controlled stimulation as a&#xD;
      potentially efficient form of treatment. Conventional deep brain stimulation delivers fixed&#xD;
      stimulation all of the time. For example, researchers are beginning to see that stimulation&#xD;
      control based on feedback from beta activity in the basal ganglia may have advantages over&#xD;
      conventional continuous deep brain stimulation in treating Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is particularly interested in the processes contributing to slowness&#xD;
      (bradykinesia) and rigidity (stiffness) in patients with Parkinson's disease, tremor in&#xD;
      patients with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor, and muscle spasms in patients with&#xD;
      dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Bradykinesia and Rigidity in patients with Parkinson's disease Here there is already&#xD;
           evidence that these impairments are associated with beta frequency band activity&#xD;
           (~20Hz). Such activity is exaggerated in patients with Parkinson's disease in whom it&#xD;
           comes in bursts lasting several hundred milliseconds or even longer. The investigators&#xD;
           have already shown that by triggering stimulation when bursts of beta activity occur&#xD;
           they can speed up movement and reduce rigidity. In the present study they are interested&#xD;
           in (a) determining whether it is necessary to trigger off beta bursts or whether it is&#xD;
           sufficient to trigger off the general level of beta activity (ie averaged over long&#xD;
           periods), (b) whether if it is necessary to trigger off all beta bursts, or is it just&#xD;
           the long bursts that need to be triggered off, and (c) whether triggered stimulation is&#xD;
           also sufficient to control tremor where this is a co-existent symptom. Exploration of&#xD;
           these issues requires the investigators to record basal ganglia activity (the feedback)&#xD;
           and to deliver stimulation, whilst varying how the feedback is processed before driving&#xD;
           the stimulation. In engineering terms the investigators vary the signal processing and&#xD;
           control policy details, but the net result is feedback-controlled deep brain&#xD;
           stimulation. Note that the investigators only control the amplitude of stimulation&#xD;
           within a clinically determined range that goes no higher than the threshold for&#xD;
           eliciting side-effects. All the remaining stimulation parameters, e.g. frequency and&#xD;
           pulse width, are set to standard clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Tremor in patients with Parkinson's disease or Essential Tremor Here the evidence that&#xD;
           tremor is associated with a discrete brain activity is less robust, although&#xD;
           oscillations at tremor frequency (and twice this) are suspected of playing a role. In&#xD;
           conditions where the investigators are unsure of the exact nature of the factors&#xD;
           contributing to a state, in this case tremor, they often use machine learning to find&#xD;
           the relevant factors. Here the investigators propose to record both basal ganglia&#xD;
           activity and tremor in the limbs and then use these with machine learning algorithms to&#xD;
           point out the relevant combination of signals associated with tremor. The investigators&#xD;
           can then use machine learning outputs to tell them how to control tremor with&#xD;
           stimulation, whilst interrogating the weights of the inputs to the machine learning&#xD;
           algorithms to deduce the important relationships. As above, they will explore the&#xD;
           optimal signal processing and control policy details, but the net result is&#xD;
           feedback-controlled deep brain stimulation. Note that they only control the amplitude of&#xD;
           stimulation within a clinically determined range that goes no higher than the threshold&#xD;
           for eliciting side-effects. All the remaining stimulation parameters, e.g. frequency and&#xD;
           pulse width, are set to standard clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Involuntary muscle spasms in patients with Dystonia Here the evidence that muscle spasms&#xD;
           are associated with a discrete brain activity is also relatively weak, although&#xD;
           oscillations at theta-alpha frequencies (5-12 Hz) are suspected of playing a role. The&#xD;
           investigators propose to record both basal ganglia activity and muscle spasms in the&#xD;
           body and then use these with machine learning algorithms to point out the relevant&#xD;
           combination of signals associated with muscle spasms. They can then use machine learning&#xD;
           outputs to tell them how to control muscle spasms with stimulation. As above, the&#xD;
           investigators will explore the optimal signal processing and control policy details, but&#xD;
           the net result is feedback-controlled deep brain stimulation. Note that they only&#xD;
           control the amplitude of stimulation within a clinically determined range that goes no&#xD;
           higher than the threshold for eliciting side-effects. All the remaining stimulation&#xD;
           parameters, e.g. frequency and pulse width, are set to standard clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Techniques to be used&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study involves several techniques:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluation of symptoms using standard clinical rating scales e.g Part III motor UPDRS,&#xD;
           Unified dyskinesia rating scale and speech intelligibility test in patients with&#xD;
           Parkinson's disease; essential tremor rating assessment scale (TETRAS) for patients with&#xD;
           essential tremor; Burke Fahn Marsden dystonia rating scale (BFMDRS) for patients with&#xD;
           dystonia. The performance of these rating scales will also be videoed for off-line&#xD;
           review.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recording of peripheral symptoms like movement speed, tremor or spasm with standard&#xD;
           techniques e.g. recording joystick movement speed, recording tremor and other movements&#xD;
           with the bradykinesia akinesia incoordination test, skin mounted accelerometers and skin&#xD;
           mounted electromyographic (EMG) electrodes. These are standard, non-invasive techniques&#xD;
           that do not involve any side-effects of discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Recording of EEG using scalp mounted electrodes. This is a standard, non-invasive&#xD;
           technique that does not involve any side-effects or discomfort. However, there is an&#xD;
           important caveat here that as these patients will have recent surgical scars on their&#xD;
           scalps these will avoided so that no electrode is applied to the scalp within 4 cm of&#xD;
           any wound. EEG electrodes are applied to the scalp with a conductive paste which helps&#xD;
           hold them in place. Sometimes, where lack of hair allows, the investigators bolster that&#xD;
           attachment with some tape. There is no increase in infection risk due to recordings in&#xD;
           patients with externalised deep brain stimulation leads.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Recordings of depth EEG from the deep brain stimulation electrodes implanted in to the&#xD;
           brain by the surgeon for standard clinical therapy. As these are passive recordings&#xD;
           there are no side-effects or risks. Recordings in 2-4 will be performed using an&#xD;
           amplifier that holds a certification mark that indicates conformity with health, safety,&#xD;
           and environmental protection standards for products sold within the European Economic&#xD;
           Area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Stimulation of the deep brain stimulation electrodes implanted in to the brain by the&#xD;
           surgeon for standard clinical therapy. Stimulation can cause side-effects, so&#xD;
           importantly the investigators will only deliver stimulation in the form and range used&#xD;
           clinically, taking care to always remain below the threshold for side-effects.&#xD;
           Stimulation will be delivered through an in-house, custom-built, battery-supplied,&#xD;
           bilateral stimulator that does not hold a certification mark that indicates conformity&#xD;
           with health, safety, and environmental protection standards for products sold within the&#xD;
           European Economic Area. Nevertheless, it has been fully safety tested. The stimulator is&#xD;
           an updated version of that used for several past studies that have been reviewed and&#xD;
           approved by the United Kingdom National Research Ethics Service Committee South Central.&#xD;
           To allow for stimulation return, the amplifier is connected to a conducting pad placed&#xD;
           over the neck. Periodic impedance checks will ensure this connection is robust through&#xD;
           the course of the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given the choice to undergo the study without their usual medication for&#xD;
      their motor symptoms or with such medication. The former state is preferred to facilitate the&#xD;
      demonstration of a link between neural activities and symptoms, but the final decision will&#xD;
      be down to the participant. Symptoms may be worse with the temporary withdrawal of&#xD;
      medication, but most participants will be familiar with this as a result of forgetting their&#xD;
      medication in the past or because their medication was temporarily withdrawn as part of a&#xD;
      clinical test like the levodopa challenge.&#xD;
