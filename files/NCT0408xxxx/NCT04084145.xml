  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects around 10% of the adult population and is associated&#xD;
      with an increased risk of heart attack, stroke and end stage kidney disease (ESKD). This&#xD;
      study aims to better predict who is most likely to progress to ESKD using previously&#xD;
      identified risk factors and novel biomarkers in blood and urine samples, along with kidney&#xD;
      biopsy tissue. Resources can then be directed to those most at risk of disease progression&#xD;
      and other associated conditions such as heart attack and stroke, while those at lower risk&#xD;
      can be offered less frequent monitoring.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      3,000 participants will be recruited from nephrology clinics at multiple participating&#xD;
      centres (planned to start with 11). 100 control participants (without CKD) will be recruited&#xD;
      from among hospital staff members, people attending diabetes clinics and the general public&#xD;
      via advertisements placed in the hospitals and in the press.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants with CKD will participate in the study for 12 - 18 months of active&#xD;
      follow-up. After that participants will be sent a questionnaire annually by post to assess&#xD;
      quality of life (EQ-5D-5L) and health care resource utilisation during the previous year and&#xD;
      the investigators will collect outcome data without the need for further study visits; this&#xD;
      annual follow-up by questionnaire will continue for 14 years following their second study&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants acting as normal controls will attend only a single study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will provide written informed consent prior to undergoing any interventions.&#xD;
      After providing written informed consent participants will undergo the following assessments&#xD;
      and study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical History: The following data will be collected by interview, questionnaire and&#xD;
      examination of the participants' medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Socio-demographic: age, gender, ethnicity, first language, education status, marital&#xD;
           status, employment, indices of multiple deprivation (IMD) score (derived from postcode&#xD;
           of residence), smoking history, alcohol intake, dietary status (vegetarian/vegan)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical: All previous illnesses with particular focus on CKD diagnosis, previous AKI,&#xD;
           hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), atrial fibrillation, rheumatoid&#xD;
           arthritis, thyroid disease, retinopathy (if diabetic), peripheral neuropathy (if&#xD;
           diabetic). These will be used to calculate the Charleston Comorbidity Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family medical history: CVD before age 60 years, diabetes, CKD, ESKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All current medication including over the counter preparations and supplements/herbal&#xD;
           preparations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaccination status for influenza and pneumococcus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior laboratory results, especially prior serum creatinine results to enable analysis&#xD;
           of trend in eGFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The above data will be recorded on a questionnaire that participants will be asked to&#xD;
           complete at or prior to the baseline study visit. Questionnaires will be checked by&#xD;
           research staff at the study visit and participants will be assisted in completing the&#xD;
           questionnaires if required. Details of the medical history and blood results will be&#xD;
           verified by inspection of participants' hospital medical records.Quality of Life and&#xD;
           Functional Status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life will be measured by EQ-5D-5L quality of life questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional status will assessed using the Karnofsky score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current symptoms will be assessed using an Palliative Outcome Scale (POS) questionnaire&#xD;
           (POS-Renal P7)&#xD;
&#xD;
