  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) is a severe, chronic debilitating disease with a variable and&#xD;
      incomplete response to current treatments. Existing immunological studies have found&#xD;
      dysregulation in the TH17:Treg axis with an increase in inflammatory mediators including&#xD;
      TNFalpha, IL-17 IL-23 (amongst others) in lesional skin. Multiple cell typesincluding CD4+&#xD;
      cells, dendritic cells and macrophages infiltrate active lesions of HS and produce this major&#xD;
      contribution from the Th17 axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main barriers to the development of novel and effective treatments for HS is the&#xD;
      lack of biomarker(s) of disease activity, as well as our incomplete understanding of the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of this disease. Given the pronounced contribution of Th17 pathway (including&#xD;
      interleukin-23) in the inflammation in HS, further investigation into the role of this axis&#xD;
      in the pathogenicity of HS is essential. Guselkumab is a fully human interluekin-23&#xD;
      antagonist, FDA approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis in participants 18&#xD;
      years and over. Guselkumab is a novel potential therapy.&#xD;
