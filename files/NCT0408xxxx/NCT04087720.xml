  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, multicenter study of pegloticase in adult participants with uncontrolled&#xD;
      gout who have undergone kidney transplantation. Approximately twenty participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Study duration will be approximately 41 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of pegloticase in kidney&#xD;
      transplant participants with uncontrolled gout refractory to conventional urate lowering&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

      This is a multicenter study of pegloticase in adult participants with uncontrolled gout who&#xD;
      have undergone kidney transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design will include: 1) a Screening Period, lasting up to 35 days; 2) a 24-week&#xD;
      treatment period which includes an End-of-Study (Week 24) /Early Termination Visit; 3) a&#xD;
      safety follow-up phone/email Visit 30 days after the last infusion; and 4) a 3 month&#xD;
      post-treatment follow up visit.&#xD;

    <measure>Proportion of serum uric acid responders (sUA &lt;6 mg/dL) during Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Serum uric acid (sUA) responders are defined as participants achieving and maintaining sUA &lt;6 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time during Month 6 (Weeks 20, 21, 22, 23, 24).</description>

    <description>Serum uric acid (sUA) responders are defined as participants achieving and maintaining sUA &lt;5 mg/dL for at least 80% of the time during Month 6 (Weeks 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) pain score from baseline to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ pain visual analog scale (VAS) is a measure of pain on a continuous 100 point scale. Participants were asked to indicate how much pain they had in the past week as a result of their illness by placing a vertical mark on a horizontal line from 0 (no pain) to 100 (severe pain). A score from 0 to 3 is obtained based on the location of the participant's mark.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in Heath Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score from baseline to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ-DI is a self-reported assessment of how the participant's illness affects their ability to function in their daily life over the past week. The HAQ-DI for a participant is calculated as the mean of the following 8 category scores (range: 0 to 3): Dressing and Grooming, Arising, Eating, Walking, Hygiene, Reach, Grip, and Activities. A lower score demonstrates less disability.</description>
