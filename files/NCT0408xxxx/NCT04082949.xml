  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic periodontitis is an inflammatory and polymicrobic disease characterized by the&#xD;
      irreversible loss of alveolar bone and connective tissue attachment of the teeth. Chronic&#xD;
      periodontitis is the most prevalent type of periodontitis and it is seen in the great&#xD;
      majority of the adult population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of periodontal treatment is to heal the inflammatory tissue, to eliminate&#xD;
      unhealthy periodontal pockets, and to reduce the number of pathogenic bacteria. The&#xD;
      traditional treatment of chronic periodontitis is debridement performed with hand tools and&#xD;
      ultrasonic devices. However, in deep pockets, which are difficult to access, mechanical root&#xD;
      surface debridement is not sufficient to remove the biofilm via root instrumentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The regeneration of the periodontium aims at the reconstitution of the periodontal ligament,&#xD;
      alveolar bone, and cementum. Platelet concentrates have gained popularity in regenerative&#xD;
      periodontal therapy due to their autologous nature. Their regenerative potential is&#xD;
      associated with growth factors such as TGFβ-1, PDGF, EGF, IGF-I, and VEGF, stimulate cell&#xD;
      proliferation and regulate matrix remodeling and angiogenesis. Growth factors are naturally&#xD;
      occurring proteins that regulate cell growth and development. They also modulate cell&#xD;
      proliferation, migration, extracellular matrix formation and other cellular functions in&#xD;
      epithelization. In addition, some growth factors may function as cell differentiation&#xD;
      factors. These functions of the growth factors support epithelization following surgical&#xD;
      periodontal treatment and reduce postoperative pain and swelling with their anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties. Furthermore, studies have reported their antibacterial potentials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different platelet concentrates such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet-rich fibrin&#xD;
      (PRF) are obtained when whole blood is centrifuged at different speeds and for different&#xD;
      durations. When the literature is reviewed, it is seen that these platelet concentrates are&#xD;
      frequently used in regenerative therapies in dentistry. In 2010, Sohn et al. obtained&#xD;
      autologous fibrin glue (AFG), an injectable platelet concentrate, by centrifuging venous&#xD;
      blood for two minutes in a special centrifuge device (Medifuge, Silfradent, Italy; 2400-2700&#xD;
      rpm). AFG is used, by mixing it with bone grafts, in the production of sticky bone, which&#xD;
      could be an alternative to titanium mesh and bone block procedures that enable grafts to&#xD;
      remain more stable in defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was found in the literature review that studies on AFG, which is a second-generation&#xD;
      platelet concentrate, are limited in number. It was also found that these studies were&#xD;
      conducted on sticky bone, obtained by mixing AFG with bone grafts, and there are no studies&#xD;
      in which AFG is used alone to treat periodontal diseases. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of AFG, an injectable platelet concentration, on clinical parameters&#xD;
      in the nonsurgical treatment of chronic periodontitis.&#xD;

      This randomized controlled clinical study included patients diagnosed with moderate/severe&#xD;
      periodontitis who applied to the Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Inonu&#xD;
      University. Written consent was received from each patient. Approval was obtained from the&#xD;
      Malatya Clinical Research Ethics Committee for our study, which was designed in compliance&#xD;
      with the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two random split-mouth groups were formed among the patients. One side of each patient's&#xD;
      mouth was administered AFG following SRP (test group), while the other side of the same&#xD;
      patient's mouth was administered a placebo drug (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following periodontal parameters were evaluated in all patients before and after SRP at&#xD;
      the 1st, 3rd, and 6th months: probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), plaque&#xD;
      index (PI), gingival index (GI), and bleeding on probing (BOP) index. Measurements were&#xD;
      performed using a Williams probe (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA) for all teeth except for the&#xD;
      third molars, in 4 regions (mesiobuccal, midbuccal, distobuccal, midlingual) for PI and GI&#xD;
      and in 6 regions (mesiobuccal, midbuccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual, midlingual,&#xD;
      distolingual) for PD, CAL, and BOP. Clinical attachment level was measured from the&#xD;
      enamel-cement border. Following the initial measurement, the regions with ≥5 mm pocket depth&#xD;
      were determined. Measurements were performed only in these regions in the 1st, 3rd, and 6th&#xD;
      months. The initial pocket depth was considered within two subgroups as regions with 5-6 mm&#xD;
      pocket depth and regions with ≥7 mm pocket depth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous blood from each patient (9 mL) was transferred into a tube without any anticoagulant.&#xD;
      Following the protocol recommended by Sohn et al., the venous blood collected in the tube was&#xD;
      centrifuged in a special centrifuge machine (Medifuge, Silfradent, Italy). The AFG at the top&#xD;
      of the tube was collected using an injector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonsurgical periodontal treatments of the patients were completed in two sessions by a&#xD;
      periodontology expert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first session, the supragingival calculus was removed, and patients were given oral&#xD;
      hygiene training and encouragement. In the second session, the SRP procedure was performed&#xD;
      under local anesthesia in the regions in which there were periodontal pockets of ≥5 mm in the&#xD;
      quadrants considered as the control and test groups. The test group was administered AFG&#xD;
      using a blunt dental injector in the subgingival region, as an adjunct to SRP, while the&#xD;
      control group was administered the placebo.&#xD;
