    <textblock>
      The method of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) which was introduced in 2002 by&#xD;
      Alain Cribier et al. has offered new prospects for patients with severe aortic stenosis and&#xD;
      multiple comorbidities, for whom surgical procedures are associated with exceedingly high&#xD;
      operative risk (1,2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomized multicenter PARTNER trial (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter valve Trial)&#xD;
      proved that TAVI is an alternative for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for high-risk&#xD;
      patients.TAVI is characterized by similar mortality and results in terms of reducing the&#xD;
      symptoms of stenosis (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current recommendations by the European Society of Cardiology in the Guidelines on the&#xD;
      management of valvular heart disease (4) are that TAVI should be carried out in patients with&#xD;
      a life expectancy &gt;1 year, who deemed inoperable or high-risk by a cardiac surgeon and who&#xD;
      are likely to gain improvement in quality of life. (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the complications based on the consensus of experts (the Valve Academic Research&#xD;
      Consortium-2 (VARC-2 criteria)) is Conduction defect (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanical interaction of the prosthesis stent frame with the conduction system and left&#xD;
      bundle branch may lead to a high degree of or complete AV block and to left bundle branch&#xD;
      block (LBBB) after TAVI.(7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiology of new conduction abnormalities has not yet been elucidated. A number of&#xD;
      studies indicate that both patient and procedure related factors such as septal wall&#xD;
      thickness, non-coronary cusp thickness, pre-existing RBBB, depth of valve implantation within&#xD;
      the LVOT, post implant prosthesis expansion, and the type of prosthesis play a role , LVOT/&#xD;
      annulus ratio, LVOT/Prosethesis diameter..(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)&#xD;
