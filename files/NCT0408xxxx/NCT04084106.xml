      The overall aim of the project is to fill an important knowledge gap on the ecological&#xD;
      effects of selected antibiotics. The results will be used to guide treatment decisions for&#xD;
      common infections to as much as possible reduce the negative impact on the intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota and consequently the risks of side effect and resistance development during&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims for this study are to determine (1) the composition of intestinal microbiota&#xD;
      and prevalence of resistant bacteria and resistance genes prior to and up to 1 year after&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment, and (2) the relative effects on the microbiota after treatment with&#xD;
      three antibiotics used for lower respiratory tract infections; phenoximethylpenicillin,&#xD;
      amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, or no treatment (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 120 healthy volunteers will be recruited to the study. They are randomised to 5&#xD;
      days' treatment with phenoximethylpenicillin, amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, or&#xD;
      to no antibiotic treatment. Subjects submit faecal samples at eight different time-points; at&#xD;
      the start of the study (before treatment), immediately, one week and 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24&#xD;
      months after completion of the treatment. The samples will be delivered to Scilifelab for&#xD;
      metagenomic sequencing to detect antibiotic resistant genes and analysis of the intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota and to the Microbiology ward for analysis with phenotypic methods (culturomics) to&#xD;
      detect resistant genes and resistant bacteria.&#xD;

      Background: The rationale behind this project is that different antibiotics have varying&#xD;
      effects on the intestinal microbiota, which has clinical implications. To investigate the&#xD;
      relative collateral damage during treatment with different antibiotics a randomized trial is&#xD;
      needed. Repeated sampling during a 1-year period is required to capture prolonged disturbance&#xD;
      and the time to a restored microbiota. To readily examine the antibiotic effects healthy&#xD;
      volunteers are ideal for the study as their microbiota is most likely to be normal at&#xD;
      inclusion. They also have a low risk of encountering other factors during follow-up that will&#xD;
      affect the composition of the intestinal bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The purpose of the study is to determine: (1) composition of intestinal microbiota and&#xD;
      prevalence of resistant bacteria and resistance genes prior to and up to 1 year after&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment, and (2) differences in the microbiota after treatment with antibiotics;&#xD;
      phenoximethylpenicillin, amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid respectively compared to&#xD;
      no treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The study is a conducted within the Department of Infectious Diseases at Uppsala&#xD;
      University Hospital. A total of 120 healthy volunteers will be recruited to the study. They&#xD;
      are randomised to 5 days' treatment with phenoximethylpenicillin, amoxicillin or&#xD;
      amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, or to no antibiotic treatment. Subjects submit faecal samples at&#xD;
      eight different time-points; at the start of the study (before treatment), immediately, one&#xD;
      week and 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after completion of the treatment. Altogether, the&#xD;
      subjects will provide 8 faecal samples during the course of the study. A total of 960 faecal&#xD;
      samples will be collected and analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will submit two faecal samples at each time-point. One sample will be frozen in&#xD;
      DNA-shield and delivered to Scilifelab for analysis of the intestinal microbiota and&#xD;
      metagenomic sequencing to detect antibiotic resistant genes.The other faecal sample will be&#xD;
      delivered to the Microbiology department for analysis with phenotypic methods (culturomics)&#xD;
      to detect resistant genes and resistant bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: The compilation of data and statistics will primarily be descriptive. We will&#xD;
      analyse the intestinal microbiota and the prevalence of resistance genes in the subjects&#xD;
      prior to and immediately after antibiotic treatment, and then monitor the composition&#xD;
      (diversity) of the intestinal microbiota, resistant bacteria and resistance genes 1 week, 1,&#xD;
      3, 6, 12 and 24 months after completion of the treatment. Diversity will be analysed using&#xD;
      metagenomics (shotgun) and is used as a variable to compare the degree of collateral damage&#xD;
      on the intestinal microbiota with different antibiotics, and to compare the intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota before and after antibiotic treatment in the same individual. The diversity of the&#xD;
      intestinal microbiota in faecal sample 1 will constitute the baseline. Targeted statistical&#xD;
      calculations on differences between treatment groups and gender as regards intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota, resistance and side effects will be carried out depending on outcomes, which&#xD;
      cannot be predicted in advance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints and outcomes: The primary endpoint is the diversity and composition of the&#xD;
      intestinal microbiota, the prevalence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in&#xD;
      screening cultures and the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in faeces prior to and&#xD;
      up to 2 year after antibiotic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results may be used as a basis for targeting the choice of antibiotic for pulmonary&#xD;
      infections (pneumonia) towards those antibiotics that have the least risk of disrupting the&#xD;
      intestinal microbiota and leading to resistance.&#xD;
