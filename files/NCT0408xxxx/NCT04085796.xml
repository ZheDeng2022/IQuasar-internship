      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of hospital emergency admissions has dramatically increased in England, by 42%,&#xD;
      over the last 12 years.Qualitative research published between 1990 and 2006 on the patient&#xD;
      experience within the emergency department showed that most patients arrived at the A&amp;E with&#xD;
      the perception that their injury or condition was serious or life threatening and this&#xD;
      perception was often accompanied by physical pain. The situation is one in which patients&#xD;
      feel vulnerable, anxious, stressed and fearful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the UK, nearly a quarter of the people arriving at A&amp;E are over 65 years, older patients&#xD;
      represent a demographic group whose emergency admissions have seen a particularly sharp rise&#xD;
      over the last 12 years, especially patients aged 85 years or older. This entails hospital&#xD;
      staff having to deal in the emergency situation with patients presenting with much more&#xD;
      complex needs associated with co-morbidities and often with less external support than&#xD;
      younger people&#xD;
&#xD;
      Older patients are more prone to feel disorientated in A&amp;E. This can be due to a high&#xD;
      percentage of them presenting with dementia, delirium, delirium superimposed on dementia or&#xD;
      other CSD (Cognitive Spectrum Disorders), and they are also at higher risk of developing&#xD;
      delirium while in the emergency department. Delirium is a common medical problem that is&#xD;
      characterised by changes in cognitive function. When delirium occurs, people are confused.&#xD;
      Its onset is quite sudden, but it usually lasts only for a few days. However, if not&#xD;
      addressed delirium can become a serious complication which can lead to longer length of stay&#xD;
      in hospital and higher mortality. Stress is one of the common triggers for delirium and there&#xD;
      is also some evidence that longer and particularly stressful A&amp;E experiences are associated&#xD;
      with the risk of older patients developing delirium over the following hours .&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been a few published studies exploring the experiences of A&amp;E from the specific&#xD;
      point of view of older patients which report that most of them believe that their symptoms&#xD;
      pose a serious threat to their life or to the control they exert over their lives and that&#xD;
      the attitudes of nurses in A&amp;E are often perceived as indifferent and inattentive, thus&#xD;
      causing a feeling of exclusion and disappointment. Empathy and compassion are perceived by&#xD;
      patients to be the most significant elements of good care in A&amp;E .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compassionate Care is not a new concern for the NHS but following high profile failings&#xD;
      government policies such as the Compassionate Care in the NHS have been introduced, further&#xD;
      emphasising the importance of humanised care . Recent literature has explored different&#xD;
      perspectives, from the poor experiences of care by older people living with frailty which,&#xD;
      has been uncovered by the Francis Report, to the challenges experienced by nurses expected to&#xD;
      deliver compassionate care, who often struggle to align the reality of practice to their&#xD;
      ideals .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cornwell and Goodrich, in a study exploring patients' experiences state: &quot;the presence or&#xD;
      absence of compassion often marks the lasting and vivid memories patients and family members&#xD;
      retain about the overall experience of care in hospital&quot;. This is valid also for patients who&#xD;
      are temporarily confused and/or live with dementia. Projects like the &quot;Dementia diaries&quot;&#xD;
      project, show that people can not only be aware of how they are treated and how they feel&#xD;
      even in the middle of an extremely confused state, but they can also be able to recall this.&#xD;
      Patient satisfaction should be considered a goal in itself; however, the literature also&#xD;
      suggests that patients receiving clear and compassionate communication are more likely to&#xD;
      disclose their symptoms enabling greater understanding of their situation and more accurate&#xD;
      diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evidence from the paragraphs above indicates that an investment in targeted compassionate&#xD;
      communication for older people in A&amp;E could make their care more effective, with the&#xD;
      potential to reduce complications and make healthcare delivery more economically sustainable&#xD;
      for the NHS alongside giving patients and their families a better experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The awareness of the high incidence of stress in A&amp;E, and of the importance of compassionate&#xD;
      care for older people has driven the development of a specific Intentional Compassionate&#xD;
      Communication Intervention (ICCI) within the A&amp;E of a district hospital. The ICCI comprises&#xD;
      proactive communication-focused support to older people. It involves a specific member of&#xD;
      support staff taking responsibility for the ICCI to meet older patients' psychological needs&#xD;
      and relieve their anxieties through talking to them, sharing information with them and&#xD;
      reassuring them when in A&amp;E.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The member of the staff who delivers the ICCI has been a volunteer in the hospital for 6&#xD;
      years and is now a non-clinical member of the Dementia Care Team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The delivery of the intervention gives priority to support older people who are in A&amp;E alone&#xD;
      and to those of them who appear to be cognitively impaired. The aim is to provide patients&#xD;
      who may feel disorientated additional support in order to reduce the anxiety associated with&#xD;
      being in A&amp;E. Using effective communication skills the member of staff demonstrates&#xD;
      compassion and empathy to the older patients whilst they are in a busy A&amp;E department.&#xD;
      Activities may include talking to them, gently re-orientating them if confused, by asking&#xD;
      simple questions while using a friendly and reassuring tone of voice, offering a glass of&#xD;
      water or a cup of tea, maybe a blanket. The member of staff can also try to reassure patients&#xD;
      by enquiring with other staff about the outcome of an examination or about the next step into&#xD;
      the patient's hospital stay when it happens to be too busy or staff is under too much&#xD;
      pressure to be able to communicate with patients promptly and efficiently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      She also holds many hands, because of pain or because of fear. She purposefully uses a sense&#xD;
      of humor to prompt a smile or a quick laugh. If words are not helpful (because the cognitive&#xD;
      impairment is too severe, for example) she might play some music using an I-pad or bringing&#xD;
      some soft toys for patients to cuddle. What lays at the basis of this intervention is the&#xD;
      meeting between two human beings whereas one of them is in pain (psychological and often also&#xD;
      physical) and the other one somehow &quot;feels&quot; that pain and has a genuine wish to relieve it.&#xD;
      The ICCI is totally person-centered and does not rely on any particular technique, rather it&#xD;
      is exclusively based on a shared, deeply human drive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 2017 systematic review of literature by Sonic et al. highlighted that most recent studies&#xD;
      of patient experiences at A&amp;E are quantitative and use methods such as surveys or interviews,&#xD;
      concentrating on judgments of patients after their A&amp;E visit. A few qualitative studies have&#xD;
      been carried out. Baraff et al. in 1992 showed that patients are very concerned about losing&#xD;
      autonomy and independence, and Olthuis et al. in 2014 showed that during the A&amp;E stay&#xD;
      patients not only have to deal with their disorder, its consequences, and the situation they&#xD;
      are in, but they are also continuously troubled by all kinds of matters. They found that it&#xD;
      is a struggle for them to admit that something is wrong with them, to trust the health care&#xD;
      professionals, to endure waiting periods, to have a blood sample taken, to undress, to deal&#xD;
      with their relatives and reassure them, and even to get something to drink or eat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this, we still do not know very much about disorientated patients experiences in A&amp;E.&#xD;
      Considering the above, and that there are studies focusing on the lived experience of older&#xD;
      patients in A&amp;E but currently no published studies that focus on the experience of&#xD;
      Intentional Compassionate Care Interventions (ICCI) within A&amp;E, improved understanding of the&#xD;
      lived experience of patients with regards to the provision of ICCI within A&amp;E would be of&#xD;
      great value in nursing; particularly considering that the experience of older people in A&amp;E&#xD;
      is often characterized by discomfort, fear, and pain, and can trigger disorientation and&#xD;
      confusion. Moreover, people with Dementia or other cognitive impairments have a unique&#xD;
      contribution to make in research. Hearing their voices can help people see the A&amp;E experience&#xD;
      from their point of view, contributing to fight the assumptions and the stigma often&#xD;
      associated with such a diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the UK, nearly a quarter of the people arriving at A&amp;E are over 65 years and older&#xD;
      patients represent a demographic group whose emergency admissions have seen a particularly&#xD;
      sharp rise over the last 12 years . The experience of older people in the A&amp;E is often&#xD;
      characterised by discomfort and anxiety. Stressful experiences may represent a possible&#xD;
      trigger for delirium, a common and significant complication between older hospital patients&#xD;
      which can affect the following course of recovery and the overall hospital length of stay.&#xD;
      There is some evidence that longer and particularly stressful A&amp;E experiences are associated&#xD;
      with the risk of older patients developing delirium over the following hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compassionate care seems to reduce patient anxiety and studies conducted in A&amp;E show that&#xD;
      empathy and compassion are the most significant elements of good care for older patients in&#xD;
      A&amp;E.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the research will contribute to a deeper understanding of older potentially&#xD;
      disoriented patients' lived experiences of being in A&amp;E and receiving an A&amp;E based ICCI. This&#xD;
      study could impact upon NHS consideration of possible new roles in A&amp;E that are responsible&#xD;
      for ICCI and how to make older patients' care more effective and sustainable, and give this&#xD;
      patient group a better experience and outcome. Including people living with dementia or&#xD;
      experiencing other cognitive disorders in the study is not only a way to improve their care,&#xD;
      but also a way of valuing their contribution to society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks/Benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study participants will have the opportunity to reflect on their experience of&#xD;
      being in A&amp;E, on their emotional needs and if and how these were met during their period in&#xD;
      A&amp;E. Reflecting and acknowledging our need for human connection and meaningful interactions&#xD;
      raises our awareness and this can translate into a benefit for these participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment of patient participants for interview may include those living with dementia&#xD;
      or other cognitive impairments and it is recognised that they represent a vulnerable&#xD;
      population. However, only those who have been identified as being able to give informed&#xD;
      consent by a registered health care professional member of the Dementia Care Team, will be&#xD;
      invited to participate to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher will remain sensitive to any sign of distress during the interview and suspend&#xD;
      or stop their participation if indicated. Taking extra-care when interacting with vulnerable&#xD;
      people is essential, however, excluding patients living with dementia from participation in&#xD;
      research interviews could represent a form of discrimination, as their voice would seldom be&#xD;
      heard in research and by the services they use. Lack of capacity can make people with&#xD;
      dementia particularly vulnerable to discrimination and this is also valid for their&#xD;
      participation to research. Under the Mental Capacity Act a person is presumed to be able to&#xD;
      make their own decisions &quot;unless all practical steps to help them to make a decision have&#xD;
      been taken without success&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1-To gather rich, evocative accounts of older patients aged 65 years and over -who may have&#xD;
      felt disorientated in the Accident and Emergency department (A&amp;E) of a district hospital and&#xD;
      who received an Intentional Compassionate Communication Intervention (ICCI) about their&#xD;
      personal experience of the A&amp;E;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end point will be the completion of the qualitative analysis of transcripts from&#xD;
      patients' interviews when enough rich data to answer the research questions have been&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a qualitative study whose aim is to explore the lived experience of a sample of older&#xD;
      patients (65 years and over) who may have felt disoriented in the A&amp;E of a district hospital&#xD;
      and who received an ICCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), in-depth interviews will be carried out&#xD;
      with up to 15 patients and the data created from the transcripts will be analysed&#xD;
      thematically.&#xD;
