  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, open label, 2-group, 4-period cross-over study in adult closed system ENDS&#xD;
      consumers designed to evaluate puff topography parameters with use of JUUL ENDS products&#xD;
      (Virginia Tobacco, Menthol, Mint, and Mango flavors, each at 5% and 3% nicotine strengths).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who successfully complete screening procedures, including a brief trial with each of&#xD;
      the JUUL flavors at the 5% strength, will be eligible to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized into one of two (2) groups (Virginia Tobacco and Menthol or Mint&#xD;
      and Mango, each at both nicotine strengths) and to one of four (4) product use sequences&#xD;
      specifying the order for which they will use the assigned products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from the final in-clinic visit, study visits will include two puff topography sessions;&#xD;
      each session will be separated by 2 hours (minimum) after completion of the previous&#xD;
      topography session. Puff topography sessions will include 1 hour of ad libitum product use&#xD;
      according to the subject's usual ENDS product use procedures. A Baseline topography session&#xD;
      will be done using the subject's usual ENDS product to provide context to the JUUL results.&#xD;
      The Baseline session will be followed by a topography session with a JUUL product. Subsequent&#xD;
      clinic visits will include two different JUUL products: (1) The JUUL product used during the&#xD;
      current study period and (2) The JUUL product for the next study period. The final in-clinic&#xD;
      visit will only include one puff topography session with the JUUL product used during the&#xD;
      final study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Puff topography measurements will be collected with a Clinical Research Support System&#xD;
      (CReSS) device. Subjects who present with a preferred ENDS product that is not compatible&#xD;
      with adapters fitting the CReSS device will participate in the 1 hour product use session&#xD;
      without using the CReSS device. The weight of the product (pod/cartomizer without the&#xD;
      battery; resolution of 0.1 mg) will be measured before and after use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete subjective effects questionnaires (Product Liking and PES) after&#xD;
      completion of each topography session. The subjective effects questionnaires and product use&#xD;
      data will be used to assess potential factors that might impact the puff topography&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of required study events at each clinic visit, subjects will be discharged&#xD;
      with a 7-day supply of the appropriate JUUL product and with instructions that the provided&#xD;
      product is the only tobacco/nicotine containing product that they are to use, and to reach&#xD;
      out to the clinic if it appears that they will run out of JUUL products before the next&#xD;
      clinic visit. Subjects will be also be asked to complete an at-home product use log each day&#xD;
      until returning to the clinic.&#xD;
