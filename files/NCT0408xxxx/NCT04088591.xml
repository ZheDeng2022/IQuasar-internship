    <textblock>
      This feasibility study serves to determine if it is possible to perform a powered randomized&#xD;
      control trial of high-dose intravenous vitamin C (ascorbic acid) as an adjunctive medication&#xD;
      in the management of sepsis and septic shock in Rwanda. Further data will be collected&#xD;
      including Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Universal Vital Assessment (UVA)&#xD;
      score, duration of vasopressors, mortality and other key indicators to possibly determine the&#xD;
      impact of vitamin C on organ failure and clinical course. A total of 24 patients with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock will be recruited after obtaining informed consent at the&#xD;
      University Teaching Hospital of Kigali (CHUK) and will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to&#xD;
      receive drug or placebo. Both treatment arms will receive standard treatment (intravenous&#xD;
      fluids, antibiotics, vasopressors as needed, etc.) in addition to study drug or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the study, any difficulties encountered will be recorded and will inform&#xD;
      process improvements for a full randomized control, if it is indeed considered possible to&#xD;
      perform the definitive trial.&#xD;

      General objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will primarily determine if it is possible to perform a powered randomized control&#xD;
      trial of the administration of intravenous high-dose vitamin C for the treatment of sepsis or&#xD;
      septic shock in the tertiary care setting in Rwanda. Additionally, the study will also&#xD;
      attempt to assess any impact vitamin C has on morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility study will determine the possibility of and any difficulties encountered&#xD;
      with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Storage of vitamin C solution&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtaining informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmaceutical preparation of vitamin C for intravenous administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Protection of Vitamin C solution from light during administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nursing acquisition of vital signs during course of administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acquisition of key labs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retrieval of data from patient chart for analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the study will be feasible. We also believe that a difference indicating&#xD;
      benefit will be seen when comparing the patients receiving the study drug compared to placebo&#xD;
      in such key areas as hospital length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation or&#xD;
      vasopressors, and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study is the determination of the feasibility of performing a&#xD;
      randomized control trial of high-dose intravenous vitamin C in the management of septic&#xD;
      shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board approval will be sought at he University of Rwanda College of&#xD;
      Medicine and Health Sciences (UR CMHS), at the study site University Teaching Hospital of&#xD;
      Kigali (CHUK), and at Virginia Commonwealth University. This feasibility study will be&#xD;
      carried out in a double-blind randomized control trial format. The clinical trial will be&#xD;
      registered with ClincalTrials.gov and with the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry (PACTR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients admitted to the emergency department, medicine ward, surgery ward, obstetrics&#xD;
      and gynecology ward, and intensive care unit (ICU) at CHUK will be screened by study&#xD;
      personnel for possible inclusion on weekdays from 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. Patients will be&#xD;
      screened for sepsis or septic shock with the following criteria to determine if they are&#xD;
      eligible to participate in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Presence of organ dysfunction brought on by sepsis. This defined by an increase of two&#xD;
           or more points in the qSOFA score&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Strong suspicion or confirmation of infection If a patient meets both of these criteria,&#xD;
           informed consent will be sought from the patient-if the patient is not able to consent,&#xD;
           consent will be obtained from family members of the patient (further details of informed&#xD;
           consent addressed below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If informed consent is obtained, the patient will receive either intravenous placebo or&#xD;
      intravenous vitamin C. Placebo will be 50ml of 5% dextrose in water and will be administered&#xD;
      4 doses per day over a total duration of 96 hours. The study drug will be obtained from&#xD;
      McGuff Pharmaceuticals (Santa Ana, California, USA) and will be intravenous vitamin C&#xD;
      (ascorbic acid) 200mg/kg/day divided over 4 doses and delivered in 50 ml of 5% dextrose and&#xD;
      water over a total duration of 96 hours. In order to properly store and prepare the study&#xD;
      drug, assistance will be sought from pharmacy at CHUK and the manufacturer's instructions&#xD;
      will be followed. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive study drug or&#xD;
      placebo using Research Randomizer. Both placebo and study drug will be administered in&#xD;
      shrouding material to protect the ascorbic acid and to preserve blinding. The study drug will&#xD;
      be administered within two to four hours of diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both arms will receive the standard of care regarding intravenous fluid&#xD;
      resuscitation, but the antibiotic regimen will be altered from the standard of care (but the&#xD;
      regimen will be the same in both trial arms). The standard of care for sepsis and the&#xD;
      standard of care in prior studies that assessed high-dose intravenous vitamin C in sepsis and&#xD;
      septic shock is prompt infusion of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and prompt infusion&#xD;
      of intravenous fluids. Sepsis still tends to be treated with ceftriaxone (with or without&#xD;
      metronidazole) at CHUK yet very high levels of resistance have been shown.15 Therefore, for&#xD;
      patients who participate in this study, the empiric antibiotic will be meropenem (with or&#xD;
      without anti-tuberculosis and antimalarial drugs if indicated) and pharmacy will coordinate&#xD;
      with this study to ensure meropenem is available at all times. In the event a patient is&#xD;
      unable to afford meropenem, this will be covered by the study (this has now been added to the&#xD;
      budget). Regarding intravenous fluid resuscitation, in prior studies of high-dose intravenous&#xD;
      ascorbic acid, prompt administration of high-volume intravenous normal saline was employed;&#xD;
      however, it has been shown that this mode of fluid resuscitation results in a greater&#xD;
      mortality compared to standard of care in a randomized controlled trial in sub-Saharan Africa&#xD;
      reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2017.16 Therefore, the&#xD;
      standard of care in terms of intravenous fluid resuscitation in Rwanda will not be altered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to administration of the vitamin C, the patient's blood will be drawn and collected in&#xD;
      order to assess the following values: creatinine, total bilirubin, white blood cell count,&#xD;
      platelet count, PaO2, lactate, and ascorbic acid level and these labs will be drawn at 24,&#xD;
      48, 72, and 96 hours, with the exception of plasma ascorbic acid level, which will be drawn&#xD;
      at enrollment and at 24 hours. Glasgow Coma Scale score, respiratory rate, and blood pressure&#xD;
      will be measured at enrollment and at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. When a patient with diabetes&#xD;
      is enrolled, venous samples must be drawn to assess glucose levels-fingerstick blood glucose&#xD;
      levels have been shown to be not accurate for patient with hyperglycemia. Of note, neither&#xD;
      the patients nor their family members will be responsible for payment for the laboratory&#xD;
      assays and these will all be funded by this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety profile of high-dose ascorbic acid has been well verified and side effects have&#xD;
      been shown to be minimal. A metanalysis of five clinical trials of high-dose intravenous&#xD;
      vitamin C, which included the studies performed by Fowler et al. and Zabet et al.&#xD;
      demonstrated that no adverse reactions occurred in the 76 patients who received high-dose&#xD;
      intravenous vitamin C. In the study performed by Nathans et al., 301 patients received&#xD;
      high-dose intravenous vitamin C and no adverse events were reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ascorbic acid package insert from McGuff Pharmaceuticals indicates that possible adverse&#xD;
      reactions include oxalate nephropathy, hemolysis in patients with glucose-6-phosphate&#xD;
      dehydrogenase deficiency, and pain and swelling at the infusion site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there is a theoretical risk of hyperoxaluria and oxalate nephropathy, this has not been&#xD;
      seen in clinical trials of high-dose intravenous vitamin C; yet, patients with a history of&#xD;
      kidney stones will be excluded. The study participant will have his/her renal function&#xD;
      monitored daily during the study period. Patients with a known history of&#xD;
      glucose-6-phosphatase-dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency will be excluded and every patient will&#xD;
      have his/her hemoglobin measured daily. Patients will be monitored for pain and swelling at&#xD;
      the infusion site and if this occurs the infusion will be stopped, a cold compress will be&#xD;
      applied, and the infusion will be restarted at 50% of the prior rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While it is not likely that an adverse reaction will occur, in the event an adverse reaction&#xD;
      occurs, the study recruiter/coordinator will stop the infusion, notify the PI immediately,&#xD;
      and complete an incident report form (included in the IRB application packet) will be&#xD;
      completed. The incident report sheet will be available in all clinical care areas where the&#xD;
      patient may receive intravenous high-dose ascorbic acid (e.g., internal medicine ward,&#xD;
      intensive care unit, etc.). If the adverse event occurs outside the study&#xD;
      recruiter/coordinator's work hours, the in-charge nurse will perform these duties. The&#xD;
      UR-CMHS IRB and other IRBs will be notified of the event as well.&#xD;

      Feasibility double-blind randomized control trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key metrics as per above, including SOFA and UVA scores and laboratory values, will be&#xD;
      recorded in the patient's chart by nursing or study personnel and will be entered into REDCap&#xD;
      (a secure web-based application for storage and management of data) at the time of patient&#xD;
      discharge or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted from November 2019 until 24 patients have been recruited and&#xD;
      complete the study-it is expected that the study will conclude in November 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size will be 24 patients, with 12 patients in the treatment arm of the trial and&#xD;
      12 patients in the placebo arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients or surrogate decision maker (in the event of patient's incapacity to make decisions&#xD;
      and provide consent, in most circumstances family members) will be fully informed of all&#xD;
      risks and benefits of participating in the trial. Risk of intravenous high-dose vitamin C&#xD;
      have been shown to be minimal. The decision maker will be informed that the patient may&#xD;
      receive placebo or study drug. The informed consent form will be available in both English&#xD;
      and Kinyarwanda and if the decision maker is illiterate the form will be read to him or her.&#xD;
      All questions will be answered in full.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study we will make sure that the privacy and confidentiality of participants are&#xD;
      respected. All research team members will avoid discussing sensitive information concerning&#xD;
      individuals where they may be overheard or leave individual's information, either on paper or&#xD;
      on computer screens, where they can be seen by other patients/subjects, unauthorized health&#xD;
      care staff or the public.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding data collection and storage, the investigator will create a dataset key and assign&#xD;
      a unique identifier to each patient selected for chart review for recording individual&#xD;
      patient study data. Resultant study data will therefore be de-identified and will then be&#xD;
      stored electronically in password protected files on an encrypted computer. The PI will be&#xD;
      responsible for overseeing data management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be accessible only by the research team, overseen by the Principal Investigator,&#xD;
      who will possess passwords and keys to enter. Only de-identified data untraceable to study&#xD;
      participants will be retained after study completion by the study investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, only the named study investigators will have access to the de-identified data.&#xD;
      De-identified data may be shared with the health facility leadership and regulatory bodies as&#xD;
      may be required for oversight.&#xD;
