  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The question proposed by this study, is one of patient outcomes. Does intraoperative&#xD;
      injection of Exparel decrease postoperative use of opioid pain medications in patients&#xD;
      undergoing thyroid and parathyroid surgery? The trial seeks to assess the effect that Exparel&#xD;
      has on postoperative pain control.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be identified in clinic as good candidates for surgical intervention based on&#xD;
      current standard of care. Once participants are consented, they will be randomly placed into&#xD;
      one of three categories. The first category being patients undergoing surgery with local&#xD;
      injection of lidocaine and epinephrine as is current practice. The second category of&#xD;
      patients will undergo surgery with local injection of bupivacaine HCL and epinephrine&#xD;
      preincision. The third group will undergo surgery with local injection of lidocaine and&#xD;
      epinephrine preincision and Exparel postincision. As stated above, all patients will undergo&#xD;
      surgery as planned, which will be standard of care, with the exception of the local&#xD;
      anesthetic and timing of the injection. Postoperatively, patient's pain scores and opioid&#xD;
      usage will be evaluated. Patients will be monitored by either using the patient's electronic&#xD;
      medical record or by a pain journal that will be provided to the patients. The patients will&#xD;
      record their pain using a scale of 1-10 with the FACES scale, as well as medication usage.&#xD;
      Patients will return to their first postoperative appointment to further discuss their pain&#xD;
      levels as well as medication usage. An ANOVA test will be used to determine if there is a&#xD;
      significant difference in the amount of opioids taken postoperatively, in oral morphine&#xD;
      equivalents, between these three groups. Opioid usage will then be compared between&#xD;
      participants in different categories of local anesthetic to determine if there is an effect&#xD;
      of postoperative opioid usage between different anesthetics.&#xD;

To help with the randomization, the study team will enter the needed patient information into www.randomizer.org, which will categorize the patients into the desired groups.</masking_description>
