  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervix carcinoma is a common malignancy. Radiation therapy still remains a major treatment&#xD;
      for patients with carcinoma cervix. Conventional treatment with radiation therapy includes a&#xD;
      combination of external beam radiation therapy and intracavitary treatment. Low dose rate&#xD;
      intracavitary brachytherapy treatment is already well studied. But high dose rate&#xD;
      brachytherapy is a relatively new alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In brachytherapy, major developments have been made in the integration of 3D imaging and&#xD;
      computerized 3D treatment planning. Medical imaging improvements allowed for better&#xD;
      definition of tumoral volumes and organs at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GYN GEC-ESTRO published recommendations on the 3D imaging for better characterization of&#xD;
      these volumes. Improvements in CT-SCan and lately in RMN had lead to a better definition of&#xD;
      volums of interest (tumor and his extensions and organs at risk : bladder, rectum, sigmoidis,&#xD;
      small bowels). RMN is the imaging standard in the evaluation of tumoral extension in cervix&#xD;
      cancer. However its use is not easy in many brachytherapy departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the feasibility and sparing of organs at risk for high dose rate&#xD;
      brachytherapy if volume delineation is done at each of the two sessions performed with 3D&#xD;
      RMN.&#xD;

      After 60 Gy are delivered with Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), the&#xD;
      brachytherapy in high dose rate will deliver 15 Gy to the CTVhr (high risk CTV) in two&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical examination and an RMN are performed at the end of the external radiation to&#xD;
      evaluate the residual tumoral volume. Two HDR brachytherapy sessions are then performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first session, a CT-Scan and an RMN will be performed after the fletcher&#xD;
      application. A second CT-Scan will be performed during the second treatment session to create&#xD;
      new volumes and to improve organs at risk sparing.&#xD;
