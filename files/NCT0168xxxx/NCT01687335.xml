  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of malnutrition in cancerous patients varies between 50% and 80%. It is&#xD;
      variable in function: the location and the extension of the tumor, of the general state , of&#xD;
      age, of the socio-economic class and the pain. The health consequences of a malnutrition are&#xD;
      very important: aggravation of the state of health, complications of treatment,&#xD;
      hospitalization, alteration of the quality of life and decrease the survival, and the&#xD;
      treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutrition being very important in patients, there are recommendations for the nutritional&#xD;
      care of these patients, formulated by the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and&#xD;
      Metabolism. The investigators do not know to what extent these recommendations are respected&#xD;
      in practice and their influence on the nutritional status and the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore propose to assess the conformity of the nutritional care patients&#xD;
      in clinical practice in relation to the European recommendations and in a second time to&#xD;
      assess the influence of this compliance or non-compliance on the nutritional status clinical&#xD;
      and biological of cancerous patients under chemotherapy, on their quality of life, on their&#xD;
      response to treatment and on their survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will try to identify factors that may be linked to the non-compliance such&#xD;
      as the characteristics of the cancer disease, socio-demographic characteristics of the&#xD;
      subject and the factors related to the structure in which it is supported.&#xD;
