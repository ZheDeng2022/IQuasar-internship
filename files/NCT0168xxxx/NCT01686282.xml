  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be the leading cause of death in the U.S. Americans&#xD;
      have been more concerned about their blood cholesterol levels and dietary cholesterol intakes&#xD;
      rather than their overall cardiovascular health risk factors leading to CVD such as&#xD;
      hypertension, vascular dysfunction, inadequate consumption of fruits and vegetables and&#xD;
      physical activity. Statistics show that approximately 91% of individuals with CVD have&#xD;
      vascular dysfunction which is attributed to endothelial and autonomic dysfunction leading to&#xD;
      increased arterial stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators long-term goal is to provide feasible and effective dietary ways for pre-&#xD;
      and stage 1- hypertensive individuals to normalize their blood pressure (BP), improve&#xD;
      vascular function and thereby reducing their cardiovascular risk and enhancing the quality of&#xD;
      life. Blueberries are a rich source of phenolic compounds and these compounds may play an&#xD;
      important role in promoting cardiovascular health. Considering the strong possibility that&#xD;
      phytochemicals present in blueberry work additively or synergistically, it would be ideal to&#xD;
      investigate the cardioprotective effects of blueberry as a whole. The investigators overall&#xD;
      objective to bring forth evidence that blueberry consumption will reduce BP and&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors including endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, and&#xD;
      autonomic dysfunction in pre- and stage 1-hypertensive postmenopausal women. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that blueberry supplementation will improve vascular function and&#xD;
      will lower blood pressure in postmenopausal women with pre-hypertension. The findings of this&#xD;
      study will provide a foundation for disseminating feasible, safe approaches for preventing&#xD;
      and combating hypertension at its early stage which does not require drug therapy.&#xD;

      The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of 22 grams of freeze-dried blueberry&#xD;
      intake on a daily basis for eight weeks on arterial function and blood pressure in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women with pre- and stage 1-hypertension. The specific aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the extent to which daily consumption of 22 g blueberry drink-mix reduces&#xD;
           blood pressure in individuals with pre- and stage 1-hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether daily consumption of 22 g blueberry drink-mix will improve the&#xD;
           autonomic control of blood pressure and heart rate in individuals with pre- and stage&#xD;
           1-hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To measure serum markers of oxidative stress to determine whether increased antioxidant&#xD;
           defense is in part responsible for blueberry's vascular protective effects.&#xD;
