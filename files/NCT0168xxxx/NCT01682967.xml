    <textblock>
      Headache following accidental dural punction as during epidural analgesia can be severe and&#xD;
      sometimes very disabling. The incidence of PDPH is 10-40%, most starting within 48 h of dural&#xD;
      puncture. Although spontaneous resolution of headaches is common in most patients within 7&#xD;
      days, in 20% can they be persistent and in some very disabling. The exact reason for the&#xD;
      characteristic headache is unknown, but it is believed to be the result of leakage of&#xD;
      cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) from the dural puncture. The greater the leakage of CSF, the more&#xD;
      severe and persistent the headache. This is why larger needles (lower gauge) are known to&#xD;
      have a higher incidence of PDPH. However, the type of needle also seems to play an important&#xD;
      role in the likelihood of PDPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Headache following accidental PDPH is very typical as it increases significantly when sitting&#xD;
      or standing and often disappears completely on lying down. It is typically located in the&#xD;
      back of the head, accentuated by light and often decreases with intake of large quantity of&#xD;
      fluids. In many cases, it is self-limiting and most often decreases with time and bed rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of PDPH is clinical and sometimes difficult. It is well known that liquor leakage,&#xD;
      as following spinal anaesthesia, results in partial loss of unilateral or bilateral hearing&#xD;
      that can be detected by oto-acoustic hearing loss. We plan to use this knowledge and test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that measurement of hearing loss may be a diagnostic method for confirmation of&#xD;
      clinical symptoms and signs of accidental PDPH.&#xD;

      Parturients who have received epidural analgesia during labour would be included in this&#xD;
      study and these would comprise of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. patients without clinical symptoms of postdural puncture headache&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. patients with clinical symptoms of postdural puncture headache&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a control group of parturients who have not received an epidural analgesia would&#xD;
      constitute the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients would have audiometry (oto-acoustic emission - OAE, and auditory steady state&#xD;
      response - ASSR) done following diagnosis of PDPH. Subsequently, the patients would be&#xD;
      observed for 24 h to assess whether the headache resolves spontaneously. A new audiometry&#xD;
      would be done at this stage. Those patients with substantial evidence of PDPH at this stage&#xD;
      would receive an epidural blood patch (EBP) and a new audiometric assessment would be made&#xD;
      after 4 h and 24 h to assess whether any audiometric deficit has resolved or not. All&#xD;
      patients would have a similar measurement of hearing after 3 months when it is believed that&#xD;
      most patients have returned to normal hearing. In addition to audiometric analysis, patients&#xD;
      would be asked to fill out a detailed PDPH questionnaire at the same time periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All measurements would be compared with patients who have received an EDA but without PDPH&#xD;
      and those who have not received an EDA.&#xD;
