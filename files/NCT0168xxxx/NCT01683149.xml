      H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute will be the Sunshine Project Coordinator,&#xD;
      but will not be recruiting locally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to establish a dose of the combination of drugs,&#xD;
      Topotecan and Sorafenib in children. This will be called the maximum tolerated dose. The&#xD;
      chemotherapy in this study is a combination of Topotecan and Sorafenib. The investigators are&#xD;
      trying to find the highest dose of Topotecan and Sorafenib that can be given safely to&#xD;
      children with Refractory or Recurrent Pediatric Solid Malignancies. The investigators will do&#xD;
      this by testing different doses of these drugs in different groups of children. The&#xD;
      investigators will also study how the body processes these drugs.&#xD;

This study will use the (RECIST 1.1) Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors from the NCI for assessment of radiographic response in patients with solid tumors and in order to determine if patients have met off study criteria, i.e. disease progression. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the disease measurement, taking as reference the smallest disease measurement recorded since the start of treatment, or the appearance of one or more new lesions, or evidence of laboratory or clinical progression.</description>
