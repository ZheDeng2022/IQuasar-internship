      This is an open study.approximately 20 patients diagnosed with Borderline Personality&#xD;
      Disorder (in case patient is under drug treatment, treatment should be stable within the&#xD;
      prior 4 weeks before study entry).Starting from the third day, subjects would undergo rTMS&#xD;
      (repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) for five days a week, for four weeks, and will&#xD;
      be clinically evaluated in order to monitor for improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate a significant reduction in symptoms severity at the end of the&#xD;
      treatment compared to study entry.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The symptoms of borderline personality disorder can be treated, but there is no known cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several recent studies have shown that patients suffering from borderline personality&#xD;
      disorder (BPD) express a significant hypoactivity and smaller gray matter concentration in&#xD;
      the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), compared to healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this current study we are attempting to find a better solution for the treatment of&#xD;
      Borderline Personality Disorder using deep Transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS)&#xD;
      technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HBDL coil is intended to induce activation of prefrontal and orbitofrontal brain&#xD;
      structures, including the ACC, in order to induce long term potentiation in this brain&#xD;
      region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol includes bilateral stimulation to the SMA at 110% of the motor threshold of the&#xD;
      Abductor Policies Brevis and at a frequency of 10 Hz. each session is comprised of four&#xD;
      cycles of 3 seconds of stimulation and a 20 seconds recess(Total number of pulses:&#xD;
      1200).approximately 20 patients diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder will&#xD;
      participate. subjects would undergo rTMS sessions for five days a week, for four weeks, using&#xD;
      the HBDL dTMS coil. this coil is capable of producing a magnetic field in deeper parts of the&#xD;
      cerebral cortex, and for that reason we believe that it can produce better clinical outcomes&#xD;
      then superficial TMS coils used in earlier studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (TMS) in treating patients suffering from borderline personality disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main objective is to observe a reduction in the severity of the symptoms post treatment&#xD;
      in comparison to pre treatment, using the zan-bpd as the main outcome measure. Additional&#xD;
      objective is to observe normalizaition of borderline's empathic tendencies: on one hand, we&#xD;
      expect their affective empathy to be compromised post treatment in comparison to pre&#xD;
      treatment. on the other hand, we expect heir cognitive empathy to be increased post treatment&#xD;
      in comparison to pre treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note that on the first day subjects will be randomized to receive sham stimulation or real&#xD;
      stimulation. subject who received real stimulation on the first day will receive sham&#xD;
      stimulation on the second day. Likewise, Subjects who received sham stimulation on the first&#xD;
      day will receive real stimulation on the second day. After receiving stimulation subjects&#xD;
      will perform a facemorph task which evaluates their empathic capabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the 20 day of treatments will be started from the third day.&#xD;

From the third treatment all subjects will recive a real stimulaitiobn: a session of rdTMS includes 4 cycles of 5 minutes of stimulation at a frequency of 10 Hz to the supplementary motor cortex and then a 20 seconds recess.each subject would undergo 5 sessions a week for 4 weeks</description>
