      This study is being done as the doctor investigators would like to lessen the amount of blood&#xD;
      transfusions given to patients. Patients who receive blood transfusions have a greater chance&#xD;
      of developing complications after surgery. There is a device called the Cell Saver that&#xD;
      allows the doctors to process blood that is lost during surgery and return it to the patient.&#xD;
      This lessens the amount of transfused blood the patients receive. This device is not used for&#xD;
      patients undergoing surgery for muscular skeletal tumors.The investigators are not sure&#xD;
      whether tumor cells are present in the blood which is lost during the course of an operation&#xD;
      like yours. The goal of this study is to see if we lessen the amount of blood transfusions&#xD;
      given to patients who may have tumor or cancerous cells present in their blood. One way to do&#xD;
      this is to test the blood that is circulating in your veins and also to test the blood which&#xD;
      is lost during the course of your operation&#xD;

      Allogenic Blood transfusions are associated with numerous complications from simple uticaria&#xD;
      to serious transmissible diseases. While improved testing has significantly decreased the&#xD;
      incidence of AIDS and hepatitis C to approximately 1:2,000,000 units tested; hepatitis B&#xD;
      approximately 1:200,000 units tested, more frequent complications occur secondary to&#xD;
      immunomodulation, which results in making infections more common. These are not due to&#xD;
      infected blood, but develop because of changes in patients' immune system after having&#xD;
      received an allogenic red blood cell transfusion. The relative risk for developing an&#xD;
      infection is 1.6 for 1-3 red blood cell units and 3.6 for patients who receive more than 3&#xD;
      red cell units. Patients who receive transfusions have a 52% greater risk of developing&#xD;
      pneumonia and a 35% greater risk of developing a urinary tract infection. On average,&#xD;
      hospitalization costs $14,000 more for patients with a serious infection. These infections&#xD;
      prolong the length of hospitalization after surgery and may even result in death.2 Other&#xD;
      complications of transfusion include Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury which causes at&#xD;
      least 5300 TRALI reactions per year in the US alone, and approximately 500 deaths. In fact,&#xD;
      just one donor whose blood triggered a TRALI death was found on review of records to have&#xD;
      caused 14 previous cases of TRALI. Other serious complications include Adult Respiratory&#xD;
      Distress Syndrome, and transfusion reactions. As a group, these complications of transfusion&#xD;
      result in increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is in the best interest of&#xD;
      patients to decrease the amount of allogenic blood transfused (from other individuals). To&#xD;
      prevent this, surgeons employ the use of a Cell Saver (CS) during surgery which collects the&#xD;
      patient's own blood from the operative field and washes it. This blood is then re-infused&#xD;
      into the patient's intravenous, minimizing the need for transfusion of blood from the blood&#xD;
      bank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the benefits of the cell saver, it is not used in patients who have malignancy due to&#xD;
      concern that the tumor cells may spread systemically via the blood. Due to the nature of&#xD;
      musculoskeletal tumor resections there is often significant blood loss. Dissection is&#xD;
      regularly through the muscles rather than around muscular intervals, which can result in&#xD;
      significant bleeding. The goal of this study is to determine the presence or absence of tumor&#xD;
      cells in the blood suctioned from the surgical field. Pending the outcome, consideration will&#xD;
      be made to go forward with a second study to determine if cell saver could be used in&#xD;
      patients with malignancy undergoing surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unclear whether tumor cells are present in the blood suctioned from an extremity&#xD;
      malignancy resection. It is also unknown if the processing of blood suctioned would remove&#xD;
      tumor cells from the blood to be transfused. If no tumor cells are found in the blood after&#xD;
      processing then transfusion of this blood would likely be safe. This could result in&#xD;
      decreased blood transfusions in this patient population. This would not only decrease risk to&#xD;
      these patients, it would also improve the blood supply, ensuring that blood is available for&#xD;
      other patients who require it. This work is highly significant as it would both improve&#xD;
      safety in this patient population and improve the blood supply. Data collected will include&#xD;
      the patient's diagnosis, the presence or absence of metastatic disease, whether they have&#xD;
      been previously treated with chemotherapy or radiation and the dates of that treatment.&#xD;
      Patients will undergo surgery and anesthesia in the usual manner. Three sets of specimens&#xD;
      approximately 4mL each would be taken; one from a peripheral line prior to opening the skin,&#xD;
      the second sample will be taken from the surgical field or suction canister during the tumor&#xD;
      resection the third from the surgical field or suction canister shortly before the tumor is&#xD;
      removed. These samples will be taken to Dr. Fitzhugh's laboratory for slide staining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are determined by their surgeon and/or anesthesiologist to require blood will be&#xD;
      administered blood processed by the University Hospital Blood Bank using standard transfusion&#xD;
      protocols. No blood taken from the patient or the operative field will be transfused.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no significant risks in this study. Roughly 2 ml of blood is required for the total&#xD;
      number of slides (2-4) that would be prepared per tube. This amount of blood 12 mL is less&#xD;
      than one tablespoon and does not pose significant risk to the patient nor does it increase&#xD;
      the likelihood of transfusion. Slides will be stained using the Diff-Quik staining method, a&#xD;
      method similar to the Wright-Giemsa staining used in hematology laboratories. The technique&#xD;
      is rapid (requires only 3 minutes per submitted sample) and inexpensive. Slides will be&#xD;
      reviewed by Dr. Fitzhugh.&#xD;
