  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well giving abiraterone acetate and prednisone with or&#xD;
      without dasatinib works in treating patients with metastatic, hormone-resistant prostate&#xD;
      cancer. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy, such as&#xD;
      abiraterone acetate, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Dasatinib may stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not&#xD;
      yet known whether abiraterone acetate and prednisone is more effective than abiraterone&#xD;
      acetate, prednisone, and dasatinib in treating prostate cancer&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the progression-free survival of men with metastatic castration-resistant&#xD;
      prostate cancer treated with abiraterone (abiraterone acetate) plus dasatinib to that of men&#xD;
      treated with abiraterone alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the toxicity profile of the combination, as well as the rate of&#xD;
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, objective responses, and changes in circulating&#xD;
      tumor cell (CTC) numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM A: Patients receive&#xD;
      abiraterone acetate 1000 mg orally (PO) once daily (QD) and prednisone 5 mg PO twice daily&#xD;
      (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive abiraterone acetate and prednisone as patients in arm A. Patients&#xD;
      also receive dasatinib 100 mg PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;
