  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute radiation skin reactions (ARSR) occur in the majority of patients undergoing&#xD;
      postoperative radiotherapy (RT). Some patients experience more severe reactions such as dry&#xD;
      and/or moist desquamation but most patients experience mild reactions e.g. erythema (Lopez et&#xD;
      al., 2005). The radiation dose, volume, RT technique and previous treatment, such as type of&#xD;
      surgery and previous chemotherapy, are factors that might impact on the risk for ARSR&#xD;
      together with patient-related factors such as body mass index (BMI), smoking status and&#xD;
      previous skin damage (Porock et al., 1998; Wells et al., 2004). In a pilot study (n=93) of&#xD;
      the frequency of ARSR in patients with breast cancer who underwent adjuvant RT it was shown&#xD;
      that 93% developed ARSR, mostly mild reactions. Patients reported low scores on pain and&#xD;
      itching (Sharp et al., 2011). Over 80% of the patients reported adherence to the skin care&#xD;
      recommendations which included application of a thin layer of Essex® cream, a non-perfumed&#xD;
      aqueous cream, on the irradiated area at least two times a day (Sharp et al., 2011). The&#xD;
      effects of skin care products containing Calendula Officinalis (marigold plant) on ARSR in&#xD;
      patients with breast cancer were investigated in a randomized clinical trial (Pommier et al.,&#xD;
      2004). Patients in the experimental group, treated with calendula cream had a statistically&#xD;
      significant lower incidence of severe ARSR, pain and treatment interruptions in comparison&#xD;
      with the patients in the control group, treated with trolamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this blinded, randomized clinical trial is to compare two topical agents,&#xD;
      Calendula Weleda® cream and Essex® cream, in terms of efficacy to reduce the risk of severe&#xD;
      acute radiation skin reactions (ARSR) in relation to adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) for breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were instructed to apply a thin layer of the assigned cream twice a day, starting at&#xD;
      the onset of RT and continue until two weeks after termination, or until the ARSR is healed.&#xD;
      The application should include the whole treatment area including the armpit and&#xD;
      shoulder/back area in patients treated with modified radical mastectomy. Patients are also&#xD;
      advised to not apply the cream within two hours before the RT in order to avoid possible&#xD;
      build-up effect. Daily wash with perfume free soap and tap water are recommended and patients&#xD;
      are advised to refrain from use of other topical agents in the irradiated area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the efficacy to reduce acute radiation skin reactions (ARSR),&#xD;
      assessed with the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/The Organization for Research and&#xD;
      Treatment of Cancer Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (RTOG/EORTC scale) at&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include patient reported outcome measures; Quality of Life Questionnaire&#xD;
      (QLQ-C30), Sleep disturbances (MOS-sleep questionnaire) and symptoms experienced from the&#xD;
      irradiated area (visual analogue scale). Patients' experiences and adherence to the topical&#xD;
      agents are also evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 400 patients are required to detect a true absolute reduction in the proportion of&#xD;
      patients with ARSR, from 35% with standard treatment (Essex® cream) to 20% with the&#xD;
      experimental treatment (Calendula Weleda® cream), with a significance level of 5% a power of&#xD;
      90%. With this sample size, 95% confidence intervals for the difference in proportions are&#xD;
      estimated to be in the order of ±10%. Assuming a rate of 5% of non-responders, the target&#xD;
      size has been set to 420 patients.&#xD;
