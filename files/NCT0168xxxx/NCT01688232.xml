      Medical and Scientific Background: Colorectal cancers (CRC) are the leading cancers in both&#xD;
      genders. This cancer is of prognostic severity. The prognosis of this cancer has not been&#xD;
      significantly improved. The treatment of colonic cancer is primarily based on surgery.&#xD;
      Adjuvant chemotherapy is proposed for metastatic cancers (stages III and IV). However nearly&#xD;
      30% of patients with localized cancer (stage II) will present a recurrence. Despite intense&#xD;
      research efforts, no markers of sufficient prognostic value (independent of TNM) are&#xD;
      available to identify this group of patients and justify intensified therapy. The natural&#xD;
      history of cancer involves interactions between the tumor and the immune system of the host.&#xD;
      The immune infiltration at the tumor site may be indicative of host response. We showed that&#xD;
      the density of intratumor memory T cells (CD45RO) and cytotoxic T cells (CD8) in tumor&#xD;
      regions (the core and the invasive margin) influenced the occurrence of early events of&#xD;
      metastasis (tumor emboli) and was strongly associated with prognosis of patients with CRC&#xD;
      (Pagès et al, NEJM-2005). This immune criterion was a better predictor of survival than the&#xD;
      &quot;gold standard&quot; histoprognostic data of tumor invasion (T stage and N) and allowed to&#xD;
      identify a group of patients at high risk of recurrence (*2). The availability of this immune&#xD;
      criterion in clinical practice could improve the prognostic assessment of patients and better&#xD;
      guide the therapeutic. A dedicated platform has been implemented in our hospital to speed up&#xD;
      the transfer of this immune investigation into the clinic. The investigation takes into&#xD;
      account the density of immune cell populations in tumor regions (the core and the invasive&#xD;
      front of the tumor). This methodology has been validated for the markers CD45RO, CD3 and CD8&#xD;
      and leads to the creation of an immune score (&quot;immunoscore&quot; ranging from IO to I4). We&#xD;
      validated the prognostic impact of the immunoscore in a retrospective series of 250&#xD;
      colorectal cancers. The main objective of this multicentric prospective clinical study is to&#xD;
      assess in clinical practice the &quot;immunoscore&quot; and measure its prognostic value. The cohort&#xD;
      study will include 400 patients with CRC stage I to IV (6 centers for inclusion; Paris-HEGP,&#xD;
      Dijon, Bobigny-Avicenne, Besancon, Poitiers, Rouen). Two years of inclusion and a follow-up&#xD;
      of 3 years for each patient will be performed (co-financing for data collection during the&#xD;
      4th and 5th year planned). For each patient, the pathologist of the center will send to the&#xD;
      immunomonitoring platform of HEGP tissue sections from a paraffin block containing the tumor&#xD;
      regions. The investigations will combine a step of immunostaining for CD3, CD8, and CD45RO&#xD;
      (Ventana automate) markers, high-resolution scanning of the stained slides and quantification&#xD;
      of digital images by an imaging module developed by our group from the program of Developer&#xD;
      XD of Définiens company. The immunoscore will be calculated and the score will be correlated&#xD;
      to the clinical data for the relapse and the survival. The secondary objective of this&#xD;
      program is to evaluate the prognostic performance of the immune infiltrate on the biopsies&#xD;
      performed for diagnostic purposes. This study will be conducted on patients of the cohort&#xD;
      whose biopsies were performed in the same hospital than surgery and whose samples are&#xD;
      available in pathology laboratories involved (representing 50% of cases). For the same&#xD;
      patients will be conducted a genetic investigation of the tumor to assess the MSI status, the&#xD;
      presence of a K-Ras and BRAF mutations. This investigation will be performed on tumor&#xD;
      sections from the same tumor block selected for the immunohistochemical analyses. The&#xD;
      sections will be processed by the Department of Biology, Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou.&#xD;
      The prognostic performance of the immune investigations performed on tumor sections and&#xD;
      biopsies will be compared to that of genetic features of the tumor. Finally, a questionnaire&#xD;
      will be sent every six months along the monitoring of the patients to obtain information&#xD;
      concerning (i) the emergence of an immune disorder (such as allergy, autoimmunity,&#xD;
      inflammatory process) and (ii) the psychological status of the patients. The potential impact&#xD;
      of such parameters during the course of the disease on the prediction of the relapse and&#xD;
      survival obtained with the immunoscore performed at the time of surgery will be evaluated.&#xD;
      Expected results : This prospective study is an indispensable step for the clinical&#xD;
      validation of the prognostic value of the immunoscore. The secondary objectives should help&#xD;
      to precise the benefit of a concomitant analysis of the biopsy, the genetic features of the&#xD;
      tumor. The questionnaire should help to identify the clinical parameters to track along the&#xD;
      monitoring&#xD;

      The main objective is to assess the impact of the immunoscore in the clinical practice. To&#xD;
      this end, the immune parameter (CD3, CD8, CD45RO) of colorectal cancers (stage I-IV) will be&#xD;
      evaluated prospectively through a large multicenter study. 400 patients with CRC stage I to&#xD;
      IV will be included (6 centers for inclusion; Paris-HEGP, Dijon, Bobigny-Avicenne, Besancon,&#xD;
      Poitiers, Rouen). The number of patients to be included has been calculated on the basis of&#xD;
      an inclusion period of 24 months, a follow-up of 3 years (a collection of data during the 4th&#xD;
      and 5th year is planned with a co-financing), an expected event rate of 20%, a prognostic&#xD;
      value of the immune parameter similar to that observed in the retrospective study of 399&#xD;
      patients with CRC (*1) and a power of the test of 90%. During both initial management and&#xD;
      follow-up, all therapeutic procedures will be registered (surgery, radiotherapy,&#xD;
      chemotherapy…). Data will be collected from clinical examination, radiological exams and&#xD;
      biological tests that are usually performed during a hospitalization for colorectal cancer:&#xD;
      Full clinical examination and questioning about the presence of personal and family history&#xD;
      of CRC, adenomas and other cancers; Abdominal ultrasound, chest X-ray; Computed tomography&#xD;
      (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) according to clinician's requirement; Standard&#xD;
      laboratory tests and blood assay for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA); The Histopathologic&#xD;
      study of the tumor containing the status of the surgical excision margins, the histological&#xD;
      type of cancer, the level of parietal invasion, the number of lymph nodes examined and the&#xD;
      number of metastatic lymph nodes, according to the TNM classification. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed-up every 3 months during the first 2 years, and every 6 months for the rest of the&#xD;
      follow-up period, as recommended. Each patient will be followed up to 5 years. Clinical,&#xD;
      biological and radiological data will be registered into a specific CRF. Verification of&#xD;
      inclusions and monitoring of data will be conducted by the HEGP Clinical Research Unit (URC&#xD;
      HEGP) and the principal investigator. A plan for data-management will be built in line with&#xD;
      the monitoring. A questionnaire will also be sent to the patients every six month for five&#xD;
      years. This questionnaire was built by Pr F Pagès and by psychologists and psychiatrists to&#xD;
      search for information concerning (i) the presence of an immune disorder (such as allergy,&#xD;
      autoimmunity, inflammatory process) and (ii) the psychological status of the patients (eg.&#xD;
      depression). After monitoring, all data will be stored using a double data entry system in a&#xD;
      MS-Access database designed by the URC-HEGP and in the TME.dB database created by the team of&#xD;
      the principal investigator. The 2 databases will be merged, and the final data base will be&#xD;
      frozen for statistical analysis. Sample preparation: The pathologist of each center will&#xD;
      choose a tumor block containing the core of the tumor and the invasive margin. This tumor&#xD;
      block is part of the tumor samples routinely processed by the department of Pathology for&#xD;
      diagnosis. three tissue sections of 4-microns will be made and deposit on a glass slide to&#xD;
      perform the immunohistochemistry. Four tissue sections of 4-microns will be made and deposit&#xD;
      on an Eppendorf safe lock tubes to perform the genetic analyses. Anonymous patient names on&#xD;
      the slides and tubes will be provided by using a code number and initials of the patient. If&#xD;
      biopsies for diagnostic purposes are available (i.e. those performed for the patients during&#xD;
      their initial hospitalization (50% of cases), A tissue sections of each biopsy will be done.&#xD;
      All slides and tubes will be sent by mail to the HEGP platform for analysis of the immune&#xD;
      infiltrate and to the Biology department for the genetic analyses. The immunoscore will be&#xD;
      determine using the following steps: Immunostainings for CD3, CD8, CD45RO on Benchmark XT&#xD;
      automate; Scanning the immunostainings on Hamamatsu scanner: Quantification of the immune&#xD;
      populations in specific tumor areas (the core and the invasive margin) with a dedicated image&#xD;
      analysis module based on the recognition of histological structures adapted to colorectal&#xD;
      cancer. This module has been developed by our group in connection with the Definiens company.&#xD;
      A semi-automatic procedure allows the quantification of stained cells in each tumor region.&#xD;
      Each region is divided into tiles of 800 microns side (500 to 700 tiles analyzed per tumor).&#xD;
      The density of each marker is calculated using the mean density of the three tiles the most&#xD;
      infiltrated in each tumor region. A categorization into high density (Hi) or low (Lo) for&#xD;
      each marker in each tumor region of interest will be performed. This categorization is done&#xD;
      by comparing the observed density with the optimal cut-off density (min p value approach) we&#xD;
      previously determined for the DFS and OS in a retrospective study of 250 CRC. Genetic&#xD;
      analyses: The tubes containing the sections for the genetic analyses of patients with inform&#xD;
      consent signed for genetic investigation will be transfer to the Department of Biology,&#xD;
      Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou. The % of tumor cells of each specimen will be determined&#xD;
      by a pathologist (based on a H&amp;E evaluation; less than 10%, 10-20%, 20-50%, up to 50% tumor&#xD;
      cells) and the DNA extraction will be performed. Genetic investigation will comprise the MSI&#xD;
      status, the presence of a K-Ras and BRAF mutation&#xD;
