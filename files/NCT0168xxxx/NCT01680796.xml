      This is an open-label phase I study in which dovitinib is given in combination with&#xD;
      bortezomib and dexamethasone. Dovitinib dose escalation is planned in order to determine its&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose when given in this combination.&#xD;

    <description>Determination of the maximum tolerated dose of dovitinib will be based on Treatment Cycle 1 safety data for all subjects for whom all safety assessments during Treatment Cycle 1, as well as the pre-dosing safety assessments performed on Study Day 1 of Treatment Cycle 2, are completed and who do not receive alternate anti-neoplastic therapies during that period.</description>

    <description>Starting with Treatment Cycle 2, response to treatment will be determined during each treatment cycle (Stringent Complete Response (sCR), Complete Response (CR), Very Good Partial Response (VGPR), Partial Response (PR), and Stable Disease (SD)).</description>
