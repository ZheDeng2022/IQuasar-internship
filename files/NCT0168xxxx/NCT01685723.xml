  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Smoking cessation can largely improve cancer prognosis and quality of life among&#xD;
      cancer patients. However, few patients are aware of the importance to quit at the stage, or&#xD;
      they have difficulties to quit by self.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: to examine the effectiveness of a smoking cessation intervention using a risk&#xD;
      communication approach&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Outpatient clinics of the Clinical Oncology Departments of five major hospitals in&#xD;
      different regions of Hong Kong&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject: Smokers who attend medical follow-up visits at outpatient clinics of the Clinical&#xD;
      Oncology Departments of five major hospitals in different regions of Hong Kong and who met&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria were invited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: At baseline, intervention group receives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a face-to-face individualized brief advice based on risk communication for 15-30 minutes&#xD;
           from the nurse counselors;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. examination of exhale CO level; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. a generic standard self-help smoking cessation booklet. They will receive a booster&#xD;
           intervention at 1 week. Control group will receive standard care and a generic self-help&#xD;
           smoking cessation booklet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome: Primary outcome is the self-reported 7-day point prevalence quit rate at 6-month&#xD;
      follow up. Secondary outcomes include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. self-reported 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence at 12-month follow-up;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. biochemically validated quit rate at 6-month follow-up; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. percentage of patients reduced smoking by at least 50% at 6- and 12-month follow-up&#xD;
           compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: This study develops and validates practical smoking cessation interventions&#xD;
      targeted to cancer patients to improve their cancer prognosis and in long-term.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking causes many types of cancer in general. Past studies have shown that current smokers&#xD;
      have increased risk of cancer, and most lung cancers are attributable to smoking. Cancer&#xD;
      (malignant neoplasm) is the number one killer in Hong Kong, which leads to nearly one-third&#xD;
      of all deaths each year. Cancer patients who continue smoking would result in extra risks of&#xD;
      all cause mortality, cancer recurrence and second primary cancer as well as reducing survival&#xD;
      time (Chen et al., 2010). Smoking could also reduce the efficacy of clinical and medical&#xD;
      treatment of cancer including radio- and chemo-therapies (Benninger et al., 1994; Browman et&#xD;
      al., 1993) and increase the risk of treatment related side-effects (Rugg et al., 1990).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer patients may present an excellent &quot;teachable moment&quot; for smoking cessation&#xD;
      interventions, as their current illness could largely be due to smoking. However, few smoking&#xD;
      cessation programs target on this vulnerable group and only one-third of oncology nurses&#xD;
      would assist cancer patients quit smoking. Healthcare professionals have the responsibility&#xD;
      to assist this vulnerable group to quit smoking. Recent randomized controlled trials (RCT)&#xD;
      suggested behavioral intervention may help cancer patients quit smoking, but they are limited&#xD;
      by small sample size. No RCT study has ever been done in Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study can make an important contribution to evidence-based practice by testing the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a smoking cessation intervention using a risk communication approach and&#xD;
      targeting cancer patients. The results primarily serve the purpose to support the development&#xD;
      of clinical practice guidelines and interventions to promote smoking cessation in cancer&#xD;
      patients to improve their cancer prognosis and, in the long-run, increase their survival time&#xD;
      and quality of life.&#xD;

The brief advice will be based on a specifically-designed risk communication leaflet that warns about the risks of continued smoking for subjects' cancer treatment and prognosis.
