      This is a Single blind, prospective, placebo controlled trial in which trauma victims are&#xD;
      randomized to receive an explanation about the first sleep following trauma exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide a baseline prior the explanation, participants will receive a medical and&#xD;
      psychological evaluation. at this point the participants will be given one of two&#xD;
      explanations about sleep. The experimental group will receive an encouragement to deprived&#xD;
      sleep explanation, and the control group will receive an encouragement to sleep explanation,&#xD;
      Lorazepam 1mg will be offered to assist sleep. After two weeks the research assistant or&#xD;
      study psychiatrist will perform behavioral ratings and complete history details pertaining to&#xD;
      PTSD risk factors. Participants will be assessed again by the study psychiatrist or research&#xD;
      assistants at 1 &amp; 3 months. Further assessments might be done at 6 &amp; 13 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will include men and women age 18-70, who have been exposed to an event&#xD;
      meeting the DSM-IV &quot;A.1&quot; criterion for trauma exposure, and who provide written, informed&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be recruited from trauma victims who arrived at the Chaim Sheba&#xD;
      Medical Center Emergency Room.&#xD;
