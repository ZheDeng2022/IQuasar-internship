  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial. Phase I clinical trials test the safety of&#xD;
      an investigational combination of drugs. Phase I studies also try to define the appropriate&#xD;
      dose of the investigational combination of drugs to use for further studies.&#xD;
      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the combination of drugs is still being studied and that&#xD;
      research doctors are trying to find out more about it. It also means that the FDA has not&#xD;
      approved this combination of drugs for AML. As part of this research study, you will take&#xD;
      lenalidomide in combination with MEC. MEC are FDA approved chemotherapy drugs that are&#xD;
      commonly used in the treatment of AML. Lenalidomide is approved by the FDA for patients with&#xD;
      multiple myeloma, and some patients with myelodysplasia. Lenalidomide is considered&#xD;
      investigational in this research study because it is not approved by the FDA for patients&#xD;
      with AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lenalidomide is a drug that affects the immune system, called an immunomodulatory drug or&#xD;
      IMID. This drug is successful in the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma and some&#xD;
      patients with myelodysplasia, a pre-leukemic condition. Other research studies suggest that&#xD;
      lenalidomide may also be effective in patients with AML. Since we know that many patients who&#xD;
      receive MEC chemotherapy alone do not have a prolonged remission (time free from leukemia),&#xD;
      we are studying the addition of lenalidomide to MEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, we are looking for the highest dose of lenalidomide that can be given&#xD;
      safely with MEC.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      After undergoing screening procedures to confirm that you are eligible to participate in the&#xD;
      research study you will be admitted to the hospital. You will likely receive the majority of&#xD;
      treatment on an inpatient basis. You will remain in the hospital for at least Days 4-8 and&#xD;
      will be discharged at the discretion of your study doctor. It is likely that you will be&#xD;
      hospitalized for several weeks due to the risk of infection after chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since we are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be administered safely&#xD;
      without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      AML, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the&#xD;
      study drug. The dose you get will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled&#xD;
      in the study before you and how well they have tolerated their doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you take part in this study you will be given a study drug-dosing calendar. There is only&#xD;
      one cycle of treatment, which will be 28 days long. On Days 1 to 14 you will receive the&#xD;
      lenalidomide orally. On Days 4-8 you will receive MEC chemotherapy: mitoxantrone by IV&#xD;
      (intravenously, into your vein) over 30 minutes, etoposide by IV over one hour, and&#xD;
      cytarabine by IV over one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While on this study you will undergo a daily clinical exam for the first 14 days and then at&#xD;
      least twice a week until your blood counts recover from treatment. A clinical exam consists&#xD;
      of a physical exam, questions about your general health and specific questions about any&#xD;
      problems that you might be having and any medications you may be taking. You will also&#xD;
      undergo blood tests to assess your disease status and determine organ function level. This&#xD;
      will happen daily for the first 14 days and then at least once a week (but up to 3 times per&#xD;
      week) until your blood counts recover from treatment. Additionally a bone marrow&#xD;
      aspirate/biopsy will be completed at the time of blood cell count recovery (usually between&#xD;
      days 20 and 45) and as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to keep track of your medical condition for up to two years after your final&#xD;
      dose of study drug. We would like to do this by getting in touch with you every 6 months to&#xD;
      see how you are doing. Keeping in touch with you and checking your condition helps us look at&#xD;
      the long-term effects fo the research study.&#xD;
