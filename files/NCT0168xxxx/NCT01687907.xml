      The aim of this trial is to find out if active music listening during pregnancy and delivery&#xD;
      reliefs fear of childbirth, pain in delivery, need for analgesia during delivery and if there&#xD;
      is an effect on delivery complications. Also we try to find out if there is any influence on&#xD;
      mother-baby relationship.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Finland fear of childbirth is one of the common reasons for consultation of obstetrician&#xD;
      and motherÂ´s demand on elective caesarean section. Approximately 5-8% of pregnant women&#xD;
      suffer from severe fear of childbirth, which disturbs their family-life and working and&#xD;
      prevents normal preparation to childbirth and parenthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Listening or playing music is very common in all cultures. Even fetuses are able to hear and&#xD;
      recognize music and babies are interested in voices and sounds of music.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Music therapy has been used in other purposes widely. It is known that music stimulates the&#xD;
      synthesis of dopamine in brain and it has been shown that music has an influence on&#xD;
      hypertensive rats, lowering their blood pressure. In human beings there has been pleasurable&#xD;
      responses to music correlate with activity in brain. It has also been shown that music&#xD;
      listening enhances cognitive recovery and mood after middle cerebral artery stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A strong attachment between mother and infant is essential to child's normal developement.&#xD;
      Mothers who suffer from very strong fear of childbirth often have difficulties in&#xD;
      mother-infant relationship and pronounced risk of puerperal depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many features in listening and playing music have something to do in bonding together in&#xD;
      societies. Lullabies are good example of communication between parent and infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been some trials about music therapy and pregnancy but not systematic randomized&#xD;
      trials about listening to music and its influence on pain experience, length of delivery or&#xD;
      complications of delivery. Music has a relaxing influence on human beings and we assume that&#xD;
      it has a positive influence on pregnant women also.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We try to find out if active listening to music has any influence on physical and mental&#xD;
      wellbeing of pregnant women or is there any influence on fear of childbirth, outcome of&#xD;
      delivery or mother-baby relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women referred to the outpatient clinic because of fear of childbirth have also&#xD;
      normal appointments with obstetrician and/or midwife as needed and participating this trial&#xD;
      has no influence on those appointments.&#xD;
