    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is designed to prove the efficacy and safety of Fexinidazole as an oral&#xD;
      treatment for human african trypanosomiasis in advanced stage. The Fexinidazole is compared&#xD;
      to reference treatment NECT. The trial will try to demonstrate that Fexinidazole is not&#xD;
      inferior to NECT treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a life-threatening and neglected disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few treatment options are currently available for stage 2 (meningo-encephalitic stage) HAT,&#xD;
      with NECT being the most commonly used one since 2010. Though NECT represents a significant&#xD;
      improvement over current therapies, it is still far from ideal given the environment in which&#xD;
      HAT patients live (remote, poor areas with little health infrastructure, if any, and&#xD;
      difficult logistics). There is an urgent need for less toxic and more easily manageable&#xD;
      compounds to treat this fatal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fexinidazole is a 2-5-nitroimidazole, formulated for oral administration, which has been&#xD;
      shown to possess in vitro and in vivo activity against both T. b. rhodesiense and T. b.&#xD;
      gambiense parasites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predicted CSF concentrations reached target levels after repeated dosing. Its efficacy and&#xD;
      safety must now be tested in patients with stage 2 HAT.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint is the outcome (success or failure) at the test of cure (ToC) visit 18 months after the end of treatment (EOT) adapted from WHO criteria.&#xD;
Success at 18 months is:&#xD;
Either cure:&#xD;
patient alive,&#xD;
AND with no evidence of trypanosomes in any body fluid,&#xD;
AND 20 or less WBC/µl CSF&#xD;
Or Probable cure:&#xD;
Patient with no parasitological evidence of relapse in blood and lymph&#xD;
AND who refuses lumbar puncture OR whose CSF sample is haemorrhagic without trypanosomes&#xD;
AND whose clinical condition is satisfactory (without clinical symptom or signs) OR whose clinical status is unlikely to be due to HAT</description>
