    <textblock>
      In this first study of inhaled apomorphine in Parkinson's disease patients, the primary&#xD;
      objective is to find the minimum efficacious dose of apomorphine that is useful in rescuing&#xD;
      patients during 'off' periods. Safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of inhaled&#xD;
      apomorphine will be assessed during the study.&#xD;

             Brain Bank Criteria), of at least 3 years duration prior to study entry, who were on&#xD;
             specific and optimised anti-Parkinson medication (levodopa and/or dopamine agonists),&#xD;
             and with motor fluctuations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with a modified Hoehn and Yahr disease severity scoring of between 2 and 4 in&#xD;
             an &quot;on&quot; state.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Men or women aged over 30 years.&#xD;

             incapable of becoming pregnant, including any female who was post-menopausal) or of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential with a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who experienced motor fluctuations with recognisable &quot;off&quot; periods in control&#xD;
             of motor symptoms, as assessed by the motor fluctuation questionnaire (patients were&#xD;
             to have reported at least 1 &quot;Yes&quot; response to the questions in the motor fluctuation&#xD;
             questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient willing and able to comply with study procedures.-&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;

             showing significant clinical symptoms associated with orthostatic hypotension.&#xD;

         13. Patients with persistent elevation of BP, with average systolic readings of 160 mm Hg&#xD;
             or average diastolic readings of 100 mm Hg.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients taking anabolic steroids, traditional antipsychotics (unless low dose), and&#xD;
             antiemetics other than domperidone.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patients taking agents of the 5HT3 antagonist class including ondansetron,&#xD;

             cardiovascular, gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, central nervous system,&#xD;
             pulmonary system, or bone marrow disorders that in the Investigator's opinion&#xD;
             compromised patient safety.&#xD;
