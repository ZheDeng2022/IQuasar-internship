      When babies are sick, or are born prematurely, they sometimes need an endotracheal (ET) tube&#xD;
      to assist their breathing and/or a nasal canula. The investigators must periodically irrigate&#xD;
      the ET tube to prevent them from being plugged up by secretions. The investigators also, due&#xD;
      to the drying effects of nasal canula, periodically moisten the nasal passages of babies.&#xD;
      Presently 0.9% saline is the solution being used for moistening of the ET tube, nose, as well&#xD;
      as oral cares will infant is not eating. However, scientists have recently learned that&#xD;
      saline can destroy the body's natural antibacterial properties in the windpipe, nose, and&#xD;
      mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed a new solution to be used in place of saline for&#xD;
      endotracheal (ET), nasal, and oral cares. The investigators' new solution is patterned after&#xD;
      the natural fluid in the windpipe, nose, and mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients who receive ETCare will have no increase in adverse events related to its&#xD;
           administration, compared with 0.9% saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients who receive ETCare will have a lower proportion of tracheal aspirates where&#xD;
           pathogens are reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients who receive ETCare will have a lower proportion of tracheal aspirates where&#xD;
           leukocytes are reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients who receive ETCare will have fewer (risk-adjusted) days of supplemental oxygen.&#xD;

      Normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride) is used by virtually all neonatal intensive care units&#xD;
      to periodically irrigate the endotracheal tube of neonates who require mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation. This practice is intended to reduce the risk that thick secretions will occlude&#xD;
      the endotracheal tube. Normal saline is also occasionally used to periodically clear the&#xD;
      nasal passages of neonates on nasal CPAP or nasal canula oxygen. It is also occasionally used&#xD;
      as a means of periodically moistening the mouth of neonates who have an endotracheal tube in&#xD;
      place, because the tube prevents lip apposition and results in a dry mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The problem with the current method of using normal saline for periodic endotracheal, nasal,&#xD;
      and/or oral care is that high concentrations of sodium and chloride have recently been found&#xD;
      to rapidly and completely inactivate the natural antimicrobial properties of tracheal&#xD;
      effluent, nasal secretions, and saliva. Tracheal secretions, nasal secretions, and saliva&#xD;
      contain potent antibacterial substances. One such that was recently described is a 37 amino&#xD;
      acid peptide with widespread antimicrobial properties, termed &quot;LL-37&quot;. It has recently been&#xD;
      shown that 0.9% saline inactivates the antimicrobial properties of LL-37 and significantly&#xD;
      damages the overall antibacterial actions of tracheal secretions, nasal secretions, and&#xD;
      saliva. Further research has shown that the high sodium and chloride content of saliva of&#xD;
      patients with cystic fibrosis inactivates the antimicrobial properties, thus partly&#xD;
      explaining the high incidence of airway infections in these patients. Moreover, a family with&#xD;
      deficient LL-37 has been described in Sweden, and these individual all have chronic&#xD;
      gingivostomatitis and airway infections. Therefore, our current practice of instilling 0.9%&#xD;
      sodium chloride likely inactivates the major innate anti-microbial defense system of the&#xD;
      upper airway. Perhaps reducing immune capacity in the upper airway with this practice&#xD;
      unwittingly contributes to the high incidence of upper airway infections among intubated&#xD;
      neonates.&#xD;
