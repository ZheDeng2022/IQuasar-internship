      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of an adherence protocol&#xD;
      intervention among stented patients to improve adherence to antiplatelet therapy (primary&#xD;
      endpoint). Secondary endpoints will assess whether the intervention reduces cardiovascular&#xD;
      events (ACS, stent thrombosis, re- hospitalization and coronary angiography,&#xD;
      revascularization, all-cause mortality) and its cost-effectiveness.&#xD;

      RATIONALE : Acute coronary syndrome is the first cause of mortality in cardiology.&#xD;
      Development of stent and dual antiplatelet therapy have led to important declines in&#xD;
      morbi-mortality. Despite this, the risk of recurrent events and mortality after stent&#xD;
      implantation remains substantial, especially within the first six months. Non-adherence to&#xD;
      antiplatelet therapy is the major modifiable risk factor that expose to adverse outcomes&#xD;
      following stent implantation and has been identified as the major risk factor of stent&#xD;
      thrombosis. Prior interventions to improve medication adherence in cardiovascular populations&#xD;
      have produced mixed results and have not specifically assessed compliance to antiplatelet&#xD;
      therapy in patients treated by stent implantation after acute coronary syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is currently unknown if interventions to improve antiplatelet therapy compliance in the&#xD;
      six month after stenting discharge will improve medication adherence and clinical outcomes or&#xD;
      will be cost-effective&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: investigators propose to assess the effectiveness of a multi-faceted&#xD;
      patient-centered adherence intervention among patients following stent implantation to&#xD;
      improve adherence to antiplatelet therapy (primary aim).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims will assess whether the intervention improve :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cardiovascular events : ACS, stent thrombosis, re - hospitalization and coronary&#xD;
           angiography, new revascularization, all-cause mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD : Investigators propose a six month, mono-site patient-level randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial to evaluate, relative to usual care, a multi-faceted patient-centered intervention to&#xD;
      improve adherence to antiplatelet treatment among stented patients following ACS. The study&#xD;
      will enroll 800 patients to intervention versus usual care for 6 months in one university&#xD;
      hospital (CHU Timone, Marseille, France). The proposed intervention will be based on several&#xD;
      conceptual frameworks (Chronic Care Model and Medication Adherence Model) and adapt elements&#xD;
      of prior successfully adherence interventions, including: collaborative care, patient&#xD;
      education, tailoring of medication regimens, and daily mobile phone short message service&#xD;
      (SMS). The primary analyses will be a comparison of adherence to antiplatelet therapy using&#xD;
      specific laboratory testing of drug effect. Secondary analyses will compare incidence of&#xD;
      clinical endpoints in both groups, cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed. All&#xD;
      analyses will be intention to treat&#xD;
