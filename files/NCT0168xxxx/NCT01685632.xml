      Intra Peritoneal Chemo Hyperthermia (IPCH) is a recently validated option for the treatment&#xD;
      of peritoneal carcinomatosis from colorectal or ovarian origin. This therapeutic program&#xD;
      demonstrated a significant improvement of the late stages (i.e. carcinomatosis) of the&#xD;
      disease. From a clinical point of view, within the first 24 hours after IPCH, patients&#xD;
      undergo a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and therefore require to be monitored in&#xD;
      an intensive care unit. From a metabolic perspective, preliminary data have been shown a&#xD;
      significant &quot;anaerobic style&quot; disturbance of energetic metabolism, suggesting a deep cellular&#xD;
      energetic deficit throughout IPCH process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Putative contradictory effects of IPCH, like the increase of chemotherapy-related cellular&#xD;
      toxicity due to heat and on the other hand the initiation of a stress protein response (heat&#xD;
      shock response) which helps to reduce the cell injuries, leads to conduct a research project&#xD;
      on the underlying mechanisms: consequences, in terms of patient's care and follow-up, are of&#xD;
      high relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal is a multimodal assessment of the IPCH-related cell modifications: signaling&#xD;
      pathways, apoptosis and antitumoral immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment criteria include Heat shock protein expression (blood/cell ratio) compared to&#xD;
      baseline values, apoptosis and immune response before/after IPCH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scheduled sample size is 30 patients having an IPCH and 30 patients contraindicated per&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      Intra Peritoneal Chemo Hyperthermia (IPCH) is a recently validated option for the treatment&#xD;
      of peritoneal carcinomatosis from colorectal or ovarian origin. This therapeutic program&#xD;
      demonstrated a significant improvement of the late stages (i.e. carcinomatosis) of the&#xD;
      disease (survival median &gt; 33 months). IPCH induces morbidity as high as 20% and mortality&#xD;
      less than 4%. From a clinical point of view, within the first 24 hours after IPCH, patients&#xD;
      undergo a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and therefore require to be monitored in&#xD;
      an intensive care unit. From a metabolic perspective, preliminary data have been shown a&#xD;
      significant &quot;anaerobic style&quot; disturbance of energetic metabolism, suggesting a deep cellular&#xD;
      energetic deficit throughout IPCH process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Putative contradictory effects of IPCH, like the increase of chemotherapy-related cellular&#xD;
      toxicity due to heat and on the other hand the initiation of a stress protein response (heat&#xD;
      shock response) which helps to reduce the cell injuries, leads to conduct a research project&#xD;
      on the underlying mechanisms: consequences, in terms of patient's care and follow-up, are of&#xD;
      high relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heat shock protein expression (stress protein response markers) and apoptosis are the main&#xD;
      chosen tools to evaluate IPCH-related cellular consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals of the study Primary goal Multimodal assessment of the IPCH-related cell modifications:&#xD;
      signaling pathways, apoptosis and antitumoral immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary goal Comparative study of Heat shock protein expression, whether IPCH is done or&#xD;
      the patient is recused for the surgery due to intraoperative contraindication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Prospective cohort follow up Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the usual care (surgical debulking and extensive tumoral resection after laparotomy&#xD;
      under general anesthesia), the research protocol includes :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  7 blood samples over 72 hours (meaning less than 40 ml), including 4 samples under&#xD;
           general anesthesia throughout surgery and 3 samples during the 3 following days (at&#xD;
           24th, 48th and 72th hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 tissue biopsies, i.e. 2 from peritoneum disease-free and 2 from invaded peritoneum ,&#xD;
           each representing a volume less than 1 cm3 and 2 biopsies from healthy colonic tissue&#xD;
           for the colon-related cancer and 4 biopsies (peritoneum n=2, tumoral tissue n=2) for&#xD;
           ovarian-related cancer. All biopsies are done during the surgery under general&#xD;
           anesthesia, and each biopsy per site before/after IPCH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  main criteria : Heat shock protein expression (blood/cell ratio) compared to baseline&#xD;
           values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  associate criteria : apoptosis and immune response before/after IPCH Statistical&#xD;
           method/Sample size/Study's lenght Scheduled sample size is 30 patients having an IPCH&#xD;
           and 30 patients contraindicated per surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The normal distribution is verified using the d'Agostino-Pearson test. For intragroup&#xD;
      comparisons, the repeated measures ANOVA is done. For intergroup comparisons, an univariate&#xD;
      analysis is done, using the Student t-test and the Fisher exact test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into account the planned sample size and the annual number of IPCH, the scheduled&#xD;
      length of the study is 18 months.&#xD;
