        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has histologically confirmed diagnosis of MTC that is unresectable,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The subject has been previously treated with available standard therapy for&#xD;
             unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic MTC; or other currently available&#xD;
             therapy is considered inappropriate for the subject as determined by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 - 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has adequate organ and marrow function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is capable of understanding and complying with the protocol requirements&#xD;
             and has signed the informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active subjects (men and women) must agree to use medically accepted barrier&#xD;
             methods of contraception (eg, male or female condom) during the course of the study&#xD;
             and for 3 months after the last dose of cabozantinib received as part of this study,&#xD;
             even if oral contraceptives are also used. All subjects of reproductive potential must&#xD;
             agree to use both a barrier method and a second method of birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has received cytotoxic chemotherapy (including investigational cytotoxic&#xD;
             chemotherapy) or biologic agents (eg, antibodies) within 4 weeks, or&#xD;
             nitrosoureas/mitomycin C within 6 weeks before the first dose of cabozantinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has previously been enrolled in a clinical trial evaluating cabozantinib&#xD;
             including placebo-controlled trials in which the subject may not have been treated&#xD;
             with cabozantinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has received radiation therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. to the thoracic cavity, abdomen, or pelvis within 12 weeks before the first dose&#xD;
                  of study treatment , or has ongoing complications or is without complete recovery&#xD;
                  and healing from prior radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. to bone or brain metastasis within 14 days before the first dose of cabozantinib&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. to any other site(s) within 28 days before the first dose of cabozantinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has received radionuclide treatment within 6 weeks before the first dose&#xD;
             of cabozantinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has received prior treatment with a small molecule kinase inhibitor or a&#xD;
             hormonal therapy (including investigational kinase inhibitors or hormones) within 14&#xD;
             days or five half-lifes of the compound or active metabolites, whichever is longer,&#xD;
             before the first dose of cabozantinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has received any other type of investigational agent within 28 days before&#xD;
             the first dose of cabozantinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has not recovered to baseline or CTCAE ≤ Grade 1 from toxicity due to all&#xD;
             prior therapies except alopecia and other clinically non-significant side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has active brain metastases or epidural disease (certain exceptions apply)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject requires chronic concomitant treatment of strong CYP3A4 inducers (eg,&#xD;
             dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin,&#xD;
             phenobarbital, and St. John's Wort)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject requires concomitant treatment, in therapeutic doses, with anticoagulants&#xD;
             such as warfarin or warfarin-related agents, heparin, thrombin or Factor Xa&#xD;

          -  The subject has experienced any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. clinically-significant GI bleeding within 6 months before the first dose of&#xD;
                  cabozantinib&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. hemoptysis of &gt; 0.5 teaspoon (2.5 ml) of red blood within 3 months before the&#xD;
                  first dose of cabozantinib&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. any other signs indicative of pulmonary hemorrhage within 3 months before the&#xD;
                  first dose of cabozantinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has radiographic evidence of cavitating pulmonary lesion(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has radiographic evidence of tumor in contact with, invading or encasing&#xD;
             any major blood vessel&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has evidence of tumor invading the GI tract (esophagus, stomach, small or&#xD;
             large bowel, rectum or anus), or any evidence of endotracheal or endobronchial tumor&#xD;
             within 28 days before the first dose of cabozantinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness (which may&#xD;
             include certain cardiac disorders, certain gastrointestinal disorders, and major&#xD;
             surgeries)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is unable to swallow capsules&#xD;
&#xD;

             with the investigator or designee&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has had another diagnosis of malignancy, requiring systemic treatment,&#xD;
             within two years before the first dose of cabozantinib, unless that malignancy has&#xD;
             been treated with curative intent and the subject is taking no other anti-cancer&#xD;
             therapy&#xD;
