      The electronic medical record (EMR) offers a new method to provide patients with information&#xD;
      about their visits with a clinician. The EMR can generate personalized and patient specific&#xD;
      handouts at the end of the visit that can recap the topics covered during that visit. These&#xD;
      After Visit Summaries (AVS) can be automatically generated with information contained in the&#xD;
      patient's chart. The AVS has the potential to improve patient retention of information needed&#xD;
      for adherence to treatment plans, and follow-up instructions, and to facilitate information&#xD;
      transfer between healthcare settings. However, the content and formatting of the AVS to&#xD;
      optimize patients' information retention and satisfaction with the visit is not known. In&#xD;
      this study, we will develop and test in a randomized trial three different versions of an AVS&#xD;
      to determine the AVS content that maximizes patient satisfaction and retention of information&#xD;
      on the AVS,and adherence to physician instructions. The three versions of the AVS developed&#xD;
      from patient and physician input will be compared to a control condition which consists of&#xD;
      current practice in each setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct an experiment in the four selected primary care clinics to test objectively&#xD;
      the effect of three levels of AVS content on patient recall of personal visit information,&#xD;
      satisfaction with the information received from their providers, and uses of the information&#xD;
      after their visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The four clinics were selected to provide a diverse patient sample with regard to&#xD;
      socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity and language preference. The study is planned to have a&#xD;
      total of 68 patients in each AVS form group (272 total), and 136 patients in each language&#xD;
      group. In our previous research in these SPUR-Net clinics, we found that it is very difficult&#xD;
      to recruit Spanish-language preference individuals in private practice settings. The great&#xD;
      majority of persons of Hispanic ethnicity who attend private practice clinics prefer to&#xD;
      communicate in English. For this reason, we will not attempt to recruit Spanish-speakers from&#xD;
      the Baylor Family Medicine Clinic. Patients will be approached, and if they agree to&#xD;
      participate they will be consented for the study. At the end of the visit, each study patient&#xD;
      will be randomized either to the control group or one of the three experimental groups. The&#xD;
      RA will accomplish this by opening a sealed envelope that contains the randomly generated&#xD;
      group assignment. For the experimental AVS's, the RA will select and generate the appropriate&#xD;
      study AVS in Epic. For the control group, the AVS that is currently being used in that clinic&#xD;
      will be printed and distributed to the patient. All research subjects will then be contacted&#xD;
      in 24 hours, and then again in 2-3 weeks to study the following outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are not able to test a control condition that withholds an AVS altogether, in as much as&#xD;
      JACHO standards governing some of the participating clinics require an AVS of some kind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome: The primary outcome measure will be the amount of information recalled by&#xD;
      patients at two time points: 2 days after the primary care visit, and 2-3 weeks after the&#xD;
      visit. The recall test will consist of two parts. Part 1 will involve recall of the general&#xD;
      categories of information contained on the AVS. Sample questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Did the form have information about your blood pressure?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Did the form have information about your medications?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Did the form have a list of your health problems?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The responses will be scored as correct or incorrect, depending on the version of the AVS&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the patient. The final version of the recall test will be developed&#xD;
      after the focus group analysis, when a final determination of the content of the three forms&#xD;
      of the AVS is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 of the recall test will ask the patient to generate the list of medications prescribed&#xD;
      and instructions given. This represents the content of the minimum information AVS (Form 3),&#xD;
      which can be answered by all study participants. The patients' answers will be recorded in&#xD;
      the data base verbatim, and at the completion of data collection, the investigators will&#xD;
      develop scoring rules to assign a score to each item. These rules will account for informal&#xD;
      names for medications (such as &quot;water pill,&quot; &quot;sugar pill,&quot; etc.). The score on this part will&#xD;
      be the percent of medication information correctly recalled, including name of pill (formal&#xD;
      or informal), number of doses to be taken per day, and timing of dose. The total test score&#xD;
      will be the percent of items correctly recalled. The two parts can be analyzed separately and&#xD;
      as a total score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Satisfaction with the AVS will be assessed with a 9-item questionnaire adapted from a&#xD;
      longer patient satisfaction scale developed by researchers in Baylor's Department of Family&#xD;
      and Community Medicine for evaluating patient responses to educational materials. Response&#xD;
      options to a series of questions regarding satisfaction with various characteristics of the&#xD;
      AVS range from &quot;strongly agree&quot; to &quot;strongly disagree.&quot; Two open ended questions will provide&#xD;
      patients the opportunity to mention elements of the AVS, or their reaction to it, that might&#xD;
      not have been anticipated by the research team. The form will be available in both English&#xD;
      and Spanish versions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to Treatment will be assessed to examine whether the different AVS formats&#xD;
      influence patients' self-reported adherence to the provider's recommendations. We will use a&#xD;
      general measure of adherence that summarizes information about the patient's tendency to&#xD;
      adhere to medical recommendations, regardless of type of treatment recommended. The items in&#xD;
      this measure are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. I had a hard time doing what the doctor suggested I do;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. I found it easy to do the things my doctor suggested I do;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. I was unable to do what was necessary to follow my doctor's treatment plans;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. I followed my doctor's suggestions exactly; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Generally speaking, how often during the past 4 weeks were you able to do what the&#xD;
           doctor told you?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response options for each item range from &quot;none of the time&quot; to &quot;all of the time.&quot; The&#xD;
      general adherence scale was constructed by averaging responses to the five items and&#xD;
      transforming the result linearly to a 0-100 distribution. This scale, developed in&#xD;
      conjunction with the Health Outcomes Study, has demonstrated good internal reliability&#xD;
      approaching .80, and acceptable stability over time. Standard back translation procedures&#xD;
      have been used to construct an equivalent Spanish version.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Study Variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health Literacy will be assessed with the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults&#xD;
      (S-TOFHLA)in order to account for the effect of functional health literacy on response to the&#xD;
      AVS. Patients' health literacy skills are increasingly recognized as a critical variable in&#xD;
      primary care research. The S-TOFHLA is a timed reading comprehension test that measures&#xD;
      patients' ability to read and understand passages describing common medical instructions. It&#xD;
      is available in English and Spanish versions, takes approximately 7 minutes for patients to&#xD;
      complete, and is scored on a scale of 0 to 36. Patients are categorized as having adequate&#xD;
      health literacy if the S-TOFHLA score is 23-36, marginal health literacy if it is 17-22, and&#xD;
      inadequate health literacy if the score is 0-16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and Health variables will be collected, including such standard variables as age,&#xD;
      sex, race/ethnicity, and number of years of education completed. In order to adjust analyses&#xD;
      for disease severity, we will document the total number of health problems included in the&#xD;
      patient's problem list on the day of their study visit. In addition, because the salience of&#xD;
      the AVS may be related to the presence or absence of an acute condition, we will classify&#xD;
      each visit as to whether the problem list for the visit includes chronic conditions only, and&#xD;
      acute condition only, or a combination of acute and chronic problems. This categorical&#xD;
      variable will be included as a covariate in the outcomes analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the potential confounders are evenly distributed across the study groups, the differences&#xD;
      among groups on the primary and secondary outcome measures will be tested by one-way ANOVA or&#xD;
      Chi-square analysis as appropriate for continuous or discrete variables.&#xD;
