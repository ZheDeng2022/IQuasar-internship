  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endothelin-1 (ET-1) seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm after&#xD;
      subarachnoid hemorrhage. However measurements of cerebrospinal fluid concentrations (CSF) of&#xD;
      ET-1 are not sensitive enough to predict the development of vasospasm representing the&#xD;
      average value throughout the entire cerebral circulation. Cerebral microdialysis (MD) is a&#xD;
      technique able to detect molecule concentrations in a small perivascular area. The&#xD;
      investigators performed a prospective observational clinical study to test the hypothesis&#xD;
      that MD ET-1 concentrations should be a sensitive predictor for vasospasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage at high risk for vasospasm according to Fisher scale&#xD;
      admitted to the ICU were consecutively studied. All patients received surgery within 48 hours&#xD;
      from the bleeding; MD probe was placed in the area at risk for vasospasm after surgery and&#xD;
      samples were hourly collected and analysed to measure lactate, piruvate and glutamate levels;&#xD;
      ET-1 levels in CSF and MD fluids were measured from admission until day 7. At admission and&#xD;
      after 7 days two angiographies were performed to detect the degree and extent of vasospasm,&#xD;
      Transcranial Doppler and neurological evaluation were daily performed. Patients were then&#xD;
      classified according to the presence of vasospasm in 3 groups: absence of vasospasm (NV),&#xD;
      presence of vasospasm (CV), acute neurological deterioration (AND).&#xD;
