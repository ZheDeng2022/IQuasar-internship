      The purpose of this study is to verify the usefulness of Healthy KIDS Program (HKP) for&#xD;
      children and adolescents to lose weight and promote their self esteem in a fun atmosphere.&#xD;

      The Program will be divided into four areas: 1) Screening, 2) Implementation 3) Follow-up&#xD;
      Post program, 4) Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening Children between the ages of 8-16 years of age whose BMI&gt;85th% will be&#xD;
           identified and screened. The parent and their child must agree to participate in the&#xD;
           entire study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the first three visits, a full medical evaluation will be performed and it will&#xD;
           be determined if the potential patient meets study entry criteria. Body measurements,&#xD;
           blood collection, family history, behavioral, cardiac, exercise and nutritional&#xD;
           evaluations will take place. Glucose tolerance testing will be performed during&#xD;
           screening. if HbA1c is above 5.2 to classify patients as euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic or&#xD;
           Type 2 Diabetes. Other endocrine evaluations (e.g. FSH, LH, testosterone, Total T4, Free&#xD;
           T4, andandT3, TSH for PCOS and/or thyroid hormone dysfunction) will be performed as&#xD;
           medically indicated. And if medical problems are present, they there will be addressed&#xD;
           and treated by an appropriately medical treatment. In case of PCOS medical treatment is&#xD;
           not enough and diet and exercise should be always part of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Program Implementation Participants will be entered into the 10-week program. Each child&#xD;
           will act as his/her own control and the success of the interventions will be measured in&#xD;
           change in percentiles over time. Each group will contain no more than 12 participants.&#xD;
           During the program there will be intensive nutrition, behavioral and exercise therapy&#xD;
           designed specifically for each child and for each family participating. The program,&#xD;
           designed for a total of 32 weeks, will include weekly sessions for the first 10 weeks,&#xD;
           every other week for the next 10 weeks, and once a month thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of the intervention is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Individualized meal planning and exercise regimen sessions will be developed for each&#xD;
           participant. .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants and their families will participate in groups of 10 to 12 where they can&#xD;
           elicit support and motivation from one another, learn about nutrition, behaviors as well&#xD;
           as engage in exercise programs which are facilitated by a certified instructor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Weekly topics will be taught through 'gaming activities' designed to impart educational&#xD;
           information through games and activities. Group support activities will use affective&#xD;
           techniques in order to elicit sharing of feelings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Each discipline involved- behavioral, nutritional and exercise physiology will design&#xD;
           pre and post evaluation tools (in addition to maintaining histories on each participant)&#xD;
           as well as lesson plans, gaming activities and affective techniques. Behavioral issues&#xD;
           such as eating through boredom, stress, or loneliness, for example, might be addressed&#xD;
           in varied ways weaved throughout the 2 Â½ hr session, while portion control, appropriate&#xD;
           food choices might be the nutritional topics covered that session and reviewed through&#xD;
           gaming activities. The exercise portion of the lesson may address varied types of&#xD;
           exercise to reduce stress and keep them busy and a yoga instructor may come that night&#xD;
           to demonstrate other stress reduction techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) Follow-up Post Program After the 32-week program, there will be follow-up visits in order&#xD;
      to assess maintenance of weight loss. Questionnaires and visits at 2 months, 6 months, and 1&#xD;
      year after the program ends will evaluate long-term success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent visits will occur every three months which is considered standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4) Analysis: Pre 10 week session and post 10 week session the following evaluation tools and&#xD;
      criteria will be evaluated: Weight, waist circumference, endurance, strength, flexibility,&#xD;
      triceps caliper measurements as well as the YES evaluation. The Youth Evaluation Scale is a&#xD;
      nationally standardized test. The YES evaluation is performed on ages 9 and &gt; and evaluates&#xD;
      areas such as: habits, knowledge, self esteem, depression, anxiety, family communications,&#xD;
      lifestyle, structure and more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After years 1 and 2, the study team will evaluate the effectiveness of the program as a whole&#xD;
      and each individual component. Recommendations for design changes, as well as statistical&#xD;
      information from all study members (i.e., behavioral, nutrition, exercise) will be analyzed&#xD;
      to determine the advantages of certain treatment modalities in the effective treatment of&#xD;
      childhood obesity.&#xD;
