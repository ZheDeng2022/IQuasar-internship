  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The prevalence of overweight and obesity continues to increase in socially less&#xD;
      advantaged populations but is stabilizing even is decreasing in socially more advantaged&#xD;
      populations. The PRALIMAP trial highlighted the effectiveness of structured screening and&#xD;
      care management in decreasing the prevalence of overweight and obesity in high school&#xD;
      adolescents over 2 years. The PRALIMAP-INES trial aims to investigate whether a strengthened&#xD;
      care management (CM) for socially less advantaged adolescents in school in the short and long&#xD;
      term has an equivalent effect as a standard-CM on decreasing the prevalence of overweight and&#xD;
      obesity among socially advantaged adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: PRALIMAP-INÉS is a mixed prospective and multicenter trial of 1,250 overweight&#xD;
      and obese adolescents aged 13 to 18 years who are attending grade 9 and 10 in the 35&#xD;
      state-run schools of the Vosges department (northeastern France) for the academic years&#xD;
      2012-2013 2013-2014 and 2014-2015. Overweight adolescents (including obese) classified as&#xD;
      advantaged are allocated to the standard-CM and those less advantaged are randomized to&#xD;
      standard CM or strengthened-CM. The standard-CM consists of 5 collective sessions of 2 hr&#xD;
      each performed in high school and supervised by a healthcare mobile team specialised in&#xD;
      overweight and obesity care management for adolescents. The strengthened-CM consists of 5&#xD;
      collective sessions with the same standard operating procedure as the standard-CM with&#xD;
      supplementary interventions between each session: strengthened solicitation with the&#xD;
      adolescent and the family, peer-led educational sessions, motivational interviews, financial&#xD;
      support for physical activity practice, cooking classes and multidisciplinary consultation&#xD;
      meetings. Data on sociodemographics, anthropometrics, physical activity and mental health are&#xD;
      collected at 3 visits: at the entry to grade 9 or 10 (before the intervention=T0), at the end&#xD;
      of grade 9 or 10 (at the end of the intervention=T1) and at the end of grade 11 (1 year after&#xD;
      the intervention=T2). Process evaluation data are also collected during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: To confirm the effectiveness of overweight CM for adolescents in a school&#xD;
      setting and to highlight or not the effectiveness of specific strengthened interventions&#xD;
      adapted for socially less advantaged adolescents to maintain social equality in access to&#xD;
      overweight care.&#xD;

      Background: The prevalence of overweight and obesity continues to increase in socially less&#xD;
      advantaged populations but is stabilizing even is decreasing in socially more advantaged&#xD;
      populations. The PRALIMAP trial confirmed major social inequalities in overweight and obesity&#xD;
      frequency in adolescents in grade 10. The trial highlighted the effectiveness of structured&#xD;
      screening and care management in decreasing the prevalence of overweight and obesity in high&#xD;
      school adolescents over 2 years. The PRALIMAP-INES trial aims to investigate whether a&#xD;
      strengthened care management strategy for socially less advantaged adolescents in school in&#xD;
      the short and long term (just after the intervention and 1 year later) has an equivalent&#xD;
      effect as a standard-care management strategy on decreasing the prevalence of overweight and&#xD;
      obesity among socially advantaged adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: A strengthened overweight and obesity care management strategy for overweight and&#xD;
      obesity (risk factors of cancer) can improve care access for socially less advantaged&#xD;
      adolescents and maintain social equality in terms of overweight and obesity prevalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: PRALIMAP-INÉS is a mixed prospective and multicenter trial (one randomised part&#xD;
      and one non-randomised part) of 1,250 overweight and obese adolescents aged 13 to 18 years&#xD;
      who are attending grade 9 and 10 in the 35 state-run schools of the Vosges department&#xD;
      (northeastern France) for the academic years 2012-2013, 2013-2014 and 2014-2015. After a&#xD;
      session to detect overweight and obese adolescents, the social status of included adolescents&#xD;
      as &quot;advantaged&quot; or &quot;less advantaged&quot; is determined. Adolescents classified as advantaged are&#xD;
      allocated to the standard-care management and those less advantaged are randomized to&#xD;
      standard-care management or strengthened-care management. The standard-care management&#xD;
      consists of 5 collective sessions of 2 hr each performed in high school and supervised by a&#xD;
      healthcare mobile team specialised in overweight and obesity care management for adolescents.&#xD;
      The team consists of physicians, dietitians, psychologists and sports educators from the AVRS&#xD;
      Association. The content of sessions was validated in the PRALIMAP trial. The&#xD;
      strengthened-care management consists of 5 collective sessions with the same standard&#xD;
      operating procedure as the standard-care management with supplementary interventions between&#xD;
      each session: strengthened solicitation with the adolescent and the family, peer-led&#xD;
      educational sessions, motivational interviews, financial support for physical activity&#xD;
      practice, cooking classes and multidisciplinary consultation meetings (adjusting the care&#xD;
      management according to the social status). Data on sociodemographics, anthropometrics,&#xD;
      physical activity and mental health are collected at 3 visits: at the entry to grade 9 or 10&#xD;
      (before the intervention = T0), at the end of grade 9 or 10 (at the end of the intervention =&#xD;
      T1) and at the end of grade 10 or 11 (1 year after the intervention = T2). T1 measurement&#xD;
      allows for evaluating the short-term effect of the intervention and T2, the long-term effect&#xD;
      of a 1-year break from the intervention. Data on participation and from questionnaires, as&#xD;
      well as focus group and activity reports, necessary for evaluation, are collected during the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: With this trial, the investigators expect to confirm the effectiveness of&#xD;
      overweight and obesity care management for adolescents in a school setting and to highlight&#xD;
      or not the effectiveness of specific strengthened interventions adapted for socially less&#xD;
      advantaged adolescents to maintain social equality in access to overweight and obesity care.&#xD;
