    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 pilot study assessed the safety and efficacy of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in&#xD;
      10 people with chronic, treatment-resistant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), comparing&#xD;
      the effects of low and full dose MDMA as an adjunct to psychotherapy. The first two subjects&#xD;
      were enrolled in the open label full dose lead-in with 125 mg of MDMA, followed 1.5 to 2.5&#xD;
      hours later by a supplemental half-dose of 62.5 mg of MDMA. The remaining eight subjects&#xD;
      enrolled in Stage 1 of the study and received either an active placebo dose (low dose of 25&#xD;
      mg MDMA, with a supplemental dose of 12.5 mg MDMA) or a fully active dose of MDMA (125 mg,&#xD;
      with a supplemental dose of 62.5 mg MDMA) during two experimental psychotherapy session, each&#xD;
      lasting six to eight hours and scheduled three to five weeks apart. The extent of PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms was assessed at baseline and two months after the second experimental session using&#xD;
      the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) [Blake et al., 1995]. Subjects who enrolled in&#xD;
      Stage 1 and received the active placebo had the opportunity to enroll in Stage 2 of the study&#xD;
      and complete open-label experimental sessions with the fully active dose of MDMA on the same&#xD;
      schedule as Stage 1.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder that can develop&#xD;
      after a person experiences a traumatic event, such as sexual assault, war, or any other&#xD;
      life-threatening event. PTSD is a worldwide health problem that severely reduces a person's&#xD;
      quality of life and is associated with high rates of psychiatric and medical comorbidity,&#xD;
      disability, suffering, and suicide. At least a third of PTSD patients fail to respond to&#xD;
      established PTSD psychotherapies. A wider array of effective treatments for PTSD are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy may be a potential treatment&#xD;
      option for PTSD. MDMA is a monoamine releaser that affects serotonin, norepinephrine, and&#xD;
      dopamine. MDMA is capable of inducing unique psychopharmacological effects such as decreased&#xD;
      feelings of fear, increased feelings of wellbeing, increased sociability and extroversion,&#xD;
      increased interpersonal trust, and an alert state of consciousness. In the U.S., MDMA was&#xD;
      used as an adjunct to psychotherapy by a considerable number of psychiatrists and therapists&#xD;
      before it was placed in Schedule I in 1985 as a result of non-medical use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized, double-blind, active placebo-controlled Phase 2 pilot study investigated the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in 10 people with chronic,&#xD;
      treatment-resistant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), comparing the effects of low and&#xD;
      full dose MDMA as an adjunct to psychotherapy. The first two subjects were enrolled in the&#xD;
      open label full dose lead-in with 125 mg of MDMA, followed by a supplemental half-dose of&#xD;
      62.5 mg of MDMA after 1.5 to 2.5 hours. The remaining eight subjects enrolled in Stage 1 of&#xD;
      the study and received either an active placebo dose (low dose of 25 mg MDMA with a&#xD;
      supplemental half-dose of 12.5 mg MDMA) or a fully active dose (125 mg MDMA with a&#xD;
      supplemental half-dose of 62.5 mg MDMA) during two experimental psychotherapy session, each&#xD;
      lasting six to eight hours and scheduled three to five weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects remained with their male/female co-therapist team for the entirety of the study.&#xD;
      Upon enrollment, subjects met with their therapist team for three preparatory sessions. After&#xD;
      each MDMA-assisted psychotherapy session, subjects met with their therapist team for&#xD;
      integrative psychotherapy sessions where subjects processed and connected their thoughts and&#xD;
      feelings about the experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extent of PTSD symptoms was assessed at baseline and two months after the second&#xD;
      experimental session using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) (Blake et al., 1995).&#xD;
      Safety measures, vital signs, and a measurement of psychological distress was assessed during&#xD;
      all experimental sessions. Blood pressure and heart rate were assessed periodically during&#xD;
      each experimental session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who enrolled in Stage 1 and received the active placebo had the opportunity to&#xD;
      enroll in Stage 2 of the study and complete open-label experimental sessions with the fully&#xD;
      active dose of MDMA (125 mg and 62.5 mg supplemental) on the same schedule as Stage 1.&#xD;

        <description>Validated self-report measure of symptoms of depression. The BDI-II total score of 0-13 is considered minimal range, 14-19 is mild, 20-28 is moderate, and 29-63 is severe depressive symptoms. The BDI-II is scored by summing the ratings for the 21 items. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3. The maximum total score is 63.</description>

        <title>Change in Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS) Symptom Severity Score From Baseline to End of Stage 1</title>
        <description>The Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS) is a 49-item self-report instrument designed to aid in the diagnosis of PTSD. Responses to 17 symptom items are made on a 4 point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (five or more times per week). The symptom items are summed to calculate the symptom severity score which ranges from 0 to 51, with higher scores indicating more severe PTSD symptoms.</description>
