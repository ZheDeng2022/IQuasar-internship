  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the Pico-Union/Koreatown community of Los Angeles investigators are designing a preventive&#xD;
      health care model that increases the opportunities for families to make healthy choices -- in&#xD;
      their homes, schools &amp; communities. The project's key element is: Lay community health&#xD;
      workers (paraprofessionals) - Mentor Mothers (MM) (promotoras) - who make home visits to&#xD;
      pregnant mothers &amp; newly-delivered mothers who have agreed to participate in the research&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hope to achieve the following outcomes: 1) lower maternal BMI at 6 months&#xD;
      post-birth; 2) longer duration of breastfeeding; 3) less alcohol, smoking, and drug use&#xD;
      during pregnancy; and 4) increased and consistent prenatal and postnatal healthcare&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will implement the study with 6 MMs, who will maintain an average caseload of&#xD;
      16 women each across an 18-month period. Each participant will be visited (or receive the&#xD;
      intervention by telephone) twice per month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Separate Assessment Team members will conduct assessments at: Baseline, within a week of&#xD;
      birth of the target child, and 6 months from birth.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After participant mothers have been recruited, screened, and consented into the study, each&#xD;
      woman will be contacted by a member of the Assessment Team to schedule the in-home Baseline&#xD;
      Assessment. The Baseline Assessment will take approximately 90 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Assessments will take place: within a week of delivery and 6 months after delivery.&#xD;
      Interviews will be audio-recorded for quality assurance purposes. The domains of the&#xD;
      Follow-up Assessments will be 1) maternal weight, height, and eating and exercise routines;&#xD;
      2) feeding routines, style, and frequency; 3) substance use; and 4) adherence to health care&#xD;
      prenatally and postnatally, immunizations, and illnesses for mothers and babies. Secondarily,&#xD;
      investigators will assess the mother's pregnancy, general health, mental health, social&#xD;
      support, the father of the child, use of alternative medicine and health care, reproductive&#xD;
      health, HIV, relationships and violence, baseline knowledge of antenatal health, baseline&#xD;
      knowledge of delivery health, and baseline stated future plans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All in-home interviews will take place in a private room or area of the participant's home.&#xD;
      If an in-home interview is not practical or appropriate for any reason, the interviewer will&#xD;
      conduct the interview at the Robert F. Kennedy Community Schools campus, UCLA, or another&#xD;
      site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment team in-home interviews will be audio-recorded for quality assurance &amp; supervision&#xD;
      purposes. Telephone interviews will not be audio-recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      IN-HOME (OR TELEPHONE) MENTOR MOTHER INTERVENTION VISITS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be assigned to a Mentor Mother (MM). Participants will receive a series&#xD;
      of twice-monthly, pre- and post-natal, in-home (or telephone call) intervention visits, for&#xD;
      the study period of 12 months, from her assigned MM. The MM will measure the mother's height&#xD;
      &amp; weight at each intervention home visit, then proceed to deliver one of the Intervention&#xD;
      Topics (e.g. nutrition, substance use awareness, infant development etc.). After the baby is&#xD;
      born, the Mentor Mother will continue to record the mother's weight and height, and will also&#xD;
      measure and weigh the infant, entering that data into the study mobile phone. These&#xD;
      intervention visits (or phone calls) will last for approximately 1 hour each. The MM will&#xD;
      address any concerns or questions the mother has, provide referrals to community resources as&#xD;
      necessary, and leave handouts for the participant mother based on the day's intervention&#xD;
      topic and/or the participant mother's questions that day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ----------------------------------------------------&#xD;
&#xD;
      HEALTH INFORMATION MAILINGS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women will receive twice-monthly mailing that will provide information about&#xD;
      pregnancy, breastfeeding, nutrition, and infant care.&#xD;
