      Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a novel method in evaluation of microscopic structures&#xD;
      in vivo. The examination is carried out with a confocal laser endomicroscope, which is either&#xD;
      part of the endoscope (manufactured by Pentax) or probe based (manufactured by Cellvizio).&#xD;
      Hereby, all parts of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can be examined. The method has&#xD;
      potential to replace conventional microscopy and the dynamic nature of the procedure allows&#xD;
      visualization of structures and cellular processes in almost real-time. This provides us with&#xD;
      a potentially new diagnostic tool with a promising future. To date only a few studies have&#xD;
      been published on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and in the literature high-quality&#xD;
      research is still lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project consists of a blinded prospective observation and methodology study including&#xD;
      inter- and intra-observation of patients with proctitis before and after initiation of local&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: CLE can be used to assess the degree and extend of acute and chronic inflammation&#xD;
      and treatment response in patients with ulcerative colitis and is a sensitive supplementary&#xD;
      to conventional diagnostics.&#xD;

      Confocal laser endomicroscopy findings in patients with proctosigmoiditis before and after&#xD;
      initiation of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.&#xD;
      Crohn's disease often strikes the terminal ileum, but may occur from the mouth to the anus.&#xD;
      It is characterized by segmental spreading with transmural inflammation and occasional&#xD;
      presence of granulomas in the tissue samples. Ulcerative colitis is only found in the colon&#xD;
      and involves in practice always the rectum. The inflammation is limited to the mucosa and&#xD;
      submucosa, and the diffusion is continuous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of endoscopy has made these procedures a central part of the diagnostic and&#xD;
      therapeutic management of patients with gastrointestinal diseases, including IBD. The entire&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract is now available for inspection and therapy. A limitation of these&#xD;
      studies is that the histology, which is often essential for the diagnosis and treatment of&#xD;
      the patient, cannot always be precisely evaluated by a conventional examination. The proper&#xD;
      handling of detected lesions require in addition to the endoscopic evaluation, a histological&#xD;
      evaluation of the tissue involved, making tissue samples necessary in order to obtain a&#xD;
      definitive diagnosis and thus optimal handling. Therefore, during the endoscopic procedure&#xD;
      tissue samples from the intestinal mucosa must be taken, which rarely involves a greater risk&#xD;
      to the patient, but causes a delay, due to preparation time for the histological analysis and&#xD;
      in some cases even due to re-examination if histopathology is negative. In the treatment of&#xD;
      IBD the endoscopic assessment of the severity and extension is absolutely essential for the&#xD;
      choice of treatment. The &quot;Gold standard&quot; for the optimal treatment is called &quot;deep&quot;&#xD;
      remission, defined by clinical and endoscopic remission as assessed by conventional&#xD;
      endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within recent years a new approach was introduced, wherein the microscopic structures of the&#xD;
      intestinal mucous can be evaluated continuously in vivo during the endoscopic procedure. The&#xD;
      technique is called confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE). CLE functions by means of a laser&#xD;
      device, which is inserted or build into an endoscope, and used as an illuminator of the&#xD;
      lining of a small area and at a precise depth. The tissue is first added with fluorescence by&#xD;
      intravenous administration. The reflection of the mucosa is captured in a focused area and&#xD;
      magnified by which a two-dimensional image of mucosal microscopic structures is formed. This&#xD;
      provides us with an &quot;optical biopsy&quot;, which can be compared with a similar microscopic image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This provides us with a potential opportunity for immediate diagnosing and targeted therapy&#xD;
      during the same procedure. The optical biopsy is stored digitally in such a way that it can&#xD;
      also be evaluated postprocedure. During CLE multiple frames are generated per second, which&#xD;
      is stored continuously, thereby forming a movie sequence, so that the microscopic assessment&#xD;
      of the tissue becomes dynamic i.e. the flow in the small vessels may be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A current hypothesis about the pathogenesis of IBD is that a defective barrier function may&#xD;
      be a key element. The intestinal barrier is composed of epithelial cells, which are bound&#xD;
      together by the so-called &quot;tight junctions&quot;. Experimental studies have shown an increased&#xD;
      intestinal permeability in IBD patients and that the degree of permeability is a prognostic&#xD;
      indicator for the relapse of Crohn's disease. In CLE-studies, the defective barrier function&#xD;
      has been identified in vivo as an efflux of fluorescein through the intestinal wall and&#xD;
      demonstrated to be significantly greater in IBD patients compared to a healthy control group.&#xD;
      The spacing between the epithelial cells are also increased. In patients in remission a&#xD;
      defective barrier function predisposes to relapse of their disease. However, it is not&#xD;
      possible to realize this dysfunction by a conventional histological examination, as well as&#xD;
      other parameters, which require a dynamic microscopic evaluation. By implementing CLE the&#xD;
      sensitivity of the endoscopic assessment may increase, which may change not only the&#xD;
      characteristics of &quot;deep&quot; remission, but also assessment of the diseases activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLE is at present a rapidly growing field of development which has primarily been used in&#xD;
      connection with endoscopy of the digestive tract, but also has been used in connection with&#xD;
      endoscopy of the urinary and respiratory tract. CLE have been shown, to reduce the number of&#xD;
      tissue samples significantly without compromising the diagnosis. Furthermore, several studies&#xD;
      suggest that CLE can contribute to a more accurate diagnosis, and preliminary studies suggest&#xD;
      that the degree of the disease can be estimated better compared to conventional endoscopy.&#xD;
      Yet, there is no data evaluating the applicability of the method in relation to monitoring of&#xD;
      treatment response and as a real prognostic tool. CLE is a new method, and therefore still&#xD;
      many unresolved issues and areas to be clarified exist before the technology can finally be&#xD;
      implemented in the daily practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is in the research group led by professor of endoscopy Peter Vilmann several years&#xD;
      fostered a greater experience in the introduction of new methods. This includes the&#xD;
      implementation of relevant studies and the collection and publication of scientific data at&#xD;
      an international level, so that the modality can find its proper place for the diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction: By conventional colonoscopy, the degree and spread of inflammation is often&#xD;
      underestimated or overlooked in patients with acute inflammation due to insufficient&#xD;
      sensitivity. In ulcerative colitis the course of the disease and in particular the risk of&#xD;
      treatment failure is related to the degree of acute inflammation, which in addition to&#xD;
      clinical and endoscopic observations is assessed by changes in crypt architecture, and&#xD;
      infiltration of acute inflammatory cells in the lamina propria. The dissemination of the&#xD;
      disease is also particularly important for the choice of treatment, which changes&#xD;
      successively from suppositories to enemas and to systemic corticosteroids depending on the&#xD;
      proximal boundary of the inflammation. Taking tissue samples may partially prevent&#xD;
      underestimation, but this is time consuming, expensive and rarely leads to a radically change&#xD;
      of treatment strategy, since endoscopy is the reference in this context. The literature&#xD;
      suggest two classifications of inflammation based on CLE, which we partly - and for a start,&#xD;
      will use to estimate disease activity before and after initiation of treatment and in a&#xD;
      control group. In addition, personal observations will be recorded and analyzed. This&#xD;
      assessment will subsequently be used for an intra-and inter-observer study and a&#xD;
      stratification of CLE-observations in relation to acute inflammation and degree in tissue&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: CLE can be used to assess the degree and extend of acute and chronic inflammation&#xD;
      and treatment response in patients with ulcerative colitis and is a sensitive supplementary&#xD;
      to conventional diagnostics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A blinded prospective observation and methodology study in patients before and after&#xD;
      initiation of topical steroid treatment with subsequent calculation of intra-and&#xD;
      inter-observer variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Enrolled patients will be examined by conventional colonoscopy and CLE before and&#xD;
      after initiation of topical treatment, respectively. The degree and distribution of acute&#xD;
      inflammation will be assessed by conventional microscopy (Mayo score), CLE (crypt&#xD;
      architecture, micro vascular changes and the presence of inflammatory cells in the lamina&#xD;
      propria and defective barrier function) and histology biopsies. It is expected that not&#xD;
      previously described CLE-finding will be found, and that these will be recorded and evaluated&#xD;
      as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The terminal ileum and each colonic segment is (caecum, ascending colon, transversal colon,&#xD;
      descending colon, colon sigmoid and rectum) assessed as described above. CLE findings will be&#xD;
      graded for analysis according to the following scales:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crypt Architecture: 1: Normal, 2: Changed shape, size and distribution, 3: Crypt destruction&#xD;
      and abscess&#xD;
&#xD;
      Micro vascular changes: 1: Normal, 2: Slightly higher in number and moderately dilated, 3:&#xD;
      Significantly higher in number and massively dilated&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infiltration of inflammatory cells: 1: No, 2: Presence &lt;50% of the crypts, 3: Presence&gt; 50%&#xD;
      of the crypts&#xD;
&#xD;
      Defective barrier function: 1: Normal, 2: Functional defect, 3: Structural defect&#xD;
&#xD;
      The correlation between histology (the &quot;gold standard&quot;), the Mayo score, which is a combined&#xD;
      clinical and endoscopic index, and CLE will be calculated. This applies to both IBD patients&#xD;
      as the control group. An intra-and inter-observer study is planned after the initial study,&#xD;
      where CLE operators are blinded with respect to each other. The pathologist is blinded to&#xD;
      conventional and CLE observations. CLE results are stratified in order to identify which of&#xD;
      the recorded CLE parameters correlates best with the other two methods, and is therefore most&#xD;
      suitable for further studies with focus on inflammation. In addition, a determination of the&#xD;
      relationship between CLE findings and the treatment effect for the individual patient is&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical method: Comparison of CLE-findings in relation to the Mayo score and histology is&#xD;
      made using Spearman correlation analysis. To evaluate the treatment effect the Wilcoxon&#xD;
      Signed Rank test is used. In the inter-and intra-observer study weighted kappa statistics are&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient: A complete sample-size calculation has been made for the inter-and intra-observer&#xD;
      study of the individual CLE parameters by 3 observers. If possible, to achieve a kappa value&#xD;
      of 0.9 with a confidence interval of 0.05, there must be 122 observations. If we register&#xD;
      Mayo score, CLE parameters and take tissue samples for pathology in all the abovementioned&#xD;
      intestinal segments during two endoscopies, 14 observations for each patient will be&#xD;
      registered which subsequently are assessed in relation to each of the parameters used in the&#xD;
      study. If there is no waivers, all ileocolonoscopies are fulfilled and all CLE observations&#xD;
      can be analyzed, only 9 patients needs to be included. It is assumed, however, that if only&#xD;
      25% of the expected observations are obtained, since some CLE observations will be&#xD;
      unsatisfactory, some examinations will be interrupted, and some patients will only be only&#xD;
      evaluated once. Thus, 36 patients must be enrolled in the study to achieve the desired&#xD;
      strength, of which 10 are in the control group.&#xD;
