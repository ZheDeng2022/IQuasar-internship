  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the trial is to demonstrate that the creation of epicardial and endocardial&#xD;
      lesions with temperature-controlled radiofrequency (TCRF) ablation applied using the Estech&#xD;
      COBRA® Surgical System during concomitant heart surgery is a safe and effective treatment for&#xD;
      non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF).&#xD;

    <description>The Estech COBRA® Surgical System has been designed to create epicardial and endocardial lesions on the heart using temperature controlled radiofrequency (TCRF) ablation with the Estech COBRA surgical probes. Temperature control provides a meaningful endpoint, maintaining tissue at safe yet effective temperatures to produce the desired lesion set. Internal probe cooling and advanced suction helps to ensure reproducible transmural (full-thickness) endocardial or epicardial lesions.</description>
