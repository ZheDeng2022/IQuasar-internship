    <textblock>
      This is a treatment guideline to allow routine clinical data to be collected and maintained&#xD;
      in Oncore (clinical database) and the University of Minnesota Blood and Marrow Database as&#xD;
      part of the historical database maintained by the department.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm trial to evaluate the efficacy of busulfan and cyclophosphamide followed&#xD;
      by an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in the treatment of hematological&#xD;
      malignancies. The intent of this study is to provide a protocol that will use unmanipulated&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells from related and unrelated donors after a common&#xD;
      preparative regimen.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The length of time after treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of that cancer or any other type of cancer. In a clinical trial, measuring the disease-free survival is one way to see how well a new treatment works. Patients with leukemia involving the BM and myelodysplastic syndrome will have this assessed by BM biopsy and additional special studies such as cytogenetics or flow cytometry as appropriate. Patients will also have radiology studies such as plain X-rays or CT scans and/or other studies such as blood tumor markers to document presence or absence of disease as clinically indicated.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease by Grade</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 100</time_frame>
    <description>Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease is a severe short-term complication created by infusion of donor cells into a foreign host. Patients will be staged weekly between days 0 and 100 after transplantation using standard criteria used for staging. Patients will be assigned an overall GVHD score based on extent of skin rash, volume of diarrhea and maximum bilirubin level. The stages of individual organ involvement are combined to produce an overall grade. Grade I GVHD is characterized as mild disease, grade II GVHD as moderate, grade III as severe, and grade IV life-threatening.</description>

        <description>The length of time after treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of that cancer or any other type of cancer. In a clinical trial, measuring the disease-free survival is one way to see how well a new treatment works. Patients with leukemia involving the BM and myelodysplastic syndrome will have this assessed by BM biopsy and additional special studies such as cytogenetics or flow cytometry as appropriate. Patients will also have radiology studies such as plain X-rays or CT scans and/or other studies such as blood tumor markers to document presence or absence of disease as clinically indicated.</description>

        <description>Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease is a severe short-term complication created by infusion of donor cells into a foreign host. Patients will be staged weekly between days 0 and 100 after transplantation using standard criteria used for staging. Patients will be assigned an overall GVHD score based on extent of skin rash, volume of diarrhea and maximum bilirubin level. The stages of individual organ involvement are combined to produce an overall grade. Grade I GVHD is characterized as mild disease, grade II GVHD as moderate, grade III as severe, and grade IV life-threatening.</description>

Grade I GVHD is characterized as mild disease, grade II GVHD as moderate, grade III as severe, and grade IV life-threatening.</description>
