  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Constipation is a common gastrointestinal motility disorder, chronic condition that often&#xD;
      negatively affects the daily lives of patients due to their symptoms, such as infrequent&#xD;
      stools, hard stools, straining or painful defecation, cramping, bloating and flatulence.&#xD;
      Stress, poor diet and sedentary lifestyle are part of modern lifestyle, which contributes to&#xD;
      the onset of constipation. One way to reduce constipation through nutritional management of&#xD;
      affected individuals is through consumption of probiotic products, which beneficially affect&#xD;
      the development of microbial flora in the intestine, helping to improve the symptoms of&#xD;
      constipation. Among these foods, the market is a fresh cheese, plus Bifidobacterium lactis,&#xD;
      which according to its maker, when consumed as part of a healthy diet, presents beneficial&#xD;
      effects in improving symptoms of constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The fresh cheese enriched with Bifidobacterium lactis relieves symptoms&#xD;
      constipation.&#xD;

      General Objective: To investigate the effect of consumption of fresh cheese enriched with&#xD;
      Bifidobacterium lactis in improving symptoms of constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine whether the intake of cheese enriched with Bifidobacterium lactis changes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  frequency of bowel movements;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  straining or pain when defecating;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  format of the faeces;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sensation of incomplete evacuation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sensation of anorectal obstruction and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  use of manual maneuvers to facilitate evacuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The food industry is increasingly concerned about produce food that are healthy and able to&#xD;
      prevent diseases, in particular, to ensure intestinal health. To verify the effectiveness of&#xD;
      these new products on the market is one way to ensure that they have health benefits. Thus,&#xD;
      they may be indicated as a treatment for constipation, as part of a healthy lifestyle that&#xD;
      includes nutrition and physical activity practice. For this reason, this search is justified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type Search:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research is quantitative, exploratory and experimental. This is a clinical trial&#xD;
      randomized and controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population and study sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population comprised of individuals who will use the Unified Service Health System,&#xD;
      the Family Health Strategy,Brazil, participating groups of Nutritional Education. This&#xD;
      population is comprised of approximately seventy individuals, but this number is quite&#xD;
      relative, it depends on the participation. The approach of research subjects will be done&#xD;
      through an invitation, conducted orally through the Community Health Agents (CHA), during&#xD;
      home visits monthly. During the period of one month, the CHA invite to attend a lecture given&#xD;
      by the student Diane Favretto, who will speak constipation on the subject and propose the&#xD;
      participation of stake holders in the research. The stakeholders respond to a questionnaire&#xD;
      administered by the student and those who 24 showing symptoms of constipation (according to&#xD;
      Rome III criteria), will be part of study, and the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For individuals in the population are classified as constipated, they will responding to a&#xD;
      structured questionnaire with closed questions based on criteria Rome III that characterizes&#xD;
      the symptoms of constipation. Will be considered constipated individual who has at least two&#xD;
      of six symptoms in the questionnaire, 25 at least 25% of the evacuation, in that alternative&#xD;
      corresponds to the questionnaire &quot;Often&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Being able to participate in this study, a structured questionnaire, with open and closed&#xD;
      questions to assess the lifestyle (dietary habits, intake of net) associated diseases and&#xD;
      medications will be made to collect these data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The weight of the participant will be measured using portable scale brand and the individual&#xD;
      is placed standing bare foot in the center of scale with light clothing, with arms out&#xD;
      stretched to the side, with out moving. To measure the height measuring tape will be set at&#xD;
      flat wall with no baseboard and individuals will be placed in an upright position, standing&#xD;
      with bare feet parallel and heels, shoulders and buttocks touching the wall. The Body Mass&#xD;
      Index is calculated from data on weight and height (kg / m²) and classified according to the&#xD;
      Organization World Health Organization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both data will be collected at the neighborhood community hall, where the meetings monthly&#xD;
      nutrition education groups are held. Agreeing to participate in the study, the group will&#xD;
      receive all necessary instructions and will sign the informed consent. Each participant&#xD;
      receives two copies of the word, anda copy shall be given to the student and a copy will be&#xD;
      with the participant. Individuals selected to participate in the study will be randomized&#xD;
      into two groups: treated group and control group. The treatment group will receive the fresh&#xD;
      cheese plus Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07, with 108 colony forming units per serving. In the&#xD;
      placebo group, individuals will receive a fresh cheese, the same brand, with out the addition&#xD;
      of probiotics. The products will be packaged or numbered so that neither the researcher nor&#xD;
      the participants know what is cheese and what is probiotic cheese placebo. The two groups&#xD;
      will be oriented eating a slice of cheese per day (30 grams) for 30 days. This cheese will&#xD;
      part of the breakfast. Patients will be advised that, according to the manufacturer's&#xD;
      product, both cheeses not present any risk to health. Some patients may not like the taste of&#xD;
      cheese. That may be minimized by the use there of in food preparation involving other,as&#xD;
      sandwiches and salads, as long as the cheese is not heated, because this way he loses&#xD;
      probiotic your property. During this period, all participants will be instructed to continue&#xD;
      their normal dietary habits, physical activity and fluid intake. It will also be directed to&#xD;
      participants do not make use of other products containing probiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention period, the questionnaire on the symptoms of constipation is applied&#xD;
      again in order to determine whe ther there was a change in bowel habits.&#xD;
