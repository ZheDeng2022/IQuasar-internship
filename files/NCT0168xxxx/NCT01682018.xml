      The purpose of the study is to investigate if bronchoscopic lung volume reduction by valves&#xD;
      (Zephyr) would reduce native lung overinflation in patients that underwent single lung&#xD;
      transplantation due to emphysema, and improve their well being and pulmonary function tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emphysema is a progressive pulmonary disease characterized by abnormal and permanent&#xD;
      enlargement of air spaces distal to terminal bronchioles accompanied by the destruction of&#xD;
      pulmonary parenchyma. Treatment includes inhaled bronchodilator therapy, rehabilitation&#xD;
      and/or oxygen treatment. In addition to the above, patients with severe emphysema may benefit&#xD;
      from surgical lung volume reduction and/or lung transplantation. The rationale for lung&#xD;
      volume reduction surgery is that reducing lung size would restore elastic recoil of the lung&#xD;
      and improve chest wall and diaphragm mechanics. It has previously been shown that&#xD;
      particularly patients with heterogeneous emphysema seem to benefit most from surgical lung&#xD;
      volume reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR) has recently been introduced as a less invasive&#xD;
      potential alternative to surgical lung volume reduction. BLVR attempts to achieve the effects&#xD;
      of surgery, by placing bronchial prostheses using a fibreoptic bronchoscope to selectively&#xD;
      occlude the airways supplying the most affected hyperinflated regions of the emphysematous&#xD;
      lung, while permitting exhaled gas to escape. This attempts to achieve segmental or lobar&#xD;
      volume reduction, simulating the effects of surgical LVR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to investigate if bronchoscopic lung volume reduction by valves&#xD;
      (Zephyr) would reduce native lung overinflation in patients that underwent single lung&#xD;
      transplantation due to emphysema, and improve their well being and pulmonary function tests&#xD;
