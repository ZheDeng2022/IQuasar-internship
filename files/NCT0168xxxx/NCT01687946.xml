      RESOLVE's objective is to identify and characterize validated molecular targets capable of&#xD;
      shifting primary organ repair towards fibroproliferative wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work package 2 (WP2) of RESOLVE includes the clinical study protocols within the RESOLVE&#xD;
      system evaluating different forms of pulmonary repair in humans ranging from normal repair&#xD;
      over mainly inflammatory to predominantly fibroproliferative repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibrosis of the lung is an aberrant and intensified form of wound healing. It is the result&#xD;
      of an unresolved disturbance of both initiation and control of repair which is partly&#xD;
      age-related. As a result of the relentlessly activated wound healing reaction, mechanisms of&#xD;
      inflammation largely representing the condition of chronic inflammation within the peripheral&#xD;
      bronchial tree will aggravate this abnormal form of repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematic comparison of the molecular pathology of fibrotic repair representing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Varying intensity of fibrosis related to the pathology of usual interstitial pneumonia&#xD;
           (UIP),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Varying inflammatory mechanisms (UIP vs. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis [HP], acute and&#xD;
           chronic), and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Varying stages of age (Normal pulmonary repair in young and old individuals vs.&#xD;
           acute/chronic HP vs. UIP) will be able to&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identify molecules capable of shifting regular repair towards fibroproliferative repair&#xD;
           and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  elucidate their interrelationship with other molecules forming coordinated yet&#xD;
           misdirected metabolic responses characteristic for fibroproliferative repair.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      After reaching adulthood, the organs of the human body preserve their shape and function over&#xD;
      a long period, making directed repair one of the most important mechanisms throughout&#xD;
      lifetime. Regular wound healing after an injury consists of a well-ordered sequence of&#xD;
      overlapping phases: inflammation, formation of supportive new tissue, re-epithelization and&#xD;
      final regeneration of epithelial and endothelial lining cells, and essentially repeats the&#xD;
      complex process of organ development. In young adults, damage to an organ is frequently&#xD;
      answered by fully regenerative wound healing repeating mechanisms of embryonic organ growth&#xD;
      called &quot;primary&quot; wound healing. Repeated damage in younger individuals may cause &quot;secondary&quot;&#xD;
      wound healing in form of scar formation serving as a rescue program to maintain surface&#xD;
      integrity once epithelial and/or endothelial reorganization has failed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organ failure in the ageing organism, however, is different and essentially represents the&#xD;
      loss of its capacity to achieve an orderly reactivation of organ development. This different&#xD;
      quality of wound healing consists of a combination of chronic inflammation and&#xD;
      fibroproliferative, non-regenerative repair. Its pathology refers to a large group of&#xD;
      diseases involving every organ of the human body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the lung, its most prominent form is characterized by a well-defined histopathology named&#xD;
      usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). Unfortunately, this histopathology, while identifying a&#xD;
      particularly aggressive phenotype of the fibroproliferative repair response itself, does not&#xD;
      allow for an unambiguous clinical diagnosis, as the UIP &quot;pattern&quot; may be found in different&#xD;
      fibrotic diseases of the lung, such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), especially in its&#xD;
      chronic form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, various mechanisms of inflammation which are partly related to the wound healing&#xD;
      response itself, may profoundly intensify the aberrant wound healing response. As a result,&#xD;
      the mechanisms leading to this condition and maintaining its characteristic clinical&#xD;
      appearance are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current investigation belongs to the work package 2 of the RESOLVE study system&#xD;
      (FP7-HEALTH-F4-2008 Contract no. 202047) which contains the clinical study protocol&#xD;
      evaluating different forms of fibrotic repair in the human lung. RESOLVE's main objective is&#xD;
      to identify and characterize clinically validated molecular targets capable of shifting&#xD;
      primary organ repair towards fibroproliferative wound healing. In this pilot study, different&#xD;
      forms of repair of the lung will be prospectively analyzed by means of a concomitant clinical&#xD;
      and biological analysis guided by evaluated functional and radiological measures of clinical&#xD;
      development. The assessments will be made at the beginning of the study period (visit 1),&#xD;
      after three months of prospective observation (visit 2), and after 12 months (end of study)&#xD;
      allowing for a clinically relevant correlation of all biological data obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three general conditions of repair will be chosen for systematic biological analysis as a&#xD;
      result of their clinical diagnosis (histopathology, radiology) and their association with&#xD;
      age:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) occurring almost exclusively at an age of 55-80&#xD;
           years,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (HP), both acute and chronic, occurring at an age of 20-55&#xD;
           years, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal repair in young (18-40 years) and old (older than 55 years) individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      After securing the diagnosis (see below: inclusion/exclusion criteria) and following informed&#xD;
      consent during the screening visit, patients lacking any previous immunosuppressive treatment&#xD;
      (therapy-na√Øve patients) will receive an immunosuppressive therapy with prednisolone (daily&#xD;
      dose of 1 mg/kg BW) for at least three months in order to exclude pathologies dominated by&#xD;
      mechanisms of inflammation. During the screening visit, the results of the histopathological&#xD;
      analysis will be secured, and the clinical and functional history of the disease recorded.&#xD;
      This will include previous medication, the results of previous pulmonary function tests (PFT)&#xD;
      as well as the results of radiological analysis (computed tomography including HR-CT) and lab&#xD;
      testing (excluding collagen vascular disease and securing HP serology).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three months after the screening visit, at visit 1, the functional and radiological stage of&#xD;
      the pulmonary fibrosis will be assessed again, and the patients will be finally enrolled into&#xD;
      the study. In accordance with the findings obtained at the screening visit, and due to the&#xD;
      functional and radiological results obtained at visit 1, the patients will be stratified into&#xD;
      the following investigational groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Limited UIP) Patients with proven UIP and functionally and radiologically less advanced&#xD;
      pulmonary fibrosis (n=12) as defined by histopathology (assessment by two independent and&#xD;
      experienced pathologists not involved in the study) and/or radiology (computed tomography&#xD;
      [CT] scans incl. high-resolution CT, independently assessed by an experienced radiologist not&#xD;
      involved in the study) and pulmonary function tests (PFT). PFT will consist of spirometry,&#xD;
      measurement with bodyplethysmograph, single-breath measurement of carbon monoxide diffusion&#xD;
      capacity and full cardiopulmonary exercise testing including assessment of pulmonary&#xD;
      ventilation and gas exchange at rest and on exertion;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Advanced UIP) Patients with proven UIP (n=12) in a significantly more advanced stage of the&#xD;
      disease as determined by PFT (FVC at least 10 percent and DLCO at least 15 percent lower than&#xD;
      in group A) and CT scan;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Chronic fibrosing Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis, HP) Patients with chronic fibrosing HP&#xD;
      (n=12) diagnosed by histopathology, radiology and lab testing;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group D:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Acute HP) Patients with acute HP (n=9) diagnosed by histopathology, radiology and lab&#xD;
      testing (Group D: acute HP);&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group E:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular Pulmonary Repair 9 young (18-40 years of age) without any clinically evident&#xD;
      pathology and 9 old volunteers (55-80 years of age) without pulmonary fibrosis will serve as&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with UIP and HP will be followed during for a study period of 12 months. The&#xD;
      study period starts with visit 1. In addition to visit 1, two additional visits will be&#xD;
      performed after 3 months (visit 2, functional assessment) and after 12 months (visit 3, end&#xD;
      of study).&#xD;

&#xD;
      Biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lung specimens for biological analysis will be derived from both diagnostic surgical lung&#xD;
      biopsies and transbronchial lung biopsies taken during the bronchoscopies performed at visit&#xD;
      1 and 3. In total, five transbronchial biopsies will be taken at each visit for biological&#xD;
      analysis. All transbronchial lung specimens will be removed under radiologic control from&#xD;
      peripheral lung areas previously specified in accordance with the latest CT scan. The&#xD;
      biopsies taken at visit 3 will be performed in the same lung segment as those taken at visit&#xD;
      1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Except for the results of the latest CT scan, the investigator performing the bronchoscopy&#xD;
      will be blinded for all clinical results obtained during the visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular Biology Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological analysis will be independently performed. All investigators involved in biological&#xD;
      analysis will be blinded for diagnosis and clinical course of the patients and volunteers.&#xD;
      The participants will be solely identifiable by their study identification number (ID). The&#xD;
      study samples will be numbered according to patient ID and sample description provided by the&#xD;
      LIMS. Biologic assessment will include measurement of whole genome transcriptomics, protein&#xD;
      analysis by mass spectrometry and EIA, analysis of DNA methylation status, and microRNA&#xD;
      analysis. The measurements will be based on lung specimens derived from diagnostic surgical&#xD;
      lung biopsies, if possible, and/or from transbronchial biopsies (TbX) taken during a&#xD;
      bronchoscopy at visit 1 and 3 of the study (month 0 and month 12). In addition, BAL fluid&#xD;
      will be stored and used for detection of proteins and lipids. Materials for DNA methylation&#xD;
      analysis will be obtained from both lung tissue and whole blood samples.&#xD;
