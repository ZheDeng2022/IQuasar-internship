      The purpose of this study is to evaluate serial changes of neointimal coverage after&#xD;
      everolimus-eluting stent implantation at 3-, 6- and 12-months by OCT examination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Late and very late stent thrombosis is current main issue after introduction of drug-eluting&#xD;
      stents .Possible causes of these stent thromboses include thrombus formation resulting from&#xD;
      delayed neointimal coverage, spasms occurring at the distal end of the stent implantation&#xD;
      site, positive remodeling of coronary arteries caused by local immune reaction to paclitaxel&#xD;
      or rapamycin, and vascular endothelial damage induced by the polymer. For BMS, neointimal&#xD;
      coverage begins within the first one month after stent implantation and almost completes in&#xD;
      three months. For DES, sirolimus eluting stents (SES) for example, neointimal coverage is&#xD;
      markedly delayed after stent implantation and the exposed stent struts may be largely&#xD;
      attributable to the occurrence of late stent thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, everolimus eluting stents (EES), which have a thinner stent strut layer&#xD;
      and improved polymer biocompatibility, it has been reported that earlier and more normal&#xD;
      neointimal coverage can be achieved compared with other first-generation DESs, SES and&#xD;
      paclitaxel eluting stents (PES). These findings suggest that coverage with vascular&#xD;
      endothelium differs among different DES platforms. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has a&#xD;
      resolution of 15 to 20 μm, which is approximately 10 times higher than that of intravascular&#xD;
      ultrasound (IVUS). It is therefore necessary to use OCT to accurately evaluate&#xD;
      cross-sectional images of the stent struts covered with vascular endothelium. However, no&#xD;
      studies have reported the results of continuous observation and evaluation of EES covered&#xD;
      with endothelium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators investigate time course of neointimal coverage of EES through&#xD;
      detailed evaluation by OCT of neointimal coverage at 3, 6, and 12 months after stent&#xD;
      implantation.&#xD;
