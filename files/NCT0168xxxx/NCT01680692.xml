  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a new regional anesthesia technique would&#xD;
      provide better pain control, patient satisfaction, less narcotic use and no symptoms of foot&#xD;
      drop after knee replacement surgery.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to compare and measure the effects of Ropivicaine given through&#xD;
      catheters located in the femoral and tibial nerves on indices of sensory blockade after total&#xD;
      knee arthroplasties. This is a randomized, prospective study designed to address the primary&#xD;
      research question: Does placing a continuous femoral &amp; tibial catheter infusion lead to&#xD;
      superior analgesia and patient satisfaction during the entire hospital stay? The secondary&#xD;
      research question is: Will selectively placing a continuous tibial catheter decrease the&#xD;
      episodes of transient foot drop to zero? Investigators know from own regional institutional&#xD;
      practices that by performing a continuous femoral with a single shot sciatic nerve block&#xD;
      provides adequate analgesia of the entire leg, but by post-operative day 2 patient's begin to&#xD;
      experience pain with rehabilitation and rest in the posterior-lateral aspect of the knee and&#xD;
      leg secondary to wearing off of the sciatic nerve block anesthetic. Also, it is known that by&#xD;
      blocking the sciatic nerve proximal to its bifurcation may lead to episodes of transient foot&#xD;
      drop due to common peroneal nerve blockage and irritation. It is hypothesized that placement&#xD;
      of continuous catheters in the femoral and tibial nerves would provide better analgesia and&#xD;
      lead to no episodes of foot drop as compared to the patients that receive continuous femoral&#xD;
      and single shot sciatic blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently at Texas Tech Health Science Center-El Paso and University Medical Center, about&#xD;
      95% of patient's undergoing total knee arthroplasty's (TKAs) receives a continuous femoral&#xD;
      infusion and a single shot sciatic with an initial bolus of 30mL (femoral) and 20mL (sciatic)&#xD;
      of Ropivicaine 0.5% and an infusion of Ropivicaine 0.2% at a rate of 10cc/hr (usually started&#xD;
      post-op) for at least the first 48-72 hours post-operatively. For our study, Orthopedic&#xD;
      clinic will provide a copy of the consent form to the subject so that they can review it, and&#xD;
      if interested in participating in the study, the patient can then contact the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator or Study Coordinator directly. After informed consent is obtained, patients will&#xD;
      be randomized during that time using a numbering system enclosed in sealed envelopes. Group 1&#xD;
      will receive a pre-operative continuous femoral catheter and a post-operative single shot&#xD;
      sciatic with both given an initial bolus of 30 mL (femoral) 0.5% Ropivicaine and 20mL&#xD;
      (sciatic) 0.2% Ropivicaine. Following surgery the femoral infusion will be started, which&#xD;
      will be running Ropivicaine 0.2 at 10cc/hr. Group 2 will receive a pre-operative continuous&#xD;
      femoral catheter and a post-operative continuous tibial catheter with an initial bolus of 30&#xD;
      mL 0.5% Ropivicaine (femoral) and 20mL 0.2% Ropivicaine (tibial), which will be followed by&#xD;
      infusions post-operatively running at the same rate and dosage as group 1. All nerve blocks&#xD;
      performed will be placed using a nerve stimulator (with no twitches lower than 0.2mA) under&#xD;
      ultrasound-guidance. Proper catheter placement will be confirmed by injecting 3mL of air and&#xD;
      visualizing by ultrasound. Once confirmed, the bolus dose as mentioned earlier of either&#xD;
      Ropivicaine 0.5% (femoral) or 0.2% (sciatic/tibial) will be injected. All TKA cases will be&#xD;
      performed under general anesthesia with laryngeal mask airway. Considering the fact that by&#xD;
      placing a selective continuous tibial catheter pre-operatively, we run the risk of the&#xD;
      catheter being the surgical field during the case. For this reason, it was decided that&#xD;
      placement after the procedure would be best. Therefore, the patient will be taken back to the&#xD;
      block room post-operatively and a continuous tibial nerve catheter or single shot (depending&#xD;
      on what group assigned) will be placed and bolused using the same technique as previously&#xD;
      described. To detect a 30% reduction in the pain score from 3-4 to a 1-2 would be required&#xD;
      for an observed post-operative pain control difference. In order to achieve a statistically&#xD;
      significant result to detect the previously observed difference, a sample of 38 patients in&#xD;
      each group (total of 76) would be required. Assuming a high consent rate and given the fact&#xD;
      many TKA's it is projected that this study can be completed in approximately 12 months.&#xD;
