  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many people with intellectual disability have challenging behaviour which often has serious&#xD;
      consequences such as the prescription of long term medication, in-patient admissions and&#xD;
      disruption of normal daily activities. Community intellectual disability services may have&#xD;
      difficulties in helping people with challenging behavior. Available research suggests that&#xD;
      Positive Behavior Support (PBS), a training system that teaches staff how to manage these&#xD;
      situations, can benefit service users who may show improvements in challenging behavior and&#xD;
      quality of life. The investigators do not know of any study so far that has examined the&#xD;
      clinical and cost effectiveness of PBS that is provided by staff in routine clinical practice&#xD;
      in community intellectual disability services. If PBS proved to be better than treatment as&#xD;
      usual, it would have important implications for the management of a very vulnerable group of&#xD;
      service users. In this trial, health staff will receive accredited training in PBS available&#xD;
      in a manual written by PBS experts. It will give details of how to understand challenging&#xD;
      behavior and develop a management plan and how to implement it and monitor whether it has&#xD;
      achieved its goals. Twenty community intellectual disability services and 260 service users&#xD;
      with mild to severe intellectual disability and challenging behavior will be invited to take&#xD;
      part in the study. The sample size calculations are based on our pilot study and allow for&#xD;
      non participation of 10% and inflation due to the number of community intellectual disability&#xD;
      teams and staff that will take part. The teams will be randomly allocated into one of two&#xD;
      conditions. Half will be in the PBS arm (but will also have treatment as usual) and half will&#xD;
      be in the treatment as usual only group. The investigators will carry out assessments of&#xD;
      challenging behavior, use of services, quality of life, mental health, aggression and family&#xD;
      and paid carer burden at six and 12 months. The investigators will monitor treatment fidelity&#xD;
      and the investigators will talk to a sample of paid and family carers, service users, staff&#xD;
      and managers about what they think of the treatment and how best the investigators can&#xD;
      deliver it in routine care. The main outcome is reduction in challenging behavior at one year&#xD;
      after the randomization. The investigators will also carry out a health economic evaluation&#xD;
      to examine the costs and consequences of staff training in PBS.&#xD;

    <description>Most community intellectual disability services provide a range of health interventions that include but are not limited to psychiatric assessment and management, nursing support, psychology, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and counselling. There may be some variation in resources but service users with challenging behaviour are likely to receive a range of broadly defined behavioural management and pharmacological interventions. Staff is routinely supervised by their clinical managers weekly.</description>
