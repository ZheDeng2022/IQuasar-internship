        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have given written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have histological or cytological evidence of relapsed malignant glioma (such as&#xD;
             glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma) for&#xD;
             which no treatment of higher priority exists&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Available baseline tumor specimen is required prior to considering participant to&#xD;
                  be enrolled. The original diagnostic tumor tissue is sufficient for this&#xD;
                  inclusion criteria, but where possible, freshly obtained tumor biopsy material&#xD;
                  may be obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Measurable disease to allow assessment of tumor response based on radiographic&#xD;
                  assessment following Macdonald criteria and Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid&#xD;
                  Tumors (RECIST)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have sufficient hepatic, renal, and hematological function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a performance status of â‰¤2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have discontinued all previous therapies for cancer, including chemotherapy,&#xD;
             radiotherapy or other investigational therapy for at least 30 days prior to study&#xD;
             enrollment and recovered from the acute effects of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to swallow tablets and capsules&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For females, reproductive potential must be either terminated (by surgery, radiation,&#xD;
             or menopause) or attenuated by the use of an approved contraceptive method (including&#xD;
             intrauterine or barrier devices) during and for 3 to 6 months after the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male participants must be willing to use contraception during and for 3 to 6 months&#xD;
             after the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received treatment within the last 30 days with a drug that has not received&#xD;
             regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have moderate or severe cardiac disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have the presence of cardiac disease, including a myocardial infarction within 6&#xD;
                  months prior to study entry, unstable angina pectoris, New York Heart Association&#xD;
                  (NYHA) Class III/IV congestive heart failure, or uncontrolled hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have documented major electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities at the investigator's&#xD;
                  discretion (for example, symptomatic or sustained atrial or ventricular&#xD;
                  arrhythmias, second- or third-degree atrioventricular block, bundle branch&#xD;
                  blocks, ventricular hypertrophy, or recent myocardial infarction)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have major abnormalities documented by echocardiography with Doppler (for&#xD;
                  example, moderate or severe heart valve function defect and/or left ventricular&#xD;
                  ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;50%, evaluation based on the institutional lower limit&#xD;
                  of normal)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have predisposing conditions that are consistent with development of aneurysms of&#xD;
                  the ascending aorta or aortic stress (for example, family history of aneurysms,&#xD;
                  Marfan syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve, evidence of damage to the large vessels&#xD;
                  of the heart documented by computerized tomography [CT] scan with contrast)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have current acute or chronic leukemia&#xD;
