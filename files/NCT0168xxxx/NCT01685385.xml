      Difficulty in breathing or increased rate of breathing are common causes of admission to&#xD;
      intensive care unit. This may be due to heart failure, or other causes such as infection in&#xD;
      the lungs. Treating doctors usually perform Chest X-ray, ECG, and other tests to know if&#xD;
      breathlessness is due to heart failure or other cause. Doctors also give medicines to treat&#xD;
      heart failure, or other conditions of the lungs based on the symptoms and investigation&#xD;
      results. BNP is released by heart which is not functioning well. However BNP levels are also&#xD;
      high in case of severe infection.Hence there is equipoise in utility of BNP measurements&#xD;
      among critically ill patients, and it is not a current standard of care. The current cost of&#xD;
      this test (about 1000 rupees per measurement) is high, and hence its utility needs to be&#xD;
      carefully examined before a widespread use. The investigators intend to test the hypothesize&#xD;
      that that on-admission BNP measurements, help clinicians identify CHF early, which may modify&#xD;
      therapeutic decisions, and improve outcomes. The current study is designed with an objective&#xD;
      to determine if on-admission BNP value and availability of its test results to treating&#xD;
      physicians will reduce in-hospital, and 30-day mortality and in-hospital morbidity.&#xD;

      There usually remains a diagnostic uncertainty as differentiation between cardiogenic or&#xD;
      non-cardiogenic cause of dyspnea. Often there are multiple underlying etiologies for acute&#xD;
      onset dyspnea, and their evaluation leads to diagnostic delays, and hence longer hospital&#xD;
      stay. While various clinical symptoms, signs and imaging based investigations are used in&#xD;
      this differentiation, their accuracy remains low, and overlapping features preclude such&#xD;
      differentiation. Echocardiography is an important adjunct in making such differentiation, but&#xD;
      operator skill, and lack of availability of this technique at point of care are barriers in&#xD;
      use of this modality. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a rapidly-assayed, serum biomarker,&#xD;
      has been found to be effective in distinguishing congestive heart failure (CHF) from other&#xD;
      causes of dyspnea in the emergency or urgent care settings. Recently this test has become&#xD;
      available at point of care (Alere Heart-Check). Ease, low cost, and objectivity in&#xD;
      measurement of BNP has led to widespread incorporation of BNP and its precursor NT-pro-BNP&#xD;
      into the clinical evaluation of CHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating levels of BNP/NT-proBNP are normally very low in healthy individuals. In response&#xD;
      to increased myocardial wall stress due to volume- or pressure-overload states (such as in&#xD;
      CHF), the BNP gene is activated in cardiomyocytes. This results in the production of an&#xD;
      intracellular precursor propeptide (proBNP108); further processing of this propeptide results&#xD;
      in release of the biologically inert aminoterminal fragment (NT-proBNP) and the biologically&#xD;
      active BNP.Various studies have been performed to determine cut-off level to make a&#xD;
      differentiation between presence or absence of CHF using this test. BNP level below 50pg/ml&#xD;
      rules out CHF with a negative predictive value of 96%. (3) In the same study by Maisel et al&#xD;
      the diagnostic accuracy of B-type natriuretic peptide to rule in CHF at a cutoff of 100 pg&#xD;
      per milliliter or more was 83.4 percent. However subsequent studies have instead suggested a&#xD;
      multiple cut-point strategy (Less than 100pg/ml rules out CHF (NPV 90%), more than 400 pg/ml&#xD;
      rules in CHF (91% specificity) while intermediate values representing a grey zone.&#xD;
      Individuals with renal dysfunction have elevated BNP levels, and a lower cut-off to exclude&#xD;
      CHF in such patients is 200pg/ml. Individuals with a high BMI have falsely low levels and a&#xD;
      BMI adjusted correction is used (Lower cut-off of 54pg/mL if BMI &gt;35kg/m2). The levels of BNP&#xD;
      as well as NT-Pro-BNP have similar elevations in CHF, later being three times as much higher.&#xD;
      (1) Use of BNP to differentiate CHF from other causes of dyspnea, (4) and ease in its&#xD;
      measurement has resulted in increase in its use in intensive care settings, as point-of-care&#xD;
      testing has a potential to change outcomes. However when the test is used in this setting,&#xD;
      very high BNP levels were detected in critically ill patients with sepsis and shock. In&#xD;
      patients with shock, levels below 1200pg/ml had a negative predictive value of 92% for&#xD;
      cardiogenic shock. Such high levels in patients with compromised systolic function have&#xD;
      questioned utility of this measure to distinguish between CHF and other causes in critical&#xD;
      care settings. It is debated that in critically ill patients, coexisting other organ&#xD;
      dysfunction, rapid changes in volume status, variable bioavailability and burst synthesis of&#xD;
      BNP may all confound interpretation of BNP levels. However despite this confounding, even in&#xD;
      critically ill patients higher values are associated with adverse prognosis, and very low&#xD;
      levels (less than 100pg/ml) will mean a preserved left ventricular function. Thus, while it&#xD;
      is known that BNP really gives useful information, not already available from other clinical,&#xD;
      radiologic and biochemical measurements, what the investigators do not know is if the test&#xD;
      results become available in an intensive care unit setting, will it help treating physicians&#xD;
      to make meaningful clinical decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given above considerations, there is equipoise in utility of BNP measurements among&#xD;
      critically ill patients, and it is not a current standard of care. The current cost of this&#xD;
      test (about 1000 rupees per measurement) is high, and hence its utility needs to be carefully&#xD;
      examined before a widespread use. The investigators intend to test the hypothesize that that&#xD;
      on-admission BNP measurements, help clinicians identify CHF early, which may modify&#xD;
      therapeutic decisions, and improve outcomes. The current study is designed with an objective&#xD;
      to determine if on-admission BNP value and availability of its test results to treating&#xD;
      physicians will reduce in-hospital, and 30-day mortality and in-hospital morbidity.&#xD;
