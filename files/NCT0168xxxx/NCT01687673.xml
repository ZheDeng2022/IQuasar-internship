  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II trial is being developed following the completion of a Phase I study of the&#xD;
      combination of temsirolimus and sorafenib in 25 first-line therapy patients with advanced&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (December 2009 through April 2012). The maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination of temsirolimus is 10 mg IV weekly&#xD;
      plus sorafenib 200 mg (oral, twice daily).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this single-arm phase II study is that the combination of temsirolimus and&#xD;
      sorafenib will achieve a clinically-meaningful median time to progression (TTP) of at least 6&#xD;
      months, with null hypothesis of less than or equal to 3 months, in first-line systemic&#xD;
      therapy for patients with advanced Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A randomized trial would&#xD;
      be required to formally compare the efficacy of this combination to sorafenib alone and will&#xD;
      be indicated if this phase II study achieves a median TTP of at least 6 months. An interim&#xD;
      safety analysis will employ stopping rules after 30% of planned patients have been treated&#xD;
      with at least one dose of protocol therapy to ensure the combination does not confer&#xD;
      excessive toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key aspect of this study will be the requirement of histologic confirmation along with&#xD;
      adequate archival tissue for correlative tissue analyses to explore new biomarkers of&#xD;
      response to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition. Circulating biomarker data&#xD;
      including enumeration of circulating tumor cells (CTC) and measurement of the tumor marker&#xD;
      Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) will be performed at specific time points to evaluate for predictive&#xD;
      value. Specimen banking of tissue, serum, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be&#xD;
      undertaken to enable future novel biomarker studies. Modified RECIST will be performed in&#xD;
      addition to standard RECIST 1.1 to explore for improved imaging predictors of response.&#xD;

             the assistance of a medical translator according to institutional policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. The effects of temsirolimus on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             and because sorafenib - also being used in this trial - is known to be teratogenic,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days of&#xD;
             study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Also, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use two methods adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal plus barrier or two forms of barrier) or abstinence prior to&#xD;
             study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this&#xD;
             study, she needs to inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled&#xD;
             on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, or&#xD;
             be surgically sterile, for the duration of study participation, and for 3 months after&#xD;
             completion of study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Eligibility of patients receiving any medications or substances known to affect or&#xD;
             with potential to affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of temsirolimus and/or&#xD;
             sorafenib will be determined following review of the case by the Study Chair. Efforts&#xD;
             should be made to switch patients who are taking enzyme-inducing anti-convulsant&#xD;
             agents to other medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. mixed histology (mixed HCC-cholangiocarcinoma) tumors if deemed appropriate for HCC&#xD;
             therapy by treating MD&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Mixed tumor histology or fibrolamellar variant tumors are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior systemic or antiangiogenic therapy for HCC (including thalidomide, sorafenib,&#xD;
             sunitinib, or bevacizumab). Prior systemic therapy for other diagnoses is permitted if&#xD;
             greater than 6 months have elapsed since last dose, any prior toxicity has recovered&#xD;
             to ≤ grade 1 by CTCAE v4.0, and treatment was not discontinued for toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior treatment with mTOR inhibitor or other molecularly targeted therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior systemic cytotoxic therapies for HCC (chemoembolization is permitted if&#xD;
             inclusion criteria are met).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Treatment with other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Immunosuppressive medications including systemic corticosteroids unless used for&#xD;
             adrenal replacement, appetite stimulation, acute therapy for asthma or bronchitis&#xD;
             exacerbation (≤ 2 weeks), or antiemesis&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with known HIV infection are ineligible due to risk of pharmacokinetic&#xD;
             interactions between anti-retroviral therapy and the study drugs, as well as potential&#xD;
             for significant immunosuppression and serious infections with mTOR inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients who have undergone liver transplantation are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Uncontrolled hypertension (&gt; 150/90 mmHg).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Uncontrolled hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol &gt; 350 or triglycerides &gt; 300).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Symptomatic brain or bone metastases; prior radiation and/or steroid therapy for brain&#xD;
             or bone metastases (if applicable) must be completed ≥ 2 weeks prior to study&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. History of seizure disorder requiring antiepileptic medication or brain metastases&#xD;
             with seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Serious non-healing wound, ulcer, bone fracture, or abscess.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Major surgical procedure less than 4 weeks from start of protocol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patients requiring chronic anticoagulation with warfarin are excluded. Patients&#xD;
             treated with low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin are eligible if on&#xD;
             a stable dose without evidence of clinically significant bleeding for at least 2 weeks&#xD;
             prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Active second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer or cervical carcinoma in&#xD;
             situ. (Patients with history of malignancy are not considered to have a &quot;currently&#xD;
             active&quot; malignancy if they have completed therapy and are now considered by their&#xD;
             physician to be at less than 30% risk for relapse.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to: Ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;

             infarction within preceding 12 months, cerebrovascular accident within preceding 12&#xD;
             months, pulmonary disease impairing functional status or requiring oxygen, impairment&#xD;
             in gastrointestinal function that may affect or alter absorption of oral medications&#xD;
             (such as malabsorption or history of gastrectomy or bowel resection).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Patients will be excluded if there is any history of allergic reaction(s) attributed&#xD;
             to compounds of similar composition to temsirolimus, sorafenib, their metabolites, or&#xD;
             any component of their formulation (including excipients and polysorbate 80). This&#xD;
             includes hypersensitivity to macrolide antibiotics due to potential for&#xD;
             cross-reactivity with temsirolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Pregnant or lactating women are excluded from this study because temsirolimus and&#xD;
             sorafenib are drugs with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with temsirolimus or sorafenib, breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother is receiving temsirolimus/sorafenib treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Patients who require prohibited medications with potential for serious interactions&#xD;
             with protocol therapy, and who cannot have therapeutic substitution are excluded.&#xD;
             Patients receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of&#xD;
             CYP450 enzyme(s) are ineligible. Lists of prohibited medications and substances known,&#xD;
             or with the potential to interact with the specified CYP450 enzyme(s) isoenzymes are&#xD;
             provided in Appendices 6-9 Prohibited Medications&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Psychiatric illness, other significant medical illness, or social situation which, in&#xD;
             the investigator's opinion, would limit compliance or ability to comply with study&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
