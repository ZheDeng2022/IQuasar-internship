      This study on the effect of PectaSol-C Modified Citrus Pectin (MCP) with subjects selected on&#xD;
      the basis of documented PC post local therapy, and biochemical relapse, with linear&#xD;
      progression of at least 3 PSA tests in at least 3 months. After initial screening, treatment&#xD;
      {4.8 grams (6 capsules) three times a day away from meals} will continue for 6 months&#xD;
      provided patients are showing benefit and tolerating the therapy well. Patient tolerability&#xD;
      of MCP will be assessed by comparing the results of monthly self-assessment diaries with&#xD;
      baseline assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men, except for non melanoma skin cancer. It&#xD;
      is the second leading cause of cancer related death in men. About 33% of prostate cancer&#xD;
      patients treated with primary therapy (surgery or radiation) will recur in the form of non&#xD;
      metastatic biochemically relapsed prostate cancer (BRPC-M0). In these patients, PSA is rising&#xD;
      while scans are negative for metastasis. Recent surveys demonstrated that approximately 40%&#xD;
      of prostate cancer patients use various complementary and alternative medicine modalities as&#xD;
      a component of therapy. Currently, there is no standard treatment for biochemical failure&#xD;
      with proven benefits. Patients are being encouraged to enroll in clinical trials to help&#xD;
      establish standards of care. Studies have shown that in 80% of patients with BRPC-M0, PSA&#xD;
      will rise by at least 25% every 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Native pectin is a complex carbohydrate soluble fiber. Dietary fibers, such as pectin, have&#xD;
      been shown to have positive effects on a wide spectrum of pathological conditions. Their&#xD;
      positive influence on human health is explained by their antioxidative, hypocholesterolemic,&#xD;
      and anticancer effects. MCP is composed of short, slightly-branched, carbohydrate chains&#xD;
      derived from the soluble albedo fraction of citrus fruit peels, which have been altered by&#xD;
      decreasing the molecular weight and degree of esterification using pH, temperature, and a&#xD;
      controlled enzymatic process. This specific modification is critical as it allows for the&#xD;
      absorption of MCP into the circulatory system and ensures its targeted bioactivity throughout&#xD;
      the body. MCP is relatively rich in galactose and thus antagonizes the binding protein&#xD;
      galectin-3 which results in suppression of cancer cell aggregation, adhesion, and metastasis.&#xD;
      MCP acts as a ligand for galectin-3, which plays a major role in tumor formation and&#xD;
      progression. It has been shown using a combination of fluorescence microscopy, flow&#xD;
      cytometry, and atomic force microscopy, that pectin galactan specifically binds to the&#xD;
      recombinant form of human galectin-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MCP showed anti-metastatic effects on cancer cells in multiple in vitro and in vivo studies.&#xD;
      MCP inhibits carbohydrate mediated tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis via effects on&#xD;
      galectin-3 function as demonstrated in an animal study on MCP's inhibition of breast and&#xD;
      colon cancer progression. Results demonstrated a 70.2% reduction in breast tumor growth, a&#xD;
      66% reduction in breast angiogenesis, and 0% breast to lung metastasis compared to 100% in&#xD;
      the control group; 0% colon to liver metastasis compared to 60% in the control group; and 25%&#xD;
      colon to lymph metastasis compared to 100% in the control group. In an earlier study oral&#xD;
      intake of MCP had been shown to act as a potent inhibitor of spontaneous prostate carcinoma&#xD;
      metastasis in an animal model, demonstrating a significant 56% reduction in lung metastases.&#xD;
      Human cancer cell lines (LNCaP androgen dependent &amp; PC3 androgen independent) and mouse&#xD;
      prostate cancer cell lines (CASP2-1 androgen dependent and CASP1-1 androgen independent)&#xD;
      treated with 1% MCP showed the following cytotoxicity due to induced apoptosis: 52.28% in&#xD;
      LNCaP; 48.16% in PC3; 23.03% in CASP2-1; and 49.01% in CASP1-1.13 The effects of MCP on&#xD;
      cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions mediated by carbohydrate-recognition were investigated&#xD;
      by looking at MCP-inhibited B16-F1 melanoma cells adhesion and aggregation. MCP was shown to&#xD;
      inhibit anchorage-independent growth of B16-F1 cells. These results indicate that&#xD;
      carbohydrate-recognition by cell surface galectin-3 is involved in cell-extracellular matrix&#xD;
      interaction and plays a role in anchorage-independent growth as well as the in vivo&#xD;
      embolization of tumor cells. The modulation of the lung colonization of B16-F1 melanoma cells&#xD;
      by MCP was first observed in 1992 when injection of MCP significantly decreased B16-F1&#xD;
      experimental metastasis (greater than 90%). Galectin-3 participation in the adhesion of the&#xD;
      MDA-MB-435 cells to the endothelium was observed by the clustering of galectin-3 on&#xD;
      endothelial cells at the sites of the contact with tumor cells, suggesting its potential&#xD;
      functional significance for anti-adhesive therapy of cancer metastasis. The anti-metastatic&#xD;
      effect of MCP has also been shown in reduced liver metastasis in a dose-dependent manner. The&#xD;
      use of MCP in combination with the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin has demonstrated an&#xD;
      increased cytotoxicity effect of inducing rapid cell death in prostate cancer cell lines&#xD;
      DU-145 (androgen independent) through apoptosis, and in LNCaP (androgen dependant) through&#xD;
      cell cycle arrest (G2-M arrest). These results show promise for the use of MCP with&#xD;
      doxorubicin as an adjuvant to chemotherapy which may allow for lower dosage of the cancer&#xD;
      drug to be used with less toxicity. A human clinical pilot trial with MCP showed an increase&#xD;
      in prostate specific antigen doubling time, a marker of slowing the progression of prostate&#xD;
      cancer. Clinical research on MCP also demonstrated a significant improvement in quality of&#xD;
      life and stabilization of disease for patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to its therapeutic roles against cancer, MCP has been shown to remove toxic&#xD;
      metals from the body without affecting essential minerals. In a clinical study, baseline&#xD;
      levels of heavy metals and essential minerals were established with 24-hours urine collection&#xD;
      prior to oral administration of MCP. 24-hours urine collection was repeated on days 1 and 6.&#xD;
      Urinary excretion of lead, mercury, cadmium, and arsenic increased significantly, essential&#xD;
      minerals were not changed significantly and no side effects were reported. In a hospital&#xD;
      study in China, children with lead toxicity were given MCP. Their blood serum levels went&#xD;
      down while corresponding lead levels in their urine increased significantly, without side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MCP has immunostimulatory properties as demonstrated in human blood samples, including the&#xD;
      activation of functional NK cells against K562 leukemic cells in culture: Unsaturated&#xD;
      oligogalacturonic acids appear to be the immunostimulatory carbohydrates in MCP. Human blood&#xD;
      samples collected from healthy volunteers were incubated with increasing concentrations of&#xD;
      MCP and antibodies. After 24-hours, blood-antibody mix was lysed and run on a flow cytometer&#xD;
      using a 3-color protocol and the % of activated T-cytotoxic cell subset, B-cell, and&#xD;
      NK-cells, and % increase over untreated control calculated and a significant dose dependent&#xD;
      activation was seen. The ability of the activated NK cells to induce leukemia cell death was&#xD;
      analyzed by co-incubating MCP-treated lymphocytes with K562 T-cell leukemia cells and induced&#xD;
      leukemia cell death was determined to be greater than 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MCP has been demonstrated to be protective in experimental nephropathy with modulation of&#xD;
      early proliferation and later galectin-3 expression, apoptosis and fibrosis by experimentally&#xD;
      modulating galectin-3 in folic acid (FA)-induced acute kidney injury. Mice were pre-treated&#xD;
      with normal or 1% MCP-supplemented drinking water one week before FA injection. During the&#xD;
      initial injury phase, all FA treated mice lost weight whilst their kidneys enlarged secondary&#xD;
      to the renal insult; these gross changes were significantly lessened in the MCP group but&#xD;
      this was not associated with significant changes in galectin-3 expression. At a histological&#xD;
      level, MCP clearly reduced renal cell proliferation but did not affect apoptosis. Later,&#xD;
      during the recovery phase at two weeks, MCP-treated mice demonstrated reduced galectin-3 in&#xD;
      association with decreased renal fibrosis, macrophages, proinflammatory cytokine expression&#xD;
      and apoptosis. Galectin-3 inhibition by MCP was demonstrated to block Aldosterone (Aldo)&#xD;
      induced collagen type I synthesis. Rats were treated with Aldo-salt combined MCP for 3 weeks.&#xD;
      Hypertensive Aldo-treated rats presented vascular hypertrophy, inflammation, fibrosis, and&#xD;
      increased aortic Gal-3 expression. MCP treatment reversed all the above effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MCP is affirmed as GRAS (generally regarded as safe) under the US Code of Federal Regulation&#xD;
      21CFR184.1588.&#xD;
