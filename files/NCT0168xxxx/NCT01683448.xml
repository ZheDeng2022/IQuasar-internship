      This study will be a retrospective study. The patient data from the electronic medical&#xD;
      records and existing database will be collected and analyzed. Primary endpoints will be&#xD;
      postoperative mortality (within 30 days) and overall complications and length of hospital&#xD;
      stay. The secondary endpoints will be myocardial infarction, cardiac death, CHF, arrhythmia,&#xD;
      ischemia, stroke, neurological complications, length of ICU stay, re-admission rate,&#xD;
      infections, pulmonary complications, length of intubation time, length of ventilation time,&#xD;
      and acute renal failure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year about 694,000 Americans have open-heart surgery including valve repairs, valve&#xD;
      replacements, heart transplants, and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery [1]. The&#xD;
      reported incidence of perioperative complications in these cardiac surgery patients is 4.5%&#xD;
      while the prevalence varied from1.6% to 14.1% [2,3]. As the population ages, increased&#xD;
      numbers of elderly patients with more advanced cardiac diseases and comorbidities are being&#xD;
      referred for cardiac surgery. For these patients, postoperative cardiovascular complications&#xD;
      (cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), ischemia, congestive heart failure (CHF),&#xD;
      arrhythmia, stroke, and acute renal failure (ARF)) represent the major postoperative&#xD;
      complications [4-6]. These complications translate into increased mortality, prolonged&#xD;
      hospital stay and estimated costs exceeding $20 billion annually [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      These events may be triggered by surgical stress responses that result in increased plasma&#xD;
      levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine [8], myocardial oxygen supply demand imbalance, and&#xD;
      plaque rupture [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, alfa2-agonists, Aspirin, statins, nitrates, anti-platelet&#xD;
      medications and anticoagulation medications have been widely used in patients with coronary&#xD;
      artery disease, hypertension and other heart diseases. Beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and&#xD;
      Aspirin statins have also been shown to have a positive impact on the outcomes of surgical&#xD;
      and non-surgical treatments [10-11]. However, there are other studies which were unable to&#xD;
      demonstrate the positive results of these medications on post-operative outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the previous studies referenced above, we propose that the use of perioperative&#xD;
      medications (Betablockers, ACE inhibitors, alfa2-agonists, Aspirin, statins, nitrates,&#xD;
      anti-platelet medications, and anticoagulation medications) may provide cardiac protection&#xD;
      for cardiac surgical patients. The specific aim of this study is to retrospectively&#xD;
      investigate whether perioperative medication use is associated with decreases in the&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative cardiovascular complications in patients undergoing elective&#xD;
      cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a retrospective study. The patient data from the electronic medical&#xD;
      records and existing database will be collected and analyzed. Primary endpoints will be&#xD;
      postoperative mortality (within 30 days) and overall complications and length of hospital&#xD;
      stay. The secondary endpoints will be myocardial infarction, cardiac death, CHF, arrhythmia,&#xD;
      ischemia, stroke, neurological complications, length of ICU stay, re-admission rate,&#xD;
      infections, pulmonary complications, length of intubation time, length of ventilation time,&#xD;
      and acute renal failure.&#xD;
