      The Environmental Polymorphisms Registry (EPR) Health and Exposure Survey is designed to&#xD;
      gather health, family history of disease, environmental exposures and lifestyle data on adult&#xD;
      EPR subjects. The EPR is a registry established to collect and store DNA samples from 20,000&#xD;
      volunteers from North Carolina and to serve as a resource to scientist investigating&#xD;
      genotype-driven translational research of chronic conditions. Under this new protocol, we&#xD;
      will administer a health and exposures survey to all EPR subjects. The information collected&#xD;
      in the survey will be used to better characterize the EPR population thus making it more&#xD;
      useful to NIEHS researchers. The survey contains approximately 200 questions. Data from the&#xD;
      survey will help researchers develop hypotheses, design follow-up studies, and select&#xD;
      appropriate subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey will be administered to EPR subjects using a modified version of the Dillman Total&#xD;
      Design Method (TDM) for surveys. This method requires following specific time-dependent steps&#xD;
      for survey administration that incorporate both self- and phone administration and other&#xD;
      types of phone and mail contact. The goal of TDM is to maximize subject response rates.&#xD;

      The Environmental Polymorphisms Registry (EPR) Health and Exposure Survey is designed to&#xD;
      collect health, family history of disease, environmental exposures and lifestyle data on EPR&#xD;
      participants. The EPR was established to collect and store DNA specimens from 20,000&#xD;
      participants and to serve as a resource for scientists investigating genotype-driven&#xD;
      translational research of chronic health conditions. Under this protocol, we will administer&#xD;
      the approximately 200 question Health and Exposure Survey to EPR participants. The&#xD;
      information will be used to better characterize the EPR population, thus making it more&#xD;
      useful in answering research questions related to gene-environment interactions. Data from&#xD;
      the survey will help researchers to advance clinical research by developing new ways of&#xD;
      preventing, diagnosing, and treating common diseases such as cardiovascular disease, asthma,&#xD;
      and diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phases I and II, the survey was administered to EPR participants using a modified&#xD;
      version of the Dillman Total Design Method (TDM) for surveys. This method requires following&#xD;
      specific steps for survey administration that incorporate web-based, paper and phone&#xD;
      administration. The rationale for using the TDM is to maximize participant response rates.&#xD;
      During Phase III, the survey may be distributed to new EPR participants (e.g., those who were&#xD;
      not enrolled in the EPR at the time of the Phase I and II survey administrations) for&#xD;
      self-administration at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators may select and contact participants for follow-up studies based upon health,&#xD;
      exposure, or disease status information; this includes responses to the EPR Health and&#xD;
      Exposure Survey. Participation in follow-up studies is completely voluntary. Participants can&#xD;
      decide at the time they are contacted if they would like to enroll in the follow-up study.&#xD;
      Their decision whether or not to participate in a follow-up study will not affect their&#xD;
      participation in the EPR.&#xD;
