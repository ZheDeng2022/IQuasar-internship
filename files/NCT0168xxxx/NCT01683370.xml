      STUDY AIMS Based on prospectively collected information on ear temperatures, ANC values,&#xD;
      emergency calls and consultations for fever, and on hospitalizations for FN in children and&#xD;
      adolescents with cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to describe the frequency of episodes of FN, and of other clinically relevant FN-related&#xD;
           measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to compare these frequencies and measures in reality vs. applying Bernese standard&#xD;
           limits for defining fever (ear temperature ≥39.0°C)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to compare these frequencies and measures applying the Bernese standard limit of ≥39.0°C&#xD;
           (LimitStandard) vs. a range of hypothetically lower limits defining fever (LimitLow)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine if it would be useful to perform an interventional study on the question of&#xD;
           different fever limits, powered to study both efficacy (frequency of FN) and safety (AE&#xD;
           in delayed FN diagnosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to use the platform of this prospective study to explore if the serum level of cortisol&#xD;
           is associated with adverse events in FN&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS In children and adolescents with cancer, hypothetically modifying the definitions&#xD;
      of fever from ear temperature 39.0°C to lower limits would&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increase the rate of FN episodes diagnosed during chemotherapy (primary endpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increase the rate of other clinically important FN-related measures related to&#xD;
           chemotherapy exposure time (secondary endpoints 1,2,3) and outcome/treatment-related&#xD;
           measures during treatment of FN episodes diagnosed in reality (secondary endpoints&#xD;
           4,5,6).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  not relevantly decrease the proportion of FN with AE (secondary endpoint 7).&#xD;
