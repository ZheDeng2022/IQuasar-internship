  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire works in measuring eating&#xD;
      behavior in adolescent and young adult survivors of central nervous system (CNS) tumors. The&#xD;
      Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire is comprised of three factors, including cognitive&#xD;
      restraint, uncontrolled eating, and emotion eating. The Eating Questionnaire - Ecological&#xD;
      Momentary Assessment method measures a patient's recent experiences and behavior, such as&#xD;
      eating behavior, as they continue their daily living. Giving the Three-Factor Eating&#xD;
      Questionnaire and the Eating Questionnaire - Ecological Momentary Assessment may help&#xD;
      researchers measure eating behaviors more effectively in adolescent and young adult survivors&#xD;
      of CNS tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES I. Evaluate whether the factor structure of the adapted Eating&#xD;
      Questionnaire-Ecological Momentary Assessment (EQ-EMA), which has been modified for real time&#xD;
      assessment, will be similar to the factor structures for cognitive restraint (CR) and&#xD;
      uncontrollable eating (UE) factors assessed by the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire-R18v2&#xD;
      (TFEQ-R18v2) in a sample of adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors of childhood central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) tumors in the United States (US).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I. To validate the original TFEQ-R18v2 in a sample of AYA survivors of&#xD;
      childhood CNS tumors in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the association of the original TFEQ-R18v2 with self-reported body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the association of the original TFEQ-R18v2 with fruits and vegetables,&#xD;
      fiber, and fat intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the association of EQ-EMA with self-reported BMI. V. To determine the&#xD;
      association of EQ-EMA with fruits and vegetables, fiber, and fat intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients complete the TFEQ-R18v2 questionnaire, a dietary intake assessment, and the&#xD;
      EQ-EMA questionnaire online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients complete the EQ-EMA questionnaire, a dietary intake assessment and the&#xD;
      TFEQ-R18v2 questionnaire.&#xD;

             conversations (excluding individuals who may experience severe cognitive impairments&#xD;
             because participants will need to provide assent [if &lt; 18 years old] or consent [if &gt;=&#xD;

             determined to not be severely cognitive impaired if the participant is able to respond&#xD;
             to basic questions such as their age, whether or not they have internet access, and&#xD;
