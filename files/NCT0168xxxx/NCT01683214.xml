  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting this study to test the usefulness of a new type of analysis&#xD;
      of electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings called brain network activation or BNA. BNA&#xD;
      allows to identify patterns of activation in brain networks and to track their changes over&#xD;
      time. The investigators want to examine the possible role of brain network activation (BNA)&#xD;
      in the diagnosis of mood disorders and predicting improvement over time. The procedure&#xD;
      conducted with patients diagnosed with a mood disorder will be compared to people who do not&#xD;
      have a mood disorder.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Novel approach to ascertain use of BNA strategy and technology for the use in confirming&#xD;
      diagnosis and predicting effect of specific treatment(s)in the various stages of&#xD;
      affective/mood disorders. The goal is to develop non-invasive technology to confirm diagnosis&#xD;
      via biological outcomes, and to study the preliminary data of predicting&#xD;
      response/non-response to specific interventions before clinical effects are shown.&#xD;
