      This study is designed to investigate the presence and absence of abnormal heart muscle&#xD;
      contractions during sickle cell crises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked to do echocardiography during and after your admission to the hospital. We&#xD;
      will compare tow pictures and study the differences.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common genetic disorder of hemoglobin synthesis. Although&#xD;
      sickle disease is globally spread it is more common in sub-Saharan Africa, India, Saudi&#xD;
      Arabia and Mediterranean countries1. In Saudi Arabia, the prevalence of sickle cell disease&#xD;
      id 24 per 10,000 with a higher prevalence in eastern province 145 per 10,0002.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaso-occlusive crisis is the principal presentation of SCD3. Acute pain is the primary&#xD;
      and most common symptom of vaso-occlusive crisis4. Pain management and fluid resuscitation&#xD;
      are the mainstay therapy for the treatment of vaso-occlusive crisis5. Pulmonary edema has&#xD;
      been reported as a complication of fluid therapy during acute crisis management6. However,&#xD;
      the exact mechanism of pulmonary edema in this population is not fully understood. Recent&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated the presence of diastolic dysfunction in patients with SCD.&#xD;
      Diastolic dysfunction was reported in 18% of patients with SCD7. These studies were performed&#xD;
      when the patients were not in vaso-occlusive crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis: Previous studies have shown that the prevalence of diastolic dysfunction is&#xD;
      18% (14-17). These studies have evaluated the general population of SCD without the&#xD;
      distention whether these evaluations were made during the acute crisis or not. Others have&#xD;
      also demonstrated increased pulmonary pressure in this patient population (32,33) . We&#xD;
      hypothesize that the degree of diastolic dysfunction gets worse during acute vaso-occlusive&#xD;
      crisis and may translate to higher pulmonary artery pressure and/or development of pulmonary&#xD;
      edema during fluid therapy Study Area/Setting King Abdulaziz Hospital Alhasa&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective if the study is to evaluate the presence and the degree of diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction during the Vaso-occlusive crisis of sickle cell disease. This will be achieved by&#xD;
      evaluating multiple echocardiography parameters in accordance with the American Society of&#xD;
      Echocardiography (ASE) Guidelines 10. These parameters include: Mitral valve inflow&#xD;
      Hemodynamic E/A ratio and deceleration time(DT), septal and lateral mitral annular velocities&#xD;
      (e')by tissue Doppler, and left atrial volume. According to these parameters the diastolic&#xD;
      function can be evaluated as normal or abnormal. If abnormal then the diastolic dysfunction&#xD;
      can be subsequently classified into impaired relaxation, pseudo-normalization and restrictive&#xD;
      physiology(10-13). These parameters are age related (see table 1). The La volume will be&#xD;
      measured by area by Biplane area-length method according to the formula (0.85) *( A1*A2/L)&#xD;
      Where is A1 is left atrial volume in 4chamer view, A2 is left atrial volume in 2 chamber view&#xD;
      and L is the length measured form the back wall of the left atrium to the mitral valve hinge&#xD;
      point(14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The grading of diastolic dysfunction will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Grade I (impaired relaxation): E/A&lt; 0.8, DT&gt;200 ms, E/e' &lt;/= 8 and LA volume &gt;34 ml/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Grade II (pseudo-normalization): E/A=0.8- 1.5, DT= 160-200 ms, E/e' = 9-12 and LA volume&#xD;
           &gt;34 ml/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Grade II (restrictive physiology): E/A &gt;2, DT&lt;160 ms, E/e'&gt;/=13 and LA volume &gt;34 ml/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. In case of overlap of these parameters so that no single category can be assigned the&#xD;
           diastolic function will be categorized as abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pulmonary artery pressure will be determined non-invasively on echocardiography by&#xD;
      measuring tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity and adding the estimated right atrial pressure&#xD;
      (15-17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary edema will be diagnosed either clinically by the presence of fine inspiratory&#xD;
      crepitations on chest examination and high jugular venous pressure, and radio graphically by&#xD;
      the presence of venous congestion and/or Kerley B-lines after confirming the finding by&#xD;
      consultant radiologist oncall (18-20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaso-occlusive crisis will be diagnosed clinically be the presence of the classical&#xD;
      symptoms of pain and dehydration in the absence of alternative diagnosis (21-23).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controls: The follow up echo (second echo) will be used as a baseline to compare the findings&#xD;
      in the acute crisis to. As it is difficult to decide who of the patients with SCD will&#xD;
      develop the acute crisis, we decided to recruit patients presenting in acute crisis and redo&#xD;
      the echo as a follow up and use the follow up echo as a baseline looking at the same&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Prospective cross sectional study Sample Size 50% probability of having the&#xD;
      outcome of interest. Assuming 10% drop rate the number of needed subject would be 216&#xD;
      patients to achieving 95% confidence, 7 % margin of error.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Technique A consecutive inpatient admission to medical ward will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study according to inclusion and exclusion criteria mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management and Analysis Plan The SPSS for Windows 19.0 programme (SPSS Inc, Chicago,&#xD;
      Illinois) will be used for statistical analysis. The chi-square test was used to analyze&#xD;
      categorical variables and the Student's t test was used to analyze parametric variables. A&#xD;
      p-value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
