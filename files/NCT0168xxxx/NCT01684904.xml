  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this phase II study is to investigate the feasibility, toxicity and efficacy of a&#xD;
      regimen incorporating a proven systemic regimen, carboplatin /paclitaxel, with conformal&#xD;
      proton modality, followed by definitive surgery. In most combined-modality trials to date,&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens have included cisplatin, usually in conjunction with 5-fluorouracil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In designing the regimen, the investigators attempt to improve on the standard&#xD;
      cisplatin/5-fluorouracil regimen in several ways. First, full-dose paclitaxel is added to the&#xD;
      regimen. This agent has activity against advanced esophageal cancer and is also a potent&#xD;
      radiosensitizer. Second, the substitution of carboplatin for cisplatin has resulted in&#xD;
      reduced toxicity of various combination regimens similar to that used by CROSS trial and&#xD;
      allows for easier administration in the outpatient setting.4 Third, for localized esophageal&#xD;
      cancer, dose distribution patterns achievable with proton beam could potentially offer&#xD;
      important clinical advantages relative to those achievable with x-rays (photons).19 Based on&#xD;
      this, the investigators believe that this study should be conducted with the radiation&#xD;
      modality that offers the best dosimetry achievable at our institution.&#xD;
