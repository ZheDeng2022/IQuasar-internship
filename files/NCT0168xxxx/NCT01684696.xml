  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women. Lung cancer is unique&#xD;
      because of racial disparity, persistent mortality rate, and social stigma. Lung cancer stigma&#xD;
      (LCS) and difficult patient-clinician communication may be an underlying factor in health&#xD;
      disparities in lung cancer. The purpose of this study is to PILOT test, in a diverse sample&#xD;
      of lung cancer patients the effectiveness of the mHealth Tool for Lung Cancer patients&#xD;
      (mHealthTLC), an interactive, immersive 3-dimensional iPad application that allows&#xD;
      individuals to experience first person virtual visits with their clinicians, to improve&#xD;
      patient-clinician communication, decrease LCS, and promote optimal self-management. The study&#xD;
      hypotheses are that patients who receive the mHealth TLC will improve their ability to&#xD;
      communicate effectively with their clinicians and will report decreased stigma related to&#xD;
      their lung cancer diagnosis compared to the attention control group.&#xD;

      This is a two arm experimental design PILOT test of the mHealth Tool for Lung Cancer patients&#xD;
      (mHealthTLC) an intervention to improve patient-clinician communication, decrease lung cancer&#xD;
      stigma, and decrease lung cancer symptom scores. Patients will be assigned to either the&#xD;
      mHealth TLC group or the Attention Control Group (ACG). Interventions in both groups will be&#xD;
      delivered online or by iPad in a research office in the clinician's building prior to each&#xD;
      visit. Assessments will be done immediately after each visit in the same research room.&#xD;
      Intervention and assessment pre-visit is expected to take less than one hour, the&#xD;
      intervention is expected to take 30mins, and post assessment is expected to take 30 minutes.&#xD;
      A follow-up assessment will be done at 3 months from enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      mhealth TLC group will meet with a nurse just before each of 4 clinician visits and use the&#xD;
      mHealth TLC on an iPad with an interactive, immersive 3-dimensional (3-D) intervention that&#xD;
      allows individuals to experience virtual visits with their clinicians. The mHealth TLC&#xD;
      provides engagement and experiential learning by delivering important information about&#xD;
      symptom management and provides the opportunity to practice a new communication strategy in&#xD;
      ever increasing complex situations with a virtual coach, receptionist, assistant, and&#xD;
      clinician.During the mHealthTLC the patient will enter a virtual clinic office, travel&#xD;
      through the different aspects of a typical clinic visit, and interact with office staff and&#xD;
      clinicians that are represented by avatars. The avatars will be designed to reflect ethnic&#xD;
      and cultural diversity. First person is the preferred format for health teaching because the&#xD;
      patient is active as self and not represented as an avatar. The first person vantage point&#xD;
      facilitates the immersion and immediacy of the experience. Key aspects of mHealthTLC include&#xD;
      informational videos about lung cancer (i.e. etiology, diagnosis, treatment, symptoms) and&#xD;
      LCS. Blame and self-blame will be addressed, information about the role of addiction,&#xD;
      social/cultural factors, and tobacco industry influence on smoking behaviors will be&#xD;
      highlighted. Information and training will be provided and patients will be able to&#xD;
      experience practiced interaction in ever increasing complex situations with avatars (i.e.,&#xD;
      receptionist, medical assistant, and clinician). A &quot;virtual coach&quot; will accompany the patient&#xD;
      through the virtual visit and will provide information and coaching (as needed). The&#xD;
      advantages to adding a virtual coach or avatar include the availability of an always-live&#xD;
      agent and the capability of customizing the coach to represent an ideal social model for a&#xD;
      particular user or group of users.Flexibility exists in how to design not only how the coach&#xD;
      will appear but also how the coach will sound - with an appropriate voice and engaging&#xD;
      non-verbal communication). This approach contributes to cultural and ethnic sensitivity. As&#xD;
      the patient attempts to communicate and receive information appropriate for a self-management&#xD;
      plan, they will receive &quot;points&quot; for successful communication. A cumulative score and&#xD;
      explanation will be given at the end of the virtual visit. During the visit the participant&#xD;
      will identify specific topics and questions that they want to address during their visit with&#xD;
      their real clinician; they will receive a printout of their priority questions that they can&#xD;
      take into the visit with their real clinician. The research nurse will review the score, the&#xD;
      priority questions, and the overall virtual experience. Virtual environments for learning are&#xD;
      sufficiently promising that further investment and development of this type of research is&#xD;
      warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attention control group (ACG)- Patients assigned to the ACG will meet with a nurse and&#xD;
      receive the informational videos from the mHealth TLC on an iPad before 4 clinician visits&#xD;
      with assessments after each clinician visit. An effort will be made to match the intervention&#xD;
      condition on salience, credibility, and contact time.&#xD;

    <description>The Medical Communication Competence Scale (MCCS) measures patients' perceptions of their competence to effectively communicate. The Patients' Self-Competence Subscale of the MCCS has 16-items with a 5 point Likert-type scaling of 5 (important) to 1 (unimportant). Higher scores indicate greater perceived self-competence. The Quality of Physician-Patient Interaction (QQPPI) measures distinct domains that establish a high quality clinician-provider interaction (i.e.,information exchange, patient involvement, and sharing in the decision making process). Fourteen items are summed to yield a total score; higher scores indicate increased quality of communication as perceived by the patient.</description>

    <description>The Cataldo Lung Cancer Stigma Scale (CLCSS) will be used to assess stigma. The CLCSS is a 31 item measure with each item rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree). Higher values indicate higher levels of LCS.The CLCSS was found to be a reliable and valid measure with a diverse sample of people with lung cancer. Construct validity was supported by expected relationships with related constructs: self-esteem, depression, social support, and social conflict. The total scale Cronbach alpha coefficient was 0.96, the Cronbach alphas for the four subscales were: stigma/shame, 0.96; social isolation, 0.95; discrimination, 0.92; and smoking 0.76.</description>

    <description>Lung Cancer Symptoms - Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) measures the physical and functional dimensions of persons with lung cancer. The scale has 9 items: six measuring major symptoms for lung cancer (appetite loss, fatigue, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, pain) and three summary items related to total symptoms. The item scale is 0 (best) and 100 (worst). An average of all 9 items is the total score.</description>
