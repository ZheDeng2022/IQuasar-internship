      This study is aimed at evaluating whether the computer-based cognitive exercises in the&#xD;
      Thinking Skills for Work (TSW) program are critical to improving work and cognitive outcomes&#xD;
      in consumers with serious mental illness and cognitive impairment enrolled in supported&#xD;
      employment (SE), or whether a streamlined version of TSW without this component (the&#xD;
      Cognitive Skills for Work (CSW) program) is equally effective for some or all consumers. An&#xD;
      RCT will be conducted at two sites (Mental Health Center of Greater Manchester in New&#xD;
      Hampshire and Thresholds Inc. in Illinois) with 244 consumers randomly assigned to one of two&#xD;
      groups (122 each, with approximately 122 participants having schizophrenia or schizoaffective&#xD;
      disorder and 122 of the participants having other diagnoses): 1) TSW, or 2) CSW. The TSW and&#xD;
      CSW programs will be delivered by the same Cognitive Specialists, who will work as members of&#xD;
      the SE team to integrate cognitive and vocational services. All participants will continue to&#xD;
      receive SE services. Participants will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment at 8 months&#xD;
      (after completion of the active teaching components of TSW or CSW), and at 16 and 24 months&#xD;
      post-baseline to evaluate cognitive functioning, symptoms, and quality of life. All work&#xD;
      outcomes will be tracked weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a supplementary study, commencing in September 2015, will assess a promising&#xD;
      biomarker for understanding the mechanisms underlying the effects of cognitive remediation,&#xD;
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), in new enrollees in the parent R01 study. This&#xD;
      supplement will complement the aims of the parent R01 by shedding light on possible&#xD;
      mechanisms related to how TSW works and for whom, thereby informing efforts to refine and&#xD;
      improve the program, as well as targeting individuals who fail to benefit. The supplement&#xD;
      will take place at the same sites as the parent R01.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unemployment is a major burden for people with severe mental illness (SMI) such as&#xD;
      schizophrenia, with competitive work rates typically between 10-20%. Over the past two&#xD;
      decades, supported employment (SE) has been shown to improve competitive work in persons with&#xD;
      SMI, and it is now considered an evidence-based practice (EBP). However, there is a need to&#xD;
      improve the effectiveness of SE, as 30-60% of consumers work little or not at all, and jobs&#xD;
      are often brief and end unsuccessfully. Cognitive remediation, when combined with vocational&#xD;
      rehabilitation, has shown promise for improving work outcomes, including in consumers in SE.&#xD;
      The most extensively studied approach is the Thinking Skills for Work (TSW) program,&#xD;
      developed by this research group, which incorporates computer-based cognitive exercises to&#xD;
      restore cognitive skills and teaching compensatory strategies by a Cognitive Specialist who&#xD;
      is integrated into the vocational rehabilitation team. Five randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      (RCTs), two conducted in SE programs (including one previously conducted by this research&#xD;
      group), have shown that adding the TSW program to vocational (SE) services improves work and&#xD;
      cognitive outcomes compared to vocational (SE) services alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study takes the next bold step of &quot;dismantling&quot; the TSW program to evaluate&#xD;
      whether the cognitive practice exercises component is critical to improving outcomes in SE,&#xD;
      or whether a more streamlined and efficient version of the program that focuses only on&#xD;
      teaching compensatory skills is sufficient. The study will also yield important information&#xD;
      about whether some consumers benefit from computer cognitive exercises, but not others,&#xD;
      permitting the TSW program to be individually tailored to consumers' personal needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preparation for the proposed study we developed, standardized, and pilot tested a variant&#xD;
      of the TSW program, the Cognitive Skills for Work (CSW) program, that teaches compensatory&#xD;
      skills for managing cognitive difficulties but omits computer cognitive exercises, resulting&#xD;
      in a program that is approximately one-half the intensity of the original TSW program. A&#xD;
      small ongoing pilot study indicated that consumers in SE could be readily engaged and&#xD;
      retained in the CSW program and obtain work, supporting the feasibility of this streamlined&#xD;
      version of TSW. The proposed research will be an RCT conducted at two high fidelity SE&#xD;
      programs, comparing the effects of the TSW and CSW programs in consumers enrolled in SE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following hypotheses will be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: Participants in TSW will have better competitive work outcomes than those&#xD;
      in the CSW program. This hypothesis is based on the fact that virtually all cognitive&#xD;
      remediation research on SMI has included cognitive exercises designed to restore cognitive&#xD;
      skills, such as the computer-based cognitive exercises in TSW, with some programs also&#xD;
      teaching compensatory strategies. If the null hypothesis is not rejected, and TSW is found to&#xD;
      be not significantly more effective than CSW, then dissemination efforts can focus on the&#xD;
      more efficient CSW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis: Participants in TSW will improve more in cognitive functioning than&#xD;
      those in CSW. This hypothesis is based on the same rationale as Hypothesis #1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Analyses: In addition to evaluating whether the TSW and CSW programs differ&#xD;
      overall in their impact on vocational and cognitive outcomes, we will explore whether&#xD;
      consumer characteristics can be identified that predict a differential response to either&#xD;
      program. For example, it is possible that consumers with more severe cognitive impairment&#xD;
      will respond better to the full TSW program, whereas those with less severe impairment may&#xD;
      benefit equally well from the more efficient CSW program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research has high potential impact for improving the outcomes of SE, an&#xD;
      established EBP for increasing competitive work in SMI, but whose effectiveness is limited by&#xD;
      the extent of consumers' cognitive impairment. Maximizing the efficiency of the TSW program,&#xD;
      a cognitive remediation program shown to improve work outcomes in two RCTs of SE programs, by&#xD;
      determining whether a more streamlined version of the program that requires about one-half&#xD;
      the time to implement (the CSW program) is equally effective, could reduce the costs of&#xD;
      disseminating and implementing the program, making it accessible to more consumers. This&#xD;
      study could also help identify which consumers benefit most from the cognitive exercises&#xD;
      component of TSW, thereby facilitating tailoring of the program to the individual's personal&#xD;
      needs. Ultimately, this research could play a critical role in making the dream of&#xD;
      competitive work a reality for many consumers with SMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a supplementary study, commencing in September 2015, will assess a promising&#xD;
      biomarker for understanding the mechanisms underlying the effects of cognitive remediation,&#xD;
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), in new enrollees in the parent R01 study. BDNF is a&#xD;
      widely distributed protein throughout the central nervous system that promotes neuronal&#xD;
      growth and is associated with a broad range of cognitive functions. Limited research suggests&#xD;
      that cognitive remediation increases serum BDNF levels, including one study of schizophrenia&#xD;
      and another study of Parkinson's disease. This supplemental study will provide a test of&#xD;
      whether computerized cognitive training contributes to increased BDNF levels, and whether&#xD;
      increases in BDNF are associated with improved cognitive functioning. The supplement will&#xD;
      take advantage of the ongoing parent R01 study of the TSW program by measuring BDNF levels at&#xD;
      baseline, following delivery of computerized cognitive training/teaching coping skills (6-8&#xD;
      months after baseline), and at two follow-ups (16 and 24 months after baseline) in a&#xD;
      diagnostically heterogeneous sample of 38 consumers with impaired cognitive functioning. This&#xD;
      supplement will complement the aims of the parent R01 by shedding light on possible&#xD;
      mechanisms related to how TSW works and for whom, thereby informing efforts to refine and&#xD;
      improve the program, as well as targeting individuals who fail to benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The supplementary study will test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: Participants in TSW will show greater increases in BDNF levels from&#xD;
      baseline to post-training than participants in CSW. This hypothesis is based on the&#xD;
      expectation that the computerized cognitive training exercises in TSW will lead to greater&#xD;
      improvements in cognitive functioning than training in compensatory strategies only in CSW,&#xD;
      with increases in BDNF levels associated with improved cognitive performance. We also expect&#xD;
      that greater increases in BDNF for the TSW group will be maintained at the 16- and 24 month&#xD;
      follow-up assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses: 1.) Greater improvements in cognitive functioning from baseline to the&#xD;
      post-training and follow-up assessments in TSW than CSW will be associated with stronger&#xD;
      increases in BDNF levels over the same assessment points. This hypothesis tests whether&#xD;
      greater gains in BDNF levels for TSW mediate the long-term and sustained improvements in&#xD;
      cognitive functioning for this program compare to CSW. 2.) Lower baseline BDNF levels will be&#xD;
      associated with less gain in cognitive functioning for TSW. This hypothesis tests whether&#xD;
      baseline BDNF levels moderate the effectiveness of TSW on improving cognitive functioning,&#xD;
      with lower BDNF levels predicting less benefit. BDNF could both be found to be both a&#xD;
      mediator and a moderator of the effects of cognitive remediation on improving cognitive&#xD;
      functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The supplement will take place at the same sites as the parent R01: Thresholds Inc. in&#xD;
      Chicago, and the Mental Health Center of Greater Manchester, NH. Inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria for the supplemental sub-study are identical to those for parent R01 study. As&#xD;
      before, pregnancy is not a rule out for participation in the BDNF supplement study.&#xD;
      Phlebotomists associated with each site will draw one tablespoon of blood from clients at&#xD;
      each assessment timepoint, therefore, a total of up to four (4) tablespoons of blood might be&#xD;
      drawn from each client over the course of the study. Drawing BDNF specimens over the full&#xD;
      24-month course of the study will permit researchers to address several important questions&#xD;
      regarding the role of BDNF in contributing to neurocognitive functioning, both in response to&#xD;
      cognitive remediation as well as how it interacts with cognitive challenging environmental&#xD;
      demands-work.&#xD;
