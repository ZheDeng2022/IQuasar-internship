    <description>The day of neutrophil recovery is defined as the first of 3 consecutive days in which the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is &gt; 0.5. The cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery will be reported at day 45 post-transplant. Sustained neutrophil engraftment is neutrophil engraftment without secondary graft failure. This will be analyzed at 1 and 2 years post-transplant.</description>

&#xD;
        Cord Blood Grafts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Units will be selected based on the HLA-match to the patient and individual cell doses of&#xD;
        the units according to current MSKCC unit selection criteria. HLA-testing will be done&#xD;
        using molecular techniques. The standard cord blood graft for this protocol will consist of&#xD;
        2 units as a double unit graft although single units are permitted. Each unit will be at&#xD;
        least 4 of 6 HLA-A, -B antigen and -DRB1 allele matched with the recipient. Each unit of a&#xD;
        double unit graft will have a cryopreserved dose of at least 1.5 x 10^7 TNC/recipient body&#xD;
        weight (TNC/kg). In the occasional patient with a large well matched good quality single&#xD;
        unit or the rare patient with only one unit of suitable match and dose characteristics the&#xD;
        cord blood graft can consist of a single unit as described in section 6.1 .&#xD;
&#xD;
        Haploidentical Donor Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;

        Adult BMT guidelines. Mismatched family members who are matched at more than 5 of 10&#xD;
        HLA-loci are permitted. Factors to be taken into account when selecting a haplo-identical&#xD;
        donor will include donor age, weight, health status and comorbidities, compliance, venous&#xD;
        access, recipent donor specific HLA-antibody status, and NK cell alloreactivity.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Medical or physical reason which makes the donor unlikely to tolerate or cooperate&#xD;
             with growth factor therapy and leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Factors which place the donor at increased risk for complications from leukapheresis&#xD;
             or G-CSF therapy (e.g., active autoimmune disease, sickle cell trait, symptomatic&#xD;
             coronary artery disease requiring therapy).&#xD;
