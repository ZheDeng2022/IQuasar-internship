  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, single-blind, active-controlled, two-period crossover study in&#xD;
      adult volunteers to compare the duration and depth of anesthesia between Synera® and&#xD;
      Lidoderm® patches when applied for 30 minutes and 4 hours. The study will include a Screening&#xD;
      Visit, two Treatment Periods, and a Follow-Up Phone Contact.&#xD;
