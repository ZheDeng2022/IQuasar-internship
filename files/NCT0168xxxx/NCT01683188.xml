    <textblock>
      This is a research study to evaluate treatment of metastatic melanoma patients with a&#xD;
      combination of drugs. The combination being studied is vemurafenib (also known as Zelboraf®)&#xD;
      and High Dose Interleukin-2 (abbreviated as HD IL-2 and known as Proleukin®). The combination&#xD;
      of vemurafenib and HD IL-2 immunotherapy may enhance the response.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, uncontrolled two-arm, multi-center study in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma with BRAFV600 oncogene mutations. Patients will initially receive&#xD;
      treatment with vemurafenib interspersed with two courses of High Dose IL-2 (HD IL-2).&#xD;
      Patients are eligible for the study if they have melanoma positive for the BRAFV600 mutation,&#xD;
      have been on vemurafenib therapy for 0-18 weeks, have responding or stable disease if on&#xD;
      vemurafenib, and meet the requirements for dosing with HD IL-2 and all protocol inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two Cohorts will be enrolled, differing only in how they are characterized prior to HD IL-2&#xD;
      treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: will consist of 135 patients naïve to vemurafenib and HD IL-2 therapy. Patients in&#xD;
      Cohort 1 will have an initial evaluation and receive a defined 6 (± 1) week course of&#xD;
      vemurafenib before beginning HD IL-2. This Cohort will be used to define study size and&#xD;
      statistical validity with the comparator being historic controls (using data from the BRAF&#xD;
      positive patients from the Melanoma SELECT study Protocol IIT10PLK06).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2: will consist of up to 50 patients who have been on vemurafenib therapy for &gt;7 to 18&#xD;
      weeks with stable or responding disease before starting HD IL-2. Patients in Cohort 2 will&#xD;
      have an initial evaluation and will begin HD IL-2 treatment after &gt;7 to 18 weeks of treatment&#xD;
      with vemurafenib. This Cohort is designed to evaluate whether additive or synergistic&#xD;
      clinical benefit or toxicity is observed in BRAFV600 mutation positive metastatic melanoma&#xD;
      patients treated with vemurafenib as a single agent for &gt;7 to18 weeks prior to the first&#xD;
      course of HD IL-2 therapy in conjunction with continued vemurafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both cohorts will discontinue dosing vemurafenib prior to each treatment with HD&#xD;
      IL-2 and resume dosing after each discharge. Patients will receive up to two courses (four&#xD;
      cycles) of HD IL-2 and will be evaluated for their disease responses at 10 weeks (±3 weeks)&#xD;
      from the start of HD IL-2 dosing, and 26 weeks (±3 weeks) from the start of HD IL-2 dosing.&#xD;
      QTc intervals will be reviewed daily for changes during each cycle of HD IL-2 dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of vemurafenib and HD IL-2 will be according to the respective Package Inserts&#xD;
      and according to the Institution's standard of care. The investigator will determine the&#xD;
      number of HD IL-2 cycles each patient will receive, according to the investigator's&#xD;
      discretion and medical judgment.&#xD;
