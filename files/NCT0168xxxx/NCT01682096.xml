      The Diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome in patients presenting with acute chest pain is&#xD;
      problematic when both, electrocardiogram and serum troponins are normal. Multidetector row&#xD;
      computed tomography angiography (CTA) allows direct and rapid non-invasive visualization of&#xD;
      coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's aim is to assess the diagnostic accuracy and safety of a novel diagnostic&#xD;
      strategy based on MDCT as compared to a strategy using stress echocardiography in the workup&#xD;
      of patient with chest pain, normal electrocardiogram, normal troponins and suspected coronary&#xD;
      artery disease. Additionally, the cost associated with both strategies will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. A total of 150 patients with acute chest pain coming to the emergency room with&#xD;
      intermediate probability of significant coronary artery disease, normal ECG and troponins&#xD;
      will be prospectively randomized to MDCT or stress echocardiography with exercise. Patients&#xD;
      showing coronary stenosis &gt;50% at MDCT or abnormal stress echocardiography or inconclusive&#xD;
      results will be admitted for further study. The primary endpoint of the study is the&#xD;
      detection of an acute coronary syndrome, defined as typical or atypical angina with&#xD;
      documented significant coronary artery disease (&gt;50% stenosis) on invasive coronariography, a&#xD;
      positive stress test or the occurrence of cardiac death, myocardial infarction or need for&#xD;
      revascularization during 6 month follow-up. All MDCT angiograms and echocardiograms will be&#xD;
      evaluated by an experienced radiologist and cardiologist.&#xD;

      Design and Aim: This is a prospective pilot study to evaluate the role of multidetector row&#xD;
      computed tomography angiography (CTA) to rule out Acute Coronary Syndrome among patients&#xD;
      presenting to the ER with chest pain complaints, non-diagnostic ECG and normal troponins and&#xD;
      intermediate pre-test probability for significant CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Following the initial clinical evaluation and the results of initial ECG, blood test&#xD;
      and X-ray, patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomized to undergo either a CTA&#xD;
      scan or a Exercise Stress Echocardiogram to rule out significant coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTA will be carried out in a 64 or 128 slice-CT Scanner (SIEMENS,Somaton Sensation 64 or&#xD;
      128-Flash Definition)following iv administration of iodinated contrast (bolus: 5cc x&#xD;
      acquisition time (seg)+ 10 cc). Images will be interpreted by two experienced physicians&#xD;
      (radiologist and cardiologist)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stress Echocardiography will be performed and interpreted by an experienced Echocardiographer&#xD;
      (cardiologist).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical decision making: Patients with a positive or inconclusive test in each arm will be&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital for treatment or further additional testing, while patients with&#xD;
      negative results will be discharged from the ER.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety issues: A phone call and chart review will be performed one month and 6 months&#xD;
      follow-up to register the occurrence of any major adverse cardiac events, as well as new&#xD;
      consultation for chest pain.&#xD;
