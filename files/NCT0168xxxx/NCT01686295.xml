  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the iRestore Hair Rejuvenation&#xD;
      System when used as directed in promoting hair growth in men and women with androgenetic&#xD;
      alopecia&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The test treatment is the iRestore™ Hair Rejuvenation System. The device irradiates the scalp&#xD;
      with visible light using 5 mW (class 3a) lasers. It is to be used approximately 3 times per&#xD;
      week for approximately 30 minutes at each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The System is placed on the head and adjusted to a comfortable size by rotating knobs on the&#xD;
      side of the device. If needed, subjects may replace the soft pad on the inside of the device&#xD;
      with the thinner pad provided. There will be 2 options for using the product. The subject&#xD;
      will either insert the 5-V AC power adapter pin into the device remote control, and the 5-V&#xD;
      adapter will then be plugged into the AC outlet; or the subjects will use the rechargeable&#xD;
      battery pack and belt clip. The battery pack is an external device which will allow the&#xD;
      subject the freedom of mobility while treating the hair. The rechargeable battery pack will&#xD;
      hold a charge for up to 3 hours prior to needing to be recharged. The iRestore™ remote&#xD;
      control clips into the battery holster and the pack plugs into the remote. The battery pack&#xD;
      can be placed in a pocket, clipped to the belt or placed next to the subject. The device will&#xD;
      be turned on by pressing the power button on the remote control. The dome of the device is to&#xD;
      be moved forward and backward by the subject to brush through the hair and increase the&#xD;
      direct light which comes into contact with the scalp. Subjects will then position the dome at&#xD;
      the front of the scalp and press the start button to begin a 10-minute session. Note: As a&#xD;
      safety feature, the dome must be placed onto the head prior to starting the device. A timer&#xD;
      will indicate the completion of the session with a beep sound. Subjects will complete the&#xD;
      same process as done with the front of the scalp with the dome repositioned to the middle of&#xD;
      the scalp and then the back of the scalp. Once all 3 positions have received the 10 minute&#xD;
      treatment, the power button is to be held for approximately 3 seconds to turn the device off.&#xD;
      Once off the device is to be unplugged from the wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control device will be identical to the test device except that the laser-emitting units&#xD;
      will be disabled. A standard light will be emitted from the device. Subjects and clinical&#xD;
      staff engaged in the performance of assessments will be treatment blinded.&#xD;
