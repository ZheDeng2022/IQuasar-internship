  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer has been the leading cancer worldwide, which can be divided into small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) based on biology, therapy, and&#xD;
      prognosis. NSCLC accounts for more than 85% of all lung cancer cases and has a poor prognosis&#xD;
      with only 15% of all lung cancer patients alive 5 years or more after diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) originated from Chinese philosophy is a different medical&#xD;
      system from conventional western medicine. It focuses on health maintenance and emphasizes on&#xD;
      harmonizing the imbalance of body. Current studies show that TCM has the advantages of&#xD;
      increasing the sensitivity of chemo- and radio-therapeutics, reducing the side effects and&#xD;
      chemo- and radio-therapeutics associated complications, improving patients' quality of life&#xD;
      and survival time. However, how TCM can work with conventional medicine for the treatment of&#xD;
      carcinoma is still an important research topic worldwide. Syndrome, the essential concept in&#xD;
      TCM theory, is a diagnostic conclusion of the pathological changes at a certain stage of a&#xD;
      disease, including the location, cause, and nature as well as the trend of development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the distribution of TCM syndromes, the changing pattern among&#xD;
      NSCLC patients before and after having surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and the&#xD;
      correlations with patient quality of life and progression free survival. The results are&#xD;
      important for establishing guidelines for TCM practice and research in future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer has been the leading cancer worldwide since 1985 both in terms of incidence and&#xD;
      mortality. According to the GLOBOCAN project of World Health Organization (WHO), there were&#xD;
      about 1.6 million new cases (12.7% of the total) and 1.4 million deaths (18.2% of the total)&#xD;
      in 2008 globally. Although the prevalence rates have already been decreasing in males, there&#xD;
      are increasing trends in females and less developed countries. From the data of Hong Kong&#xD;
      Cancer Registry for 2009, there were 4,365 new cases and 3,692 deaths, representing 16.8% and&#xD;
      28.8% of all cancers, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung cancer can be divided into small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC) based on biology, therapy, and prognosis. NSCLC accounts for more than 85% of all&#xD;
      lung cancer cases and includes two major types: squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma and&#xD;
      nonsquamous carcinoma (including adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma and other cell types).&#xD;
      Conventional treatment modalities for patients with NSCLC include surgery, radiation therapy&#xD;
      and chemotherapy. Surgery is the most potentially curative therapeutic option, while&#xD;
      postoperative chemotherapy may provide an additional benefit. However, NSCLC is frequently&#xD;
      diagnosed at an advanced stage and not suitable for surgery. Chemotherapy has produced&#xD;
      short-term improvement in disease-related symptoms, and offers modest improvements in median&#xD;
      survival in patients with advanced-stage disease. Radiation therapy combined with&#xD;
      chemotherapy can produce a cure in a small number of patients and palliation in most others.&#xD;
      Generally, NSCLC has a poor prognosis with only 15% of all lung cancer patients alive 5 years&#xD;
      or more after diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) originated from Chinese philosophy is a different medical&#xD;
      system from conventional western medicine. It focuses on health maintenance and emphasizes on&#xD;
      harmonizing the imbalance of body. Related records about cancer can first be found in Yellow&#xD;
      Emperor's Inner Classic compiled between 200 B.C. and 100 A.D. Nowadays, TCM is increasingly&#xD;
      used as an adjunctive treatment for cancer patients. According to the survey carried by the&#xD;
      Hong Kong Baptist University and Queen Elizabeth Hospital in 2008, over half of all cancer&#xD;
      patients had received at least one form of TCM therapy. Current studies also show that TCM&#xD;
      has the advantages of increasing the sensitivity of chemo- and radio-therapeutics, reducing&#xD;
      the side effects and chemo- and radio-therapeutics associated complications, improving&#xD;
      patients' quality of life and survival time. However, how TCM can work with conventional&#xD;
      medicine for the treatment of carcinoma is still an important research topic worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Syndrome, the essential concept in TCM theory, is a diagnostic conclusion of the pathological&#xD;
      changes at a certain stage of a disease, including the location, cause, and nature as well as&#xD;
      the trend of development. It is derived from all symptoms and signs collected by the classic&#xD;
      four diagnostic methods, including observation, smell/listening, inquiry and palpation.&#xD;
      However, there is no consensus on the definition of diagnosis of syndromes for NSCLC as&#xD;
      different diagnostic and treatment guidelines are published by TCM experts, colleges and&#xD;
      associations. In practice, TCM practitioners are used to make diagnosis and provide treatment&#xD;
      on the basis of their own experiences. Therefore, more consolidated evidences are urged for&#xD;
      standardizing the diagnosis and distribution of syndrome for routine practice and research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from traditional syndrome studies, advance studies about the influence of conventional&#xD;
      treatments on syndromes, and the correlation between syndromes and conventional measures had&#xD;
      been done in the past decades. From the review summarizing the syndrome changes after&#xD;
      surgery, radiation therapy or chemotherapy, deficiency syndrome and blood stasis syndrome are&#xD;
      the fundamental syndrome patterns among cancer patients while tongue manifestation is&#xD;
      significant for early stage diagnosis, outcome assessment and prognosis. A number of studies&#xD;
      have analyzed the distribution of symptoms for NSCLC patients in different TNM stages, cell&#xD;
      types, and assessment indexes, including quality of life, immunological indexes and&#xD;
      hemorheology. However, most of them were cross-sectional epidemiological studies or with&#xD;
      short follow-up period. Therefore, the impact of these factors on syndromes cannot be&#xD;
      completely elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this present longitudinal study, patients with new diagnosed NSCLC will be followed for&#xD;
      two years. During this period, the changing patterns of TCM syndromes for patients before and&#xD;
      after conventional treatment, including surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy will be&#xD;
      analyzed. Furthermore, the correlations between TCM syndromes and quality of life or&#xD;
      progress-free survival will also be investigated. We hope that the results from this study&#xD;
      can provide more consolidated evidences about the effects of conventional treatments on TCM&#xD;
      syndromes, for standardizing the diagnosis of TCM syndromes for NSCLC for clinical practice,&#xD;
      and promoting further research on integrated medicine for NSCLC.&#xD;
