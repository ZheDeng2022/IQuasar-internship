      In this retrospective cohort study, we plan to include all patients presenting with a&#xD;
      community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia at the University Hospital of Zurich between&#xD;
      January 1, 2006 and June 30, 2012 (6Â½ years). The patients will be identified either with one&#xD;
      or more blood culture pairs positive for S. pneumoniae or with a positive pneumococcal urine&#xD;
      antigen assay in combination with the clinical diagnosis of CAP, which was based on the&#xD;
      presence of select clinical features (e.g., cough, fever, sputum production, and pleuritic&#xD;
      chest pain) and is supported by imaging of the lung, usually by chest radiography according&#xD;
      to Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society consensus guidelines on&#xD;
      the management of CAP in adults [11].&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAP is not considered if the patient is discharged from a hospital less than 7 days before&#xD;
      the current hospital admission, if the first blood culture or urinary antigen assay is&#xD;
      obtained more than 1 week after hospital admission, or if the patient has no clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis of CAP at the time of admission. Patients referred from or transferred to another&#xD;
      hospital are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After identification of eligible patients upon microbiological results, medical records are&#xD;
      reviewed using a standardized data collection questionnaire. Comorbidity is determined using&#xD;
      the Charlson comorbidity index [10]. Additionally, all patients are classified according to&#xD;
      the multimorbidity patterns proposed by Holden et al. [12]. These are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. arthritis, osteoporosis, other chronic pain, bladder problems, and irritable bowel;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and allergies;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. back/neck pain, migraine, other chronic pain, and arthritis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes, and fatigue;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. cardiovascular disease, diabetes, fatigue, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and&#xD;
           arthritis; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. irritable bowel, ulcer, heartburn, and other chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time calculation is based upon the moment of emergency room (ER) admission.&#xD;
