      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and ability of panobinostat to re-activate&#xD;
      HIV transcription in latently infected CD4+ T-cells among HIV-infected patients on stable&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite effective highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART), HIV-infection persists and&#xD;
      rebounds upon treatment interruption, presumably due to latently infected resting CD4+&#xD;
      T-cells. To achieve eradication of HIV-infection this reservoir of latently HIV-infected&#xD;
      cells must be depleted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several therapeutic strategies are considered in HIV-cure related research. One approach is&#xD;
      to exploit the ability of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors to reactivate HIV-1&#xD;
      expression in latently infected cells in the presence of HAART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigator initiated single-group, non-randomized interventional phase I/II&#xD;
      trial designed to evaluate the safety and ability of oral panobinostat to activate&#xD;
      HIV-transcription in latently infected CD4+ T-cells of HIV-infected patients on suppressive&#xD;
      HAART. The study will enrol 16 patients. Each subject will be used as his/her own control in&#xD;
      a before-after design: endpoints measured after study intervention will be compared to&#xD;
      baseline for each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main study will comprise three phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A pre-treatment screening/observation phase of 4 weeks (weeks 0-4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A treatment phase of 8 weeks (weeks 4-12), where 20 mg panobinostat will be administered&#xD;
           orally on days 1, 3, and 5 (TIW) every other week (QOW) while maintaining background&#xD;
           HAART (co-therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A post-treatment follow-up phase of 24 weeks (weeks 12-36) to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
           study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be reviewed 13 times during the course of study treatment and&#xD;
      follow-up. Blood will be drawn for HIV viral load assessments, CD4 cell counts, biochemistry,&#xD;
      hematology and additional immunological and virological analyses. An electrocardiogram of the&#xD;
      heart (ECG) will be taken at screening, day 10 and 24 post treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and tolerability of panobinostat will be evaluated based on physical exams,&#xD;
      laboratory tests and questions about any problems patients may have experienced during the&#xD;
      study. A pre-specified schedule based will guide dose modification in case of unacceptable&#xD;
      adverse effects.&#xD;
