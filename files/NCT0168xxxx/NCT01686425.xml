      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced biliary tract malignancy complicated by obstructive jaundice has been traditionally&#xD;
      managed by palliative stent placement at ERCP. In 3-12% of patients with advanced disease&#xD;
      tumour involvement of the small bowel or peri-ampullary region may preclude the use of ERCP&#xD;
      necessitating percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) or surgery1. However these&#xD;
      techniques have been associated with high complication rates and significant morbidity2. PTBD&#xD;
      necessitates traversing the parietal and visceral peritoneum causing a potential for a bile&#xD;
      leak and bleeding into the peritoneal cavity. This procedure is also associated with&#xD;
      significant pain, lengthy hospital stays and an overall reduction in quality of life, and&#xD;
      even procedure related mortality. Indeed the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR)&#xD;
      quality improvements guidelines established the procedural risk of severe major complications&#xD;
      including sepsis, bleeding and procedural related death at 2.5% and less severe complications&#xD;
      including pain and prolonged hospital admissions at 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years various groups have described endoscopic ultrasound guided access of the left&#xD;
      system allowing placement of metal or plastic stents either across the distal stricture or&#xD;
      deploying the stent in the stomach (hepatico-gastrostomy), with high technical success3.&#xD;
      Retrograde cannulation normally performed from the duodenal bulb allows access to the biliary&#xD;
      tract above a malignant stricture with the intent to either pass a guide wire through the&#xD;
      papilla and then perform a rendezvous procedure, or the placement of a covered metal stent&#xD;
      into the stomach (choledochoenterostomy)10. Cannulation of a dilated segment 2 or 3 sectoral&#xD;
      duct is also possible from the proximal stomach where the endoscopist performs all procedures&#xD;
      in an antegrade fashion5. Currently these procedures are selectively performed in centres by&#xD;
      expert endoscopists from mainly tertiary care academic expert centres including in Leuven.&#xD;
      Collectively EUS biliary drainage is technically successful in 75-92% of cases, however&#xD;
      reports of bile leaking and peritonitis have been described5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various obstacles however still exist to extend the general applicability of this technique&#xD;
      outside expert centres. Firstly, no randomized control trials exist comparing the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of EUS biliary access to Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiography (PTC). Secondly,&#xD;
      current endoscopic techniques utilize standard endoscopic accessories not specifically&#xD;
      developed to be utilized within the biliary system when advanced through the gastric wall.&#xD;
      Thirdly, specific EUS strategies are needed to prevent or reduce complications associated&#xD;
      with percutaneous approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concept and preliminary experimental data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the literature we hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endoscopic ultrasound guided biliary drainage is more effective than percutaneous&#xD;
           biliary drainage in the management of obstructive jaundice&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EUS guided biliary drainage is associated with a reduced incidence of major (bile&#xD;
           peritonitis, procedure related mortality, hematobilia) and minor (abdominal pain,&#xD;
           prolonged hospital stay) complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EUS guided biliary drainage is more cost effective compared to percutaneous biliary&#xD;
           drainage&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of proposed research&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the current literature we propose a randomized pilot study assessing the following&#xD;
      specific end points&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EUS biliary drainage is as effective as percutaneous biliary drainage in achieving&#xD;
           resolution of cholestasis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EUS biliary drainage is not associated with an increased risk of complications compared&#xD;
           to percutaneous biliary drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population. Patients with obstructive jaundice due to locally advanced/metastatic&#xD;
      malignancy with dilated intrahepatic bile ducts will be recruited from the department of&#xD;
      Gastroenterology and Hepatology at the University Hospital of Leuven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This population will have failed ERCP or will be considered when ERCP is not possible due to&#xD;
      altered surgical anatomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to either PTC or EUS guided biliary drainage&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients older than 18 years presenting with malignant obstructive jaundice&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Locally advanced primary or metastatic malignancy involving the biliary tract&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients in whom an ERCP have failed or where an ERCP is not possible due to surgically&#xD;
           altered anatomy (eg. Post-Whipple).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Resectable biliary tract malignancy with curative intent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linear array endoscopic ultrasound (Pentax, Pentax Hitachi, Montvale, NJ) will be used to&#xD;
      identify the dilated left system. The Doppler mode was used to differentiate intrahepatic&#xD;
      bile ducts from portal and hepatic vein branches. A 19G needle (Echo-19, Cook, Limerick,&#xD;
      Ireland) will be used to puncture a peripherally located dilated segment 2 or 3 duct under&#xD;
      EUS guidance. Under fluoroscopic control a cholangiogram will be obtained and a standard&#xD;
      0.035 guide-wire (Hydra Jag wire, Boston Scientific, Natick, MA Boston Scientific) will be&#xD;
      advanced into the biliary system. Next a 6Fr cystotome (Endoflex, Voerde, Germany) will be&#xD;
      used to create a trans-gastric tract through the liver parenchyma to the dilated biliary&#xD;
      system. The guidewire will be manipulated across the stricture into the duodenal lumen. A&#xD;
      Hurricane biliary dilation balloon 4cm x4mm (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA Boston Scientific)&#xD;
      will be advanced through the tract and used to dilate the common bile duct stricture without&#xD;
      balloon dilation at the level of the gastric wall liver interface. A 10mmx 80mm uncovered&#xD;
      self expandable metallic stent (SEMS) will be advanced and deployed under fluoroscopy across&#xD;
      the papilla and past the duodenal obstruction when present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients were the left ductal system is not dilated, biliary access will be obtained from&#xD;
      the duodenal bulb and a covered metal stent will be deployed in the stomach&#xD;
      (choledocho-enterostomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with duodenal obstruction a Wallstent will be placed at the same session as part&#xD;
      of standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novel research perspectives and expected outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Our research will address a very difficult clinical problem in an unique way: comparing&#xD;
           the standard of care biliary drainage procedure (PTC) to EUS guided biliary drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We expect to demonstrate that EUS guided biliary drainage is as effective as PTC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We also expect to show that EUS guided biliary drainage is associated with a reduced&#xD;
           incidence of complications and reduced hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pain: Post-procedural pain as measured by visual analogue score (VAS) at 2, 24, and&#xD;
                72 hours following the procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Biochemical changes: Bilirubin decrease at 2 and 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Major complications including bile leak, bleeding, sepsis or death&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Duration of procedures in minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Length of ICU and hospital stay&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Minor complications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics power calculations It is assumed that 50% of the patients will experience&#xD;
      prolonged pain after PTC defined as pain lasting more than 48 hours and requiring analgesics.&#xD;
      48 patients in total (24 per group) are then needed to detect with 80% power a difference&#xD;
      with EUS, expecting 10% of the patients having prolonged pain after EUS. The sample size&#xD;
      calculation is based on a two-sided Fisher's Exact test (with alpha=5%). To compensate for&#xD;
      potential dropout, 7 additional patients in total will be recruited. Therefor the sample size&#xD;
      will comprise of 55 patients. Exact 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the&#xD;
      proportion major complications in both groups. Proportions will be compared using a Fisher's&#xD;
      Exact test. A Mann-Whitney U test will be used to compare the actual VAS scores and changes&#xD;
      in VAS scores between groups. A log-rank test will be used to compare the length of hospital&#xD;
      stay (LOS), censoring potential deceased patients at a value exceeding the highest observed&#xD;
      LOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P-values smaller than 0.05 will be considered significant. Statistical analyses will be&#xD;
      performed using SAS software, version 9.2 of the SAS System for Windowsld be given when&#xD;
      defining the endpoints.&#xD;
