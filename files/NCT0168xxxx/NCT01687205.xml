      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the impact of coitus (and semen) on the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir 1% gel&#xD;
           in female genital tract secretions, vaginal and cervical tissue and rectal tract&#xD;
           secretions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the impact of coitus (and semen) on pharmacodynamics of luminal drug by&#xD;
           measuring the anti-HIV-1 activity in CVL samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MTN-011 will enroll heterosexual monogamous, sexually active couples, in which both partners&#xD;
      are healthy and HIV-negative. The female participants must be between the ages of 21-46&#xD;
      (inclusive) and currently using effective non-barrier contraception. Male participants must&#xD;
      be 21 years of age or older. This Phase 1 expanded safety study will assess tenofovir PK in&#xD;
      the genital tract secretions (CVL), rectal (rectal sponge) and both intracellular and&#xD;
      extracellular tissue compartments (vaginal biopsy) in the absence of, or following coitus.&#xD;
      Pharmacodynamics (antiviral activity) will also be assessed in CVL. MTN-011 will study the&#xD;
      timing in which coitus might have the greatest impact on these variables, which is when gel&#xD;
      is applied shortly prior to coitus in the absence of a drug reservoir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MTN-011 will examine PK/PD in response to a single dose of 1% tenofovir gel applied shortly&#xD;
      before sex and compare to PK/PD assessments following a single gel application without sex.&#xD;
      Additionally, data obtained from a visit in which participants do not dose with gel and do&#xD;
      not have sex will serve as an additional control for the pharmacodynamic (PD) studies of the&#xD;
      antiviral activity in CVL. If tenofovir retains its antiviral activity following sex, then&#xD;
      the anti-HIV activity in CVL collected at the visit in which female participants dose with&#xD;
      gel and have sex should be comparable to that of CVL collected at the visit in which females&#xD;
      dose with gel and then do not engage in intercourse and significantly greater than the&#xD;
      endogenous anti-HIV activity in CVL obtained at the visit in which participants do not dose&#xD;
      with gel but do have sex and the visit in which no gel is administered and sex does occur.&#xD;
      Data analysis performed after the completion of enrollment and follow-up procedures will&#xD;
      demonstrate if there is an impact of coitus and semen on PK/PD when a single 1% tenofovir&#xD;
      dose is applied shortly prior to sex.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Men and women must meet the following criteria to be eligible for inclusion in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Able and willing to provide the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Written informed consent to be screened for and take part in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequate locator information, as defined in site SOPs&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Per participant report, at low risk for HIV/STI. Low risk is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the 6 months prior to Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No non-therapeutic intravenous drug use in the 18 months prior to Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In a mutually monogamous relationship with a partner of the opposite sex for 6&#xD;
                  months prior to Screening and the intent to stay in this relationship for the&#xD;
                  next 4 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. At Screening and Enrollment, both partners independently report not using barrier&#xD;
             contraception and/or barrier protection as part of normal coital routine and report&#xD;
             the intent to continue said sexual practice for the duration of study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. HIV-uninfected based upon testing performed by study staff at Screening (per protocol&#xD;
             algorithm)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Agrees not to participate in other research studies involving drugs, medical devices,&#xD;
             or genital and rectal products, or large blood draw studies during study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Women must also meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Age 21 through 46 years (inclusive) at Screening, verified per site SOPs&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pap result in the 12 calendar months prior to Screening consistent with Grade 0&#xD;
                  according to the Female Genital Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies&#xD;
                  Addendum 1 to the DAIDS Table for Grading Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events,&#xD;
                  Version 1.0, December 2004 (Clarification dated August 2009), or satisfactory&#xD;
                  evaluation with no treatment required of non-Grade 0 Pap result per American&#xD;
                  Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) guidelines in the 12&#xD;
                  calendar months prior to the Screening Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Women with a documented normal result within the 12 months prior to screening&#xD;
             need not have a Pap smear during the screening period. Women with abnormal Pap smears&#xD;
             can be enrolled upon completion of the initial phase of evaluation if no current&#xD;
             treatment is indicated (based on local standard of care for management of abnormal&#xD;
             cervical cytology). Need for a repeat Pap within 6 months does not preclude enrollment&#xD;
             prior to that result becoming available.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Must be currently using effective non-barrier contraception, other than a&#xD;
                  contraceptive vaginal ring, for at least three months prior to Screening (i.e.,&#xD;
                  oral contraceptive, patch, injectable hormones, subdermal implants, intrauterine&#xD;
                  device, female or male sterilization) and intending to use this method for the&#xD;
                  course of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Per participant report, regular menstrual cycles with at least 21 days between&#xD;
                  menses (does not apply to participants who report using a progestin-only method&#xD;
                  of contraception at screening, e.g., Depo-Provera)&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: This criterion is not applicable to participants using continuous combination&#xD;
             oral contraceptive pills, as the absence of regular menstrual cycles is an expected,&#xD;
             normal consequence in this context.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Anatomy sufficient for performing pelvic examinations and for collecting vaginal&#xD;
                  and cervical specimens&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female participants must also agree to abstain from intercourse (oral, anal, or&#xD;
                  penile-vaginal) and other vaginal practices (e.g., masturbation, douching, tampon&#xD;
                  use, application of lubricants/spermicides or other related practices) 72 hours&#xD;
                  prior to each follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Men must also meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Age 21 or older at Screening, verified per site SOPs&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Agree to abstain from intercourse (oral, anal, or penile-vaginal) and other&#xD;
                  penile practices (e.g., masturbation, application of lubricants/spermicides or&#xD;
                  other related practices) 72 hours prior to each follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Men and women who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant report of any of the following:&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. At Screening or Enrollment, symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI)&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Otherwise eligible participants diagnosed with UTI during screening are offered&#xD;
             treatment and may be enrolled after completing treatment and all symptoms have&#xD;
             resolved as long as treatment is completed and all symptoms have resolved within 30&#xD;
             days of obtaining informed consent for Screening/Enrollment.&#xD;

&#xD;
             Note: For female participants, cervical bleeding associated with speculum insertion&#xD;
             and/or specimen collection judged to be within the range of normal according to the&#xD;
             clinical judgment of the IoR/designee is considered expected non-menstrual bleeding&#xD;
             and is not exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Otherwise eligible participants with exclusionary genital findings may be&#xD;
             enrolled after the findings have improved to a non-exclusionary severity grading or&#xD;
             resolved as long as treatment is completed and all symptoms have resolved within 30&#xD;
             days of obtaining informed consent for Screening/Enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has any other condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator of Record&#xD;
             (IoR)/designee, would preclude informed consent, make study participation unsafe,&#xD;
             complicate interpretation of study outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving&#xD;
             the study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Women who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:&#xD;
