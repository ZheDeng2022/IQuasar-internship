  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease of unknown origin that can affect all organs,&#xD;
      especially the lungs and mediastinum. Some location of sarcoidosis may require treatment with&#xD;
      corticosteroids or immunosuppressors.Although seasonal influenza vaccination can be&#xD;
      recommended in sarcoidosis in some subgroups at risk (respiratory failure, pulmonary&#xD;
      fibrosis, age over 65, use of immunosuppressive therapy, etc ...), the investigators&#xD;
      presently have no data on the efficacy and safety (absence of adverse reactions) of seasonal&#xD;
      influenza vaccination in sarcoidosis.Especially it is not known whether the seasonal&#xD;
      influenza vaccine provides the same rate and same type of vaccine response in sarcoidosis&#xD;
      patients than in the general population. Similarly, it is unclear whether the vaccine&#xD;
      response is modified by the severity of the disease and treatment with corticosteroids and&#xD;
      immunosuppressors.Based on what is known in systemic lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, which&#xD;
      are both inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, the investigators expect at best a 50% vaccine&#xD;
      response in patients with sarcoidosis and a 85% vaccination response in healthy controls. The&#xD;
      demonstration of a vaccine response could allow reconsidering new vaccine approaches in&#xD;
      sarcoidosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data on vaccination in sarcoidosis are largely insufficient. It is thus unclear whether the&#xD;
      vaccine response is modified according to the clinical phenotype of the disease and/or&#xD;
      treatment with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. However, sarcoidosis is accompanied by&#xD;
      numerous disturbances of the immune system, including a tendency to anergy which may affect&#xD;
      the efficacy of the vaccine, especially when the disease is active and severe. In addition,&#xD;
      the tolerance of influenza vaccination in patients with sarcoidosis has not been studied&#xD;
      yet.The influenza vaccination in sarcoidosis is a common practice among medical specialists&#xD;
      who care for patients with sarcoidosis, either internists or lung specialists.. However, the&#xD;
      practice of this vaccination is not based on scientific evidence, because there are no data&#xD;
      establishing the efficacy and safety of influenza vaccination in sarcoidosis.Thus, it is&#xD;
      possible that the influenza vaccine is less immunogenic in patients with sarcoidosis than in&#xD;
      healthy adults, which may reduce the clinical effectiveness of vaccination. It therefore&#xD;
      seems essential to determine the efficacy and safety of this vaccine, which is widely&#xD;
      practiced. Poor efficiency could lead to the development of different vaccination strategies,&#xD;
      based in particular on the administration of adjuvanted vaccines.&#xD;
