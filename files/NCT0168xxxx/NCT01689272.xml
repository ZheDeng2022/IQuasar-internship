      The purpose of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the role of morphological, clinical, biochemical and imaging studies at&#xD;
           stages of kidney transplantation (medical therapy, explantation, preservation,&#xD;
           transplantation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To improve the ways of preserving optimal functional parameters of renal transplants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Terminal chronic renal failure (ESRD) as a result of almost any chronic kidney disease&#xD;
      develops due to progressive loss of nephrons. This state is characterized by a gradual&#xD;
      deterioration of the functional abilities of not only the kidneys, but also the whole body.&#xD;
      Currently, ESRD is among the first ten causes of mortality .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transplantation of donor organs is the only radical treatment for various diseases of the&#xD;
      terminal, for patients with a fatal prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kidney transplantation has allowed not only save lives, but also to return to normal life,&#xD;
      tens of thousands of people. Survival of renal transplant recipients is growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the progress made in many clinics worldwide in recent years in the field of&#xD;
      transplantation, kidney transplantation, does not settle the problem of reperfusion injury&#xD;
      and the associated post-transplant dysfunction with the absence of clear indicators of&#xD;
      morphological, clinical, biochemical and instrumental methods to assess functional reserve of&#xD;
      organs that remain relevant and meaningful.&#xD;

    <description>Graft survival is assessed on the following criteria:&#xD;
The duration of the functioning graft&#xD;
Clinical, laboratory and device functioning graft.&#xD;
Morphological and histological study of the stages of transplantation (for withdrawal, before implantation) and the post-transplant period (with the threat of rejection.) Study of the blood recipient: Laboratory tests of blood recipient: biochemical analysis, the composition of the electrolyte, acid-base status, the level of immunosuppressants. Immunological typing for HLA-system. Cross-typing of donor and recipient, the level of pre-existing limfotsitotoksicheskih antibodies in the recipient.Patients survival.</description>
