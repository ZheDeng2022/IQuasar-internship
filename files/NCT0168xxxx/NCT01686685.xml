  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm children are at increased risk for autism spectrum disorders, with an estimated rate&#xD;
      of 10%. In the US, about 1 in 8 pregnancies ends with a premature birth. Therefore,&#xD;
      individuals with ASD who were born prematurely form a substantial body of children diagnosed&#xD;
      with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premature birth confers an insult to the newborn at a neurologically vulnerable stage.&#xD;
      Prematurity associated changes in oxygen tension can be detrimental to developing organs, the&#xD;
      brain being one of the most rapidly developing organs in the second half of the pregnancy.&#xD;
      Changes in oxygen tension mediate activation of proteins that change the course of cell&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we plan to measure changes in the expression of 3 proteins that may be&#xD;
      affected by changes in oxygen level at birth. We will study the interaction between the&#xD;
      proteins' levels in the first few days after premature birth with a diagnosis of ASD at 2&#xD;
      years of age. The proteins are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor), a protein that takes part in creating new&#xD;
           blood vessels during embryonic development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypoxia-inducible factor -1(HIF-1), a key protein that coordinates expression of&#xD;
           different genes, many with developmentally critical functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. CXCR4, a cell surface protein that is activated by SDF-1. SDF- 1 is a molecule that&#xD;
           regulates migration of cells to their target destination during embryonic life. CXCR4 is&#xD;
           expressed in areas of the brain and on cells that are known to be associated with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesis that changes in oxygen tension in premature babies initiates a cascade of&#xD;
      events that lead to changes in cell mobility via abnormal CXCR4 expression. This change leads&#xD;
      to abnormal neurodevelopment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' primary aim is to find if there is a correlation between postnatal levels&#xD;
      of expression of HIF-1, CXCR4 and VEGF and a diagnosis of autism at age 24 months. The&#xD;
      investigators' secondary aim is to find if there is a correlation between postnatal levels of&#xD;
      expression of HIF-1, CXCR4 and VEGF and a language or neurocognitive delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Premature babies will be recruited in the first day post delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood samples will be collected at 3 time points during their hospitalization, and the&#xD;
           expression of HIF-1, CXCR4 and VEGF will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Infants will undergo a complete developmental evaluation at 18-24 months of age .&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Postnatal levels of HIF, CXCR4 and VEGF will be plotted against the results of the&#xD;
           developmental evaluation.&#xD;
