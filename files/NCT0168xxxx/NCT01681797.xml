    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether fluorescence angiography is an&#xD;
      effectiveness technique for the localization of vascular perforators and their area of&#xD;
      perfusion and for the postoperative monitoring of flap perfusion.&#xD;

      Reconstructive surgery is intended to replace amputated anatomical regions by autologous&#xD;
      tissue taken from distant locations: flaps. The goal is to restitute ad integrum with minimal&#xD;
      sequelae. Among the flaps available, perforator flaps have the advantage of being highly&#xD;
      plastic, large and can be taken from accessory vessels the loss of wich does not compromise&#xD;
      the vitality of the sampling site. However their more variable anatomy requires irradiating&#xD;
      preoperative morphological assessment (CT angiography) or a doppler ultrasonography that is&#xD;
      not always performed by the surgeon himself and does not distinguish between muscle&#xD;
      perforator and skin perforator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluorescence angiography is a superficial exploration technique of vascularization. After&#xD;
      intravenous injection of a tracer (indocyanine green ICG), fluorescence angiography provides&#xD;
      useful surface angiographic imaging in real-time. It can also help in monitoring&#xD;
      intraoperative and postoperative quality of vascular anastomoses. Although fluorescence&#xD;
      angiography has numerous applications (ophthalmology, neurosurgery, liver&#xD;
      transplantation...), its usefulness in surgical flaps is only supported by a few&#xD;
      publications. None really validate its clinical value by comparing it to reference&#xD;
      investigations (CT angiography or doppler ultrasonography).&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 candidate for reconstructive surgery will be included in this study. The day before&#xD;
      surgery, in addition to the usual technique used to locate perforator flaps, the patient will&#xD;
      receive an injection of 0.025 mg / kg Infracyanine® (indocyanine green) and the area of&#xD;
      interest of the flap will be explored with the Fluobeam™ camera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hours after the surgery, during the usual clinical monitoring of the vitality of the&#xD;
      flap, a new injection of Infracyanine® will test perfusion of the flap by measuring&#xD;
      fluorescence intensity of the target area. These measurement will then be repeated every 6&#xD;
      hours for 4 days.&#xD;

measuring the arterial and venous trans-anastomotic flow (ml / mm)&#xD;
flow measurement (ml / mm) of an equivalent diameter vessel located in the operative field and not affected by the anastomosis&#xD;
intrinsic transit time (in seconds) which is the time required for the fluorescence between the arterial anastomosis and the venous anastomosis&#xD;
the number of leaks around the anastomosis.</description>
