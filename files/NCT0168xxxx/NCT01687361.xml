  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is commonly used in rehabilitation contexts in&#xD;
      order to increase or restore muscle capacities of hypoactive patients or patients with&#xD;
      articular trauma. Although this technique seems to be particularly adapted to muscle&#xD;
      rehabilitation, growing evidence is emerging regarding potential damaging effects of&#xD;
      electrically- induced isometric contractions in healthy humans. Recent studies have reported&#xD;
      a 10 to 30-fold increase in creatine kinase (CK) activity coupled to significantly increased&#xD;
      muscle soreness and impaired force production as a result of NMESs. On that basis, further&#xD;
      studies should be conducted on these deleterious effects which might limit the clinical&#xD;
      application of NMES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last decade, many studies paid attention to branched-chain amino acids (BCAA)&#xD;
      supplementation as a potential prophylactic/therapeutic approach. The rationale of this&#xD;
      approach is that BCAA might increase protein synthesis and reduce protein breakdown through&#xD;
      physiological mechanisms involving mTOR regulation pathway (mammalian Target of Rapamycin).&#xD;
      Additionally, BCAA could also be used as energetic substrate during exercise when glycogen&#xD;
      stores are depleted. Overall, previous results have supported the efficacy of BCAA&#xD;
      supplementation in attenuating muscle damage. Nevertheless, comprehensive studies&#xD;
      investigating the effect of amino acid supplementation on markers of muscle damage are still&#xD;
      scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (IRM) and phosphorus 31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS)&#xD;
      are powerful non invasive tools allowing the exploration of skeletal muscle structure and&#xD;
      energy metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This ambitious project is devoted to the anatomical, functional and metabolic&#xD;
      characterization of BCAA supplementation after NMES using MRI and 31P-MRS. Various markers of&#xD;
      muscle damage, including maximal voluntary force production, T2 values and apparent diffusion&#xD;
      coefficient (obtained by MRI) and energy metabolism assessed at rest and during exercise&#xD;
      (using 31P-MRS), will be obtained before and after NMES. This project is of utmost importance&#xD;
      for improving our knowledge of anatomic, metabolic and functional events related to BCAA&#xD;
      supplementation in the context of exercise-induced muscle damage&#xD;
