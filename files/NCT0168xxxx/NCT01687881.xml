  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will highlight and validate chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy (CSMT) for&#xD;
      cervicogenic headache (CEH). If the method proves to be effective, it will provide a new&#xD;
      non-pharmacological treatment option for CEH. This is especially important since&#xD;
      pharmacological management has minor effect in CEH, and alternative treatment options are&#xD;
      warranted. The applied methodology of the study will aim towards the highest possible&#xD;
      research standards. This international study is a collaboration between Akershus University&#xD;
      Hospital, Innlandet Hospital and University of Oslo (UiO), Norway and Macquarie University,&#xD;
      Australia. The multidisciplinary professional backgrounds are physiotherapy, chiropractic and&#xD;
      medicine. By increasing the methodological quality of the investigators research to a very&#xD;
      high level, the investigators see the method to work as a guide to increase the quality of&#xD;
      chiropractic research in the future, as previous randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of CEH&#xD;
      used methodology showing room for improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CSMT using the Gonstead method reduces days with CEH by at least 25% as compared to placebo&#xD;
      (sham manipulation, i.e. broad non-specific contact, non-directional, low velocity and low&#xD;
      amplitude) and no intervention (control group).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cervicogenic headache (CEH) is a symptomatic headache characterized by chronic unilateral&#xD;
      headache and symptoms and signs of neck involvement. CEH is often worsened by neck movement,&#xD;
      sustained awkward head position, external pressure over the upper cervical or occipital&#xD;
      region on the symptomatic side. Abolition of the headache following diagnostic anesthetic&#xD;
      blocks of cervical structures or local factors in neck give evidence that the pain is&#xD;
      attributed to a neck disorder or lesion. The prevalence of CEH is 0.2% in the general&#xD;
      population of Akershus County, i.e. 9,000 Norwegians have CEH. However, the prevalence varies&#xD;
      between 0.4-4.1% in studies applying less rigorous diagnostic criteria. The efficacy of&#xD;
      pharmacological management in CEH is poor. Patients suffering from CEH are commonly treated&#xD;
      with CSMT, but the methodology has one or more shortcomings in all studies. In addition, the&#xD;
      RCTs mostly included participant with infrequent CEH and did not follow the recommended&#xD;
      clinical guidelines by the International Headache Society (IHS) of intervention of at least&#xD;
      three months. An analysis of the literature as well as a recent pilot study suggests that&#xD;
      CSMT has an effect on headache intensity and duration, and medication intake. However, a&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial with high methodological quality on CEH still remains to&#xD;
      be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RCT is single blinded, placebo-controlled trial of CSMT using the Gonstead method vs.&#xD;
      sham manipulation and control group. If the treatment shows to be effective, the participants&#xD;
      whom receive sham manipulation or control will be offered true intervention after the&#xD;
      follow-up period and free of charge. This study will follow the recommendations set by the&#xD;
      clinical trial guidelines from the IHS, while the methodological quality control will in&#xD;
      general follow previous suggested criteria and the CONSORT statements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited through Akershus University Hospital and Innlandet Hospital,&#xD;
      Norway as well as through media advertising in Akershus and Oslo County. The diagnose is set&#xD;
      by a chiropractor and a neurologist with experience in headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trials consist of three stages: Run-in, intervention (treatment) and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One month of base line data collection where participants will fill-in a diagnostic headache&#xD;
      diary. Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics will be presented in tables with&#xD;
      mean and standard deviation (SD) for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be randomized by drawing prepared sealed lots. Each lot includes three&#xD;
      different interventions, i.e active treatment, sham manipulation and control group. The first&#xD;
      three participants will draw from the same lot until all three interventions are used. The&#xD;
      next lot with three interventions is then followed by the next three participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RCTs will be conducted by an experienced chiropractor. Active treatment consists of CSMT&#xD;
      using the Gonstead method. A specific contact, high velocity, low amplitude, short lever,&#xD;
      with no recoil post adjustment directed to spinal biomechanical dysfunction diagnosed by&#xD;
      standard chiropractic tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up at 3, 6 and 12 months post-treatment. During this period participants continue to&#xD;
      fill in a diagnostic headache diary. The control group will also be included in this phase of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analyzed with SPSS using standard statistical techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators based our calculation of sample size on migraine days from recent group&#xD;
      comparison studies of topiramate (38). The investigators calculated that a sample size of 16&#xD;
      patients was required to detect a difference in mean reduction in monthly headache days of&#xD;
      2.5 with 80% power, with p=0.05 as level of significance, and assuming a common SD of 2.5 for&#xD;
      active treatment and broad-based treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insurance is through &quot;The Norwegian System of Compensation to Patients&quot; (NPE) which is an&#xD;
      independent national body, set up to process compensation claims from patients who have&#xD;
      suffered an injury as a result of treatment under the Norwegian health service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics (REK) in Norway and Norwegian Social&#xD;
      Science Data Services approved the full PhD research protocol. The declaration of Helsinski&#xD;
      is followed.&#xD;
