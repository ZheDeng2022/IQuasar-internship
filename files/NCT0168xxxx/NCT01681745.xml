&#xD;
          -  Subject is willing and able to give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is committed to undergo an abdominoplasty procedure independent of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with study instructions and commit to all visits&#xD;
             for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is in good general health and free of any disease state or physical condition&#xD;
             that might impair evaluation or which in the investigator's opinion, expose the&#xD;
             subject to an unacceptable risk by study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is currently enrolled in an investigational drug or a device study that&#xD;
             specifically targets the abdominal area.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject currently smokes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a clotting disorder and/or has used an anticoagulant (e.g., warfarin,&#xD;
             clopidogrel, etc.) within seven (7) days prior to administration of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has used oral or inhaled steroids in the last 14 days and/or has been a&#xD;
             chronic user of inhaled or oral steroids in the past such that the investigator feels&#xD;
             subject may have compromised wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has used topical steroids in the abdominal area within the last 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is on any systemic immunosuppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has had prior surgery and/or treatment that alters the subcutaneous anatomy of&#xD;
             the target treatment sites: liposuction, cryolipolysis, or high-intensity focused&#xD;
             ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of abdominal hernia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has any of the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allergy or intolerance to lidocaine,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other local skin condition (e.g., skin infection) at target treatment site,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any physical or psychiatric condition that in the investigator's opinion would prevent&#xD;
             adequate study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic medical condition or use of medication that in the investigator's opinion&#xD;
             would affect study participation or wound healing (such as diabetes, hepatitis, HIV,&#xD;
             etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is known to be noncompliant or is unlikely to comply with the requirements of&#xD;
             the study protocol (e.g., due to alcoholism, drug dependency, mental incapacity) in&#xD;
             the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
