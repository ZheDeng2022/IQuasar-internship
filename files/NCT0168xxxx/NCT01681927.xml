      Idiopathic edema (IE) is an ill-defined syndrome of uncertain etiology that occurs virtually&#xD;
      exclusively in women. It has also been referred to as cyclical edema, periodic edema, fluid&#xD;
      retention syndrome and orthostatic edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present studies were designed to 1. Improve our ability to identify patients with&#xD;
      idiopathic edema by extending the clinical criteria from an increase in weight of &gt; 1.4 kg&#xD;
      between 8 AM to 10 PM to the inclusion of nocturia, a very important component to the&#xD;
      history. Additional aims are to: 2. Demonstrate orthostatic weight gain with or without edema&#xD;
      in idiopathic edema and autonomic failure that will identify a greater number of patients&#xD;
      suffering from variable degrees of weight gain and compare to controls or other conditions&#xD;
      associated with edema. The study will focus mainly on subjects with polycystic ovaries and&#xD;
      autonomic failure. 3. Provide a reasonable course of therapy that is presently not well&#xD;
      defined. 4. Provide evidence that orthostatic edema or weight gain has two common etiologies,&#xD;
      a. an increase in vascular membrane as in idiopathic edema and b. pooling of blood in the&#xD;
      lower extremities in autonomic failure due to a lack of vascular tone.&#xD;

      All postmenarchal female patients over the age of 14 years will be eligible to enter the&#xD;
      study except for the following exclusions: serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl, patients with&#xD;
      diabetes insipidus-nephrogenic and central, those on lithium therapy and diuretics that&#xD;
      cannot be held for 3 days. Subjects under the age of 18 will be asked tp complete the&#xD;
      questionnaire, which requires that the subject record the weights at 8 AM and 10 PM and&#xD;
      whether they get up at night to urines. If they gain more than three pounds during the day&#xD;
      and get up at night to urinate, they will be asked to keep a record of their weights and the&#xD;
      number of times they get up at night to urinate for one week. A consent form for patients&#xD;
      below the age of 18 has been developed for this age-group. Patients will be recruited from&#xD;
      referrals from the different subspecialty groups in the Winthrop Hospital system, mainly&#xD;
      pediatric endocrinology, obstetric and gynecology, neurology, ophthalmology, cardiology and&#xD;
      gastroenterology practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be placed in the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I: nonedematous patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. polycystic ovaries&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. autonomic failure-male and female&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Age and gender matched normals Group II-Edema not meeting criteria for idiopathic edema&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.Congestive heart failure 2.Cirrhosis of liver 3.Nephrosis 4.Pregnancy 5.Pre eclampsia&#xD;
      6.Unknown cause of edema, such as obesity. Group III-Orthostatic weight gain of &gt; 3 lbs&#xD;
      between 8 AM and 10 PM with nocturia&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Idiopathic edema, include patients in Group I-fluctuations in weight/nocturia&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Autonomic failure, include patients in Group I-fluctuations in weight/nocturia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group III subjects will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Record weights in pajamas before bedtime and after excreting first urine upon arising in&#xD;
           the morning for 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Record the number of times they get up to urinate and collect all urines passed&#xD;
           overnight in separate containers, including urine excreted upon arising in the morning.&#xD;
           The patient will record the time and date on each container provided for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24 hour study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood will be collected after waking up the following morning and at 7 PM the same day.&#xD;
           Blood will be analyzed for renal profile, renin, aldosterone, uric acid, phosphorus&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All urines excreted from the time after arising in the morning and collected in separate&#xD;
           containers throughout the following 24 hours and the times of collection noted. The&#xD;
           urines will be analyzed for osmolality, sodium, potassium, creatinine, uric acid, urea&#xD;
           and phosphorus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioimpedance Studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in group III will have bioimpedance studies performed in the morning upon arising&#xD;
      and in the evening to determine any change in body composition, i.e. change in volume of&#xD;
      extracellular, intracellular and total body water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of Interstitial Fluid:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In selected patients, an 18g needle will be placed subcutaneously in the mid-thigh and the&#xD;
      interstitial fluid collected by gravity to obtain 2-3 ml of fluid for analysis in late&#xD;
      afternoon. A blood sample will be obtained after completion of the sampling of edema fluid.&#xD;
      The serum will be analyzed for renal profile, total protein, albumin and electrophoresis. The&#xD;
      interstitial fluid will analyzed for renal profile, osmolality, total protein, albumin and&#xD;
      electrophoresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluorescein dye studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Group III and selected patients with polycystic ovaries without edema over the&#xD;
      age of 18 years will undergo a standard ophthalmologic fluorescein dye test to detect any&#xD;
      increase in vascular endothelial permeability. Patients with diabetes mellitus will be&#xD;
      excluded from this study.&#xD;
