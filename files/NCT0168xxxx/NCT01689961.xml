      Excess weight gain in pregnancy is a major problem affecting 55-75% of Canadian women who&#xD;
      enter pregnancy overweight or obese and about 40% of women who are normal weight. Excess&#xD;
      weight gain puts mothers at risk for health problems such as diabetes and developing or&#xD;
      sustaining obesity after pregnancy, and puts their babies at risk of being born too large or&#xD;
      developing related health problems. Mothers will be randomized to a structured high dairy&#xD;
      protein diet and walking program or the usual care by their care provider. The investigators&#xD;
      research questions are: Will a structured nutrition and exercise program in pregnancy&#xD;
      compared to usual prenatal care increase the chance that mothers will achieve pregnancy&#xD;
      weight gain within the current recommendations; improve health measures, in mother and infant&#xD;
      at six months post-partum; to evaluate the benefits of a high dairy intake in pregnancy on&#xD;
      maintenance of bone status in the mother and bone health outcomes in the child in early life&#xD;
      (6 months); and to investigate the interactions between genes associated with bone health and&#xD;
      high dairy diet supplementation on bone status in mothers during pregnancy, and bone health&#xD;
      in mothers post-delivery and children to 6 months of age. Mothers' weight, physical activity&#xD;
      and adherence to the nutrition plan will be assessed until birth and at follow-up with their&#xD;
      infants at 6 months after birth. The research team will ensure new information is quickly&#xD;
      transferred to programs to assist women to have healthier pregnancies.&#xD;

      This will be a 2-arm randomized 3-site trial. Recruitment will be within the community care&#xD;
      clinics by poster and flyer advertisements. Pregnant women will be stratified by BMI&#xD;
      categories and study site and randomized within strata to Group A (Nutrition+Exercise&#xD;
      intervention program) or Group B (Usual Prenatal Care + Health Canada materials about healthy&#xD;
      pregnancy + two focus group sessions exploring women's experiences with exercise, nutrition&#xD;
      and weight gain in pregnancy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary research question: Among pregnant women, does introducing a structured and monitored&#xD;
      nutrition and exercise program (treatment) in early pregnancy compared with Usual Prenatal&#xD;
      Care (control) increase the likelihood of attaining gestational weight gain within the&#xD;
      Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines over the pregnancy period? Secondary research&#xD;
      questions: Among pregnant women (population), does introducing a structured and monitored&#xD;
      nutrition and exercise program in early pregnancy (intervention) compared with Standard&#xD;
      Prenatal Care (control) lead to 1) better maternal outcomes (outcome) at 6 months post-&#xD;
      partum; and ii) better infant outcomes (outcome) at 6 months post partum?; and 2) i) to&#xD;
      evaluate the benefits of a high dairy intake in pregnancy on maintenance of bone status in&#xD;
      the mother and bone health outcomes in the child in early life (6 months); and ii) to&#xD;
      investigate the interactions between genes associated with bone health and high dairy diet&#xD;
      supplementation on bone status in mothers during pregnancy, and bone health in mothers&#xD;
      post-delivery and children to 6 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental and Control groups: Both groups of mothers and their health care providers will&#xD;
      be given the Health Canada materials on &quot;Healthy Weight Gain during Pregnancy&quot;, &quot;Eating Well&#xD;
      with Canada's Food Guide&quot; and the &quot;Pregnancy Weight Gain Calculator&quot;. Baseline information&#xD;
      will be recorded for eligible and consenting women after which they will be randomized to&#xD;
      Experimental or Control group. Nutrition intake, physical measures and physical activity will&#xD;
      be recorded at baseline, 26-28 weeks, 36-38 weeks of gestation, and 6 months postpartum in&#xD;
      the same manner for both groups. All mothers will receive the study promotional materials and&#xD;
      small incentives. Also, all mothers will be followed by their primary care provider and have&#xD;
      usual access to public health.&#xD;
