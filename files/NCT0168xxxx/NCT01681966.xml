      LNP is new extended release (ER) oily solution formulation of ropivacaine that is intended&#xD;
      for local infiltration into surgical wounds. The purpose of this study is to determine the&#xD;
      ease of usage and administration of LNP in the surgical setting, to follow the&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of LNP over 72 hours and evaluate the duration of analgesia&#xD;
      witnessed in the surgical setting.&#xD;

      LNP is new extended release (ER) oily solution formulation of ropivacaine that is intended&#xD;
      for local infiltration into surgical wounds. The formulation is designed to slowly release&#xD;
      the ropivacaine over 36-72 hours. By providing local analgesia over a long time span, the&#xD;
      need for systemic analgesics is expected to be reduced and hospital stays may be shortened.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the ease of usage and administration of LNP in the&#xD;
      surgical setting, to follow the PK profile of LNP over 72 hours and evaluate the duration of&#xD;
      analgesia witnessed in the surgical setting.&#xD;
