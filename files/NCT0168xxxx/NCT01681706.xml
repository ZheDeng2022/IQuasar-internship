      The purpose of this non-interventional study is to implement a survey initiative to assess&#xD;
      HIV prevalence for one or more diseases and/or conditions within a specific segment of the&#xD;
      population not yet diagnosed with HIV, who presents for care with the specific&#xD;
      disease/condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The list of diseases below is not indicative of the most important indicator diseases for HIV&#xD;
      but rather a list of diseases suggested for surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enrol patients presenting with the following diseases/conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Presenting for care of malignant lymphoma, irrespective of type&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Presenting for care of cervical or anal dysplasia or cancer, (Cervical CIN II and above)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Presenting for care of Hepatitis B or C virus infection (acute or chronic - and&#xD;
           irrespective of time of diagnosis relative to time of survey),&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Presenting with ongoing mononucleosis-like illness&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Presenting with unexplained leukocytopenia or thrombocytopenia lasting at least 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Presenting with seborrheic dermatitis / exanthema&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Presenting with pneumonia, admitted to hospital for at least 24h&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Presenting with unexplained lymphadenopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Presenting with peripheral neuropathy of unknown cause (diagnosed by neurologist)&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Presenting with primary lung cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Presenting with severe or recalcitrant psoriasis (newly diagnosed)&#xD;

      Most patients infected with HIV across the European continent remain undiagnosed; although&#xD;
      this percentage varies markedly from 15-80% across the continent. Undiagnosed HIV is harmful&#xD;
      to the person infected as appropriate health interventions are then delayed until the HIV&#xD;
      infection is diagnosed. It is also detrimental to society as persons unaware of their HIV&#xD;
      infection may transmit more frequently to others than persons that are aware of their HIV&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important public health issue is hence how to diagnose more HIV-infected persons earlier&#xD;
      in the course of their infection. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#xD;
      (CDC) has introduced testing guidelines where all persons are tested upon entry into the&#xD;
      hospital system (the &quot;opt-out&quot; testing guidelines).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the &quot;HIV in Europe&quot; conference held in November 2007, the general sense was that such an&#xD;
      approach would not be suitable for Europe. Conversely, the conference recommended further&#xD;
      development of focused HIV testing in patients presenting with certain clinical conditions&#xD;
      and/or diseases (i.e. indicator condition guided testing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost effectiveness analyses suggests cost savings if a population with a HIV prevalence of 1%&#xD;
      or more are tested although this rate may be as low as 0.1%. However, there is very little -&#xD;
      if any - evidence on HIV prevalence for various conditions and diseases in specific and easy&#xD;
      to identify sections of society. This is true in general and particularly across the European&#xD;
      continent.&#xD;
