    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Average Sleep Latency Time (in Minutes) as Determined From the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) for ADX-N05 300 mg vs. Placebo at Last Assessment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 12/Last Assessment post-dose.</time_frame>
    <description>The MWT is a validated objective measure of the ability to stay awake for a defined period of time. The primary analysis was a comparison of treatments vs. control groups on change from Baseline to last available post-Baseline assessment (Week 12/Last Assessment) in the average sleep latency time (in minutes) averaged across the first four trials of the MWT using a two-sample t-test.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Improved Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) Scores for ADX-N05 vs. Placebo at Last Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-C scale rated the change in the participant's condition as compared to the Baseline visit on a 7-point scale ranging from a minimum of &quot;Very much improved&quot; to a maximum of &quot;Very much worse.&quot; The proportion of subjects experiencing at least minimal improvement on the CGI-C was calculated and summarized for each of the treatment groups at Week 4 and the last available post-Baseline assessment (Week 12/Last Assessment). The CGI-C scale consists of the following ratings: 1-Very Much improved, 2-Much improved, 3-Minimally improved, 4-No change, 5-Minimally worse, 6-Much worse, 7-Very much worse; a rating of 1 indicates a better outcome, and a rating of 7 indicates a worse outcome. Improvement was defined as a CGI-rating of 1, 2, or 3.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 4 post-dose.</time_frame>
    <description>The MWT is a validated objective measure of the ability to stay awake for a defined period of time. The MWT consisted of five 40-minute trials separated by 2 hour intervals.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) Scores for ADX-N05 vs. Placebo at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 4 post-dose.</time_frame>
    <description>The ESS is a questionnaire intended to measure daytime sleepiness. In this test, participants answer questions with regard to the level of sleepiness they experienced over approximately the 7 days prior to the assessment while performing eight common, non-stimulating activities. The ESS total score range is 1 to 24. Each activity is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from a minimum of &quot;would never doze&quot; to a maximum of &quot;a high chance of dozing.&quot; Thus, the ESS scale range is as follows: 0=would never doze, 1=slight chance of dozing, 2=moderate chance of dozing, 3=high chance of dozing; 0 indicates a better outcome, and 3 indicates a worse outcome. A negative mean change value indicates a decrease in score from baseline and an improvement in daytime sleepiness.</description>

The primary analysis was a comparison of treatments vs. control groups on change from Baseline to last available post-Baseline assessment (Week 12/Last Assessment) in the average sleep latency time (in minutes) averaged across the first four trials of the MWT using a two-sample t-test.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Improved Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) Scores for ADX-N05 vs. Placebo at Last Assessment</title>
        <description>The CGI-C scale rated the change in the participant's condition as compared to the Baseline visit on a 7-point scale ranging from a minimum of &quot;Very much improved&quot; to a maximum of &quot;Very much worse.&quot; The proportion of subjects experiencing at least minimal improvement on the CGI-C was calculated and summarized for each of the treatment groups at Week 4 and the last available post-Baseline assessment (Week 12/Last Assessment). The CGI-C scale consists of the following ratings: 1-Very Much improved, 2-Much improved, 3-Minimally improved, 4-No change, 5-Minimally worse, 6-Much worse, 7-Very much worse; a rating of 1 indicates a better outcome, and a rating of 7 indicates a worse outcome. Improvement was defined as a CGI-rating of 1, 2, or 3.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) Scores for ADX-N05 vs. Placebo at Week 4</title>
        <description>The ESS is a questionnaire intended to measure daytime sleepiness. In this test, participants answer questions with regard to the level of sleepiness they experienced over approximately the 7 days prior to the assessment while performing eight common, non-stimulating activities. The ESS total score range is 1 to 24. Each activity is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from a minimum of &quot;would never doze&quot; to a maximum of &quot;a high chance of dozing.&quot; Thus, the ESS scale range is as follows: 0=would never doze, 1=slight chance of dozing, 2=moderate chance of dozing, 3=high chance of dozing; 0 indicates a better outcome, and 3 indicates a worse outcome. A negative mean change value indicates a decrease in score from baseline and an improvement in daytime sleepiness.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Improved PGI-C Scores for ADX-N05 vs. Placebo at Last Assessment</title>
        <description>The Patient Global Impression - Change (PGI-C) scale was completed by the subject at the Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 visits. The CGI-C scale rated the change in the participant's condition as compared to the Baseline visit on a 7-point scale ranging from a minimum of &quot;Very much improved&quot; to a maximum of &quot;Very much worse.&quot; The proportion of subjects experiencing at least minimal improvement on the CGI-C was calculated and summarized for each of the treatment groups at Week 4 and the last available post-Baseline assessment (Week 12/Last Assessment). The CGI-C scale consists of the following ratings: 1-Very Much improved, 2-Much improved, 3-Minimally improved, 4-No change, 5-Minimally worse, 6-Much worse, 7-Very much worse; a rating of 1 indicates a better outcome, and a rating of 7 indicates a worse outcome. Improvement was defined as a CGI-rating of 1, 2, or 3.</description>
