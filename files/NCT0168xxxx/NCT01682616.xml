  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      ABT-199 in combination with rituximab in up to 50 subjects with Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic&#xD;
      Leukemia and Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma. The primary objectives of this study are to assess&#xD;
      the safety profile, to determine the maximum tolerated dose and establish the Recommended&#xD;
      Phase Two Dose of ABT-199 when administered in combination with rituximab. The dose&#xD;
      escalation portion of the study will include approximately 30 subjects. Once the recommended&#xD;
      phase two dose and schedule have been determined, up to 20 additional subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled in an expanded safety portion of the study. Subjects who meet criteria for CR, CRi,&#xD;
      or MRD-negative PR during the study may discontinue ABT 199. If disease progression occurs,&#xD;
      as defined by iwCLL NCI/WG criteria for tumor response, or MRD progression, subjects may&#xD;
      re-initiate ABT-199.&#xD;
