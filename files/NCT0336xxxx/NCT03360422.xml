  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, men who have sex with men (MSM), young adults,&#xD;
      Black and Latino men and people in the Southern U.S. are at highest HIV risk and should be&#xD;
      targeted with cost-effective, scalable interventions. The study team propose a synergistic&#xD;
      mobile intervention to reduce alcohol and HIV risk in young adult MSM that combines 3&#xD;
      efficacious approaches.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      New prevention efforts must address alcohol and HIV and be directed to the highest-risk&#xD;
      groups. While interventions have targeted MSM, few have targeted young MSM specifically.&#xD;
      Young people and MSM bring particular challenges. Thus, it is important that prevention be&#xD;
      targeted to them and developed with their input. To that end, the goal of this project is to&#xD;
      lay the groundwork for a synergistic, mobile intervention to reduce alcohol use and risky sex&#xD;
      and prevent HIV among young adult MSM. This research study is made up of three related&#xD;
      sub-projects: 1) a web-based survey; 2) a series of focus groups and 3) a small, preliminary&#xD;
      acceptability and usability to study to test the mobile intervention. The proposed&#xD;
      intervention to be tested on a preliminary basis in this study combines brief motivational&#xD;
      intervention with daily interactive voice response (IVR) monitoring including personalized&#xD;
      feedback. Ultimately, this combined intervention will also include pre-exposure prophylaxis&#xD;
      (PrEP), however there will be no medication in this particular study. Each of these&#xD;
      components has efficacy in enhancing treatment adherence, reducing alcohol and/or HIV risk&#xD;
      but requires other interventions to maximize its potential benefit. Combining them will&#xD;
      capitalize on the strength of each, leading to a higher impact alcohol and HIV preventive&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
