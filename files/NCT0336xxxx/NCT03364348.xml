      This trial studies the best dose and side effects of utomilumab (4-1BB agonist monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody PF-05082566) with trastuzumab emtansine or trastuzumab in treating patients with&#xD;
      HER2-positive breast cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as utomilumab, trastuzumab emtansine, and trastuzumab may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and determine the recommended dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      utomilumab in combination with ado-rastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) or trastuzumab in subjects&#xD;
      with HER2 positive advanced breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the objective tumor response (ORR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the time to tumor response (TTR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the duration of response (DR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine progression free survival (PFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of utomilumab in combination with ado-trastuzumab&#xD;
           emtansine or trastuzumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT 1: Dose 1: Utomilumab 20 mg IV + ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) 3.6 mg/kg IV every&#xD;
      3 weeks. Dose 2: Dose Level 2 - Utomilumab 100 mg IV + ado-trastuzumab emtansine 3.6 mg/kg IV&#xD;
      every 3 weeks&#xD;
