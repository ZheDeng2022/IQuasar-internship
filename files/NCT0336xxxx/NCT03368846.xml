  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, open-label, non-randomised, single oral dose study in healthy male&#xD;
      subjects. It is planned to enrol a single cohort of 6 healthy male subjects to ensure data in&#xD;
      4 evaluable subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will receive a single administration of 120 mg [14C] varlitinib oral suspension&#xD;
      containing not more than (NMT) 2.9 MBq (79 µCi), in the fed state.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be screened for eligibility to participate in the study up to 28 days before&#xD;
      dosing. Subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit on the evening prior to IMP&#xD;
      administration (Day 1) and will fast overnight for a minimum of 8 h. Subjects will be dosed&#xD;
      on the morning of Day 1 following a light breakfast, and will remain resident in the clinic&#xD;
      until up to 240 h after dosing (Day 11). It is planned that subjects will be released as a&#xD;
      group when all subjects have achieved a mass balance cumulative recovery of &gt;90%, or if &lt;1%&#xD;
      of the dose administered has been collected in urine and faeces within 2 separate,&#xD;
      consecutive 24 h periods. In this case, collection of all samples (blood, urine and faeces)&#xD;
      will cease and the subjects will undergo discharge assessments. If this criterion has not&#xD;
      been met by all subjects on Day 11, the residency period may be extended by a further 48 h&#xD;
      maximum (up to Day 13). If the criterion is still not met by Day 13, or if additional&#xD;
      residency is not considered appropriate or necessary, then home collections of urine and/or&#xD;
      faeces may be requested at the discretion of the investigator for individual subjects.&#xD;
