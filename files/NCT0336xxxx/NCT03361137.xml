  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase IV, multicenter study will evaluate whether participants with Hemophilia A (PwHA)&#xD;
      with or without inhibitors receiving emicizumab prophylaxis can safely undergo minor surgical&#xD;
      procedures without additional prophylactic bypassing agents (BPA; for participants with&#xD;
      inhibitors) or factor VIII (FVIII; for participants without inhibitors).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The Sponsor decided to terminate the study early for several reasons (low enrollment, limited&#xD;
    variety of surgery types, and available scientific data).&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Without Excessive Bleeding at Surgical Sites and Did Not Require BPA/FVIII Use for Bleeding Related to the Surgery, From the Start of Surgery Until Discharge, as Measured by the ISTH Hemostatic Efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Determined at the time of discharge (within approximately 48 hours after surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) Assessment of Hemostatic Response for Surgical Procedures scale (see reference PubMed ID:25059285) has four categories, listed here in order of best to worst response: Excellent, Good, Fair, and Poor. The participant's bleeding related to surgery was evaluated by the healthcare professional who performed the procedure using the hemostatic efficacy scale, with an absence of excessive bleeding at the surgical site indicated by a good to excellent rating. The endpoint was met when the response to &quot;Intraoperative and/or postoperative blood loss increased over expectation for the non-hemophilic patient determined at the time of discharge&quot; was &quot;0 to &lt;10%&quot; or &quot;10% to &lt; 25%&quot; AND the response to the question &quot;Did the patient use any bypassing agent (BPA)/factor VIII (FVIII) for the surgery before the discharge?&quot; was &quot;No&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who, After Being Discharged From Surgery, Experienced Bleeds That Were Either Related or Unrelated to Surgery and Also Required BPA/FVIII Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 48 hours (if discharged home), and 8 and 28 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Post-surgical bleeding information was self-reported by participants (or the participant's legally authorized representative) on the &quot;Bleed and Medication Diary&quot;. Bypassing agents (BPAs)/factor VIII (FVIII) used to treat excessive bleeding were also self-reported by participants if it was self-administered. BPAs/FVIII administered by the investigators to treat the bleeding were reported on the &quot;Concomitant Medications&quot; case report form page. The percentage of participants by type and dose of BPA/FVIII used to treat the bleeding is also reported. rFVIIa = recombinant activated human factor VII (eptacog alfa [activated])</description>

    <measure>Emicizumab Plasma Concentration on the Day of Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 24 hours prior to surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Enrolled participants received a minimum of four loading doses of emicizumab prior to their surgical procedure. Pharmacokinetic blood samples were obtained at study sites 24 hours before the procedures in order to describe emicizumab plasma concentration on the day of surgery for each of the inhibitor and non-inhibitor cohorts.</description>

    <measure>Safety Summary of the Number of Participants With at Least One Adverse Event</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline up to 30 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>All adverse events (AEs) that occurred after informed consent was obtained were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) v23.0, summarized by severity according to the World Health Organization (WHO) toxicity grading scale (Grade 1 is mild; Grade 2 is moderate; Grade 3 is severe; Grade 4 is life-threatening; and Grade 5 is death related to AE), and tabulated by body system and preferred term (PT) for individual events within each system organ class (SOC). For each AE, the investigator independently assessed its severity and seriousness, and whether it was considered to be related to the study drug.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Surgical Complications Requiring Hospitalization or Return to Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 48 hours after surgery, and 8 and 28 days after initial surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This safety endpoint was a composite endpoint. Surgical complications were entered as adverse events on the case report form page with &quot;Other suspected causes&quot; marked as &quot;Study Surgery or Procedure&quot;. This endpoint was met when response to &quot;It required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization&quot; was checked OR response to &quot;Was procedure/surgery performed?&quot; was &quot;Yes&quot;.</description>

Participants must have received all loading doses prior to surgery and planned to continue emicizumab for a minimum of 1 month after surgery.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Without Excessive Bleeding at Surgical Sites and Did Not Require BPA/FVIII Use for Bleeding Related to the Surgery, From the Start of Surgery Until Discharge, as Measured by the ISTH Hemostatic Efficacy Scale</title>
        <description>The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) Assessment of Hemostatic Response for Surgical Procedures scale (see reference PubMed ID:25059285) has four categories, listed here in order of best to worst response: Excellent, Good, Fair, and Poor. The participant's bleeding related to surgery was evaluated by the healthcare professional who performed the procedure using the hemostatic efficacy scale, with an absence of excessive bleeding at the surgical site indicated by a good to excellent rating. The endpoint was met when the response to &quot;Intraoperative and/or postoperative blood loss increased over expectation for the non-hemophilic patient determined at the time of discharge&quot; was &quot;0 to &lt;10%&quot; or &quot;10% to &lt; 25%&quot; AND the response to the question &quot;Did the patient use any bypassing agent (BPA)/factor VIII (FVIII) for the surgery before the discharge?&quot; was &quot;No&quot;.</description>

        <description>Enrolled participants received a minimum of four loading doses of emicizumab prior to their surgical procedure. Pharmacokinetic blood samples were obtained at study sites 24 hours before the procedures in order to describe emicizumab plasma concentration on the day of surgery for each of the inhibitor and non-inhibitor cohorts.</description>

All participants received emicizumab via subcutaneous (SC) injection at a loading dose of 3 milligrams of medication per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg) once weekly for the first 4 weeks, followed by 1.5 mg/kg once weekly, or by any other approved maintenance regimen, as long as they continued to derive sufficient benefit.
