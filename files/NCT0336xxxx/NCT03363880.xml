      This is a national multi-center, cluster-randomized controlled trial. This cluster-randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial will be performed, with counties as the randomization units. The included&#xD;
      counties will be randomized into an experimental group and a control group. A trauma&#xD;
      treatment team will be only established in the experimental group. The in-hospital mortality&#xD;
      rate will be compared between the experimental and control groups to investigate the effects&#xD;
      of trauma treatment team establishment on the treatment of patients with severe trauma.&#xD;
