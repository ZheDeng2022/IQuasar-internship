  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a hereditary multi-system disease affecting approximately 30,000n&#xD;
      children and adults in the USA. The diagnosis of CF requires biochemical confirmation (either&#xD;
      abnormal sweat chloride measurement and/or identification of two CF disease causing&#xD;
      mutations) plus clinical symptomatology. Measurements of sweat chloride remain cumbersome and&#xD;
      although most common methodology to confirm CF diagnosis with limitations especially in young&#xD;
      children less than 6 months of age and in areas that lack ability for the complex testing.&#xD;
      The study objectives of this current research proposal include: A) To expand upon previously&#xD;
      obtained pilot study data &quot;Evaluation of a fluorescent-based chloride sensor as an optical&#xD;
      sweat test to diagnose cystic fibrosis&quot; B) To add the exploratory measurement of sweat&#xD;
      Bromide as a first in human assessment observation, C) To Evaluate the development of&#xD;
      smartphone based point-of-care technology for chloride and bromide sensor measurements, D) To&#xD;
      further expand the class of citrate-based sensors with improved fluorescence and sensing&#xD;
      properties for the design of new fluorescence-based analytical and diagnostic solutions based&#xD;
      on the automated multi-halide detection system, and E) To develop point-of-care systems that&#xD;
      can successfully integrate into clinical settings to improve current practices and facilitate&#xD;
      early detection of disease.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>No personally identifiable information will be communicated to investigators at PSU-University Park. Sweat samples will be identified solely by code which code will be linked to personally identifiable information known only to Dr. Vender and which code will be kept in a locked office at Hershey Medical Center (HMC) Biomedical Research Building C5860. This code will contain participant (both CF patients and healthy volunteers): name, HMC medical record #, age, gender, date of sample, date of birth and sweat chloride/bromide results. In the event of any publication or presentation resulting from the research, no personally identifiable information will be shared. Personally identifiable health information access (such as diagnosis, name, HMC medical record#, age, gender, date of birth) is specifically for Cystic Fibrosis patients. Medical records and health information will NOT be accessed for healthy control volunteers, however name, age, gender, date of birth will be recorded.</ipd_description>
