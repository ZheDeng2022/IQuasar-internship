    <time_frame>5 weeks overall (4 weeks of treatment and/or observations followed by a one-day visit at end of study in week 5)</time_frame>
    <description>The Wound-QoL is a tool to measure disease-specific, health-related quality of life of patients with chronic wounds. It consists of 17 items on impairments which is assessed for the previous 7 days and is competed by the patient. It has 3 subscales that can assess &quot;Body&quot;, &quot;Psyche&quot; and &quot;Everyday Life&quot;. These subscales cover items 1 to 16. Item 17 is not part of any of the subscales. The Wound-QoL can be used in clinical and observational studies and in daily practice.&#xD;
Each individual item is rated on a scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). A &quot;Total&quot; or &quot;Global&quot; score is the average of at least 13 completed questions, regardless of which questions were not completed. The average of each of the 3 subscales can be computed if no more than 1 item of the subscale is missing. The higher values represents more of an impact to the patient for that item.</description>

        <title>Wound-QoL Global Score</title>
        <description>The Wound-QoL is a tool to measure disease-specific, health-related quality of life of patients with chronic wounds. It consists of 17 items on impairments which is assessed for the previous 7 days and is competed by the patient. It has 3 subscales that can assess &quot;Body&quot;, &quot;Psyche&quot; and &quot;Everyday Life&quot;. These subscales cover items 1 to 16. Item 17 is not part of any of the subscales. The Wound-QoL can be used in clinical and observational studies and in daily practice.&#xD;
Each individual item is rated on a scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). A &quot;Total&quot; or &quot;Global&quot; score is the average of at least 13 completed questions, regardless of which questions were not completed. The average of each of the 3 subscales can be computed if no more than 1 item of the subscale is missing. The higher values represents more of an impact to the patient for that item.</description>

        <title>Wound QoL Subscore; Everyday Life Dimension</title>
        <description>The Wound-QoL is a tool to measure disease-specific, health-related quality of life of patients with chronic wounds. It consists of 17 items on impairments which is assessed for the previous 7 days and is competed by the patient. It has 3 subscales that can assess &quot;Body&quot;, &quot;Psyche&quot; and &quot;Everyday Life&quot;. It can be used in clinical and observational studies and in daily practice.&#xD;
Subscale &quot;Everyday Life&quot; consists of Items #Items #11 to #16. Each individual item is rated on a scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The average of the subscale can be computed if no more than 1 item of the subscale is missing. Generally, the higher values represents more of an impact to the patient for that item.</description>
