  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate a transperineal biopsy approach (outside of the&#xD;
      rectum) using MRI targeting to facilitate better access to the whole prostate gland and&#xD;
      provide limited risk of infectious complications after biopsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy and the second most common cause of cancer&#xD;
      death in men in the Western hemisphere. Definitive diagnosis of prostate cancer relies on&#xD;
      biopsy of the prostate gland, which is historically performed by taking 12 random biopsies of&#xD;
      the prostate by placing a needle through the rectum under ultrasound guidance. Recently,&#xD;
      advances in MRI techniques have allowed identification of suspicious lesions within the&#xD;
      prostate prior to biopsy, which has given rise to targeting biopsy cores to high-suspicion&#xD;
      areas using fused ultrasound-MRI images. However, the most commonly used transrectal approach&#xD;
      to biopsy is associated with a growing rate of infectious complications as well as poor&#xD;
      sampling of the anterior region of the prostate, which is furthest from the rectum.&#xD;
