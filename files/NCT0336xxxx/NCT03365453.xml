  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Italy, life expectancy at birth has reached 80 years in men and 85 in women; in about 50&#xD;
      years, life expectancy at the age of 80 has increased by an extraordinary 61% and 55%,&#xD;
      respectively, due to more effective therapies and lower mortality of many diseases. Yet,&#xD;
      chronic diseases are nowadays more important, and often coexist as comorbidity or&#xD;
      multimorbidity, depending on whether an index condition has been considered. These conditions&#xD;
      increase the risk of death and reduce functional autonomy in the elderly and, therefore,&#xD;
      should be carefully considered within comprehensive geriatric assessment. The epidemiology of&#xD;
      valvular disease shows a clear trend in age-dependent, as the number of events and their&#xD;
      incidence increases with age, and about half are concentrates over 75 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, some observational studies in elderly patients have suggested an association&#xD;
      between frailty and cardiovascular disease: fragility and cardiovascular disease share a&#xD;
      common biological pathway, and cardiovascular diseases may accelerate the onset of frailty.&#xD;
      The frailty syndrome was identified in 25% to 50% of patients with cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      according to the rating scale used and the population studied. Frail patients with&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, in particular those undergoing invasive procedures or suffering from&#xD;
      coronary artery disease and aortic valve disease, have a much higher adverse events and&#xD;
      complications, suggesting the need for a more accurate functional stratification and a more&#xD;
      careful evaluation of the risk/benefit ratio of some invasive procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the numerous tests proposed in the literature for the functional evaluation and&#xD;
      objective measures of physical capability in elderly patient, the Short Physical Performance&#xD;
      Battery (SPPB) and the evaluation of hand grip strength (grip strength) are those&#xD;
      characterized by an improved prognostic ability and an easy administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is performed to assess if SPPB and handgrip are helpful to better stratify&#xD;
      the prognosis (all-causes death and hospital admission for all causes) in elderly patients&#xD;
      admitted to hospital for cardiac causes.&#xD;

      This is a prospective study. This a single centre study involving the Maria Cecilia Hospital&#xD;
      (Ravenna, Italy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is expected to enroll at least 450 consecutive patients with ≥70 years, which are&#xD;
      admitted for:&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP A: severe aortic stenosis undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement GROUP B: severe&#xD;
      aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter valve implantation GROUP C: severe mitral&#xD;
      regurgitation undergoing surgical repair GROUP D: severe mitral regurgitation undergoing&#xD;
      MITRACLIP repair&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients, the following functional assessments will be performed before&#xD;
      surgical/percutaneous intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      handgrip test (see definition below). Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ, see&#xD;
      definition below). Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB, see definition below).&#xD;
      Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI, see definition below). The aim of the study is to&#xD;
      assess the relationship between frailty score and prognosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      HANDGRIP (HGT). The handgrip test measures the force of contraction of the flexor muscles of&#xD;
      the fingers through the use of a dynamometer. From literature it is known as such index&#xD;
      correlates with the eventual malnutrition of the subject, with its capacity of recovery and&#xD;
      functional recovery post-surgery, as well as to be in relation with age. In each patient,&#xD;
      three measurements will be carried out. Will be taken into consideration for the study the&#xD;
      highest value. The measurement will be performed as indicated by current guidelines, with the&#xD;
      patient seated, with the dominant hand and the elbow flexed 90°. All medical personnel&#xD;
      involved in the study performed a specific course to learn the proper management and&#xD;
      execution of screening with handgrip tes and has personal experience in its proper execution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SHORT PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE BATTERY (SPPB). The scale SPPB is a short battery of tests created&#xD;
      to evaluate the functionality of the lower limbs. This battery is made up of 3 different&#xD;
      sections designed to assess a balance with 3 tests: the maintenance of the position with the&#xD;
      feet together for 10 seconds then the semi-tandem and finally tandem again for 10 seconds.&#xD;
      The score of this section varies from a minimum of 0 if the patient is unable to maintain&#xD;
      position with your feet together for at least 10 seconds to a maximum of 4 if he can&#xD;
      accomplish all three tests. The second section of the test is intended to evaluate the&#xD;
      progress of 4 linear meters and depending on the time of the performance section of the score&#xD;
      ranges from 0 if unable, at one point if the performance has a longer duration of 8.7&#xD;
      seconds, for a up to 4 if he can accomplish the task in less than 4.80 sec. The third section&#xD;
      investigates the ability of the battery to run for 5 consecutive times, getting up from a&#xD;
      chair without using the arms in this regard that must be crossed in front of chest. Also in&#xD;
      this case, the score ranges from 0 incapable or if the performance has a duration greater&#xD;
      than 60 seconds, to a maximum of 4 if such performance is carried out in less than 11.20&#xD;
      seconds. The scores range from 0 (worst performance) to 12 (best performance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A score between 5 and 9 shows seniors still independent, but with reduced physical&#xD;
      performance, which can therefore be regarded as fragile and high risk, deserving of special&#xD;
      attention and specific interventions, acts to reduce the risk of adverse consequences. Data&#xD;
      in the literature confirm that the SPPB correlates with the risk of developing disability in&#xD;
      mobility, in proportion to the decrease of the SPPB score, regardless of age, sex and&#xD;
      presence of certain chronic diseases. The SPPB score then emerges as a powerful predictor of&#xD;
      disability and mortality in the elderly population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MULTIDIMENSIONAL PROGNOSTIC INDEX (MPI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) is a prognostic tool based on a standard&#xD;
      Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) that predicts short- and long-term mortality in&#xD;
      elderly subjects. The MPI includes 63 items distributed in 8 domains of CGA as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activities of Daily Living (ADL): 6 items Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL): 8&#xD;
      items Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ): 10 items Mini Nutritional&#xD;
      Assessement (MNA): 18 items Exton-Smith Scale (ESS): 5 items Cumulative Index Rating Scale -&#xD;
      Comorbidity Index (CIRS-CI): 14 items Number of drugs used: 1 item Co-habitation status: 1&#xD;
      item On the basis of MPI values, it is possible to calculate the short- and long-term&#xD;
      mortality risk of the older subjects and to define the severity grade of mortality risk: low,&#xD;
      moderate and severe. Several studies showed that the prognostic accuracy of the aggregated&#xD;
      MPI was significantly greater than the prognostic accuracy of its individual components&#xD;
      considered singularly. Thus the multidimensional approach can be successfully used in elderly&#xD;
      patients for both clinical and administrative purposes.&#xD;
