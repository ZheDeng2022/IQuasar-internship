      This study designed to examine changes of immune system cells sub-populations during&#xD;
      influenza disease. Several parameters will be examined, such as: amount of sub populations,&#xD;
      clinical parameters (body temperature and number of hospitalization days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants are children that are hospitalized in the Laniado hospital pediatric&#xD;
      department.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In late March and early April 2009 an outbreak of a novel influenza virus designated A/H1N1&#xD;
      influenza (popularly known as swine flu) was reported in Mexico, with subsequent cases&#xD;
      observed in many countries, leading to the declaration by the World Health Organization of a&#xD;
      worldwide pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first case of influenza A/H1N1 in Israel was diagnosed at the end of April 2009 at&#xD;
      Laniado Hospital in a young man returning from Mexico.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Influenza A/H1N1 (Swine flu) carries a relatively high morbidity, particularly in young&#xD;
      patients. Early identification would enable prompt initiation of therapy, thereby improving&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2009, during the H1N1 pandemic in Israel, a research was conducted in our department of&#xD;
      pediatrics. The researchers Sharon et al. (1) have compared a group of 53 children infected&#xD;
      with Influenza A H1N1, with a group of 53 children that presented with flu symptoms but were&#xD;
      found negative for the virus. This comparison demonstrated a significant reduction in&#xD;
      lymphocyte count during the acute phase of the disease (days 1-3) with resolution on day 7&#xD;
      (6-9) as well as reduction in the neutrophil count on day 5 from the onset of high fever with&#xD;
      subsequent resolution 2-4 days later (days 7-10). This phenomenon was not observed in the&#xD;
      patients that were not infected with the H1N1 virus. Similar results were reported by Cao and&#xD;
      co-authors (2) that observed it in both pediatric and adult patients. Lewis at al suggested&#xD;
      that the lymphopenia is mainly due to reduction in T cells and to a lesser extent in B cells&#xD;
      (3). The lymphopenia typical of influenza A H3N3 during acute illness was shown to be due to&#xD;
      a reduction in both T and B cells without alteration in the CD4:CD8 ratio. This is in&#xD;
      contrast to the findings of Cao et al. (2) who noted an abnormal CD4:CD8 ratio in half of&#xD;
      those who were positive for A H1N1. One of the possible explanations as proposed by Nichols&#xD;
      and Collaborators (4) is that early lymphopenia and the later neutropenia in the influenza&#xD;
      infected patients may represent migration of these cells from the circulation to the infected&#xD;
      respiratory tract as a consequence of infection. Goals of our research To quantify the B, T&#xD;
      and NK populations of lymphocytes during different stages of the disease caused by Infuenza A&#xD;
      H1N1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study methods The subjects of the study were children that were hospitalized at our&#xD;
      department with signs and symptoms of flu. The parents or legal guardians of the participants&#xD;
      have signed a written consent. At the first stage an upper respiratory swab was taken to&#xD;
      determine the presence of Infuenza A H1N1 (the virus identification was done by RT - PCR).&#xD;
      Then the different subtypes of lymphocytes were quantified at different stages of the&#xD;
      disease. The identification and quantification of the different cell types were performed by&#xD;
      FACS method, the cell receptors that were marked were CD31, CD19, CD4, CD3, CD45, CD8, CD56.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cellular markers were assessed by flow cytometry. Cell staining was performed on single cell&#xD;
      suspensions using pre-cooled PBS in 5 ml FACS tubes. Washing steps were performed by&#xD;
      centrifugation for 5min, 300 g, 5°C, brake 5 after which supernatants were completely&#xD;
      pipetted off and cell pellets (typically containing 0.2-1.0×106 cells) were re-suspended in&#xD;
      100 μl PBS (without Ca++and Mg++) supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, stained with&#xD;
      specific fluorochrome-conjugated anti-human antibodies or isotype-matched non-specific&#xD;
      controls and incubated in the refrigerator 2-8°C for 30 min. After incubation, cells were&#xD;
      washed by centrifugation and re-suspended in 0.25-0.5 ml cold PBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cells tested were stained with mouse monoclonal antibodies for CD45-FITC, CD45-PE a pan&#xD;
      leukocyte marker, T Cell marker CD3-PE CD8-FITC, T helper cells CD4-FITC, CD8-PE, Natural&#xD;
      killer (NK) cell marker CD56-PE, monocyte marker CD31-FITC and B cell marker CD19-PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emission compensation was done by positive control tubes containing cells that were stained&#xD;
      with CD45-FITC or CD45-PE; Dead cells were excluded by staining with 7-aminoactinomycin D,&#xD;
      only un-stained viable cells were analyzed. At least 10,000 cellular events per sample were&#xD;
      analyzed using the CellQuest Pro or FlowJo software. Percentages of isotype control antibody&#xD;
      staining, not exceeding 1% stained cells, were used to set the 'positive'staining gates, and&#xD;
      were deduced from the specific antibody results. The results are expressed as the percentage&#xD;
      of stained cells.&#xD;
