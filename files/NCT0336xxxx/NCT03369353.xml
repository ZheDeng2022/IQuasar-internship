    <textblock>
      The goal of the Precision Diagnosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Cellular Therapies, and&#xD;
      Transplantation (PREDICT) trial is to apply a systems-biology approach to enable precision&#xD;
      diagnostics for the key immunologic outcomes for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease,&#xD;
      Cellular Therapeutics and Transplantation. This approach will deepen the understanding of the&#xD;
      molecular mechanisms driving auto- and allo-immune diseases and serve as a critical platform&#xD;
      upon which to design evidence-based treatment paradigms for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study will examine the immunology of auto- and allo-immune gastrointestinal&#xD;
      disturbances such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD), and&#xD;
      Functional Gastrointestinal Disorder (FGID), as well as the immune manifestations after CAR-T&#xD;
      and other cellular therapeutics. The Investigators seek to use blood and tissue samples in&#xD;
      order to better understand the mechanisms driving these diseases and their therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators further hypothesize that longitudinal systems-based immunologic analysis&#xD;
      will enable the patient-specific determination of the molecular evolution of IBD, GVHD and&#xD;
      the response to cellular therapeutics, as well post-transplant defects in protective&#xD;
      immunity, and determine which pathways, when perturbed, can cause clinical disease. The&#xD;
      discovery of these pathways will lead to improved diagnostic, prognostic and treatment&#xD;
      approaches, and to personalized therapeutic decision-making for these patients.&#xD;

      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #1: The Investigators hypothesize that they can define the molecular mechanisms&#xD;
      responsible for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and gastrointestinal (GI) acute GVHD and&#xD;
      differentiate it from other inflammatory disorders by using advanced immunologic analysis&#xD;
      including flow cytometry, TCR deep sequencing and transcriptomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #2: The Investigators further hypothesize that longitudinal systems-based&#xD;
      immunologic analysis will enable the patient-specific determination of the molecular&#xD;
      evolution of IBD as well as acute and chronic GVHD as well post-transplant defects in&#xD;
      protective immunity, and determine which pathways, when perturbed, can cause clinical&#xD;
      disease. The discovery of these pathways will lead to improved diagnostic, prognostic and&#xD;
      treatment approaches, and to personalized therapeutic decision-making for patients undergoing&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #3: We hypothesize that we can define the molecular mechanisms, phenotypic and&#xD;
      functional immunologic characteristics involved in distinct determinants of adoptive cellular&#xD;
      therapies, including the efficacy, longevity and toxicity associated with cellular therapy.&#xD;
      Longitudinal characterization of cellular therapeutics and the endogenous immune response&#xD;
      they elicit using advanced immunologic analysis including flow cytometry, mass spectrometry,&#xD;
      TCR deep sequencing and single-cell transcriptomics will allow identification and distinction&#xD;
      of pathways critical for efficacy and toxicity and enable subsequent therapeutic modulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1: To identify the mechanisms specific for IBD and GI acute GVHD and delineate&#xD;
      it from other inflammatory disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Perform flow cytometry, TCR deep sequencing and whole transcriptome analysis on&#xD;
      T cells purified from GI tissue samples taken from patients who undergo endoscopy for&#xD;
      presumed GI GVHD, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and functional gastrointestinal disease&#xD;
      (FGID).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Perform flow cytometry, TCR deep sequencing and transcriptome analysis on T&#xD;
      cells from the peripheral blood at the time of endoscopy in patients diagnosed with GI GVHD,&#xD;
      IBD, and FGID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: Characterize the immunologic dysregulation responsible for IBD, acute GVHD,&#xD;
      chronic GVHD and defects in protective immunity in patients undergoing HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Perform longitudinal immune analysis on T cells and B cells purified from&#xD;
      patients with IBD and those undergoing allogeneic HCT. For transplant patients, we will&#xD;
      compare T and B cell immunity in patients who develop acute and chronic GVHD, relapse, and&#xD;
      infectious complications post-transplant and compare to patients without these complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Perform microbiome analysis longitudinally in patients with IBD and those&#xD;
      undergoing HCT to determine the impact of microbiome alterations in the development of&#xD;
      post-transplant complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #3: Identify the molecular and cellular immunologic mechanisms involved in&#xD;
      determining the clinical response to cellular therapies and distinguish pathways critical to&#xD;
      a successful anti-tumor response from those involved in adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Characterize the cellular product prior to administration and track its&#xD;
      distribution, kinetics, persistence and function longitudinally in vivo in the patient's&#xD;
      peripheral blood and when applicable bone marrow, CSF and other tissues, using qPCR-based&#xD;
      transgene detection (if applicable), flow cytometry, mass cytometry, TCR deep sequencing and&#xD;
      whole transcriptome analysis on T cells and other immune cells contained in the cellular&#xD;
      product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Longitudinally interrogate the interplay of the cellular therapy with the&#xD;
      endogenous immune system and delineate the role of the endogenous immune response in the&#xD;
      efficacy, persistence and toxicity of cellular therapy, using flow cytometry, mass cytometry,&#xD;
      TCR deep sequencing, whole transcriptome analysis on endogenous immune cells and analysis of&#xD;
      soluble factors and antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBD: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) which includes Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative&#xD;
      Colitis (UC), is a chronic complex gastrointestinal (GI) autoimmune condition that inflicts&#xD;
      1.4 million people in the united states1. The incidence and prevalence of both CD and UC are&#xD;
      increasing over time and encompassing larger areas of the world1,2. In addition, pediatric&#xD;
      IBD comprises 25% of all diagnosed IBD, relegating the child to a lifetime of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disease and exposure to immunosuppression especially during a period meant&#xD;
      for growth and development. Despite ongoing research into the pathogenesis and genetic&#xD;
      abnormalities, the mechanism behind IBD development and progression is not well understood.&#xD;
      Standard therapies still rely on steroids, other non-specific immunosuppression (such as&#xD;
      methotrexate and azathioprine), and anti-TNF biologics. Although newer therapies such as&#xD;
      agents that block cytokines and leukocyte trafficking are emerging, no universally successful&#xD;
      treatments have been identified. Thus, relapsing forms of IBD continue to lead to systemic&#xD;
      compromise in nutritional absorptive capacity, anemia, and often, to the need for surgical&#xD;
      interventions. Deciphering the mechanisms driving the unique subtypes of IBD (even within UC&#xD;
      and CD) then optimizing treatment based on the underlying systemic dysregulation is a&#xD;
      critical unmet need in the field. While the underlying immune mechanism of IBD remains&#xD;
      undetermined, there is significant data to suggest that IBD may represent an inappropriate&#xD;
      immune response towards self antigens and commensal microbiota in a genetically susceptible&#xD;
      host3. Thus, murine colitis models suggest that mucosal inflammation results from pathologic&#xD;
      T helper- (Th) cell responses, along with regulatory cell defects. These data have emerged&#xD;
      from experiments in IL-2 deficient mice4, IL-10 deficient mice5, TGF-beta6, and TGF-betaGRII&#xD;
      dominant negative transgenic mice7. The pathogenesis also includes an exaggeration in&#xD;
      effector cell responses, which have emerged from experiments in Stat4 transgenic mice8 and&#xD;
      TNFARE mutant mice9. More recently human cytokine analysis suggests that despite clinical&#xD;
      similarities, each subtype of IBD show distinctive cytokine profiles10. Although initial&#xD;
      studies have begun to target specific effector T cell pathways11, the application of target&#xD;
      organ transcriptomics is in its infancy and individual targetable pathways are still elusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCT: Allogeneic HCT is an effective treatment for patients with malignant and non-malignant&#xD;
      hematologic diseases. However, this treatment is complicated with high rates of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality limiting its broader application. The leading causes of post-transplant morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality include acute and chronic GVHD, relapse and infectious disease. The goal of the&#xD;
      PREDICT trial is to apply a systems approach to understanding the mechanisms driving these&#xD;
      complications, such that evidence-based treatment strategies can be devised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute GVHD: Acute GVHD is mediated by donor-derived allo-reactive T cells becoming activated&#xD;
      and resulting in cytotoxicity against host cells12,13 as well as cytokine-mediated tissue&#xD;
      damage. Moderate to severe acute GVHD can occur in up to 60% of patients undergoing HCT and&#xD;
      the more severe forms have been associated with mortality rates &gt;50%14-17. The most common&#xD;
      sites of the immune-mediated tissue damage are the liver, skin, and gastrointestinal (GI)&#xD;
      tract. GI GVHD occurs in 40-50% of HCT patients and is the major cause of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality from this disease17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of GI GVHD is derived from clinical and histopathological findings. GVHD can&#xD;
      occur in both the upper and lower GI tract leading to symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain,&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, and/or anorexia12. Histopathological diagnostic criteria for GI GVHD&#xD;
      includes identification of crypt cell apoptosis, crypt destruction and/or mucosa&#xD;
      denudation18. Unfortunately, the severity of GVHD on histology is poorly correlated with the&#xD;
      clinical course of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While GI GVHD is a common complication following HCT there remain many barriers to its&#xD;
      consistent and accurate diagnosis. First, diagnosis is dependent on appropriate tissue&#xD;
      sampling. Visible lesions are frequently absent19 and endoscopic findings can be diffuse and&#xD;
      nonspecific. There is also no consensus on the optimal location of the GI tract for biopsies&#xD;
      or number of biopsies needed to secure a diagnosis. There is also frequent discordance&#xD;
      between biopsy specimens from the upper and lower GI tract20. Second, patients presenting&#xD;
      early in the course of GVHD may have subtle histopathological findings that may be missed or&#xD;
      not yet present. At the onset of GVHD few apoptotic cells may be seen and crypt loss and&#xD;
      mucosal damage may yet to have occured18. Lastly, there are also confounding factors that can&#xD;
      lead to the misdiagnosis of GVHD that include conditioning regimen related toxicity,&#xD;
      concomitant infections, and medications which can all cause focal inflammation of the GI&#xD;
      tract. In the first 20 days following a myeloablative conditioning regimen diffuse apoptosis&#xD;
      can be seen mimicking acute GVHD21. Clostridium difficile and cytomegalovirus infections can&#xD;
      also have similar clinical and histopathological presentations22. Use of mycophenolate&#xD;
      mofetil23 and proton pump inhibitors24 have also been found associated with GI tract&#xD;
      apoptosis that can be misdiagnosed as GVHD. All of these factors lead to the high degree of&#xD;
      inter-observer variability in the histological diagnosis of GVHD18,25 and poor correlation&#xD;
      with the clinical observations, illustrating the need for more sensitive and specific methods&#xD;
      of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been recent advances in the identification of biomarkers in GVHD that have&#xD;
      diagnostic and prognostic significance. IL-8, IL-2 receptor-alpha, tumor necrosis factor&#xD;
      receptor-1 (TNF-1), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), elafin, regenerating islet-derived&#xD;
      3-alpha (reg-3alpha), TIM3, IL-6, ST2, B-cell activating factor (BAFF), IL-33, CXCL10, and&#xD;
      CXCL11 have all been found to have utility in predicting the development of GVHD26-28. While&#xD;
      these biomarkers have been identified they have not been extensively validated and are yet to&#xD;
      be clinically adopted as a guide to alter treatment. Moreover, the biomarkers discovered thus&#xD;
      far are often the result of downstream pathway perturbations and discovering the upstream&#xD;
      dysregulation that occurs earlier in the course of the disease may be valuable in developing&#xD;
      diagnostic or prognostic models that could lead to trials aimed at altering the natural&#xD;
      course of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our group has previously shown that by using advanced immunologic analysis including flow&#xD;
      cytometry, and whole transcriptome analysis, we can identify previously unrecognized&#xD;
      molecular pathways active in GVHD29-31. We anticipate that by utilizing a systems immunology&#xD;
      approach in patients with acute GVHD we will be able to identify pathways that have&#xD;
      diagnostic and prognostic value. This may enhance our diagnostic capacity and most&#xD;
      importantly, allow us to individualize management of patients based on their specific&#xD;
      immunologic profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic GVHD: CGVHD occurs in 40-60% of transplant patients32-35 with the incidence of this&#xD;
      disease rising in the past 2 decades36 chronic GVHD causes significant mortality, and in&#xD;
      those patients that survive, it can result in profound effects on quality of life37-40.&#xD;
      Despite the increased frequency of chronic GVHD, accurate diagnosis and evidence-based&#xD;
      therapy is still lacking. Thus, while chronic GVHD biomarkers have been identified there have&#xD;
      yet to be any that qualify for clinical application41. Moreover, these biomarkers often&#xD;
      represent end-stage pathway perturbations and may result from nonspecific inflammation and&#xD;
      tissue damage as well as counter-regulatory mechanisms. In addition to the challenges in&#xD;
      diagnosis, there are significant treatment challenges as well: Thus, treatment of chronic&#xD;
      GVHD has not changed significantly over the past few decades. First line therapy remains&#xD;
      corticosteroids with or without calcineurin inhibitiors (CNIs)42-44 and unfortunately,&#xD;
      approximately 50% of patients will fail and require second line treatment45,46 with&#xD;
      failure-free survival at 2 years following second-line therapy being only 25%47. These data&#xD;
      underscore the significant unmet needs in this field, both for molecular diagnostics and&#xD;
      evidence-based treatment paradigms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protective Immunity: In addition to the challenges of acute and chronic GVHD, patients&#xD;
      undergoing HCT and those with IBD face other toxicities as well, many of which are related to&#xD;
      dysfunctional immune reconstitution after transplant. However, although the phenomenology of&#xD;
      the many defects in protective immunity (both against infectious pathogens and against&#xD;
      leukemia relapse) is well-documented, the causative molecular mechanisms remain unknown. To&#xD;
      address these questions, our group and others have begun to perform detailed assessments of&#xD;
      immunologic reconstitution after HCT including the application of new T Cell Receptor (TCR)&#xD;
      and B cell Receptor (BCR) deep-sequencing technologies30,48-54. These technologies allow the&#xD;
      investigation of the breadth and depth of post-transplant immune reconstitution at a level of&#xD;
      molecular detail not previously possible and hold the promise of deepening our understanding&#xD;
      of the impact of infectious pathogens on global immune health and immune reconstitution. The&#xD;
      widespread application of these technologies, and their intersection with detailed assessment&#xD;
      of immune phenotype and function can provide novel insights about the state of immune health&#xD;
      in transplant patients, and holds the promise of identifying patients in need of novel&#xD;
      interventions to improve their post-transplant immune reconstitution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the PREDICT trial is to apply a systems-biology approach to enable precision&#xD;
      diagnostics for the key immunologic outcomes post-transplant. This approach will deepen our&#xD;
      understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving the most deadly post-transplant&#xD;
      complications, and serve as a critical platform upon which to design evidence-based treatment&#xD;
      paradigms for transplant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cellular Therapy: Novel adoptive cell therapies are increasingly entering clinical trials and&#xD;
      are available as FDA approved biologics, thereby providing a therapeutic option for&#xD;
      previously refractory patients. This broad and exciting field includes chimeric-antigen&#xD;
      receptor (CAR) T cells directed against a variety of antigens55, T cells genetically modified&#xD;
      to express TCRs56,57, cytokine-stimulated NK-cells58, as well as tumor vaccine approaches&#xD;
      with endogenous, irradiated tumor samples59 or immune cells pulsed with tumor antigen.60&#xD;
      Chimeric antigen-receptor T cells have led to dramatic responses, particularly in patients&#xD;
      with CD19+ B-cell malignancies61-64, leading to FDA approval of several products. While&#xD;
      unprecedented clinical remissions can be achieved initially, the approach is frequently&#xD;
      limited by the durability of the response and CAR T cell persistence with an EFS of 50% at 12&#xD;
      months after infusion61, tumor escape mechanisms65 and significant toxicity involving&#xD;
      cytokine release syndrome, neurologic toxicity66. In the context of CAR T cell therapy, key&#xD;
      factors for successful application have been identified and include incorporation of a&#xD;
      costimulatory signaling mechanism67,68, association of in vivo CAR T cell expansion with&#xD;
      response69 and contribution of T cell phenotypic subgroups with capacity to proliferate and&#xD;
      persist long term70. Additionally, important insights into the roles of IL-6 and IL-1 in&#xD;
      cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity71,72 and the contribution of a pan-T cell&#xD;
      infiltrate and high cytokine levels in the CNS as mediators of neurotoxicity 73, have been&#xD;
      gained by our group and others. However, there is a significant unmet need to apply a&#xD;
      systematic approach interrogating the determinants of a successful response, toxicity,&#xD;
      interaction with the endogenous immune system and short- and long-term effects of&#xD;
      interventions aimed at reducing toxicity such as administration of the IL6R-antagonist&#xD;
      Tocilizumab or IL-1 blockade74.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we aim to systematically interrogate the characteristics of cell therapy&#xD;
      products, evolution after administration in vivo and behavior in different compartments such&#xD;
      as peripheral blood, bone marrow, CNS and if applicable tissues and their interplay with the&#xD;
      endogenous immune system. Single cell transcriptomics, coupled with TCR-sequencing (when&#xD;
      applicable BCR sequencing) and phenotypic characterization of transferred and endogenous&#xD;
      immune cells as well as analysis of secreted immune factors such as cytokines, chemokines and&#xD;
      antibodies in the plasma will be employed and correlated with clinical responses. This&#xD;
      unbiased, systematic precision-diagnostic approach will allow identification of critical&#xD;
      pathways which are common or distinct depending on the nature of the cell therapeutic&#xD;
      approach, target and disease entities and associated or segregable from undesired toxicities.&#xD;
      This will critically inform future rational design of cellular therapeutics and inform&#xD;
      possible therapeutic interventions after cell therapy administration.&#xD;
