  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease affecting 415 million people worldwide, 90% of cases&#xD;
      are type 2 which is frequently associated with obesity and a sedentary lifestyle. In healthy&#xD;
      individuals, insulin stimulates increased cell surface expression of a glucose transporter&#xD;
      (GLUT4) in muscle and fat tissue. This prevents blood sugar levels becoming dangerously high&#xD;
      by taking sugar into the muscle and fat cells. Loss of this response ('insulin resistance')&#xD;
      frequently occurs before the development of type 2 diabetes. Understanding the cell biology&#xD;
      of insulin resistance is necessary to develop more effective treatments for this condition&#xD;
      and prevent further cases of type 2 diabetes. Previous work showed that this movement of&#xD;
      GLUT4 is dependent on a small protein called Rab3 which is downregulated in insulin&#xD;
      resistance. Rab3 protein levels are also sensitive to inflammation, a state that is&#xD;
      exacerbated by obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to examine whether Rab3 is an early biomarker of insulin resistance, we aim to&#xD;
      measure the levels of this protein and its interactors in fat and muscle samples from insulin&#xD;
      resistant individuals. It has been shown that insulin sensitivity can be improved with an&#xD;
      intervention as short as three weeks when net energy intake is sufficiently reduced.&#xD;
      Therefore, by taking the same measurements before and after this three week intervention we&#xD;
      can observe any improvements in Rab3 expression and insulin sensitivity at a cellular level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also evidence for an effect of the gut microbiome on insulin sensitivity so we will&#xD;
      measure any changes that take place in the gut microbiome following this intervention, which&#xD;
      can be determined from faecal samples taken before and after the three weeks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease affecting 415 million people worldwide and 3.5&#xD;
      million people in the UK, with ninety percent suffering from type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      is characterised by the inability of muscle and fat tissues to adequately respond to&#xD;
      physiological levels of insulin (peripheral tissue insulin resistance), and to restore the&#xD;
      normal levels of sugars in the bloodstream. Insulin resistance may occur prior to the&#xD;
      development of type 2 diabetes and has been shown to be strongly linked to lifestyle and to&#xD;
      obesity, although the underlying mechanisms are incompletely resolved. A defining&#xD;
      characteristic of insulin resistance is abnormal glucose transport as a result of decreased&#xD;
      cell surface expression of the glucose receptor GLUT4. In healthy adipose and skeletal muscle&#xD;
      this receptor is trafficked to the cell surface in response to an insulin stimulus. We have&#xD;
      shown that this translocation to the cell membrane requires the protein Rab3, and expression&#xD;
      levels of this protein are reduced in cell models of insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesise that this downregulation of Rab3 is associated with the development of insulin&#xD;
      resistance and its activity would increase following the restoration of insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to examine the effect on Rab3 levels and GLUT4 trafficking&#xD;
      of a diet and exercise intervention that has been previously shown to increase insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity. Additionally, the gut microbiome will be studied before and after the&#xD;
      intervention to determine any relationship to insulin sensitivity. Recent evidence suggests&#xD;
      the microbiome has a significant role in the development of insulin resistance through a&#xD;
      number of potential mechanisms. Infusion of microbiota from lean donors has been shown to&#xD;
      result in improved insulin sensitivity in male recipients with metabolic syndrome, with&#xD;
      concomitant increases in the prevalence of butyrate-producing intestinal microbiota. Exercise&#xD;
      is associated with greater microbial diversity, including increases in butyrate-producing&#xD;
      microbes. No study to date has monitored insulin sensitivity and microbiota composition&#xD;
      before and after an exercise and diet intervention, and so this will lead to a better&#xD;
      understanding of the mechanisms that lead to insulin resistance and subsequently type 2&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants will include males and females aged between 40-65 years who fit the&#xD;
      criteria for inclusion. After monitoring of normal daily activities for 7 days, volunteers&#xD;
      will reduce their calorie intake by 5000 kcal/week and take part in 5 weekly exercise&#xD;
      sessions for 3 weeks. Participants will attend one session of laboratory testing before and&#xD;
      one after this period which will take place at the University of Bath. This intervention&#xD;
      should be sufficient to improve insulin sensitivity and allow us to study the cellular&#xD;
      changes that will have taken place during this time.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention will involve 3 weeks of a diet and exercise program designed to cause a net energy decrease of 7000 kcal/week compared to habitual behaviour. This will be achieved through:&#xD;
Five exercise sessions per week at 70% VO2 max, using 400 kcal per session.&#xD;
Reduction of their standard diet by 5000 kcal per week&#xD;
Before and after this intervention period participants will take part in a trial day which includes measurement of body composition (using DEXA) and blood sugar control (oral glucose tolerance test). Samples of blood, adipose, skeletal muscle and faeces will also be taken.</description>
