    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sirolimus (0.2% and&#xD;
      0.4% formulations) and its vehicle when applied topically once daily for 12 weeks for the&#xD;
      treatment of cutaneous angiofibromas in pediatric subjects with tuberous sclerosis complex&#xD;
      (TSC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study designed&#xD;
      to assess the safety and efficacy of topically-applied sirolimus for the treatment of&#xD;
      cutaneous angiofibromas in pediatric subjects with TSC. Approximately 45 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled at investigational sites in the United States (US) and China, though other countries&#xD;
      may be added in the future. Approximately 45 subjects who meet the study entry criteria will&#xD;
      randomly be assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 1 of 3 treatments: sirolimus 0.2% ointment,&#xD;
      sirolimus 0.4% ointment, or placebo ointment. The randomization is stratified by site.&#xD;
      Subjects, or a parent/guardian, will apply the study medication topically to the cutaneous&#xD;
      angiofibromas on the face once daily at night before going to bed for 12 weeks. Subjects who&#xD;
      complete the double-blind phase of the study, with an overall compliance rate &gt;80% as&#xD;
      determined by the dosing diary, will be offered entry into an open-label period for an&#xD;
      additional 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum study duration for each subject will be approximately 30 weeks and includes a&#xD;
      screening period of up to 4 weeks, a blinded treatment period of 12 weeks, optional&#xD;
      open-label period of 12 weeks, and a follow-up period of 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis will be performed when all subjects have completed the double-blind phase&#xD;
      (Visit 5 - Week 12). The data will be unblinded to assess for efficacy and results reported.&#xD;

         15. Has facial hair (e.g., beard, sideburns, mustache) that could interfere with study&#xD;

             has the potential to cause an adverse effect when given with the investigational&#xD;
             product or will interfere with the interpretation of the study results (see Section&#xD;
             16.1 Appendix 1 for Potential Drug Interactions).&#xD;
