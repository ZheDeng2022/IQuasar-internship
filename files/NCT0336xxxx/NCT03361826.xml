  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is a major public health crisis for which effective new interventions are needed. An&#xD;
      innovative new brain stimulation technique called magnetic seizure therapy (MST) shows&#xD;
      promise for treating suicidal thinking in chronically depressed individuals. Using a&#xD;
      high-risk cohort of suicidal patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and&#xD;
      treatment resistant major depressive disorder (MDD), this study will evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of MST for reducing suicidality and depressive symptoms in an open-label&#xD;
      clinical trial of up to 15 treatment sessions. Based on research showing that functioning of&#xD;
      the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) may be disrupted in BPD and place individuals at&#xD;
      risk for suicide, the DLPFC will be targeted for stimulation. Moderate-to-highly suicidal&#xD;
      patients with BPD beginning dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT) will be recruited using a&#xD;
      case-control design, comparing individuals receiving MST and DBT with matched patient control&#xD;
      group receiving DBT alone.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MST is a novel modification of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) with the potential for similar&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness, fewer side-effects and a more rapid return of orientation and shorter&#xD;
      duration of post-ictal confusion. In the proposed study, the investigators will evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness of MST for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and&#xD;
      suicidal ideation in patients with BPD. The study will use a case-control design comparing&#xD;
      symptom reports (depression severity and suicidal ideation) and cognitive functioning between&#xD;
      outpatients receiving MST plus dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) and matched patient&#xD;
      controls receiving DBT alone. To evaluate potential biomarkers that may underlie the&#xD;
      anticipated clinical benefits of MST, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be&#xD;
      used to measure activation of the DLPFC and associated neural circuits subserving emotion&#xD;
      regulation and cognitive functioning (e.g., impulse control, episodic memory) in BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: To evaluate the efficacy of MST as a treatment for suicidal ideation and TRD in&#xD;
      BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: MST will demonstrate substantial efficacy on objective measures of suicidal&#xD;
      ideation and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: To evaluate the effects of MST on cognitive functioning in patients with BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: MST will have limited, if any, effects on performance on standard&#xD;
      neuropsychological measures of attention, memory and executive functioning in patients with&#xD;
      BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: To explore potential neuroimaging-based biomarkers that may index any changes in&#xD;
      suicidal ideation and depression that result from treatment with MST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: On neuroimaging tasks assessing emotion processing and cognitive functioning,&#xD;
      patients receiving DBT+MST will show increased activity in bilateral DLPFC after treatment&#xD;
      relative to pre-treatment baseline activation, and more activation in this region than&#xD;
      patients in DBT without concurrent MST (DBT-only).&#xD;
