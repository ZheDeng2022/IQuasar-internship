    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trials studies the side effects and best dose of eribulin mesylate when given&#xD;
      together with radiation therapy in treating patients with retroperitoneal liposarcoma that&#xD;
      can be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as eribulin mesylate, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy&#xD;
      x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving chemotherapy with radiation therapy may&#xD;
      kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of radiation and eribulin mesylate&#xD;
      (eribulin) when used in combination for the preoperative treatment of retroperitoneal&#xD;
      liposarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the feasibility of a preoperative chemoradiation protocol for retroperitoneal&#xD;
      liposarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the surgical outcomes of retroperitoneal liposarcoma resections after&#xD;
      preoperative chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess preliminary anti-tumor activity of eribulin in combination with radiation in&#xD;
      subjects with retroperitoneal liposarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of eribulin mesylate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive eribulin mesylate intravenously (IV) over 2-5 minutes on days 1 and 8 and&#xD;
      undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy once daily (QD) 5 days a week beginning on day&#xD;
      8 of cycle 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may undergo surgery within 3-10 weeks after&#xD;
      radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients will be followed up at 2 weeks, 9 weeks, and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 10 years.&#xD;

             study because eribulin is an investigational agent with the potential for teratogenic&#xD;
             or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with eribulin&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued; these potential risks may also apply to&#xD;
