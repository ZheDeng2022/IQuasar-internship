      The study will examine the mechanisms linking race, stress and biobehavioral factors to&#xD;
      energy balance and obesity in both natural and controlled environments in African-American&#xD;
      and Caucasian adolescent females. A Hispanic/Latina cohort has recently been added with&#xD;
      permission for the sponsor.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obesity is one of the most serious public health problems in the US; its prevalence has&#xD;
      tripled in the last three decades and is associated with a range of short- and long-term&#xD;
      medical and psychosocial problems. Adolescence is a critical period for the development and&#xD;
      persistence of obesity, and is associated with changes in diet, physical activity and&#xD;
      fitness, fat distribution and insulin sensitivity. There are racial and sex-specific&#xD;
      disparities in the prevalence and burden of obesity. African-American (AA) females have the&#xD;
      highest rates of obesity, and the clustered risk factors for coronary heart disease and&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome are twice that of AA males. The reasons for racial and sex-specific&#xD;
      disparities in the prevalence and burden of obesity are not well understood. AA experience&#xD;
      higher stress levels than Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) due to economic and social inequalities,&#xD;
      and the effect of stress on energy-dense diet and adiposity is more prominent in females. A&#xD;
      better understanding of the mechanisms that link stress to obesity, particularly during&#xD;
      adolescence when high rates of obesity, increased stressful experiences and stronger&#xD;
      behavioral and physiological responses to stress emerge, will contribute to new clinical&#xD;
      guidelines for reducing obesity and associated medical conditions in AA females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Physiological stress system affects obesity and mediates its adaptive functions via&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Prolonged stress-induced glucocorticoid secretion&#xD;
      promotes the consumption of energy-dense diet (EI) and abdominal fat deposition both directly&#xD;
      and indirectly through its effects on metabolic hormones. Stress also reduces physical&#xD;
      activity and alters energy balance. The proposed study will examine the effects of stress and&#xD;
      HPA axis on EI and physical activity-related energy expenditure in 100 AA and 100 NHW&#xD;
      adolescent females. The effects on EI will be assessed in two contexts, the natural&#xD;
      environment and under controlled conditions incorporating a standardized psychosocial&#xD;
      stressor. Stress will be assessed in the natural environment as multiple domains (i.e.,&#xD;
      individual, family and social), and several indices of the HPA axis will be obtained to&#xD;
      represent diurnal variation, its status over 12-15 weeks and reactivity to stress.&#xD;
      Obesity-related parameters will be measured through anthropometry, fat distribution and&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Associations among stress, HPA activity/function, energy balance and obesity-related&#xD;
      parameters will be compared between and within AA and NHW samples. In combination they will&#xD;
      improve our understanding of the social factors and biobehavioral mechanisms of both racial&#xD;
      and individual differences in obesity and facilitate the development of effective treatments&#xD;
      within and across racial groups according to the principles of individualized medicine. To&#xD;
      our knowledge, racial differences in objectively-measured diet intake and energy expenditure&#xD;
      in response to stress, or their underlying physiological mechanisms, have not been assessed&#xD;
      in adolescents or adults. This is an important knowledge gap in our efforts to develop better&#xD;
      evidence-based translational obesity prevention and weight-control interventions as the&#xD;
      traditional interventions are not effective with minority youth.&#xD;
