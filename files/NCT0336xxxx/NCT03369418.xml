      The investigators aim to use a CES (cranial electrotherapy stimulation) intervention to&#xD;
      improve emotional well-being by reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression and to assess for&#xD;
      changes in markers of cellular health - specifically, telomere length and telomerase activity&#xD;

      This study aims to test an auricular cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) device,&#xD;
      Alpha-Stim, to assess for changes in markers of cellular health and emotional well-being&#xD;
      improvement associated with anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Returning Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) Veterans have a&#xD;
      high incidence of anxiety, depression, insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and&#xD;
      chronic pain, leading to reductions in emotional well-being. This type of chronic emotional&#xD;
      distress can lead to detrimental biological outcomes. We will compare as an exploratory&#xD;
      outcome Veterans vs. non-Veterans response to Alpha-Stim treatment. At the cellular level,&#xD;
      impairment of the telomere/telomerase system may be a result of this dysregulation, given the&#xD;
      descriptions of shorter telomeres (a marker of cellular aging), as well as increased markers&#xD;
      of inflammation in subjects with depression, anxiety and PTSD, compared to aged matched&#xD;
      healthy populations. These negative cellular effects of emotional distress have not been well&#xD;
      studied in this population and may offer significant benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In one study of auricular CES using the same protocol proposed here, 115 patients with&#xD;
      anxiety or anxiety and comorbid depression were studied over 5 weeks in a randomized, sham&#xD;
      controlled trial, showing significant improvements in both anxiety and depression symptoms.&#xD;
      Due to the complexity of overlapping negative affect symptoms that lead to impaired emotional&#xD;
      well-being in Veterans, the investigators chose in this proposal to evaluate a composite&#xD;
      measure of emotional distress (a combined anxiety and depression score) as the primary&#xD;
      outcome. Beyond depression and anxiety, CES has been associated with reductions in insomnia&#xD;
      and pain, both of which are also significant problems in Veterans, likely contributing to&#xD;
      reduced emotional well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primarily all interested and appropriate study subjects will undergo a screening at the&#xD;
      University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) G. Oppenheimer Center for Neurobiology of Stress&#xD;
      and Resilience (CNSR). The investigators expect to enroll and screen no less than 55 subjects&#xD;
      in order to complete 22 evaluable subjects for analysis in each treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) will assess symptom severity defined as&#xD;
      normal range (0-7), mild (8-10), moderate (11-14) or severe (15-20). Subjects with impaired&#xD;
      emotional well-being with mild to moderate anxiety and/or depression on the HADS scale will&#xD;
      be included. Subjects with a maximum combined HADS score of 28 will be included. Subjects&#xD;
      treated for anxiety, depression, psychiatric or mental health treatment must be on a stable&#xD;
      regimen (pharmacological or non-pharmacological) for the past 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If eligible the study coordinator will contact them to schedule a screening visit at UCLA.&#xD;
      During this visit, the research team will conduct baseline measurements via study&#xD;
      questionnaires, history and physical exam, and a standardized psychiatric evaluation (MINI).&#xD;
      Subjects meeting the inclusion criteria will have training in use of the Alpha-Stim device&#xD;
      and will have their first 1 hour treatment. Subjects who tolerate the CES treatment will have&#xD;
      blood drawn for biological measures and will take the device home to use daily for 8 weeks.&#xD;
      Mid-study the subjects will come back to UCLA to complete questionnaires and have vital signs&#xD;
      and weight measured. At the end of the 8 weeks, subjects will return to UCLA, return the&#xD;
      device, have vital signs and weight measured, have the final blood draw, and complete a final&#xD;
      set of questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All in all, to complete the study, subjects will have an initial screening, mid and final&#xD;
      study visit, pre, mid, and final study questionnaires, and blood drawn in the first and final&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;

    <time_frame>After completion of the study (1 year)</time_frame>
    <description>Telomere length will be determined using real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methodology as described previously with minor modifications.30,31 Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are isolated and genomic DNA extracted. Using the standard curve method, cycle threshold (CT) values are plotted on a standard curve of human genomic DNA to estimate an ng/microliter concentration value. Telomere length values are expressed as the ratio of the estimated concentration generated by PCR of the telomere gene (T) divided by the hemoglobin single (S) copy gene = (T/S).</description>
