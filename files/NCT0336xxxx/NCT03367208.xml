  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The breast cancer is composed of multiple biological entities. Recent progress in molecular&#xD;
      biology, DNA or RNA chip, permitted the global tumour genome or transcriptome study. Those&#xD;
      technics, leads to an increased in the molecular biology knowledge and a better oncogenesis&#xD;
      understanding. Breast cancer taxonomy was established following the tumor genetic profile.&#xD;
      Moreover this classification is incomplete and didn't include the metabolic pathways other&#xD;
      than hormonal or HER2 pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The metabolomics is an expanding field of research exploring the metabolites in cells,&#xD;
      tissues or biologics fluids. It allows assessing the variation activation of the different&#xD;
      cellular metabolic pathways. In oncology, it could highlight the main metabolic disturbances,&#xD;
      the interaction of tumor cells and to identify the metabolic pathways involved in oncogenesis&#xD;
      using the tumor cells metabolites profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to genomic, the metabolomics integrated the impact of the cells environments on the&#xD;
      cells biology. The cells environment plays, in fact, a key role in the oncogenesis and in the&#xD;
      tumor cells phenotypes. The metabolomics, thus being a complementary approach of the genomic&#xD;
      in order to assess a better knowledge of the impact of the extracellular environment on the&#xD;
      tumor cell phenotype. In addition, the metabolomics analyses are fast and not expensive&#xD;
      compatible with routine practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to highlight a metabolic alteration specific to certain&#xD;
      tumors phenotypes in order to have better understanding of the biology of the numerous breast&#xD;
      cancer entities and find some biomarkers which could be some possible therapeutic target.&#xD;
      Using a high resolution mass spectrometer, the investigators will analyze 52 tumor samples&#xD;
      from frozen breast surgical specimen preserved in the Centre Antoine lacassagne tumor bank.&#xD;
      The tissue analysis could be associated with a serum sample analysis from the frozen serum&#xD;
      bank of the Centre Antoine Lacassagne. With 30 patients who performed a 18 FDG-PET before the&#xD;
      surgery, The investigators will analyzed the correlation between the tumoral activation of&#xD;
      the glycolysis pathways, quantified with mass spectroscopy and the 18FDG uptake. Using the 17&#xD;
      frozen serums available, the investigators will perform a screening to identify some&#xD;
      metabolites or metabolites profile which could be detected in the serum in order to develop a&#xD;
      new liquid biopsy approach. This study is a retrospective study based on data and sample&#xD;
      already available in the center and collected during the routine practice.&#xD;
