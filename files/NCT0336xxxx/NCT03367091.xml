      RESEARCH AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the effect of the level of swing assistance on the acute metabolic and&#xD;
           cardiorespiratory responses during overground gait training with a wearable exoskeleton&#xD;
           in persons after stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate if there is an interaction-effect between the level of swing assistance&#xD;
           and the duration of walking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the exercise intensity to aerobic training recommendations&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: An experimental, 1-group trial with randomized crossover design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT RECRUITMENT: Participants will be recruited at the AZ Herentals (Herentals, Belgium).&#xD;
&#xD;
      LOCATION: The trial will be conducted at the REVAlution Center (Herentals, Belgium).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: See section &quot;Eligibility&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES: Before the start of the study, informed consent and baseline patient&#xD;
      characteristics will be collected. Next, participants will be measured during three training&#xD;
      sessions with the Ekso GT SmartAssist:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20-minute training with high swing assistance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20-minute training with neutral swing assistance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20-minute training with high swing resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trainings will be performed on a separate day in a randomized order (within one week and&#xD;
      controlled for time of day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following settings will be used in all three conditions: sitting program (&quot;Min lean&quot;);&#xD;
      standing program (&quot;Auto lean&quot;); step initiation program (&quot;ProStep+&quot;), training mode (&quot;Off&quot;),&#xD;
      SmartAssist option (&quot;2Free&quot;); and stance support (&quot;Low&quot;). The level of stance support and&#xD;
      swing assistance will be set symmetrically for the affected and non-affected side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During training, participants will walk back and forth at a self-selected walking speed in a&#xD;
      30m hall way using a cane at the non-affected side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the experimental conditions, participants will have had three training sessions in&#xD;
      the Ekso GT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESTRICTIONS &amp; PROHIBITIONS: Participants will be instructed to not consume food, alcohol,&#xD;
      caffeine or nicotine at least 3h prior to the intervention. Usual medication intake will be&#xD;
      allowed with small amounts of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS: The Ekso GT robotic exoskeleton with SmartAssist (Ekso Bionics Inc., USA) will be&#xD;
      used during the overground training sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A flexible facemask (adult facemask, small/medium, Cortex, Germany), lightweight chest&#xD;
      carrying gas analysis system (Metamax 3B, Cortex, Germany) and Bluetooth heart rate belt&#xD;
      (Polar H7, Polar Electro, Finland) will be used to measure metabolic and cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      parameters. At the start of each measurement, gas (room air and reference gas (17.4% O2 and&#xD;
      5.1% CO2)) and volume (3L syringe) calibrations of the breath-by-breath gas analysis system&#xD;
      will be performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES: See section &quot;Outcome Measures&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA-ANALYSES: Descriptive statistics will be calculated for baseline patient&#xD;
      characteristics. To investigate the effect of level of swing assistance and duration, a&#xD;
      repeated measures ANOVA (within factor duration and within factor assistance level) will be&#xD;
      conducted (interaction-effect time x duration, main effect assistance level and main effect&#xD;
      duration). In case of significant differences, posthoc analyses will be interpreted. The&#xD;
      walking speed will be considered as a covariate in the ANOVA analysis (in case significant&#xD;
      different between conditions). Significance level will be set at 5%.&#xD;
