    <textblock>
      The proposed study will assess the combined effect of perampanel and ketamine on the&#xD;
      anti-depressant response in individuals with treatment resistant depression. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to test the hypothesis that stimulation of Alpha-Amino-3-Hydroxy-5-Methyl-4-&#xD;
      Isoxazole Propionic Acid receptors (AMPAR) is critical to the anti-depressant response of&#xD;
      ketamine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is the first in humans to assess the necessity of&#xD;
      Alpha-Amino-3-Hydroxy-5-Methyl-4- Isoxazole Propionic Acid receptors (AMPAR) stimulation for&#xD;
      the emergence of the anti-depressant effects of ketamine. Despite the overall safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of ketamine, concerns remain. For example, ketamine is a drug with abuse liability.&#xD;
      Similarly, it produces transient cognitive and perceptual changes that are distressing for&#xD;
      some patients. Therefore, it is critical to determine which aspects of ketamine's effects on&#xD;
      neural systems. To do this, we employ perampanel, an FDA-approved drug that blocks calcium&#xD;
      and non-calcium dependent AMPARs. We employ a counter-balanced cross-over design in which&#xD;
      ketamine plus perampanel is given on one day, and approximately 21 days later ketamine plus&#xD;
      placebo is given. The effects of these drug combinations are assessed via fMRI studies of&#xD;
      neural functional connectivity and oxidative metabolism as well as interview and self-report&#xD;
      measures on the infusion day and 24 hours later. If perampanel blocks the capacity of&#xD;
      ketamine to ameliorate the clinical and neural signatures of major depression, it would&#xD;
      suggest that AMPAR stimulation is critical for the anti- depressant effects of ketamine in&#xD;
      humans. This would support the further exploration of drugs that selectively enhance the&#xD;
      stimulation of AMPARs without blocking N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), such as&#xD;
      AMPAkines and metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2) antagonists as anti-depressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific hypotheses include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that stimulation of&#xD;
      Alpha-Amino-3-Hydroxy-5-Methyl-4- Isoxazole Propionic Acid receptors (AMPAR) is critical to&#xD;
      the anti-depressant response of ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, we will test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Perampanel pre-treatment reduces ketamine-related increases in prefrontal functional&#xD;
           connectivity and CMRO2 during ketamine infusion in individuals with treatment-resistant&#xD;
           depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Perampanel pre-treatment reduces ketamine-induced increases in prefrontal CMRO2 and&#xD;
           functional connectivity observed at 24 hours in individuals with treatment resistant&#xD;
           depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Perampanel pre-treatment reduces the positive effect of ketamine on clinical improvement&#xD;
           as measured by the Hamilton Depression Inventory (1) at 24 hours in individuals with&#xD;
           treatment resistant depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory: Changes in prefrontal functional connectivity and CMRO2 during ketamine infusion&#xD;
      and 24 hours post-infusion are correlated with clinical improvement as measured by the&#xD;
      Hamilton Depression Inventory in individuals with treatment resistant depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this study is the first, to the investigator's knowledge, to involve using ketamine and&#xD;
      perampanel in human subjects, the investigators have included a small out-of-scanner study to&#xD;
      test the safety of the ketamine/perampanel combination on 3 healthy subjects. This&#xD;
      registration focuses on the main study that will follow the safety evaluation and evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of perampanel and ketamine on individuals with treatment resistant depression.&#xD;

             subject meets these blood pressure entrance criteria, but is being treated for high&#xD;
             blood pressure, the study team will check with the subject's primary care physician or&#xD;
