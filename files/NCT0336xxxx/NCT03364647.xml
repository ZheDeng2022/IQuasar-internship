  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine how two different blood flow restriction training&#xD;
      programs used in conjunction with standard rehabilitation affect leg strength. By doing this&#xD;
      study, the investigator hopes to learn if one program improves strength and function more&#xD;
      than the other. The investigator also hope to learn how the training affects the properties&#xD;
      of muscle in participants who will or have had anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)&#xD;
      reconstruction. These results will help define how the training programs are working.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no charge to the participant for their physical therapy visits as long as they&#xD;
      are part of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial visit and follow up assessment at the end of the training will each take up to 6&#xD;
      hours (2 hours for MRI, 2 muscle biopsy, 2 for muscle strength, movement mechanics and&#xD;
      questionaires).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical therapy visits will range from 60-120 minutes depending on the participant's&#xD;
      stage of recovery and the activities to engage in. Training sessions will be held 3 days a&#xD;
      week for approximately 4 weeks before surgery and up to 24 weeks after surgery. There will be&#xD;
      a total of 4 additional study visits over a 7 month period. The first visit will be used to&#xD;
      capture baseline conditions of their knee and thigh muscles (muscle biopsy, MRI, strength).&#xD;
      The second visit will occur right before surgery to assess changes during prehabilitation&#xD;
      (strength and walking mechanics). The third visit will occur 4-5 months after surgery and&#xD;
      will be a complete reevaluation of their thigh muscle and knee function (muscle biopsy, MRI,&#xD;
      strength, gait). The last visit will occur 6-7 months after surgery and will involve an&#xD;
      assessment of their thigh muscle strength, walking, and jumping form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The muscle biopsy and magnetic resonance imaging portion of the study will occur in the&#xD;
      outpatient unit of the Center for Clinical and Translational Science at the UK Medical Center&#xD;
      and the MRI center located on the medical center campus. The muscle biopsy will take an&#xD;
      additional 15 minutes and the MRI up to two hours (1 hour per leg). It can take up to 4 hours&#xD;
      total to complete both procedures. The investigator will accommodate participant preference&#xD;
      for scheduling.&#xD;

      The following procedures may be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training sessions: Participants will be randomly assigned one of two groups. Assignments to&#xD;
      which group are determined by random assignment based upon participant's number. One group&#xD;
      will receive standard of care and the other will receive standard of care plus blood flow&#xD;
      restriction training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The air bands will then be placed on the participant's thighs and they will be doing a&#xD;
      standardized exercise program that will vary depending on the stage of rehabilitation they&#xD;
      are in and as determined by the study personnel. Participants will also complete a&#xD;
      standardized course of physical therapy. Activities in physical therapy may include ice over&#xD;
      the knee, range of motion exercises to maintain hip strength and gait training exercises as&#xD;
      needed and as the participant's impairments dictate. The investigator will also provide an&#xD;
      educational program at regular intervals on the injury and recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quadriceps strength: Participants will sit in a seated position and a stabilizing strap will&#xD;
      be placed around the thigh. A second strap will be placed around the bottom of their lower&#xD;
      leg and attached to the isokinetic dynamometer (a muscle strength testing device) which will&#xD;
      control movements and apply force at several different speeds and in a isometric mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motion Analysis: Motion analysis will provide a means for evaluating motion of the&#xD;
      participant's hip, knee and ankle joints during walking and jogging on the treadmill.&#xD;
      Participants will have reflective markers placed on certain landmarks of their legs and lower&#xD;
      back to allow the motion analysis system to record their trunk, hip, knee, and ankle&#xD;
      movements. Markers will be applied with sticky tape to the skin and if necessary, athletic&#xD;
      tape to limit marker movement during activities. A stationary trial will be collected to help&#xD;
      the researcher identify anatomical landmarks. Motion data will be collected for 10 seconds&#xD;
      every minute. Participants will perform a series of jumps on both legs and on a single leg.&#xD;
      In addition participants will be asked to go up and down step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treadmill Activity: Participants may walk on the treadmill as long as necessary to feel&#xD;
      comfortable with it. Once ready, participants will walk at a self-selected warm up pace for 5&#xD;
      minutes. The investigator will then gradually increase the speed 1.5 m/s for 2 minutes each.&#xD;
      The speed of the treadmill will then be increased gradually to a self-selected comfortable&#xD;
      jogging\running pace for 2 minutes. Participants may request to stop at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle Biopsy: A small piece of muscle tissue will be removed from both of thighs. The muscle&#xD;
      tissue will be taken from the outside of your thigh and will be taken about one hand width&#xD;
      above your knee. A 1 inch by 1 inch portion of hair will possibly need to be shaved if&#xD;
      necessary. The area of thigh will be numbed and a small Â¼ inch incision will be made in the&#xD;
      skin. A needle will then be briefly (lasting just a couple of seconds) inserted into the&#xD;
      muscle to remove a .005 ounce piece of muscle (about the size of a pencil eraser). The&#xD;
      incision will be pulled closed with a band-aid after the site is cleaned with an alcohol&#xD;
      preparation and the participant's leg will be wrapped snugly with an elastic bandage. The&#xD;
      procedure will last approximately 15 minutes. The tissue samples will be used in the analysis&#xD;
      process. In addition, standard venipuncture methods will be used to collect one 7.5 mL tube&#xD;
      of blood to be used for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging &amp; Spectroscopy Center: Participants will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      medical screening questionnaire that will ask specific questions about their health and&#xD;
      medical history. This information will be used to determine eligibility to participate in the&#xD;
      study. At this time, the procedures and risks involved in participating in the research study&#xD;
      will be explained to the individual. Participants will also fill out a questionnaire asking&#xD;
      whether they have any metal in their body as well as any other medical conditions that may&#xD;
      need to be considered before they enter the MRI scanner. The metal screening questionnaire&#xD;
      will be reviewed by the individual operating the scanner and if any risks are identified, the&#xD;
      participant may not be able to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be taken to the MRI scanner by the experimenter. Participants will be asked&#xD;
      to remove all jewelry, body piercings, hair accessories, belts, wallets, credit cards, and&#xD;
      loose change and leave these items with the experimenter. Participants will then be&#xD;
      instructed about specific MRI procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The magnetic resonance scanning will take approximately 60 minutes per leg. Participants will&#xD;
      be asked to lie still during the scanning.&#xD;
