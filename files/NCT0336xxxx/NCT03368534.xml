      Skin wounds sometimes are difficult to heal by primary closure and often require tissue&#xD;
      substitution by autologous grafting requiring harvesting of donor skin. The latter may cause&#xD;
      morbidities such as risk of infection, discoloration, pain, and scarring of both donor and&#xD;
      recipient areas. Full-thickness stin grafts (FTSG) are created when the entire dermis and&#xD;
      epidermis are harvested, These grafts are typically used for acute full-thickness wounds&#xD;
      where the wound can sustain and nourish the graft and improved cosmesis is important.&#xD;
      Split-thickness skin grafting (STSG) has been used to close large skin wounds, and it&#xD;
      involves the harvesting of the epidermis and upper dermis from a donor site. It is generally&#xD;
      the preferred grafting method for restoring the structural integrity of chronic wounds, as&#xD;
      the wound bed may not have the ability to support a FTSG. Nevertheless, because deep dermal&#xD;
      structures such as sweat glands and hair follicles are not harvested, the STSG is&#xD;
      functionally abnormal. Before the grafting process takes place, STSGs are commonly meshed and&#xD;
      enlarged, increasing the coverage area and allowing fluid drainage. However, the meshing&#xD;
      process produces a &quot;fish-net&quot; appearance of the grafted skin. Other limitations include&#xD;
      healing of the donor site, which often is delayed and leaves unappealing pigmentary changes&#xD;
      and, at times, scar formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, engineered &quot;off the shelf&quot; grafts such as cadaveric skin, xenografts, and&#xD;
      artificial skin substitutes are being used in the management of chronic, difficult to heal&#xD;
      wounds. Skin substitutes work by providing cells, growth factors, and other key elements that&#xD;
      promote healing while preventing extracellular matrix degradation. However, these only offer&#xD;
      transient wound coverage, and require secondary healing of the wound itself. Thus, autologous&#xD;
      skin grafting continues to be necessary. Scar formation at the donor and grafted site remain&#xD;
      most troublesome morbidities in autologous skin grafting. Scar tissue is stiff,&#xD;
      dysfunctional, often painful, and tends to contract over time, producing skin irregularities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, skin remodeling is a process that substitutes missing tissue while preserving&#xD;
      tissue architecture. While scarring is triggered by large-scale tissue damage, remodeling is&#xD;
      stimulated by microscopic tissue damage. This principle became clear when fractional&#xD;
      photothermolysis (FP) was developed that is currently used for photoaged skin treatment and&#xD;
      wound scars. In FP, laser microbeams are used to produce microscopic thermal injury per cm2&#xD;
      of skin surface, which causes very thin columns of tissue damage or ablation. It has been&#xD;
      found that columns less than 500 Âµm in diameter heal promptly without scarring. FP involves&#xD;
      full-thickness (i.e. complete epidermis and dermis) tissue injury in which the epidermis&#xD;
      closes within 1 day, and the dermal damage is fixed in around 2 weeks, followed by tissue&#xD;
      remodeling without scarring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the experience with FP showed that millions of small, full-thickness columns of skin&#xD;
      tissue can be removed without scarring, it was hypothesized that full-thickness microscopic&#xD;
      skin tissue columns (MSTCs) could be harvested from healthy skin with insignificant donor&#xD;
      site-morbidity and that these MSTCs could function as a graft to accelerate wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore this, a prototype device was developed that can harvest hundreds of full-thickness&#xD;
      columns of skin tissue (500 micrometer diameter) using single-needle, fluid-assisted&#xD;
      harvesting technology. The harvested MSTCs can subsequently be placed directly onto a wound&#xD;
      to aid in healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With conventional full thickness grafts and split thickness grafts, the donor area requires&#xD;
      sometimes a period of immobility, requiring attentive wound care and pain management. The ART&#xD;
      may provide a more effective method of harvesting skin with minimal or no pain, healing&#xD;
      rapidly with little scarring. This can take place in an outpatient setting, with the use of&#xD;
      only local anesthesia.&#xD;
