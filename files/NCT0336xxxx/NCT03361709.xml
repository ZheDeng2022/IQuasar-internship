  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is rapidly growing worldwide. One major concern with&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus is how it may affect vision in different ways; including the increased risk&#xD;
      of developing cataract. Several studies have found an association between diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      and the development of cataract. In patients with DM, cataract progression is also faster and&#xD;
      occurs at a younger age.5 While results for modern cataract surgery are satisfactory,&#xD;
      cataract surgery in diabetic patients carries a higher risk of peri and post-operative&#xD;
      complications than in non-diabetic patients. Several studies have shown that the corneal&#xD;
      endothelial count of diabetic patients is decreased, with more damage occurring to corneal&#xD;
      endothelial cells following phacoemulsification in diabetics than in non-diabetics. This is&#xD;
      presumed to be due to increased vulnerability of corneal endothelial cells in diabetics and a&#xD;
      delay in the repair process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of topical corticosteroids is the main method to control post-operative&#xD;
      inflammation after phacoemulsification, however many studies have also proved the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of intracameral corticosteroids to control inflammation post-operatively. While&#xD;
      intracameral triamcinolone is effective in controlling post-operative inflammation, elevation&#xD;
      of intraocular pressure is a main concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone has been found to be effective in controlling post-operative inflammation with&#xD;
      no effect on intraocular pressure. This may be due to its rapid turnover and short half-life.&#xD;
      No studies however have been performed to evaluate the safety and benefit of intracameral&#xD;
      injection of dexamethasone following phacoemulsification in diabetic patients. In the present&#xD;
      study, investigators aim to evaluate this and determine its effect on the post-operative&#xD;
      corneal endothelial cell density and corneal thickness.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective interventional randomized controlled cohort study to determine the&#xD;
      safety and benefit of intracameral dexamethasone injection at the conclusion of&#xD;
      phacoemulsification in diabetic patients with cataract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo full ophthalmological examination including best corrected visual&#xD;
      acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), anterior segment examination and fundus&#xD;
      examination. History and control of diabetes mellitus will be recorded. Patients ≥ 40 years&#xD;
      old with a visually significant cataract, who are known to be diabetic for more than 10 years&#xD;
      and are free of exclusion criteria will be included in our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to routine pre-operative cataract evaluation and investigations, patients will&#xD;
      also undergo non-contact Specular Microscopy (Konan Medical, Inc., Hyogo, Japan) to record&#xD;
      the pre-operative corneal endothelial cell density in the central cornea, as well as&#xD;
      anterior-segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT, Optovue Inc., Fremont, CA, USA) to&#xD;
      record pre-operative central corneal thickness (CCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard phacoemulsification will be performed using the Infiniti machine (Alcon, Fort Worth,&#xD;
      Texas, USA) with the stop and chop technique, and 0.2 mg of dexamethasone in 0.05 ml will be&#xD;
      injected intracamerally at the conclusion of surgery in half of the study eyes, assigned&#xD;
      using a randomization method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative examination will include BCVA, IOP measurement and level of anterior segment&#xD;
      inflammation on days 1,7 and 30 of follow up. Specular microscopy and AS-OCT will be&#xD;
      performed at day 30 of follow up. Ophthalmologist performing examinations and investigations&#xD;
      will be masked to whether dexamethasone was injected or not to avoid bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference in mean corneal endothelial cell density before and after phacoemulsification&#xD;
      will be compared between both groups. The difference in CCT, post-operative inflammation and&#xD;
      IOP will also be compared between both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses will be done using IBM SPSS v20.0 statistical software (IBM&#xD;
      Corporation, NY, USA). Descriptive statistics will be calculated, and the data will be&#xD;
      summarized as mean ± SD for numerical data, and as frequencies and percentages for&#xD;
      categorical data. When the p-value is &lt; 0.05 this will be considered as statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
