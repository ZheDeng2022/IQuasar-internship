      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disease leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 (LAD1) affects white blood cells. Those are&#xD;
      immune system cells. In people with LAD1, white blood cells do not properly communicate with&#xD;
      the rest of the body. This causes uncontrolled inflammation, particularly in the gums. People&#xD;
      with LAD1 can get frequent infections and tend to lose their teeth before adulthood.&#xD;
      Researchers want to see if a drug called ustekinumab helps people with LAD1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the safety and tolerability of ustekinumab in treating gum inflammation in people&#xD;
      with LAD1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 12 65 with LAD1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis for possible infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline visit will take 2 days. Participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeat most screening tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have a skin exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have small pieces of their gums removed (biopsy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have mouth fluids collected&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Get the study drug injected under the skin of the abdomen, thigh, or elsewhere on the&#xD;
           body. They will be watched for at least 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed on tracking how they are feeling and any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 4 more visits over 40 weeks. They will get the study drug and repeat&#xD;
      the baseline tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have up to 5 more tissue biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be called between visits to discuss how they are feeling and side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a final visit 52 weeks after the baseline. They will repeat most of&#xD;
      the baseline tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will answer questions about their oral ulcers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 (LAD1) is an autosomal recessive disorder of leukocyte&#xD;
      function. Decreased expression of the &lt;=2 subunit of leukocyte integrins results in abnormal&#xD;
      cell-cell and cell extracellular matrix adhesion. This disease is characterized by recurrent&#xD;
      bacterial infections, impaired wound formation, and other aberrations of adhesion-dependent&#xD;
      functions. The severe phenotype can be fatal, but patients with even moderate phenotypes are&#xD;
      prone to infection and lose their teeth despite treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the p40 subunit of human interleukins&#xD;
      IL-12 and IL-23. It is approved for treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, active&#xD;
      psoriatic arthritis, and moderate-to-severe Crohn s disease. By binding the shared p40&#xD;
      subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, ustekinumab exerts clinical effects through interruption of the&#xD;
      TH1 and TH17 cytokine pathways. Previous work at the NIH suggests that blockade of IL-17,&#xD;
      which is highly expressed in the gingiva of people with LAD1, can reduce bacterial load and&#xD;
      resolve inflammatory gingival disease. We have treated one patient with ustekinumab for 1&#xD;
      year; during this time, he had no serious infections and there was a dramatic resolution of&#xD;
      his inflammatory lesions. Our goal is to explore the potential of ustekinumab as treatment&#xD;
      for LAD1 inflammatory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this open-label, proof-of-concept study is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of ustekinumab in 10 patients with LAD1. Participants will receive 5 doses of&#xD;
      ustekinumab via subcutaneous injection over the course of 1 year. They will be evaluated for&#xD;
      adverse events, as well as the effect of the drug on inflammatory lesions and biomarker&#xD;
      expression.&#xD;
