    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well a health and recovery program works in&#xD;
      increasing physical activity level in stage IA-IIIA endometrial cancer survivors. Health and&#xD;
      recovery program which includes exercise counseling, Fitbit tracker, and phone or email/text&#xD;
      communication may increase the level of physical activity in endometrial cancer survivors and&#xD;
      promote and maintain behavior change at a lower cost.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:I. Determine the increase in activity level per participant where the&#xD;
      baseline average number of steps is recorded during week 0-2 will be compared to average step&#xD;
      count recorded during week 20-28.SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:I. Determining the rate of patients who&#xD;
      have achieved a 50% increase in activity level in each communication group (telephone versus&#xD;
      [vs.] electronic).II. Demonstrate that the rate of patients who have achieved an increased&#xD;
      activity level of 50% as compared to the patient's baseline in the electronic/email group is&#xD;
      not inferior to the rate in the telephone group.III. Evaluate changes in body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI), waist circumference, blood pressure and pulse for the whole group, by communication&#xD;
      group (electronic vs. telephone), and by activity level.IV. Evaluate the changes in quality&#xD;
      of life, as assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G), during the&#xD;
      course of the study for the whole group, between the two groups (electronic vs. telephone),&#xD;
      and based on activity level.V. Evaluate maintenance of activity level at 9 month (m) (week&#xD;
      32-40) (comparison activity level 9 m vs. 6 m) for the whole group, by group (electronic vs.&#xD;
      telephone), and by activity level.OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.ARM I:&#xD;
      Participants undergo an exercise counseling session at baseline and wear Fitbit tracker daily&#xD;
      for 9 months. Participants receive a short phone call at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks, and at 4 and 5&#xD;
      months to discuss the average number of daily steps over the past 2 weeks and to encourage a&#xD;
      goal of a 10% increase over the next 2-4 week time period.ARM II: Participants undergo an&#xD;
      exercise counseling session at baseline and wear Fitbit tracker daily for 9 months.&#xD;
      Participants receive an electronic communication (email/text) of their choice at 2, 4, 6, and&#xD;
      8 weeks, and at 4 and 5 months stating the average number of daily steps over the past 2&#xD;
      weeks and encouraging a goal of a 10% increase over the next 2-4 week time period.&#xD;

    <description>The increase in activity level will be determined where the baseline average number of steps recorded per patient during week 0 - 2 will be compared to the average step count recorded during week 20 - 28. The baseline measurement will be defined as the average step count reported by the patient during 0-2 weeks. At each subsequent time point the average step count per patient will be the average of the step counts recorded during the 2-4 weeks prior to the follow up visit. The average step count measured at 20-28 weeks will be compared to the baseline in a paired t test. The paired t test will</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>BMI will be measured using the participant weight in kilograms over height (in meters) squared. Changes in BMI over time will be evaluated in a repeated measures model allowing for within patient correlation. The relationship between average step count and the BMI will be evaluated in a repeated measures model allowing for within patient correlation. Determining if there is a difference between the two groups in the relationship between step count and health measures outcome: BMI will also be evaluated in a repeated measures model allowing for within patient correlation.</description>

    <description>For each patient, the average step count for the time period week 20 - 28 will be compared to the baseline (week 0-2) average step count. If the increase in step count is 50% or more the patient will have achieved an increased activity level. The proportion of patients who have achieved an increased activity level will be calculated for each arm.</description>

Likewise, for each patient the average step count for the time period 9 months (weeks 32-40) will be compared to the baseline average step count. The proportion of patients who have achieved an increased activity level will be calculated for each arm at each time period 6 months and 9 months.</description>
