  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      POTS is a relatively common condition that affects millions of patients around the globe. It&#xD;
      has an estimated prevalence of 170/100,000 with approximately 80% of patients being women of&#xD;
      childbearing age. POTS is characterized by an excessive heart rate increase on assuming an&#xD;
      upright posture, either standing or even sitting and leading to disabling palpitations,&#xD;
      light-headedness, and even in syncope in severe cases. More than 95% patients with POTS have&#xD;
      pronounced cardiovascular deconditioning and show marked exercise intolerance. The severity&#xD;
      of POTS is variable. In mild cases the affected patient may continue with routine activities&#xD;
      with minimal limitations. Severe form of the disease precludes most normal life activities,&#xD;
      such as sitting upright, walking or standing to perform even basic house chores. An estimated&#xD;
      40% of patients with POTS have a resistant form of the condition that is nonresponsive or&#xD;
      mildly responsive to all treatments resulting in continued functional limitations in the long&#xD;
      term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of the currently available treatments in POTS are geared towards increasing blood&#xD;
      pressure. These include compression stockings, increased daily fluid intake and increased&#xD;
      salt ingestion. Saline infusions may be helpful in certain patients in the short term, though&#xD;
      many do not respond. The effectiveness of medications varies greatly, with many patient&#xD;
      failing to improve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small series of clinical patients suffering from severe POTS have shown robust response to&#xD;
      weekly albumin therapy, which supports the hypothesis that periodic albumin infusions will&#xD;
      provide significant and sustained symptomatic relief to patients with severe POTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will explore the effectiveness of albumin infusions as a treatment for POTS.&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive weekly intravenous infusions of 5% Albumin or Saline in a&#xD;
      double blinded fashion for 4 weeks and will crossover to the other infusion for 4 weeks after&#xD;
      an intervening 4-week washout period. The participants will be required to maintain a daily&#xD;
      diary of their symptoms during the screening, the study and washout periods. Any possible&#xD;
      adverse effects as the result of infusions will be documented. Outcome measures will be&#xD;
      quantified and validated at the end of each study period and the percentage reduction of&#xD;
      tachycardia will be determined at the completion of each study arm.&#xD;

      Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous 5% albumin infusions in severe Postural&#xD;
      Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodic albumin infusions will be effective in treating patients with severe Postural&#xD;
      Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification&#xD;
&#xD;
      POTS is characterized by an excessive increase in heart rate and light-headedness on assuming&#xD;
      an upright posture, standing or sitting that at times culminates in syncope. Most symptoms of&#xD;
      POTS result from marked cardiovascular deconditioning and activation of sympathetic responses&#xD;
      due to cerebral hypoperfusion. Plasma volume expanding therapies are one of the mainstays of&#xD;
      treatment. Saline infusions in patients with severe orthostatic intolerance lead to rapid but&#xD;
      transient symptomatic improvement lasting several hours. Human albumin infusions are used for&#xD;
      plasma volume replacement/expansion and have been shown to significantly improve cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow. A small subset of patients suffering from severe POTS have shown robust response&#xD;
      to weekly albumin therapy, supporting the investigator's hypothesis that periodic albumin&#xD;
      infusions will provide significant and sustained symptomatic relief to patients with severe&#xD;
      POTS. This would increase their orthostatic tolerance and improve functional capacity without&#xD;
      the limitations and side effects associated with other therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measured change in the severity of orthostatic intolerance assessed by the Orthostatic&#xD;
      Symptom Grading Scale (OSGS) scores at 4 weeks in each arm of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measured changes in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, Health&#xD;
      Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ -20) from baseline to end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Degree of improvement from baseline in the severity of tachycardia and pulse pressure on a&#xD;
      10-minute HUTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise Testing: Change in maximal exercise capacity of the patients from baseline using&#xD;
      peak oxygen consumption (VO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method/Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Duration: 16 weeks; 15 visits (+2 optional)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study with a randomized double blind, controlled, and cross over design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen patients with severe neuropathic form of primary POTS will be enrolled from the&#xD;
      University of Alberta Hospital (UAH) Autonomic Clinic during the two-year study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive weekly intravenous infusions of 5% Albumin or Saline in a&#xD;
      double blinded fashion for 4 weeks and will crossover to the other infusion for 4 weeks after&#xD;
      an intervening 4-week washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be required to maintain a daily diary of their symptoms during the&#xD;
      screening, the study and washout periods. Any possible adverse effects as the result of&#xD;
      infusions will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures will be quantified using validated symptom scales at the end of each study&#xD;
      period and the percentage reduction of tachycardia from baseline on tilt table test done&#xD;
      within three days of completion of each study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment arms: one arm will receive 5% albumin at&#xD;
      a dose of 1 gm/kg to be given weekly for 4 weeks and the other arm will receive an equal&#xD;
      amount on a volume basis of Saline weekly for 4 weeks. At the end of this treatment period&#xD;
      the subjects will undergo a 4-week washout period followed by opposite treatment arm from the&#xD;
      first study period. In this protocol each patient will serve as their own control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physical/Neurologic Examination&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients will undergo detailed a physical/neurological examination and laboratory&#xD;
           testing at the time of enrolment and during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cardiac Workup&#xD;
&#xD;
           All participants will have had an ECG and an echocardiogram. If not one will be done&#xD;
           prior to enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Autonomic Testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also undergo detailed autonomic testing as per Mayo Clinic Protocols at&#xD;
      baseline, which will include the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Test (Sweat testing) will be done to rule out autonomic&#xD;
      failure as a cause of orthostatic intolerance. An abnormal sweat test in the foot/leg is seen&#xD;
      in neuropathic form of POTS and suggest postganglionic sympathetic Sudomotor involvement.&#xD;
      Sweat responses will be recorded from four consistent sites (left forearm, proximal lateral&#xD;
      leg, medial distal leg, and proximal foot). Test interpretation will involve comparison of&#xD;
      observed sweat volumes (in nl/min) with age- and gender-based norms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Cardiovagal (Parasympathetic) Testing: Parasympathetic (cardiovagal) function will be&#xD;
      assessed by measuring heart rate variability (HRV) during deep breathing (DB), Valsalva&#xD;
      Maneuver (VM) and HUTT and the responses compared to age based normal. Briefly, during the DB&#xD;
      test the patient will perform deep inspirations and expirations paced to an oscillating light&#xD;
      emitting diode (LED). Beat-to-beat R-R intervals will be recorded during each effort and the&#xD;
      mean HRV range determined by averaging the largest R-R differences for five consecutive&#xD;
      cycles. During the VM, patients will blow into a tube at a constant pressure for 15 seconds&#xD;
      while supine. Valsalva ratio (VR) will be calculated by dividing the maximum HR by lowest HR&#xD;
      occurring within 40 seconds after VM. Finally, during HUTT the 30:15 ratio will be calculated&#xD;
      by dividing R-R interval at 30 secs to the R-R interval at 15 secs while inclined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. HUTT will be done at baseline for confirmation of diagnosis and to assess severity of&#xD;
      POTS i.e. orthostatic tachycardia, pulse pressure reduction, neurocardiogenic syncope, and&#xD;
      within three days of the end of each arm of the study. Heart rate will be recorded&#xD;
      continuously with a 3-lead ECG. After baseline recording for 2-5 minutes, patients will be&#xD;
      tilted to an angle of 70 degrees for 10 minutes after which patients will be reclined back to&#xD;
      supine position for another 5 minutes. The blood pressures will be manually recorded from the&#xD;
      opposite arm at 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minute, 5 minute, 7 minute and 10 minutes. Symptoms&#xD;
      and signs of presyncope will be monitored and recorded throughout the duration of test. HUTT&#xD;
      will also be performed at the end of each phase and at end of study (for a study total of&#xD;
      four times) to assess efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      d. Exercise Tolerance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical/exercise endurance of the study subjects will be assessed by an exercise&#xD;
      physiologist/rehabilitation specialist at baseline and the end to study to assess the effect&#xD;
      of intervention on the participants' physical abilities. VO2max will be calculated using&#xD;
      standard protocols - measured VO2max (ml/kg/minute) divided by predicted VO2max multiplied by&#xD;
      100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      e. Laboratory Investigations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Investigations will be performed during the study visits as shown:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum albumin, electrolytes, complete blood count (CBC), d-dimer levels at baseline and every&#xD;
      two weeks (to assess hemolysis, volume overload etc.) Supine and standing plasma&#xD;
      catecholamine levels at baseline and end of study (to assess sympathetic tone) 24-hour&#xD;
      urinary sodium excretion at baseline, mid-point (2weeks) and end of each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Baseline serum pregnancy test in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      f. Patient Diaries&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to maintain a daily diary of their symptoms using the OSGS and PHAQ&#xD;
      -20 scales, and sleep diaries during the screening and the study periods. Patients will&#xD;
      record a twice-daily dairy of supine and orthostatic blood pressures to assess the incidence&#xD;
      of any orthostatic hypertension using provided blood pressure monitors. Any possible adverse&#xD;
      effects associated with albumin infusions as reported by the study participants or infusion&#xD;
      nurses will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be procured through collaboration with Epidemiology Coordinating and&#xD;
      Research Centre (EPICORE) at University of Alberta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis is that the primary outcome measure i.e. OSGS scores at baseline would&#xD;
      not be statistically different at the end of study period in the active arm of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary statistical analysis, we will use a paired t-test to compare the OSGS scores&#xD;
      at baseline and at 4 weeks in each arm of the study. Secondary analyses will be performed&#xD;
      with paired t-test comparing the scores on HAQ-20 scales and degree of tachycardia at same&#xD;
      time points. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to compare&#xD;
      functional and sleep scores in patients' diaries over the study period. Probability values&#xD;
      &lt;.05 will be considered statistically significant, and all tests will be 2-tailed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: Number of subjects needed for this study with a power of 0.8, an&#xD;
      effect size of 0.7 (from pilot data) and a significance level of .05 is 15. With an estimated&#xD;
      dropout rate of 15% (2 patients) the total number of subjects required is 17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Outcome/Duration Rationale: The duration of each arm of the study and outcome measures&#xD;
      were determined based on the following observations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Preliminary results indicate that patients start showing symptomatic improvement within&#xD;
           few weeks of albumin infusions. The four-week duration for each study arm should be able&#xD;
           to discern the differences in clinical benefit between the two infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Considering the albumin half-life, a four-week washout period week should allow complete&#xD;
           return to baseline without any residual effects from the preceding infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Many studies in POTS have used transient changes in cardiovascular parameters i.e.&#xD;
           tachycardia, stroke volume etc. immediately after administration of the study drug as&#xD;
           surrogate markers of improvement in POTS. These biological markers alone do not&#xD;
           necessarily reflect clinical benefit, are one-dimensional and are confounded by a number&#xD;
           of physiologic variables. Nevertheless, the degree of improvement in orthostatic&#xD;
           tachycardia on tilt table testing has been included as a secondary outcome measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The primary and secondary end points are geared towards global assessment that&#xD;
           incorporate the patients' symptoms and impact of intervention on overall functional&#xD;
           scores and orthostatic intolerance over a sustained period. These are unarguably more&#xD;
           robust and reflective of the true clinical status.&#xD;
