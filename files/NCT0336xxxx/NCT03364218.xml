  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiolitis is the major cause of hospital admission in infants &lt; 6 months of age and&#xD;
      usually viruses like Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumo virus, Adeno virus,&#xD;
      para-influenza virus, Rhino virus and influenza virus are the main culprit. In the US, acute&#xD;
      bronchiolitis in infancy is responsible for approximately 150,000 hospitalizations yearly at&#xD;
      an estimated cost of $500 million. Globally in 2005 it was estimated that at least 33.8&#xD;
      million were affected with RSV and in the same year, RSV associated severe acute lower&#xD;
      respiratory infection (ALRI) were responsible for ~3.4 million hospitalizations and&#xD;
      66,000-199,000 deaths worldwide, with 99% of these deaths in developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In acute bronchiolitis there is cellular swelling and excessive mucus production. There is&#xD;
      also proliferation of goblet cells, which leads to increased mucus production. The excess&#xD;
      mucus produced is poorly cleared by non-ciliated (regenerating) epithelial cells leading to&#xD;
      areas of narrowing and blocking of the bronchioles, causing the airway obstruction,&#xD;
      hyperinflation, increased airway resistance, atelectasis and increased ventilation-perfusion&#xD;
      mismatch that characterize acute bronchiolitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there is no medicine that has proven effective in treating acute bronchiolitis and&#xD;
      per American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines the management of acute bronchiolitis remains&#xD;
      supportive care for the acute respiratory failure associated with acute bronchiolitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant, anti-mucus compound that increases intracellular&#xD;
      glutathione at the cellular level. It cleaves disulfide bonds by converting them to two&#xD;
      sulfhydryl groups. This action results in the breakup of mucoproteins in lung mucus, reducing&#xD;
      their chain lengths and thinning the mucus. Nebulized NAC is not studied well in acute&#xD;
      bronchiolitis and is uncommonly used for the same. NAC has been studied in the treatment of&#xD;
      various disease states, including those pulmonary in nature such as cystic fibrosis, chronic&#xD;
      bronchitis, non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and found to be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this background knowledge, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      nebulized mucolytic therapy in treatment of children with viral bronchiolitis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A randomized clinical trial with blinding of person assigned for assessing and scoring the&#xD;
      patients. The participants will include children less than 2 yrs. age admitted to the&#xD;
      Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) with a diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis who will be&#xD;
      randomized into either the NAC group or the non-NAC (Control) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with acute bronchiolitis who require to be started on high flow nasal cannula&#xD;
      support or any other noninvasive ventilator/BIPAP support are transferred/directly admitted&#xD;
      to PICU. There is no time limit between when patients are admitted and when patients must&#xD;
      sign consent or be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a patient with acute bronchiolitis is identified, a member of the study team will&#xD;
      perform a chart review to assess eligibility as described by the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. If eligible, parent(s)/guardian(s) will be approached and Informed Consent will be&#xD;
      obtained. Using randomization software(www.randomizer.org) the enrolled patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either the NAC group or the non-NAC (Control) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NAC will be ordered by the on call pharmacist and it will be administered by the on call&#xD;
      Respiratory therapists. Between the two groups only the NAC group will get nebulized 2 ml of&#xD;
      10% NAC solution every 12 hours during their stay in PICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PICU uses HHFNC (humidified high flow nasal canula), Heliox and non-invasive ventilation&#xD;
      such as RAM canula, Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) and BIPAP. The PICU also&#xD;
      typically uses Dexmedetomidine infusion once the patient is on non invasive ventilation (NIV)&#xD;
      as a light sedation medication to avoid agitation and better ventilation patient synchrony.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scoring tool used by Seattle children's Bronchiolitis pathway will be used. HHFNC&#xD;
      (humidified high flow nasal cannula) will be started for patients when scores are â‰¥2.&#xD;
      Depending on the clinical worsening the patient may require help with Heliox and escalation&#xD;
      to non-invasive ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be twice a day blind assessments completed by experienced PICU/Transport nurses&#xD;
      who were non-involved in patient care in PICU at that time. The pharmacist is going to use&#xD;
      randomization software to randomly assign patients to a group (i.e control vs treatment).&#xD;
      Also, the pharmacist will order code called as &quot;Trial***&quot; in the medical record (*** denotes&#xD;
      a number assigned) and depending on the randomization the patient may or may not get the&#xD;
      trial medication (Nebulized NAC). As such, all patients in the study will have a medical&#xD;
      record orders which look similar to help achieve blinding at this stage for the treating&#xD;
      physicians and independent evaluators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in the study will receive a type of respiratory support, such as High flow nasal&#xD;
      cannula, noninvasive ventilator/ BIPAP etc. and because the NAC neb can easily be given&#xD;
      through those circuits, no extra equipment will be required for patients who are in the&#xD;
      treatment (NAC) group. Given that there is no difference in equipment in both treatment and&#xD;
      control groups, the only way the double-blind is broken in this scenario is NAC's odor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The odor of Neb NAC typically stays in the room during the treatment (2-3 minutes) and should&#xD;
      not last &gt;30 minutes after every administration. NAC is a sulfur compound and hence smells&#xD;
      like &quot;rotten eggs&quot; so for precaution to maintain blindness, a respiratory therapist will&#xD;
      spray a commercial rotten egg smelling solution at approximately the same time as treatment&#xD;
      is administered for all patients in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the NAC neb will be delivered through a closed respiratory circuit and also because&#xD;
      the respiratory therapists use filters for nebulization treatments, the chances of sticky&#xD;
      residues will be lower and hence difficult to figure out by examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 12 hourly neb treatments will occur from 6:30-7:30am and pm respectively. This timing&#xD;
      works in favor for blinding because both attending physicians and the independent evaluators&#xD;
      are less likely to be present during this time. The assessment will involve scoring the&#xD;
      patients according to the bronchiolitis scoring data tool. These assessments will be&#xD;
      completed for the duration of the PICU stay. The on service PICU attendings will only be&#xD;
      involved in clinical management of patients and will be blinded from randomization. The&#xD;
      blinding will be broken if one of the on service physicians or PICU/Transport nurses&#xD;
      performing assessments are aware of the currently admitted patient randomization details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reasons subjects may be withdrawn from the study: patient gets transferred to another&#xD;
      facility due to family's requests, family wishes to withdraw in the middle of the study, or&#xD;
      to protect the welfare of the patient.&#xD;
