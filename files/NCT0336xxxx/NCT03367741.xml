  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well cabozantinib s-malate and nivolumab work in&#xD;
      treating patients with endometrial that has come back (recurrent) or spread to other places&#xD;
      in the body (advanced or metastatic). Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving cabozantinib and&#xD;
      nivolumab may work better in treating endometrial cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the clinical anti-tumor activity of cabozantinib s-malate (XL184&#xD;
      ([cabozantinib]) and nivolumab based on progression free survival (PFS) in patients with&#xD;
      advanced, recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer previously treated with at least one&#xD;
      line of platinum-based chemotherapy compared to patients receiving nivolumab alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of XL184 and nivolumab in terms of overall response rate (ORR)&#xD;
      compared to nivolumab alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate overall survival (OS) of patients receiving XL184 and nivolumab compared to&#xD;
      patients receiving nivolumab alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the safety of combination treatment using XL184 and nivolumab in patients&#xD;
      with advanced, recurrent metastatic endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate correlation between PD-L1 expression, CD3, CD4 and CD8 infiltrates and&#xD;
      outcome (PFS, ORR, OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To compare PD-L1 expression, CD3, CD4 and CD8 infiltrates in the primary tumor (archival&#xD;
      tissue) and in the tissue from baseline biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To assess activity (PFS, ORR and OS) of nivolumab alone or in combination with XL184&#xD;
      according to microsatellite instability (MSI)/mismatched repair (MMR) status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess activity (PFS, ORR and OS) of XL184 and nivolumab in patients progressed after&#xD;
      previous exposure to anti PD-1, PD-L1 or PD-L2 agents or crossed-over from single agent&#xD;
      nivolumab, and in patients with diagnosis of carcinosarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare microsatellite (MS) and MMR status, in the primary tumor (archival tissue) and&#xD;
      in the tissue from baseline biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the genomic and immune-markers landscape at baseline on tumor tissue and&#xD;
      changes in immune landscape in peripheral blood during treatment and correlate with outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive cabozantinib s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and&#xD;
      nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15, then on day 1 beginning cycle&#xD;
      5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive nivolumab as in Arm A. Patients may cross-over to Arm A at the time&#xD;
      of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30-37 days, then every 8-12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients should be excluded if they have had prior treatment with anti-CTLA-4 antibody&#xD;
             or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation; previous&#xD;
             treatment with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-L2 is allowed and patients will be&#xD;
             enrolled in the exploratory cohort (arm C) at the time of progression from last line&#xD;
             of treatment (treatment with immune check point inhibitor does not have to necessary&#xD;
             be the last line of treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be excluded if they have had prior treatment with cabozantinib;&#xD;
             previous use of other antiangiogenic agents other than cabozantinib is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other active malignancy other than the endometrial cancer, that is progressing or&#xD;
             requiring active treatment with the exception of basal or squamous cell skin cancer,&#xD;
             superficial bladder cancer, carcinoma in situ of any site&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because of the possible increased risk of bleeding&#xD;
             if treatment with antiangiogenic agents is provided; patients with history of brain&#xD;
             metastases can enroll provided the brain metastases were removed and controlled with&#xD;
             no radiological evidence within the past 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring concomitant treatment, in therapeutic doses, with anticoagulants&#xD;
             such as warfarin or warfarin-related agents, heparin, thrombin or factor Xa&#xD;

             dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine,&#xD;
             phenobarbital, St. John's wort) or inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, miconazole,&#xD;

             troleandomycin, mibefradil and conivaptan); because the lists of these agents are&#xD;
             constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list,&#xD;
             medical reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this&#xD;
             information; as part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will&#xD;
             be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new&#xD;
             medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new&#xD;
             over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;

             10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent; steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity&#xD;

             inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematous, ankylosing spondylitis,&#xD;
             scleroderma, or multiple sclerosis requiring treatment within the last two years;&#xD;
             patients with vitiligo or diabetes are not excluded; replacement therapy (e.g.&#xD;

             pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment;&#xD;
             patients with recent history of thyroiditis; subjects with remote history (greater&#xD;
             than 5 years) of thyroiditis are not excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) &gt;&#xD;
             500 ms within 28 days before randomization; Note: if initial QTcF is found to be &gt; 500&#xD;
             ms, two additional electrocardiogram (EKG)s separated by at least 3 minutes should be&#xD;
             performed; if the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF is =&lt; 500 ms,&#xD;
             the subject meets eligibility in this regard&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is not able to swallow pills&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because XL184 and nivolumab are agents&#xD;
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with XL184 and nivolumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued&#xD;
             if the mother is treated with XL184 and nivolumab&#xD;
