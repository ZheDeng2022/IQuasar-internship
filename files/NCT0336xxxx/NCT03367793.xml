    <textblock>
      This study tests the hypothesis that objectively derived spectacle prescriptions based on&#xD;
      wavefront aberration measurements of the eyes of individuals with Down syndrome can provide&#xD;
      an improvement in visual acuity over that obtained with spectacle prescriptions based on&#xD;
      standard clinical prescribing techniques. The objectively derived prescriptions are derived&#xD;
      using strategies to optimize retinal image quality as measured by image quality metrics, and&#xD;
      thus these prescriptions will be referred to as metric-derived.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with Down syndrome suffer from significant ocular complications including high&#xD;
      levels of lower-order refractive error (sphere and cylinder) and elevated levels of&#xD;
      higher-order aberrations. These optical factors likely contribute to the poor acuity observed&#xD;
      in this population. Current clinical prescribing practices may under-serve this community, as&#xD;
      the cognitive demands of the subjective refraction sequence are difficult for this population&#xD;
      and often leave clinicians to prescribe from objective clinical findings that target full&#xD;
      correction of sphero-cylindrical refractive error. This prescribing practice can lead to&#xD;
      sub-par outcomes given the fact that full lower-order corrections can exacerbate the effects&#xD;
      of higher-order aberrations in more aberrated eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, individuals with Down syndrome will be dispensed three pairs of spectacles&#xD;
      for 2 months each, in random order: one clinically-derived, and two objectively-derived&#xD;
      refractions based upon methods designed to optimize a given metric of retinal image quality&#xD;
      which takes into consideration the wavefront aberration measurements of the eye. Both initial&#xD;
      and adapted visual acuity in the presence of each correction will be evaluated to determine&#xD;
      whether the objectively-derived refractions outperform clinically-derived refractions.&#xD;

    <description>Prescription spectacle lenses determined by metric-derived objective technique #1. For this method, wavefront error will be measured with the COAS (complete ophthalmic analysis system) wavefront aberrometer post-dilation with the goal of obtaining 3 to 5 high quality captures per eye. Wavefront measures will be re-sized to the patient's habitual pupil diameter and averaged. Post-measurement analysis will then be performed using a computer algorithm to identify the refractive correction predicted to produce the best image quality, as measured by maximization of the image quality metric Visual Strehl ratio in the spatial domain (VSX).

Spectacles - Clinically Derived: Prescription spectacle lenses determined by clinically derived techniques of a masked examiner and may include autorefraction, retinoscopy, and subjective refraction obtained pre or post dilation.&#xD;
Spectacles - Metric Technique #1 Derived: For this method, wavefront error will be measured with the COAS (complete ophthalmic analysis system) wavefront aberrometer post-dilation (3 - 5 captures per eye). Measures will be re-sized to the patient's habitual pupil diameter and averaged. Post-measurement analysis is performed to identify the refractive correction predicted to produce the best image quality, as measured by maximization of the image quality metric Visual Strehl ratio in the spatial domain (VSX).&#xD;
Spectacles - Metric Technique #2 Derived: For this method, wavefront error will be measured with the COAS wavefront aberrometer post-dilation (3 - 5 captures per eye).

          <title>Adaptive Behavior Standard Score</title>
          <description>Participant developmental ability was assessed through the parent/guardian responses on the Vineland 2 Adaptive Assessment. Standard scores &lt;70 indicate low adaptive functioning, scores from 70 to 85 indicate moderately low functioning, and scores from 86 to 115 indicate adequate adaptive function. The total range of possible standard scores on the Vineland is 20 to 160.</description>

          <title>Binocular Distance Visual Acuity</title>
          <description>Visual Acuity with the participant's presenting correction (or unaided if that had no correction) was obtained with a computerized logMAR style chart with subjects identifying letters from 0.8 logMAR size to progressively smaller sizes in 0.1 logMAR steps (5 letters per line) until a total of 5 mistakes were made. Measures were performed with both eyes open rather than for each eye individually. The potential minimum score on the test (worst vision) was 0.90 logMAR and the potential maximum score (best vision) was -0.20 logMAR.</description>

          <title>Refractive Error Classification</title>
          <description>Refractive error was classified for each eye based on the individual powers of the principal meridians and cylinder magnitude. Myopia was -0.50D or more myopia in both meridians. Hyperopia was a most plus meridian at least +1.00 D with the fellow meridian greater than or equal to 0 D. Mixed astigmatism was one principal meridian with plus power and the other with minus with at least 0.50 D cylinder. Emmetropia was both principal meridians between -0.50 and +1.00 D with less than 0.50 D cylinder.</description>

Post-measurement analysis is performed to identify the refractive correction predicted to produce the best image quality, as measured by maximization of the image quality metric Visual Strehl ratio in the spatial domain (VSX).&#xD;

Measures will be re-sized to the patient's habitual pupil diameter and averaged. Post-measurement analysis is performed to identify the refractive correction predicted to produce the best image quality, as measured by maximization of the image quality metric Visual Strehl ratio in the spatial domain (VSX).&#xD;

Spectacles - Clinically Derived: Prescription spectacle lenses determined by clinically derived techniques of a masked examiner and may include autorefraction, retinoscopy, and subjective refraction obtained pre or post dilation.&#xD;
Spectacles - Metric Technique #1 Derived: For this method, wavefront error will be measured with the COAS (complete ophthalmic analysis system) wavefront aberrometer post-dilation (3 - 5 captures per eye). Measures will be re-sized to the patient's habitual pupil diameter and averaged. Post-measurement analysis is performed to identify the refractive correction predicted to produce the best image quality, as measured by maximization of the image quality metric Visual Strehl ratio in the spatial domain (VSX).&#xD;
Spectacles - Metric Technique #2 Derived: For this method, wavefront error will be measured with the COAS wavefront aberrometer post-dilation (3 - 5 captures per eye).

Spectacles - Metric Technique #1 Derived: For this method, wavefront error will be measured with the COAS (complete ophthalmic analysis system) wavefront aberrometer post-dilation (3 - 5 captures per eye). Measures will be re-sized to the patient's habitual pupil diameter and averaged. Post-measurement analysis is performed to identify the refractive correction predicted to produce the best image quality, as measured by maximization of the image quality metric Visual Strehl ratio in the spatial domain (VSX).&#xD;

Spectacles - Clinically Derived: Prescription spectacle lenses determined by clinically derived techniques of a masked examiner and may include autorefraction, retinoscopy, and subjective refraction obtained pre or post dilation.&#xD;
Spectacles - Metric Technique #1 Derived: For this method, wavefront error will be measured with the COAS (complete ophthalmic analysis system) wavefront aberrometer post-dilation (3 - 5 captures per eye). Measures will be re-sized to the patient's habitual pupil diameter and averaged. Post-measurement analysis is performed to identify the refractive correction predicted to produce the best image quality, as measured by maximization of the image quality metric Visual Strehl ratio in the spatial domain (VSX).&#xD;
