  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a three-dimensional deformity of the spine due to an&#xD;
      unknown cause. Bracing is a proven non-surgical treatment for scoliosis. Our group developed&#xD;
      an ultrasound assisted method which can improve brace design. However, it is still quite time&#xD;
      consuming to construct a brace. Although 3D printing technology has been proposed to&#xD;
      construct a scoliosis brace, its effectiveness has not been validated. The goals of this&#xD;
      study was to investigate if an effective and comfortable brace can be designed and fabricated&#xD;
      by using ultrasound and computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM)&#xD;
      technology, and be printed directly from a 3D printer with faster production, lower cost, and&#xD;
      improved comfort to patients. Also, to investigate the effectiveness of new designed brace.&#xD;
      The final outcomes may reduce the total number of spinal surgeries for scoliosis. The&#xD;
      benefits not only reduce the health care cost, but also increase the quality of life of these&#xD;
      adolescent patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized clinical trial with a total of 50 new brace candidates diagnosed with AIS from&#xD;
      the Stollery Children's Hospital Scoliosis Clinic will be conducted in the next 2 years.&#xD;
      Ethics approval (Pro00054113) has been granted. Inclusion is based on the standard Scoliosis&#xD;
      Research Society (SRS) brace studies criteria: a) diagnosed with AIS and new to rigid spinal&#xD;
      brace treatment, b) prescribed full-time brace wear (23 hours per day), c) primary Cobb&#xD;
      angles 20°- 40°, d) age between 10 -16 years, e) Risser 0-2 (skeletally immature), f) either&#xD;
      premenarchal or less than 1 year postmenarchal. The 50 subjects will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      2 equally sized groups (n=25 in each group): group A conventional designed and manual&#xD;
      fabricated braces and group B ultrasound and CAD/CAM scanner designed brace with printing by&#xD;
      a 3D printer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups: A brace monitor (2.5cm x 4.0cm x 1.5 cm and 8g) developed from our group will be&#xD;
      installed into all braces for both study groups. It will monitor patients' compliance which&#xD;
      includes how much time they use their braces and how much time they wear their braces at the&#xD;
      prescribed tightness level (quantity and quality). The battery power and memory capacities of&#xD;
      the monitor last for 9 months with the sample rate at 1 sample/minute. The brace monitor will&#xD;
      be embedded into the brace). No extra attention is needed from the patients. The brace wear&#xD;
      pattern data will be downloaded at the routinely scheduled follow up clinics (post brace&#xD;
      prescription of 2 months, 6 months, 1 year and every 6 months periods).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the compliance assessment, we will get 80% power in this sample size if the average&#xD;
      compliance from the control group is 60±4% (from our previous study), but in the intervention&#xD;
      group the compliance is increased to 70±4%. The compliance is the number of brace wear hours&#xD;
      relative to the prescribed hours per day wear time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: When subjects return to their regular follow up scoliosis clinics, the standard&#xD;
      standing in-brace radiographs will be taken. The in-brace Cobb angle will be measured by the&#xD;
      clinic staff and saved into the clinical database. The Cobb angle correction (in percent) of&#xD;
      the treated curve as measured at the immediate follow-up clinic (in-brace radiographic&#xD;
      clinic) [(Pre-Out of brace Cobb angle - In-brace Cobb angle)/Pre-brace Cobb angle]*100 will&#xD;
      be used to evaluate the immediate effectiveness. An unpaired 2-tailed Student's t-test using&#xD;
      an alpha of 0.05 will be used to compare the correction observed in the intervention group to&#xD;
      that of the control group. The total numbers of in-brace radiographs will be tailed; it will&#xD;
      be counted up to the last radiograph that shows an in-brace correction which is deemed&#xD;
      acceptable by the attending orthopedic surgeon. The number of radiographs will be compared&#xD;
      between the two study groups. The p-value of the chi-squared test for independence will be&#xD;
      used to determine whether a statistically significant difference exists between the 2 groups.&#xD;
