      This is an international, multi-centre, non-controlled, open-label, single arm, two-stage&#xD;
      Simon Design phase II study for non-BRCA metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients with&#xD;
      homologous recombination deficiency treated with Olaparib single agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to assess the efficacy of olaparib single agent as determined by&#xD;
      Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST&#xD;
      1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first stage Triple negative (TN) non-BRCA, metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients&#xD;
      whose tumours exhibited any characteristic related to homologous recombination deficiency&#xD;
      (HRD). In the second stage, luminal patients (RH positive HER2 negative) will be allowed in&#xD;
      the same conditions that TN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients whose tumours are identified as Homologous Recombination Deficient by deleterious&#xD;
      HRR gene mutations (according to Foundation Medicine's Foundation One assay) will receive&#xD;
      olaparib 300 mg (two tablets of 150mg) orally twice daily (bid) on days 1-28 each 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study commitment is 39 patients: 17 patients will be enrolled at first stage and 22 at the&#xD;
      second stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the study period is 34 months.&#xD;

      This is an international, multi-centre, non-controlled, open-label, single arm, two-stage&#xD;
      Simon Design phase II study for non-BRCA metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients with&#xD;
      homologous recombination deficiency treated with Olaparib single agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to assess the efficacy of olaparib single agent as determined by&#xD;
      Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST&#xD;
      1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triple negative non-BRCA metastatic breast cancer women (for the first stage) age â‰¥ 18 years&#xD;
      that had previously received at least one (and no more than three) line for their metastatic&#xD;
      disease. Patients must have previously received taxanes either in the early or in the&#xD;
      metastatic scenario. To be included in the trial, tumours must be considered homologous&#xD;
      recombination deficient (HRD) according to Foundation Medicine's Foundation One assay.&#xD;
      Evidence of measurable metastatic disease is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second stage, luminal patients (RH positive HER2 negative) will be allowed to&#xD;
      participate in the same conditions that TN patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients whose tumours are identified as Homologous Recombination Deficient by deleterious&#xD;
      HRR gene mutations (according to Foundation Medicine's Foundation One assay) will receive&#xD;
      olaparib 300 mg (two tablets of 150mg) orally twice daily (bid) on days 1-28 each 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study commitment is 39 patients: 17 patients will be enrolled at first stage and 22 at the&#xD;
      second stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the period between the end of the first stage and the beginning of the second, an&#xD;
      interim analysis will be conducted to assess the viability of the second part of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the study period is 34 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage I:&#xD;
&#xD;
