      This study will evaluate the role of systematic lymphadenectomy after sentinel node (SLN)&#xD;
      mapping in high risk endometrial cancer (high grade histologies or deep myometrial invasion).&#xD;
      The participants will be randomized in a non-inferiority controlled trial in 2 groups: SLN&#xD;
      mapping or SLN mapping followed by systematic lymphadenectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although most patients with endometrial cancer present with early-stage disease, the standard&#xD;
      treatment still includes systematic lymph node dissection for staging. Recently, SLN mapping&#xD;
      has emerged as an acceptable surgical strategy when deciding between complete lymphadenectomy&#xD;
      and no node dissection. This approach can help avoid the morbidity that is associated with a&#xD;
      complete lymphadenectomy, such as neurovascular injury, lymphocyst formation, and lymphedema.&#xD;
      A recent meta-analysis that included 55 studies and 4915 patients reported an overall SLN&#xD;
      detection rate of 81% versus 50% for bilateral SLNs. Moreover, the use of indocyanine green&#xD;
      increased the bilateral SLN detection rate compared with blue dye (74.6% vs. 50.5%). Yet, the&#xD;
      studies noted an overall sensitivity of 96% and false negative rates of less than 5% when&#xD;
      analyzed per hemipelvis. Since 2014, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)&#xD;
      guidelines have recommended SLN mapping as an alternative option for node staging in&#xD;
      endometrial cancer. However, most studies on SLN mapping have included patients who are at&#xD;
      low risk for lymph node involvement and thus might underestimate the false negative rate.&#xD;
      Recently, Soliman et al. reported a series of only high-grade and deep invasive endometrial&#xD;
      cancers for which patients underwent SLN mapping, followed by pelvic and para-aortic lymph&#xD;
      node dissection. An 89% detection rate was reported, suggesting that SLN mapping accurately&#xD;
      identifies node metastases, with an negative predictive value (NPV) of 98% and an false&#xD;
      negative predictive value (FNPV) of 2% when analyzed by hemipelvises. Positive nodes were&#xD;
      found in 22.8% of patients (43% of isolated tumor cells and micrometastases), and in 40% of&#xD;
      cases, the SLN was the only positive node. Data from the investigators corroborate these&#xD;
      findings-26.7% of high-risk cases had positive nodes (50% of isolated tumor cells and&#xD;
      micrometastases), and when analyzed by hemipelvis, the NPV was 97.9% and the FNPV was 2.1%.&#xD;
      In 14 (70%) patients, the SLN was the only positive node. Moreover, there are few&#xD;
      publications that have compared the results of the addition of SLN mapping to lymphadenectomy&#xD;
      alone. Raimond et al. compared 156 patients that had SLN mapping with 95 who had pelvic node&#xD;
      dissection. In their study, SLN mapping and imuno-histochemistry (IHC) were performed in low-&#xD;
      and intermediate-risk patients, and the former detected metastatic node 3 times more often&#xD;
      than complete pelvic lymphadenectomy alone (16.2% vs. 5.1%, p=0.03). They had no false&#xD;
      negatives, and the IHC findings modified the adjuvant therapy in half of all cases. Holloway&#xD;
      et al. compared a series of 661 patients who had undergone pelvic and para-aortic&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy with 119 who were subjected to SLN mapping plus node dissection, including 68&#xD;
      high-intermediate- and high-risk patients in the SLN mapping group (GOG99 stratification).&#xD;
      Despite the similarity in demographics and pathological risk factors, the SLN group had more&#xD;
      LN metastases that were detected (30.3% vs. 16.3%; p&lt;0.001) and received more adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy (28.6% vs. 16.3%; p=0.003). The SLN was the only positive node in 18 (50%) of mapped&#xD;
      cases, and the false negative rate was 2.8%.The investigators recently published a series on&#xD;
      high risk endometrial cancer and also recorded a higher pelvic node metastasis rate for the&#xD;
      SLN mapping group (26.7% vs. 14.3%, p=0.02) but no significant difference in para-aortic node&#xD;
      metastases (13.5% vs. 5.6%, p=0.12). Notably, if considered only patients in whom SLNs were&#xD;
      mapped, 31.3% had pelvic positive nodes. Despite the differences in uterine risk factors&#xD;
      between groups, 10.6% (8/75) of patients in the SLN group had node metastasis that was&#xD;
      diagnosed only after IHC. Excluding these patients, the SLN group would have had a node&#xD;
      positivity rate of 17.3%, similar to the N-SLN group (17.4%), reinforcing the impact of IHC&#xD;
      in the detection of node metastases. Moreover, the SLN group received more adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy (33.5% vs. 48%). The overall detection rate for SLNs was 85.3%, and bilateral&#xD;
      SLNs were observed in 60%. The investigators noted an overall sensitivity of 90%, a negative&#xD;
      predictive value of 95.7%, and a false negative predictive value of 4.3%. Recently, Touhami&#xD;
      et al. showed that the risk of non-SLN metastasis is 61% when the SLN metastasis size is&#xD;
      â‰¥2mm, and 5% for SLN metastasis of &lt;2mm. However, one of the remaining uncertainties is the&#xD;
      role of systematic lymphadenectomy after a positive SLN. In other words, is there any benefit&#xD;
      in favor of systematic lymphadenectomy in a patient that already undergo adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy? The investigators hypothesized that there is no disease free survival benefit&#xD;
      in adding systematic lymphadenectomy to only sentinel node mapping and proposed a prospective&#xD;
      randomized controlled non-inferiority trial comparing SLN mapping to SLN mapping with&#xD;
      systematic lymphadenectomy in high risk endometrial cancer.&#xD;
