  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human/first-in-patient, multi-center, open-label, non-randomized,&#xD;
      ascending dose, safety and tolerability study of a single intravenous infusion of PF-06939926&#xD;
      in ambulatory and non-ambulatory subjects with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Other&#xD;
      objectives include measurement of dystrophin expression and distribution, and assessments of&#xD;
      muscle strength, quality, and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of approximately 35 subjects will receive PF-06939926, and these will include both&#xD;
      ambulatory and non-ambulatory subjects. Up to 13 subjects may be included in a cohort that&#xD;
      includes the concomitant medication, sirolimus. In order to mitigate unanticipated risks to&#xD;
      subject safety, enrollment will be staggered within and between two planned dose-levels and&#xD;
      will include a formal review by an external data monitoring committee (E-DMC) prior to dose&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
