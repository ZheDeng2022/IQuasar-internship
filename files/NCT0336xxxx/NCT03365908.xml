  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the outcome of pain interventions that are considered standard of&#xD;
      care during the surgical treatment of ACL injuries. The comparison will be looking at pain&#xD;
      control during and after ACL surgery as well as functional outcomes in patients that had a&#xD;
      nerve block versus those who did not. The investigators hypothesize that pain control will be&#xD;
      equal between both groups.&#xD;

      Specific Aim #1: To determine if there is a difference in opioid pain medication use&#xD;
      following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction between an oral pain regimen versus&#xD;
      adductor canal block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: To determine if there is a difference in knee recovery and function&#xD;
      post-operatively following ACL reconstruction between an oral pain regimen versus adductor&#xD;
      canal block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #3: To determine if cost-effectiveness or patient flow logistics of ACL&#xD;
      reconstruction are affected by whether has patient has adductor canal block versus receiving&#xD;
      oral pain medication regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #4: To determine if pre-operative Resiliency scores are associated with&#xD;
      post-operative pain and outcomes following ACL reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #1: There is no difference in post-operative pain management or functional&#xD;
      outcomes following ACL reconstruction based on whether patient had adductor canal block&#xD;
      versus an oral pain medication regiment implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #2: Worse resiliency scores pre-operatively are associated with worse outcomes and&#xD;
      pain scores post-operatively following ACL reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon enrollment and at at the participant's pre-op appointment, the participant will complete&#xD;
      a questionnaire entitled the Brief Resiliency Scale (BRS) to determine the participant's&#xD;
      resiliency score and receive post-operative pain medication prescriptions. At time of surgery&#xD;
      the participant will begin a pain diary to chronicle use of pain medication for 6 weeks and&#xD;
      turn this document in at the 6-week follow-up appointment along with documentation of time to&#xD;
      first able to walk (ambulate) without assistive device (i.e. crutch, walker, etc.). In the&#xD;
      recovery room, the participant will verbally complete a Visual Analog Scale to determine the&#xD;
      pain level at 15 minutes after surgery and before discharge. At the 3-month post-op visit,&#xD;
      the participant will complete another questionnaire entitled the Knee Injury and&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) to determine operative knee pain and function. At the&#xD;
      6-month post-op visit, the participant will complete a questionnaire entitled Marx Activity&#xD;
      Rating Scale to determine operative knee function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will be chosen by chance, like flipping a coin. Neither the participant nor the&#xD;
      study doctor will choose what treatment the participant receives. The participant will have a&#xD;
      one in two chance of being given each treatment. The participant will know which treatment&#xD;
      was given but the operating surgeon will not know.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be randomized to 1 of 2 standard of care treatment groups at the time of&#xD;
      surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adductor canal nerve block (an anesthetic block of the femoral nerve halfway down the&#xD;
           thigh that causes numbness in the knee and lower part of the leg)), or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No nerve block for perioperative (during the operation) pain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of treatment group, all participants pre-operatively will receive the following&#xD;
      pain medication: 400 mg celecoxib (Celebrex), 300 mg gabapentin (Neurontin), and 1 g of&#xD;
      acetaminophen (Tylenol) 1-2 hours before surgery. This oral regimen is similar to standard of&#xD;
      care pre-operative medication in total knee arthroplasties (knee replacements).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will also receive the same post-operative prescriptions at their&#xD;
      pre-operative clinic visit which will be: 90 tablets of 1 g acetaminophen to be taken three&#xD;
      times a day for 30 days and 90 tablets of 5 mg oxycodone with 1-2 tablets to be taken every 4&#xD;
      to 6 hours as needed for pain. Additionally, the participant will receive two medications&#xD;
      (Zofran, Phenergan) for nausea/vomiting which are to be taken as needed. Participants will&#xD;
      record their medication use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACL reconstruction and any other procedures to address any other damage in the participants's&#xD;
      knee as determined by the surgeon will be performed as per standard clinical practice at an&#xD;
      outpatient surgical facility. The participant will undergo standard post-operative&#xD;
      rehabilitation. During the standard of care post-operative visits in the Sports Medicine&#xD;
      Clinic, the participant will be asked to fill out questionnaires specific for our data&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
