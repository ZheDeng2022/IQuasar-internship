  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are evaluating a service called peer-delivered Whole Health Coaching to&#xD;
      understand how it can help Veterans with PTSD. This project has two main goals: (1) determine&#xD;
      how peer-delivered Whole Health Coaching can help Veterans with post-traumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder and (2) learning about feasibility of implementing this service in Veterans Health&#xD;
      Administration primary care settings. The investigators are also evaluating feasibility of&#xD;
      the research methods in this trial to learn how to improve future studies on this topic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole Health Coaching is a service designed to improve health and wellness. It is a variation&#xD;
      of integrative health coaching and is being used in Veterans Health Administration medical&#xD;
      centers. In Whole Health Coaching, Veterans will work with coaches to develop a personal&#xD;
      health mission, develop specific goals and action steps, and then adjust their plan as&#xD;
      needed. Coaches provide guidance and support throughout the process. In this project, a peer&#xD;
      support specialist working in primary care will be the coach. VA Peer Support Specialists,&#xD;
      &quot;peers&quot;, are Veterans recovering from a mental health condition trained to help other&#xD;
      Veterans improve their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive peer-delivered Whole Health Coaching. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned a start date for their first session with the Peer Whole Health Coach&#xD;
      between 4 and 13 weeks after they start the study. The information provided during this time&#xD;
      prior to the first session helps us understand how participants do on their own without the&#xD;
      service. The research components include interviews and questionnaires about health and&#xD;
      wellness, goals, and experiences with the service. Veterans who participate in the study will&#xD;
      complete short questionnaires twice a week for 6 months and have four longer appointments&#xD;
      where more questions will be asked. Participants will also be given the opportunity to&#xD;
      provide feedback on the service.&#xD;

    <measure>Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants completed GAS twice weekly throughout the entire 24 week study period and scores were compared over time.</time_frame>
    <description>Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) is a systematic method used to evaluate participants' individualized goals and progress towards Whole Health goals. Scores range from 0-10 for each domain of whole health measured with higher scores indicating more positive outcomes. Each participant's GAS score reflects the GAS score from the goal domain(s) that the participant identified as primary during the course of the intervention. For participants with multiple goals, GAS scores were average across domains.</description>

    <measure>PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants completed the PCL-5 at baseline, pre-treatment, post-treatment, and final follow-up assessments over the course of the 24 week study period.</time_frame>
    <description>The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) is a measure of participants' PTSD symptoms. The total sum score ranges from 0-80 with lower scores indicating more positive outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning (IPF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants completed the IPF at baseline, pre-treatment, post-treatment, and final follow-up assessments over the course of the 24 week study period.</time_frame>
    <description>The Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning (IPF) is a measure of psychosocial functioning across several domains. The total score was used for this project and reflects a composite of multiple subscales (romantic relationships, family, work, friendships and socializing, parenting, education, and self care). Scores range from 0-100 with lower scores indicating more positive outcomes.</description>

        <title>Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS)</title>
        <description>Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) is a systematic method used to evaluate participants' individualized goals and progress towards Whole Health goals. Scores range from 0-10 for each domain of whole health measured with higher scores indicating more positive outcomes. Each participant's GAS score reflects the GAS score from the goal domain(s) that the participant identified as primary during the course of the intervention. For participants with multiple goals, GAS scores were average across domains.</description>
        <time_frame>Participants completed GAS twice weekly throughout the entire 24 week study period and scores were compared over time.</time_frame>
        <population>Participants were included in this analysis if they initiated peer-delivered Whole Health Coaching within 2 weeks of their designated start date, if they met the baseline stability criterion (at least four data points on the primary outcome, the final two of which had to fall within the range of the previous two data points, for at least 5 of the 9 domains), and if they completed at least three assessments during the intervention phase.</population>
