    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) in&#xD;
      non-smoking adults with chronic cough and the prevalence of BHR in patients with upper airway&#xD;
      cough syndrome (UACS) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), to evaluate the&#xD;
      relationship between BHR and cough reflex sensitivity, to assess the diagnostic accuracy of&#xD;
      methacholine challenge test (MCT) in cough variant asthma (CVA) with special regard to its&#xD;
      discriminating cut off value between CVA and other causes of chronic cough, particularly&#xD;
      GERD, to estimate prognostic value of BHR, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and induced&#xD;
      sputum eosinophil count in predicting response to asthma treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with a chronic cough will undergo the standard diagnostic work-up&#xD;
      recommended by experts for patients with a chronic cough, including methacholine challenge&#xD;
      test (MCT) and an at least 4-week period of causal treatment. Patients with BHR in MCT will&#xD;
      be treated with - in first step B2-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for at least 4&#xD;
      weeks, if improvement is not significant in next steps with leukotriene receptor antagonist&#xD;
      (LTRA) or systemic corticosteroid. A good treatment response, evaluated by visual analogue&#xD;
      scale (VAS), Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) and cough challenge will confirm the&#xD;
      diagnosis of the disease. A statistical analysis will consist of the frequency of BHR in a&#xD;
      chronic cough, correlation between the results of MCT and cough reflex sensitivity in&#xD;
      capsaicin inhalation test and cut-off point for MCT to discriminate asthma from other causes&#xD;
      of a chronic cough.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study has the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to assess the prevalence of BHR in non-smoking adults with a chronic cough,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to assess the prevalence of BHR in patients with UACS and GERD,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to evaluate the relationship between BHR and cough reflex sensitivity,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to assess the diagnostic accuracy of MCT in CVA with special regard to its&#xD;
           discriminating value between CVA and other causes of a chronic cough, particularly GERD,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. to estimate prognostic value of BHR, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and induced&#xD;
           sputum eosinophil count in predicting response to asthma treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigated group will consist of 80 non-smoking adults (18-75 years old), who are not&#xD;
      treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, with no signs of respiratory infection&#xD;
      within six weeks prior to enrolment, with a normal chest radiograph and who are referred to&#xD;
      the hospital due to a cough lasting at least eight weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining an informed consent, the diagnostic approach of the most common causes of&#xD;
      chronic cough will be performed: a medical history, physical examination, chest radiograph,&#xD;
      in some cases chest computed tomography, pulmonary function tests (spirometry, fractional&#xD;
      exhaled nitric oxide, methacholine challenge test), laboratory tests (total immunoglobulin E&#xD;
      concentration, complete blood count), skin prick tests, induced sputum cell count, computed&#xD;
      tomography of the paranasal sinuses and ENT consultation, 24-hour impedance with pH&#xD;
      monitoring, videolaryngoscopy and cough challenge with capsaicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cough severity will be assessed twice (on admission and after six weeks of causal&#xD;
      treatment) using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the Polish version of the Leicester Cough&#xD;
      Questionnaire (LCQ) and the capsaicin inhalation cough challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If MCT result is positive, CVA will be assumed the cause of a chronic cough and treatment&#xD;
      with an inhaled steroid combined with a long-acting beta-agonist will be administered for at&#xD;
      least 4 weeks. If no satisfactory response to this treatment is observed, an anti-leukotriene&#xD;
      agent or in the next step systemic corticosteroid will be applied. Ineffective treatment with&#xD;
      the above-mentioned medications will indicate an opportunity for a different underlying cause&#xD;
      of BHR. The estimation the area under a ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve will be&#xD;
      used to determine the optimal cut-off point for the differentiation between asthma and&#xD;
      alternate causes of a chronic cough.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected to assess the frequency of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in subjects with a&#xD;
      chronic cough, to confirm a correlation between the results of MCT and the sensitivity of&#xD;
      cough reflex measured in capsaicin inhalation cough challenge. The investigation will&#xD;
      probably determine a precise cut-off point for MCT which would allow discriminating asthma&#xD;
      from other causes of a chronic cough.&#xD;
