  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supplemental oxygen is frequently used in patients admitted to hospital due to ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease. In the setting of suspected myocardial infarction, clinical practice guidelines&#xD;
      advocate the use of supplementary oxygen even in patients with normal levels of peripheral&#xD;
      oxygen saturation. The theoretical basis for this practice is that an increase in blood&#xD;
      oxygen content may limit ischemia and final myocardial damage and subsequent infarct size.&#xD;
      However, although some experimental laboratory data and small studies in humans have&#xD;
      supported the use of supplemental oxygen in patients with coronary artery disease,&#xD;
      contradicting evidence suggests possible harmful effects, mainly through mechanisms involving&#xD;
      coronary vasoconstriction and reduction of myocardial perfusion (hyperoxemic coronary&#xD;
      vasoconstriction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the EPOXY-IMR trial, the investigators aim to further explore possible detrimental effects&#xD;
      from routine use of supplemental oxygen on the coronary circulation with special focus on the&#xD;
      small vessels referred to as the coronary microcirculation.&#xD;

      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the EPOXY-IMR trial is to evaluate the effect of supplemental oxygen on coronary&#xD;
      circulation in the setting of elective coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI). To achieve this, different functional parameters such as the index of&#xD;
      microcirculatory resistance (IMR), fractional flow reserve (FFR) and coronary flow reserve&#xD;
      (CFR) will be obtained and serial biomarkers (cardiac troponin) will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) based on arteriosclerotic narrowing of the coronary blood&#xD;
      vessels is the most common cause of death in the western world. To determine the severity of&#xD;
      the disease in symptomatic patients and guide optimal therapy, coronary angiography is&#xD;
      frequently performed. Simplified, three outcomes can be found:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. No or mild evidence of CAD leading to continuous medical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Severe disease demanding revascularization therapy done by either percutaneous coronary&#xD;
           intervention (PCI), where most commonly balloon dilatation followed by placement of a&#xD;
           metal stent in the coronary vessel is performed, or coronary artery bypass grafting&#xD;
           (CABG).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In patients with moderate disease further functional testing is required to assess the&#xD;
           gravity of the narrowing. This can be achieved by placing a pressure sensor equipped&#xD;
           guide wire to the diseased artery comparing blood pressure proximal and distal to the&#xD;
           stenosis during hyperemia, known as Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR). Although based on&#xD;
           pressure recordings, FFR is a highly accurate measure of the flow limitation of a given&#xD;
           stenosis. A common cut-off value of 0,8 is used where a lower value mandates therapy as&#xD;
           in patients with severe disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further information regarding the coronary circulation can be obtained by calculation of&#xD;
      coronary flow reserve (CFR) and the index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR), the former&#xD;
      representing a measure of the flow situation in the complete coronary arterial system, the&#xD;
      latter more specifically the vascular resistance in the microcirculatory compartment. These&#xD;
      indices are based on thermodilution measurements using a temperature sensor also located in&#xD;
      the above mentioned pressure sensor equipped guide wire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplemental oxygen is frequently used all over the world in patients hospitalized with&#xD;
      suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) irrespective of oxygen levels in the blood.&#xD;
      Scientifically, only experimental laboratory data and small studies in humans have supported&#xD;
      this practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, mounting evidence suggests possible harmful effects of supplemental oxygen by&#xD;
      causing a decrease in cardiac function, especially through mechanisms of narrowing of the&#xD;
      coronary arteries due high oxygen levels in the blood (hyperoxemic coronary&#xD;
      vasoconstriction). Clinically, epicardial coronary vasoconstriction mediated by oxygen&#xD;
      therapy may result in underestimation of vessel size during percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI), possibly increasing the risk of subsequent complications such as stent&#xD;
      thrombosis and in-stent restenosis. Furthermore, vasoconstriction in the microcirculatory&#xD;
      compartment may result in increased periprocedural myocardial injury as a result of&#xD;
      microvascular obstruction from plaque related and thrombotic material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the EPOXY-IMR trial, the investigators aim to analyze possible detrimental effects of&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen in patients undergoing coronary angiography and intracoronary&#xD;
      pressure/flow measurements due to angiographically intermediate coronary lesions and with&#xD;
      special focus on the circulation of the small vessels (microvascular function).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      EPOXY-IMR is a single centre, interventional, double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial&#xD;
      aiming to recruit 40 patients in the treatment group (cohort A, patients in whom PCI is&#xD;
      performed) and 25 patients in the non-intervention group (cohort B, patients in whom PCI is&#xD;
      deferred on the basis of a non-significant FFR-value).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) scheduled for elective coronary&#xD;
      angiography and normal oxygen saturation (≥90% on pulse oximeter) are asked to participate in&#xD;
      the trial in good time prior to the exam. After written informed consent standard diagnostic&#xD;
      coronary angiography is performed. If coronary stenosis of moderate degree is found in the&#xD;
      larger arteries (40-90% diameter stenosis), further functional evaluation is mandated to&#xD;
      determine if the stenosis impedes coronary blood flow significantly. According to clinical&#xD;
      routine, this is achieved by placing a pressure wire in the diseased vessel passing the&#xD;
      narrowed section, obtaining data on coronary blood pressure proximal and distal to the&#xD;
      stenosis and inducing hyperemia with adenosine infusion for determination of FFR. Using&#xD;
      thermodilution with intracoronary bolus injections of room temperature saline, data for&#xD;
      calculation of the index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) and coronary flow reserve (CFR)&#xD;
      will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients with FFR &lt;0,8 indicative of restricted blood flow to the heart muscle&#xD;
      mandating further treatment by PCI, form cohort A. Patients with FFR &gt;0,8 make up cohort B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereafter, the patients are randomized in a double blinded fashion by a designated study&#xD;
      nurse to either supplemental oxygen 6l/min delivered by an open face mask (Oxymask®) or&#xD;
      ambient air (sham placement of Oxymask®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A: After 10 minutes inhalation of oxygen/ambient air, FFR, CFR and IMR are re-measured&#xD;
      followed by PCI according to clinical routine. Finally, post PCI measurements of IMR, FFR and&#xD;
      CFR are performed. Troponin levels are obtained at baseline, 4 hours and 12-24 hours post&#xD;
      PCI. An arterial blood gas sample is drawn just before PCI. During PCI, coronary pressure&#xD;
      distal to the lesion is recorded during balloon inflation, allowing for recording of wedge&#xD;
      pressure which is required for correct calculation of flow- and resistance indices in a&#xD;
      significantly stenosed vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B: After 10 minutes inhalation of oxygen/ambient air, FFR, CFR and IMR are re-measured&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supplemental oxygen reduces coronary blood flow and increases microcirculatory&#xD;
           resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supplemental oxygen increases microcirculatory resistance leading to increased procedure&#xD;
           related myocardial damage&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint is the effect of supplemental oxygen on IMR. Secondary endpoints will&#xD;
      furthermore evaluate effects on CFR, FFR and serial cardiac troponin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there is limited and conflicting evidence supporting the routine administration of&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen in patients with coronary artery disease. The EPOXY-IMR trial is designed&#xD;
      to explore the effects of supplemental oxygen on coronary blood flow and microvascular&#xD;
      resistance as potential mediators of detrimental clinical effects.&#xD;
