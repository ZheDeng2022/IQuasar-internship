    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of navitoclax and how well it&#xD;
      works when given together with vistusertib in treating patients with small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      and solid tumors that have come back (relapsed). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      navitoclax, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Vistusertib may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving&#xD;
      navitoclax and vistusertib may work better than navitoclax alone in treating patients with&#xD;
      small cell lung cancer and solid tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of navitoclax and vistusertib&#xD;
      in patients with advanced solid tumors. (Phase I) II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD), dose limiting toxicities (DLT), and recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) of navitoclax and&#xD;
      vistusertib. (Phase I) III. To determine the objective response rate (ORR), defined as&#xD;
      complete plus partial response, of the combination of navitoclax and vistusertib in patients&#xD;
      with recurrent small cell lung cancer (SCLC). (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of navitoclax and vistusertib when administered together.&#xD;
      (Phase I) II. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. (Phase I) III. To confirm the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of navitoclax and vistusertib at the RP2D. (Phase II) IV. To estimate&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of the combination of navitoclax&#xD;
      and vistusertib at the RP2D. (Phase II) V. To estimate disease control rate (DCR) of the&#xD;
      combination of navitoclax and vistusertib at the RP2D. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess pharmacodynamic changes in levels of phosphorylated 4EBP1 (p4EBP1) the ratio of&#xD;
      p4EBP1 to total (p4EBP1/4EBP1) in paired pre-treatment and on-treatment biopsies at the RP2D.&#xD;
      (Phase II) II. To correlate changes in BAX and MCL-1 with response. (Phase II) III. To&#xD;
      estimate the baseline inter-patient variability in p4EBP1, pS6, BAX, and MCL-1. (Phase II)&#xD;
      IV. To explore exposure-response relationships between navitoclax and vistusertib exposure&#xD;
      and the pharmacodynamic endpoints (safety, efficacy, and laboratory correlatives). (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive navitoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) and vistusertib PO twice daily (BID)&#xD;
      on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 8-12&#xD;
      weeks for up to 2 years.&#xD;

                  contraception cannot be considered highly effective as it is currently unknown&#xD;
                  whether vistusertib may reduce their effectiveness; periodic abstinence, the&#xD;

                  40% and shortening fraction [SF] &lt; 15%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Drugs which have an increased risk for QTc prolongation should be avoided&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Vistusertib belongs to a class&#xD;
             of drugs that causes hyperglycemia. In order to assess toxicity, patients with an&#xD;
             elevated risk of hyperglycemia should be excluded from study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients currently receiving medications or herbal supplements of the classes below&#xD;
             are ineligible; patients are eligible if they stop use of these compounds at least 1&#xD;
             week prior to receiving any treatment on this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 /5 (CYP3A4 inhibitors such as&#xD;
                  ketoconazole and clarithromycin are not allowed 7 days prior to the first dose of&#xD;
                  navitoclax and during navitoclax administration)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Strong or moderate inhibitors of Pgp or BRCP1&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sensitive substrates of CYP2C9 (i.e. phenytoin and warfarin)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Substrates of certain drug transporters (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1 or MATE2K)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because navitoclax and vistusertib have&#xD;
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with navitoclax and vistusertib breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with navitoclax and vistusertib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are not excluded from this&#xD;
             study, but HIV-positive patients must have:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A stable regimen of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) that does not&#xD;
                  include strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No requirement for concurrent antibiotics or antifungal agents for the prevention&#xD;
                  of opportunistic infections&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A CD4 count above 250 cells/mcL and an undetectable HIV viral load on standard&#xD;
                  polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based test&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any hematopoietic growth factors (e.g., filgrastim [granulocyte colony-stimulating&#xD;
             factor; G-CSF], sargramostim [granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor;&#xD;
             GM-CSF]) within 14 days prior to receiving study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received a live, attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of first dose of&#xD;
             drug&#xD;
