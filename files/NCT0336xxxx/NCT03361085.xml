  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) is divided in two distinct groups,&#xD;
      ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and non-ventilator-associated HAP (nvHAP). Although&#xD;
      nvHAP occurs more frequently than VAP and results in similar mortality and costs, prevention&#xD;
      guidelines and prevention focus almost exclusively on VAP. Scientific evidence about nvHAP&#xD;
      prevention is scarce. Therefore, we designed a mixed-methods study to investigate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a newly developed nvHAP prevention bundle and factors that influence its&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This single-centre project at the 950-bed University Hospital Zurich (UHZ) will&#xD;
      engage the wards of nine departments with substantial nvHAP rates. The nvHAP bundle consists&#xD;
      of five primary prevention measures: 1) oral care, 2) identification and treatment of&#xD;
      patients with dysphagia, 3) mobilization, 4) stopping unnecessary proton pump inhibitors,&#xD;
      and, 5) respiratory therapy. Implementation includes the engagement of department-level&#xD;
      implementation teams, who sustain the 'core' intervention components of education, training,&#xD;
      and environmental restructuring and adapt the implementation strategy to local needs. The&#xD;
      effects of the implementation will be analysed by a mixed-method approach. As primary&#xD;
      outcome, nvHAP incidence rates will be analysed by Poisson regression models to compare&#xD;
      incidence rates before, during, and after the implementation phases (on the hospital and&#xD;
      department level). In addition, the association between process indicators and nvHAP&#xD;
      incidence rates will be analysed using longitudinal Poisson regression models. A&#xD;
      longitudinal, qualitative study and formative evaluation based on interviews and focus groups&#xD;
      identifies supporting or hindering factors for implementation success in participating&#xD;
      departments dynamically over time. This accumulating implementation experience will be&#xD;
      constantly fed back to the implementation teams and thus, represents an active implementation&#xD;
      element.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: This comprehensive mixed-methods study is designed to accomplish both, measure&#xD;
      the effectiveness of a new prevention bundle against nvHAP and provide insights into how and&#xD;
      why it worked or failed. The results of this study may contribute substantially to patient&#xD;
      safety in the area of a rediscovered healthcare-associated infection - nvHAP.&#xD;

      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this mixed-methods study, we aim to investigate the impact of the implementation of a&#xD;
      newly designed nvHAP prevention bundle on the nvHAP incidence rate among inpatients in our&#xD;
      tertiary care hospital. We will quantify the adherence to the individual bundle elements and&#xD;
      qualitatively identify the factors that influence successful implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the nvHAP bundle effectiveness on the nvHAP incidence rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the adherence the nvHAP bundle and each of the bundle elements&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To relate adherence to nvHAP bundle elements with nvHAP incidence rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To qualitatively monitor changes and identify trends in implementation outcomes&#xD;
           throughout the study periods&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To identify which factors in the implementation setting are associated with the actual&#xD;
           degree of local implementation of the nvHAP bundle&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is conducted at the University Hospital Zurich (UHZ), Switzerland, a 950-bed&#xD;
      tertiary-care teaching hospital covering all medical specialties except paediatrics and&#xD;
      orthopaedics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population consists of all patients hospitalized in nine predefined medical and&#xD;
      surgical departments and their corresponding wards chosen based on the following criteria; 1)&#xD;
      nvHAP rate above the 50th percentile according to UHZ nvHAP data from the year 2017; 2) high&#xD;
      absolute number of patients with nvHAP according to UHZ nvHAP data from the year 2017; 3)&#xD;
      organizational structure, e.g. departments sharing same nursing or medical personnel; 4)&#xD;
      representing both medical and surgical specialties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nvHAP bundle: The University Hospital Zurich nvHAP bundle was designed by an&#xD;
      interprofessional and interdisciplinary group of experts. Elements were chosen based on the&#xD;
      evidence, although scarce, of their effectiveness and based on their anticipated feasibility&#xD;
      and implementability. The bundle consists of five prevention measures (details see Annex&#xD;
      nvHAP Bundle).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Oral care, i.e. mechanical and pharmacological oral care&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identification and treatment of patients with dysphagia, i.e. by applying a 'modified&#xD;
           swallowing assessment' (MSA) adapted from the 'Standardized Swallowing Assessment' by&#xD;
           Perry et al. (15) (Annex 'MSA Perry')&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mobilization, i.e. mobilization at least twice daily&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Stopping unnecessary PPI and antacids&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Respiratory therapy As not all bundle elements apply to all patients, the patients will&#xD;
           first be assessed for indication of the respective prevention measure after admission,&#xD;
           clinical deterioration, and major surgery during hospital stay. The execution of the&#xD;
           bundle element has to be documented in the electronic medical record (EMR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation strategy and formative evaluation: Our implementation strategy is designed to&#xD;
      increase ownership and local adoption in each department by engaging local implementation&#xD;
      teams, who establish department-specific actions based on local needs. This strategy is also&#xD;
      intended to facilitate adaptability, i.e. the degree to which the intervention can be adapted&#xD;
      to meet local needs (16, 17). Based on an initial behavioural analysis informed by&#xD;
      sensitizing frameworks (see below, &quot;Implementation Frameworks&quot;) (16, 18, 19), we identified&#xD;
      the following as promising intervention functions to increase adherence to the nvHAP bundle:&#xD;
      increasing knowledge and understanding about the nvHAP bundle elements through education;&#xD;
      imparting skills through technical training; and changing the physical context to increase&#xD;
      awareness and support performance of nvHAP measures through environmental restructuring.&#xD;
      Whereas these intervention functions to increase adherence to the nvHAP bundle elements make&#xD;
      up the foreseeable core intervention components, each department is encouraged to adapt the&#xD;
      delivery of these components and to employ additional promotional components according to&#xD;
      local context, making up the 'soft periphery' of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local implementation teams, composed of one nurse, one physician and one physiotherapist,&#xD;
      will be established in each department. During recurrent &quot;action plan&quot; meetings, the local&#xD;
      implementation team from each department, with support from the nvHAP study team, will be&#xD;
      responsible for assessing the current implementation status with respect to each bundle&#xD;
      element and establishing an &quot;action plan&quot; with a list of planned actions aimed to increase&#xD;
      adherence to bundle elements according to local needs. Local implementation teams will be&#xD;
      responsible for implementing the nvHAP bundle in their respective departments. Established&#xD;
      &quot;action plans&quot; will be revisited to assess progress and refine necessary actions, as&#xD;
      described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nvHAP study team, based in the infection prevention department, will form a central&#xD;
      coordinating team to provide local teams with support, example training materials, and&#xD;
      feedback on process and outcome data. Additionally, we will employ a formative approach,&#xD;
      during which we aim to continuously identify influences on implementation efforts (e.g.&#xD;
      barriers and facilitators) and feed these insights back to local implementation teams to&#xD;
      optimize the potential for implementation success (20). This formative evaluation will occur&#xD;
      in stages throughout the project, as described by Stetler and colleagues (20) and presented&#xD;
      in Table 1. The formative evaluation will rely primarily on &quot;action plan&quot; meetings as an&#xD;
      opportunity to feed information back to local implementation teams regarding identified&#xD;
      barriers and facilitators to implementation and to refine implementation action plans&#xD;
      accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This mixed methods study collects and analyses quantitative and qualitative data collected&#xD;
      during the three study periods (baseline, implementation, and intervention period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline period will start at the same time for all departments and will be of different&#xD;
      length (minimum 12 months) as implementation of nvHAP prevention measures will occur at the&#xD;
      department level and the start of implementation activities is chosen by every department,&#xD;
      primarily relying on availability of resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We define three study periods on the department level, 1) department baseline period, before&#xD;
      implementation of nvHAP bundle in the specific department; 2) department implementation&#xD;
      period, a two month time frame starting with the beginning of implementation activities in&#xD;
      the respective department; 3) department intervention period following the department&#xD;
      implementation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the hospital level the three periods are defined as follows: 1) hospital baseline period,&#xD;
      before starting implementation in the first department; 2) hospital implementation period,&#xD;
      from the beginning of the implementation period of the first department until end of&#xD;
      implementation period of the last included department; 3) hospital intervention period&#xD;
      following the hospital implementation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation framework:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is theoretically informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research&#xD;
      (CFIR) (16) and the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Both the CFIR and the TDF integrate&#xD;
      findings from theoretical literature into synthesized frameworks consisting of constructs&#xD;
      that may mediate behaviour change. Whereas the TDF domains represent a set of constructs&#xD;
      related to individual behaviour change, the CFIR domains include constructs relating to&#xD;
      broader organizational behaviour change. For the current inquiry, we find the use of both&#xD;
      frameworks useful to capture influencers of behaviour at the individual level, as well as the&#xD;
      department, the overall hospital, and the wider environmental context. The CFIR and the TDF&#xD;
      will inform the intervention implementation strategy, as previously described, and guide the&#xD;
      qualitative data collection (semi-structured interview guides) and analyses (use of TDF as&#xD;
      deductive coding framework). In particular, use of these sensitising frameworks throughout&#xD;
      our study will facilitate the timely identification of barriers and facilitators and will&#xD;
      also provide insights as to which additional intervention components are most likely to be&#xD;
      successful in addressing the identified barriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources: In the study hospital, all patient data are charted electronically via an EMR&#xD;
      system. Selected data are stored in a clinical data warehouse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NvHAP surveillance We apply the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)&#xD;
      definition criteria for pneumonia that are used in the ECDC point prevalence studies (10)&#xD;
      (Annex 'ECDC Definition nvHAP') and a validated semi-automated surveillance system for nvHAP&#xD;
      is used (22). Place of nvHAP acquisition is defined as department, ward and room to which the&#xD;
      patient was affiliated 48h before first symptoms of nvHAP, unless shorter incubation period&#xD;
      was evident from patient history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process indicators:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process indicators portraying adherence to the nvHAP bundle elements will be monitored in two&#xD;
      ways. First, for all five prevention measures, at least one surrogate parameter for adherence&#xD;
      is continuously extracted from the EMR of the total patient population (continuous process&#xD;
      indicators; see Annex 'Process indicators'). This parameter, e.g. toothbrushing provided by&#xD;
      nurses, will be expressed per department, and month, and either hospital days or admissions.&#xD;
      Second, we will monitor process indicators on a sample basis with individual assessment of a&#xD;
      subset of patients at four different time points per department (intermittent process&#xD;
      indicators; see Annex 'Process indicators'). The latter allows a more detailed description of&#xD;
      adherence, including non-documented prevention measures (e.g. oral care executed by patient)&#xD;
      and takes into consideration the individual need of patients for the specific prevention&#xD;
      measure (e.g. respiratory therapy is indicated only in a subset of patients). From the&#xD;
      intermittent process indicators the 'nvHAP adherence score' will assess patient based&#xD;
      adherence per department and time point. The score is based on samples of 50 patients, the&#xD;
      'nvHAP adherence indicator' takes the value 1 in the case the specific prevention measure was&#xD;
      completed in the specific patient, 0 if that was not the case, and &quot;empty&quot; in the case of&#xD;
      missing values. The 'nvHAP adherence score' is calculated by summing up the five proportions&#xD;
      of patients with completed specific prevention measures (i.e. 'nvHAP adherence indicator'=1)&#xD;
      dividing it by factor five (Annex 'nvHAP adherence score').&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longitudinal qualitative data will be collected throughout the project as portrayed in Figure&#xD;
      2, including action plan interviews with local implementation teams, drop-in interviews with&#xD;
      frontline staff, and focus group interviews, as described in Table 2. These three data&#xD;
      collection activities will allow for rigorous triangulation of findings among data sources&#xD;
      and will all inform the ongoing formative evaluation (see Table 1).&#xD;
