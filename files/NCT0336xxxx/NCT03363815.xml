  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a four-part study to evaluate the effect of multiple doses of CC-90001 on the PK,&#xD;
      safety, and tolerability of single doses of omeprazole, midazolam, warfarin, rosuvastatin,&#xD;
      metformin, digoxin, and nintedanib in healthy subjects. Each study part is a nonrandomized,&#xD;
      fixed-sequence, open-label, two-period study. The study parts can be run in any order and can&#xD;
      be, but do not have to be, run in parallel. Subjects may participate in one part only. For&#xD;
      each part, each subject will participate as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening (Days -21 through -2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline phase for each study period (Periods 1 and 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment phase for each study period (Periods 1 and 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up telephone call&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will consist of 4 parts. Each part has two periods. The parts may be conducted in&#xD;
      any order. Subjects may participate in 1 part only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will participate in a screening phase, a baseline phase in each study period, a&#xD;
      treatment phase in each study period and a follow-up telephone call. Subjects will be&#xD;
      screened for eligibility. Eligible subjects will return to the study center on Day -1 of&#xD;
      Period 1 and will remain at the study center until the last day of Period 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1, Single doses of omeprazole, midazolam, warfarin, and vitamin K will be&#xD;
      administered under fasted conditions on Period 1, Day 1. During Period 2, subjects will&#xD;
      receive once daily (QD) doses of CC-90001 from Days 1 through 18. On the day of dosing with&#xD;
      probe drugs, CC-90001 will be dosed following an overnight fast. On all other days, CC-90001&#xD;
      can be dosed without regard to food. On Period 2, Day 14, subjects will also be administered&#xD;
      single doses of omeprazole, midazolam, warfarin, and vitamin K under fasted conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2, A single dose of rosuvastatin will be administered under fasted conditions on&#xD;
      Period 1, Day 1. There will be a washout period of 5 to 10 days between Period 1, Day 1 and&#xD;
      Period 2, Day 1. During Period 2, subjects will receive QD doses of CC-90001 from Days 1&#xD;
      through 6. On the day of dosing with probe drug, CC-90001 will be dosed following an&#xD;
      overnight fast. On all other days, CC 90001 can be dosed without regard to food. On Period 2,&#xD;
      Day 5, subjects will also be administered a single dose of rosuvastatin under fasted&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 3, single doses of metformin and digoxin will be administered under fasted conditions&#xD;
      on Period 1, Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a washout period of 5 to 10 days between Period 1, Day 1 and Period 2, Day 1.&#xD;
      During Period 2, subjects will receive QD doses of CC-90001 from Days 1 through 6. On the day&#xD;
      of dosing with probe drugs, CC-90001 will be dosed following an overnight fast. On all other&#xD;
      days, CC 90001 can be dosed without regard to food. On Period 2, Day 5, subjects will also be&#xD;
      administered single doses of metformin and digoxin under fasted conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 4, a single dose of nintedanib will be administered 30 minutes after the start of a&#xD;
      standard breakfast on Period 1, Day 1. There will be a washout period of 5 to 10 days between&#xD;
      Period 1, Day 1 and Period 2, Day 1. During Period 2, subjects will receive QD doses of&#xD;
      CC-90001 from Days 1 through 14. On the day of dosing with probe drug, CC 90001 will be dosed&#xD;
      30 minutes after the start of a standard breakfast. On all other days, CC 90001 can be dosed&#xD;
      without regard to food. On Period 2, Day 14, subjects will also be administered a single dose&#xD;
      of nintedanib 30 minutes after the start of a standard breakfast.&#xD;
