  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study seeks to obtain preliminary signal of the tolerability and efficacy of&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for depressive symptoms in a sample of&#xD;
      adolescents with depression and epilepsy. Additionally, effects of tDCS will be assessed via&#xD;
      electroencephalographic, cognitive, and psychosocial measures.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been investigated extensively in recent&#xD;
      years for the treatment of depression. Meta-analysis of individual patient data indicates&#xD;
      that tDCS results in improvement in depressive symptoms, with efficacy comparable to&#xD;
      antidepressant medications and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), while&#xD;
      tDCS offers advantages over other treatments, including side effect profile, cost, and&#xD;
      portability. tDCS has been employed to a more limited extent in children and adolescents for&#xD;
      psychiatric conditions other than depression, as well as in both adults and children with&#xD;
      epilepsy, with excellent tolerability and a mild adverse effect profile. The proposed&#xD;
      protocol aims to extend the use of tDCS for treatment of depression in children with epilepsy&#xD;
      (CWE), a population with a very high prevalence of depression and a significant need for&#xD;
      additional treatment options, particularly nonpharmacologic treatments, due to challenges&#xD;
      with the use of antidepressant medications and other non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS)&#xD;
      techniques in CWE.&#xD;
