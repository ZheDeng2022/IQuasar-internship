  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a common neurologic with attacks of headache and associated symptoms such as&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, phono and photophobia. Migraine can lead to substantial functional&#xD;
      impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent evidence suggests that electro stimulation is effective in providing relief for&#xD;
      chronic headaches including migraine. It is tolerable by patients and associated with no&#xD;
      adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device utilizes electro stimulation to achieve conditioned pain modulation (CPM). CPM an&#xD;
      stimulate endogenous analgesic mechanism. The modulatory effect is over the whole body, and&#xD;
      can be induced anywhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, sham controlled multi-center trial. Ratio&#xD;
      between treatment and control groups will be 1:1, stratified by center and use of preventive&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objectives is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the Nerivio Migra&#xD;
      electro stimulation device for the reduction of migraine headache during an attack of&#xD;
      migraine with or without aura.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is intended for subject with 2-8 migraine episodes per month. patients will receive&#xD;
      the device, either an active or a placebo type, and will be asked to use the device at home&#xD;
      or in any location that they will be when the migraine starts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that electro stimulation delivered transcutaneously to the peripheral&#xD;
      nervous system at onset of a migraine attack significantly reduce headache pain demonstrated&#xD;
      by a significant difference between proportions of responders to the active treatment&#xD;
      stimulation in comparison to proportion of responders that will use a placebo device.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Nerivio Migra is intended for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in&#xD;
      patients 18 years of age or older. It is self-applied to the upper arm. Treatments are&#xD;
      self-administered by the user at the onset of a migraine attack. The device delivers extra&#xD;
      cephalic transcutaneous electrical stimulation below the pain threshold to the skin of the&#xD;
      upper arm at the onset of a migraine attack. Nerivio Migra is operated via a mobile&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, sham controlled multi-center clinical trial&#xD;
      to test the ability of the Nerivio Migra neuromodulation device to relieve the patient's&#xD;
      migraine pain during a migraine attack. The study will enroll up to 270 patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with migraine with or without aura, per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. These patients&#xD;
      will be individually and randomly assigned to either treatment group or control group. For&#xD;
      sham control, electrical pulses of similar width and intensity, but much lower frequency&#xD;
      compared to the active device will be administered. This sham program produces pulses that&#xD;
      are perceivable by the user, thus maintaining the blinding, but on the other hand do not have&#xD;
      therapeutic qualities, based on existing knowledge of parameters range of electro stimulation&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. st visit - screening, enrollment and training on the application in diary mode Following&#xD;
           successful screening, enrollment interview and signing of informed consent, participants&#xD;
           will be provided with the Nerivio Migra application (either installed on their own&#xD;
           smartphone, or on a smartphone provided by the study coordinator). The participants will&#xD;
           be trained how to operate the application and report their migraine attacks in the&#xD;
           patient diary mode, which is part of the application. The site personnel will be&#xD;
           required to approve the training session in the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Stage 1 - Roll in phase The Roll-in is a period of 15 - 30 days in which at least two&#xD;
           (2) and no more of eight (8) migraine attacks has been occurred. During this period,&#xD;
           baseline information including mean frequency and severity of migraine attacks,&#xD;
           occurrence of other headaches, presence of ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria for migraine with&#xD;
           or without aura and use of preventive and rescue medications will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. nd visit Following the Roll-in phase, the participants will arrive to the clinic and&#xD;
           their compliance to the study procedures and eligibility to continue to the next phase&#xD;
           will assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants that will be eligible to continue to the treatment phase will undergo the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participant will be randomized into one of the two study group (Active or Sham device)&#xD;
           Investigational devices will be programmed in active or sham mode with a 1:1 ratio, in&#xD;
           order to achieve the desired ratio between active and control groups sizes, stratified&#xD;
           with by use of preventive medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participant will be trained on the device, the application (in diary and treatment&#xD;
           modes), the treatment procedures and the key elements critical for the success of the&#xD;
           study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Apply the Nerivio Migra as soon as possible following the onset of the migraine&#xD;
                symptoms and NO LATER than 60 min from onset&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Refrain from taking any rescue medication 2 hours following the start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Perform the treatment for a period of at least 30 minutes (recommended treatment&#xD;
                time is 45 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 - Parallel arms, double- blind treatment phase. Participants will be instructed to&#xD;
      activate the device at onset of a qualifying migraine attack and manually adjust stimulation&#xD;
      intensity to a level within the pre-defined range, where it is well perceived but not&#xD;
      painful. A qualifying migraine attack shall be preceded by at least 48 hours of freedom from&#xD;
      migraine. Patients will be requested to refrain from use of rescue medications prior to and&#xD;
      during the first two hours after treatment with the device, and if they cannot comply with&#xD;
      this, record their use of rescue medications (migraine specific drugs or other medications or&#xD;
      therapies that may be used to treat pain, from a pre-specified list) in the mobile&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Via the smartphone application, each participant will be asked to rate his/her migraine pain&#xD;
      level three times using Pain Grades Scale (0 - no pain, 1- mild pain, 2- moderate pain, 3 -&#xD;
      severe pain): (1) upon starting the treatment, (2) two hours after start of treatment, (3) 48&#xD;
      hours after start of attack. At the start of each treatment, participants will be also asked&#xD;
      to provide time elapsed from start of migraine symptoms to start of the treatment.&#xD;
      Participants will be also asked to provide feedback regarding their use of medication&#xD;
      (migraine specific drugs or other medications or therapies that may be used to treat pain,&#xD;
      from a pre-specified list), presence of nausea, photophobia, phonophobia or allodynia, and&#xD;
      treatment perception. After providing feedback at two hours after start of treatment and in&#xD;
      case of pain recurrence, participants will be allowed to re-treat the attack using Nerivio&#xD;
      Migra device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3 (optional, by subject request only) - Open label extended treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the completion of double-blind stage of the study, all subjects will be offered a&#xD;
      2-month open label period using the active device.&#xD;

        <time_frame>48 hours post treatment</time_frame>
        <population>12 participants in the active group and 14 participants in the sham group did not report their pain level at 24h post treatment for the &quot;Test&quot; treatment. Thus, the active and sham groups included 87and 89 participants, respectively</population>

            <description>Treatment of acute migraine with an active form of Nerivio migra-1 device&#xD;
Nerivio Migra-1 active device: The device is placed on the subject upper arm. when activated, stimulus is applied to influence the subject's perception of a painful stimulus, delivered (or originating) at a different location. Based on diffused noxious inhibitory control mechanism, sometimes referred to as &quot;pain inhibits pain&quot; principle, conditioned pain modulation evokes an endogenous analgesic mechanism. The modulatory effect is over the whole body, and can be induced anywhere in the body. This approach allows applying the conditioning stimuli away from the painful site.</description>
