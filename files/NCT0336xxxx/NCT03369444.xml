  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe haemophilia B is a bleeding disorder where a protein made by the body to help make&#xD;
      blood clot is either partly or completely missing. This protein is called a clotting factor;&#xD;
      with severe haemophilia B, levels of clotting factor IX (FIX) (nine) are very low and&#xD;
      affected individuals can suffer life threatening bleeding episodes. HB mainly affects boys&#xD;
      and men (normally one in every 30,000 males). Current treatment for HB involves intravenous&#xD;
      infusions of factor IX as regular treatment (Prophylaxis) or 'on demand'. On demand treatment&#xD;
      is highly effective at stopping bleeding but cannot fully reverse long-term damage that&#xD;
      follows after a bleed. Regular treatment can prevent bleeding, however can be invasive for&#xD;
      patients and also expensive. This research study aims to test the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      a gene therapy which produces Factor IX protein in the body. The gene will be given using an&#xD;
      inactivated virus called &quot;the vector&quot; ( FLT180a), in a single infusion. The vector has been&#xD;
      developed from a virus known as an adeno- associated virus, that has been changed so that it&#xD;
      is unable to cause a viral infection in humans. This &quot;inactivated&quot; virus is further altered&#xD;
      to carry the Factor IX gene and to make its way within liver cells where Factor IX protein is&#xD;
      normally made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to three different doses cohorts of FLT180a will be tested, in up to 24 patients with&#xD;
      severe haemophilia B. Patients will be recruited from haemophilia centres in the EU and US.&#xD;
      Patients will be in the trial for approximately 40 weeks and will undergo procedures&#xD;
      including physical examinations, bloods tests, ECGs and liver ultrasounds.&#xD;
