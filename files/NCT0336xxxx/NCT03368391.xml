    <textblock>
      Anesthetics with vasoconstrictors decrease pulpal blood flow but the impact of intranasal&#xD;
      local anesthetics on blood flow is unknown. This blinded, randomized crossover clinical trial&#xD;
      will compare the effects of different local anesthetics on anterior teeth in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. On separate study visits patients will receive either traditional injections or&#xD;
      intranasal administration of the following solutions: 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epi, 3%&#xD;
      mepivacaine, tetracaine HCl and oxymetazoline HCl, or saline. The following variables will be&#xD;
      assessed: pulpal blood flow, pulpal sensibility, pain on administration, and adverse&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

      Informed Consent Prior to screening, informed consent will be obtained from subjects by study&#xD;
      personnel. All questions pertaining to the study will be addressed and answered prior to the&#xD;
      participants' agreement to voluntarily partake. The informed consent explicitly states that&#xD;
      participation, failure to participate, or withdrawal from the study will not impact the&#xD;
      employment or educational standing or any student or employee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are screened, selected, provided informed consent, and partake in the 6-week&#xD;
      study will be compensated for their time commitment will receive a total of $100.00. They&#xD;
      will receive $25 for the screening/impression visit if accepted and $25 for each of the&#xD;
      additional 3 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Medications&#xD;
&#xD;
      2% Lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine is the most commonly used local anesthetic in&#xD;
      dentistry. It is associated in with a very small increase in blood pressure and heart rate&#xD;
      due to the vasoconstrictor which is clinically insignificant in healthy adults. Reports of&#xD;
      true allergy in the literature are very rare in a drug that has been administered millions a&#xD;
      times a year for decades. This drug is associated with transient blood flow reduction to the&#xD;
      pulp which is inconsequential to a healthy dental pulp but may have an impact on a tooth that&#xD;
      has sustained dental injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3% mepivacaine is another commonly used local anesthetic. It has less inherent vasodilating&#xD;
      properties than other local anesthetics and can be used without a vasoconstrictor. This drug&#xD;
      has been shown to have a reduced impact on pulpal blood flow. However, 3% mepivacaine has a&#xD;
      much shorter duration of action due to the lack of vasoconstrictor and may be of inadequate&#xD;
      duration to manage a dental trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kovanaze is an intranasal local anesthetic that has been FDA approved for use. It is&#xD;
      comprised of the local anesthetic tetracaine HCl and oxymetazoline which is the primary&#xD;
      ingredient in the drug Afrin. It has been approved for children over 40 kg and adults of all&#xD;
      ages. The impact of Kovanaze is unknown but it would be expected to have no impact on blood&#xD;
      flow as it is administered in an area distant from the blood vessels that supply teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saline will be administered as a placebo at each study visit so participants only receive one&#xD;
      study drug per session. It will be administered either intranasally or as an injection as the&#xD;
      protocol dictates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kovanaze速 dose syringes will be stored according to manufacturer's label in refrigeration.&#xD;
      Injectable anesthetics, in vials, will be stored according to manufacturer's labels. All&#xD;
      disposals will comply with manufacturer's labels and meet requirements of those laid out by&#xD;
      federal and state regulations. All three drugs are FDA approved for anesthesia of anterior&#xD;
      teeth. No drug is contraindicated under any procedural circumstance including trauma at this&#xD;
      time and can each be interpreted as fulfilling the standard of care for local anesthesia to&#xD;
      manage a traumatic injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group Assignment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects accepted into the study will be randomized into three different groups that will&#xD;
      determine the order medications are administered using a random number generator. All groups&#xD;
      will be exposed to all three study medications distributed over 3 sessions. Each subject will&#xD;
      serve as their own control. There will be a minimum of a one week washout period between&#xD;
      study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each clinical visit, participants will receive a 3.0ml buccal infiltration of anesthetic&#xD;
      (lidocaine or mepivicaine) or placebo, 0.5ml palatal infiltration of anesthetic (lidocaine or&#xD;
      mepivicaine) or placebo, and 0.4ml (2 sprays, 0.4ml of Kovanaze) or saline placebo in right&#xD;
      nostril. Buccal and palatal infiltrations will be administered by same operator over a one&#xD;
      minute time period. Buccal infiltrations will be administered in labial vestibule above&#xD;
      apices of teeth #7 and #8. Palatal infiltration will be administered in attached keratinized&#xD;
      gingiva near apices of teeth #7 and #8. Each anesthetic syringe will be labeled accordingly&#xD;
      to correspond to material used. The dentist that gives the medicine will know which medicine&#xD;
      is being given but the dentist that later tests the teeth will not know so that bias is&#xD;
      avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Individual Sensor Holder&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary determinant of blood flow will be measured by use of noninvasive, objective laser&#xD;
      doppler flowmetry. In order to ensure the laser sensor tip is placed on the same location at&#xD;
      each visit a custom holder from dental putty will be fabricated. This is a standard procedure&#xD;
      in dentistry and involves placing a malleable material on the teeth. This material sets to a&#xD;
      rubbery consistency in a matter of minutes and will allow the study team to adapt the holder&#xD;
      for both the laser doppler tip as well as the pulp tester tip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pulp tester is a simple instrument, commonly used in daily practice to measure pulp&#xD;
      sensitivity. See further explanation below. The screening appointment and fabrication of the&#xD;
      sensor holder should not take more than 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Data Gathering&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to any intervention baseline data will be gathered from each patient. An objective&#xD;
      measure of blood flow to the teeth with be gathered by noninvasive laser doppler flowmetry&#xD;
      which requires placement of a probe on the front of the tooth with the assistance of the&#xD;
      custom fabricated holder. Doppler is emerging as the gold standard for assessing pulpal blood&#xD;
      flow in research but its exorbitant expense prohibits its widespread use in clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy and duration of the local anesthesia will be subjectively tested through&#xD;
      Electric Pulp Testing or EPT. Electric pulp testing tests the sensibility of dental nerves to&#xD;
      an electric current and is one of the most commonly used pulp testing modalities due to its&#xD;
      lack of harm to the dental pulp, reasonable cost, widespread availability, and acceptability&#xD;
      by patients. Every 4 seconds a slight increase in electricity is added until the subject can&#xD;
      feel the electricity. Once any sensation is perceived, testing is discontinued and this value&#xD;
      is recorded. Patients hold the testing probe to provide grounding and they are told to let go&#xD;
      of the probe when they feel sensation precluding any further sensation. This avoids the risk&#xD;
      of injury or pain associated with electric pulp testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both of these procedures a plastic, non-latex rubber dam or barrier is placed to prevent&#xD;
      interference from the gingiva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each testing visit is expected to last no more than 1.5 hours. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      lay in supine position for 10 minutes prior to initiation of testing. To obtund the sensation&#xD;
      associated with an injection, 20% benzocaine topical 3min prior to delivery of anesthesia as&#xD;
      is the standard in clinical dentistry and trauma management. 2.5 mL of 2% Lidocaine with&#xD;
      1:100,000 epi and 3% Mepivacaine by injection. 0.4 mL of Kovanaze will be administered&#xD;
      intranasally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser Doppler Flowmetry readings will be taken at 7, 12, 17, 32, 47, and 62 minutes after&#xD;
      administration of anesthetics. Electronic Pulp Testing will be performed at 5, 10, 15, 30,&#xD;
      45, and 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective data, pertaining to pain and comfort with procedure, will be collected using&#xD;
      questionnaire. Following delivery of anesthetic or placebo a Heft-Parker Visual Analogue&#xD;
      Scale will be utilized to assess pain associated with injection and nasal spray. Patients&#xD;
      will be monitored for adverse reactions during the clinical procedure and although rare, most&#xD;
      adverse reactions related to local anesthesia are acute. The testing visits should last no&#xD;
      more than 90 minutes each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon discharge patients will be reminded to call the emergency contact and seek emergency&#xD;
      medical care for major adverse events. This is unexpected as no major adverse events have&#xD;
      been recorded with Kovanaze and are not encountered in daily use of lidocaine or mepivacaine.&#xD;
      Participants will also be given the take home questionnaire and asked to deliver it to the&#xD;
      student researcher. The following will be addressed in the take home questionnaire:&#xD;
      Heft-Parker Visual Analogue Scale for pain (1 hour after, 4 hours after, 24 hours after),&#xD;
      minor adverse events, and a Likert response scale of patient satisfaction. The questionnaire&#xD;
      takes 5 minutes to take for a total of 15 minutes of questionnaire for each testing visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be reported to the IRB, LSUHSC, and the Louisiana State Board of&#xD;
      Dentistry as required by statute. Compensation for injuries will not be provided by study&#xD;
      personnel if an adverse reaction has occurred. Participants will be asked to provide a&#xD;
      contact in case of emergency prior to commencement of testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected and interpreted from the research study will be only available to those who&#xD;
      are a part of the research team. Participants information that is collected during the&#xD;
      project will be kept confidential. Participants will be designated a identification number,&#xD;
      rather than name. Only the principal investigator and research member designated to the&#xD;
      current study will be able to obtain the information gathered by participants identification&#xD;
      number. After testing, data collection, documentation of results, and manuscript formulation,&#xD;
      all information, including participant identification number, will be safely locked in filing&#xD;
      cabinet and/or stored on an encrypted password protected computer, in a secure location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference between baseline and experimental values for doppler flowmetry and EPT will be&#xD;
      determined and analyzed for each study medication. The means and standard deviations will be&#xD;
      plotted and used in statistical measurements for significance. Data will be analyzed using&#xD;
      ANOVA and Tukey's method for group comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes for the Heft Parker Visual Analogue Scale for pain and the Likert Scale for patient&#xD;
      satisfaction will be analyzed using Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests. Reports of adverse events will&#xD;
      be categorized and reported using descriptive statistics.&#xD;
