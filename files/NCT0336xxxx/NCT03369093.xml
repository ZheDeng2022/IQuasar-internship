  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Burden: Pneumonia remains the leading infectious cause of death accounting for 920,000&#xD;
      children under five around the world. This means a loss of over 2,500 child lives every day,&#xD;
      or over 100 every hour. Since 2000, the number of child deaths caused by pneumonia has&#xD;
      decreased by 47 percent. The tremendous progress made is due in part to the rapid roll-out of&#xD;
      vaccines, better nutrition, and improved care-seeking and treatment for symptoms. However,&#xD;
      pneumonia hasn't declined as quickly as other diseases such as malaria (58%), HIV/AIDS (61%),&#xD;
      and measles (85%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge gap: The Lancet Series on Childhood Pneumonia and Diarrhea has reported that case&#xD;
      management is one of the three most effective interventions to reduce pneumonia deaths in&#xD;
      children. It is also noted that the cost-effectiveness of these interventions in the national&#xD;
      health system needs urgent assessment. It was suggested to find out means to reduce hospital&#xD;
      stay without compromising the quality of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: The main purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy of two doses of&#xD;
      parenteral Amoxicillin plus single-dose Gentamicin compared to four doses of parenteral&#xD;
      Ampicillin plus single-dose Gentamicin. After 72 hours of treatment injectable Amoxicillin or&#xD;
      injection Ampicillin will be switched to or replaced by oral Amoxicillin and will be&#xD;
      discharged with an advice to attend to Ambulatory Care Unit (ACU) to receive a once-daily&#xD;
      dose of injection Gentamicin for a total of 5 days. It is anticipated that this modified&#xD;
      therapy will reduce the hospitalization stay of children with severe pneumonia and would&#xD;
      therefore be relevant in countries with the resource-poor settings. By reducing the&#xD;
      hospitalization period, this therapy has the potentials to reduce hospital-acquired&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis (if any): Rate of treatment failure with two doses of injectable Amoxicillin plus&#xD;
      single-dose Gentamicin will be no more than that of four doses of injectable Ampicillin plus&#xD;
      single-dose Gentamicin in the management of children between 2 months to 59 months&#xD;
      hospitalized for WHO classified severe pneumonia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe pneumonia is a serious infection in children which requires timely intervention.&#xD;
      Management of severe pneumonia is done by appropriate antibiotics and supportive care. WHO&#xD;
      recommendation is to use injection ampicillin four times a day for 3-5 days and injection&#xD;
      gentamicin once a day for 3-5 days in children with severe pneumonia. In the study, the&#xD;
      investigators want to compare the response of injection ampicillin with another similar and&#xD;
      equally effective antibiotic (amoxicillin). The reason for choosing amoxicillin is that the&#xD;
      dose is two times a day and it is cost-effective and reduces chances of nosocomial infection.&#xD;
      The response of the drugs will be compared by the time difference of clinical improvement of&#xD;
      the patients or time difference of disappearance of the sign and symptoms on admission. The&#xD;
      investigators are interested to compare the recovery time from the illness as well as&#xD;
      treatment failure in both groups. In that way, the investigators will be able to develop a&#xD;
      better treatment for pneumonia in children in low-cost settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be an open-label, randomized, controlled intervention in children between two&#xD;
      months to 59 months admitted to Dhaka Hospital of icddr,b. Investigators will use sealed&#xD;
      envelopes to randomly assign the children to either treatment arm. In the first arm children&#xD;
      will receive 2 daily doses of parenteral Amoxicillin and a single daily dose of parenteral&#xD;
      Gentamicin; and in 2nd arm, children will receive 4 daily doses of parenteral Ampicillin and&#xD;
      a single daily dose of parenteral Gentamicin. After 72 hours of treatment, injection&#xD;
      Amoxicillin and injection Ampicillin will be replaced with oral Amoxicillin but injection&#xD;
      gentamicin will be continued for a total of 5 days in one daily dose. During this time&#xD;
      participants will be suggested to discharge from the hospital and attain to the Ambulatory&#xD;
      care unit for getting a once-daily dose of injection of Gentamicin. Both the treatment arm&#xD;
      will continue for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period, participants in both study arms will also receive standardized&#xD;
      hospital management for other co-morbidities-such as diarrhea, malnutrition, and any other&#xD;
      complications. Hypoxia will be managed by B-CPAP through a nasal cannula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any participants will be declared &quot;Treatment failure&quot; who show the persistence of danger&#xD;
      signs after 48 hours or develop new danger signs within 24 hours of initiation of antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment. If a participant needs mechanical ventilation, dies at any time during a hospital&#xD;
      stay, or left the hospital against medical advice will be also declared as a treatment&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants from either study group who develops the features of &quot;treatment failure&quot; should&#xD;
      be rescued with the second-line antibiotic regimen, which is injection ceftriaxone and&#xD;
      injection levofloxacin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of the children with severe pneumonia The following parameters should be routinely&#xD;
      monitored in every child with severe pneumonia. Special attention should be given to&#xD;
      participants receiving I/V fluid therapy and those with SAM. Such as: Heart rate, respiratory&#xD;
      rate, temperature, respiratory pattern including chest recession, lower chest wall indrawing,&#xD;
      use of accessory muscles, the establishment of oral feeding, liver size, oxygen saturation&#xD;
      level, chest auscultation: (rales, rhonchi, bilateral basal crepitation, pleural rub), fluid&#xD;
      and calorie intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants on oxygen therapy should have at least 3-4 hourly observations of all the above&#xD;
      parameters and participants without getting oxygen should be observed at least 2 hourly by&#xD;
      the study nurses. All the patients should be evaluated by the physicians at least 12 hourly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signs of Improvement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In absence of complications, within 2 days of initiation of treatment, there should be signs&#xD;
      of improvement i ) breathing rate within normal limit; ii) absence of the lower chest wall&#xD;
      in-drawing; iii) less to no fever; iv) improved ability to eat and drink, and v) better&#xD;
      oxygen saturation without assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discharge criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respiratory distress has resolved&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxygen saturation &gt; 90%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feeding well&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Able to take oral medication or have completed a course of parenteral antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The parents understand the signs of pneumonia, risk factors, and when to return&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objective is to compare the efficacy of two doses of injectable Amoxicillin plus&#xD;
      single-dose injectable Gentamicin compared to four doses of injectable Ampicillin plus&#xD;
      single-dose injectable Gentamicin in the management of participants hospitalized with WHO&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to compare time to resolution of danger signs of pneumonia, length&#xD;
      of hospital stay, mortality rate, rate of complication requiring mechanical ventilation, and&#xD;
      rate of multiorgan or renal or cardiac failure between the two treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children more than 2 months to less than 59 months will be enrolled in the study, if&#xD;
      participants have a history of cough or difficulty in breathing and WHO classified severe&#xD;
      pneumonia plus at least two of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Central cyanosis or oxygen saturation &lt;90% on pulse oxymetry ii) Severe respiratory&#xD;
      distress (e.g. grunting, very severe chest indrawing) iii) Signs of pneumonia with a general&#xD;
      danger sign: inability to breastfeed or drink; lethargy or reduced level of consciousness;&#xD;
      convulsion iv) In addition, some or all of the other signs of pneumonia may be present, such&#xD;
      as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signs of pneumonia [age specific fast breathing( Annex 1)]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest indrawing: lower chest wall indrawing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest auscultation signs: (any one)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Decreased breath sounds&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Bronchial breath sounds&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Crackles&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Abnormal vocal resonance (decreased over a pleural effusion or empyema, increased&#xD;
                over lobar consolidation)&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Pleural rub&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with a life-threatening condition that required immediately assisted ventilation&#xD;
      or referring to an outside hospital (such as septic shock, cardiac arrest, apnea, respiratory&#xD;
      failure, etc.) will be excluded from the study. Children with uncorrected cyanotic CHD,&#xD;
      hypercapnia (PCO2 &gt; 60mm of Hg), status asthmaticus and upper-airway obstruction, preterm&#xD;
      baby (but not ex-preterm), and those for who inform consent can't be secured from their&#xD;
      parents/ care-givers. Caregivers presented with any drug container of antibiotics or&#xD;
      prescription showing getting antibiotics will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      [For two-sample comparison of proportion (non-inferiority)]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis: p2-p1≤ δ (inferior), where: pi (entered in command) is the overall&#xD;
      proportion of participants expect to experience the outcome of the treatments are&#xD;
      non-inferior, and delta is the smallest change in proportions between groups (p2 - p1) which&#xD;
      would still be clinically important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      power = 0.8; alpha = 0.025 (one-sided); pi = 0.50; delta = 0.16 Estimated required sample&#xD;
      size (per group) = 154,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total sample is 308&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted at the Dhaka Hospital of icddr,b, Dhaka, Bangladesh. This&#xD;
      hospital is located in Dhaka city, the capital of Bangladesh. It provides care and treatment&#xD;
      to around 110,000 diarrheal patients with or without associated complications and with or&#xD;
      without other health problems each year. The vast majority of the patients come from poor&#xD;
      socio-economic backgrounds from urban and peri-urban Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients attending this hospital are first assessed by an experienced triage nurse, which&#xD;
      includes assessment of the type of diarrhea and degree of dehydration, and presence of other&#xD;
      health problems including ALRI/ pneumonia, severe malnutrition, impaired mental status&#xD;
      (convulsion), and sepsis. The non-diarrhoeal patients have been redirected to other&#xD;
      appropriate hospitals in the city. Based on an assessment of diarrhoeal patients, those with&#xD;
      uncomplicated illness without signs of dehydration are referred to the Out-Patient Department&#xD;
      (OPD) for 4-5 hours of observation, maintenance of hydration using ORS solution, and for&#xD;
      provision of health education to the mothers/caregivers. Those with some and severe&#xD;
      dehydration but without any associated health problems are admitted to Short Stay Ward (SSW)&#xD;
      for correction of dehydration and maintenance of hydration using ORS and/or intravenous&#xD;
      fluids, provision of antimicrobial therapy as appropriate, with an average stay of 24 hours.&#xD;
      Those with associated complications of diarrhea and/or associated health problems are&#xD;
      referred to a physician for assessing the need for admission to either the Longer Stay Ward&#xD;
      (LSW) or Acute Respiratory Ward (ARI) or to the Intensive Care Word (ICU) depending on the&#xD;
      clinical severity. The usual associated conditions include difficult respiration, cyanosis,&#xD;
      apnoea, hypothermia or hyperthermia, marked lethargy or comatose condition, poor peripheral&#xD;
      perfusion not attributable to severe dehydration. Participants hospitalized in SSW are&#xD;
      assessed by hospital clinicians for possible admission to LSW and further workup and&#xD;
      management. After admission to the LSW/ARI/SCU, the attending physician will obtain medical&#xD;
      history, performs a thorough clinical examination, makes a problem list including&#xD;
      differential diagnoses for each of them, arranges for required laboratory workups, and&#xD;
      develops the treatment plan following standard guidelines of the hospital. Investigators will&#xD;
      also perform bedside procedures such as sampling blood, performing lumbar punctures, etc.&#xD;
      Oxygen saturation is determined by pulse oximeter when necessary, and blood glucose estimated&#xD;
      by bedside Gluco Check machine in nearly all patients admitted to the LSW/ARI /SCU.&#xD;
