  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While the standardization of treatment protocols for Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) has&#xD;
      helped to reduce historically high mortality, mortality in inpatient settings remains&#xD;
      substantial, likely due to the severity of complications associated with late presentation&#xD;
      and health-care associated infection (HCAI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to serve as an important stand-alone description to inform the&#xD;
      understanding of the magnitude of the problem and help guide implementation of measures to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of nosocomial infection and multi-drug resistance.&#xD;

      This study is designed as a cross-sectional, non-randomized, two-site, four-phase study: an&#xD;
      initial baseline period, two intervention periods, and a final interruption period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a descriptive study to collect information on the risk of HCAIs in the MSF-supported&#xD;
      inpatient nutritional treatment centers. Information on key clinical indicators will be&#xD;
      collected regularly according to the routine program procedures from the time of admission to&#xD;
      discharge. All children will undergo a blood draw for culture at time of admission and at the&#xD;
      time of any suspected hospital-acquired bloodstream infection. As part of active surveillance&#xD;
      for bacterial colonization, including multi-drug resistant organisms, all children will&#xD;
      undergo nasal and rectal swabs at the time of admission, suspected infection, and discharge.&#xD;
      Data will provide an estimate of nosocomial infection incidence under routine circumstances&#xD;
      and inform sample size calculations if further study is warranted.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The initial 8-month baseline period will be used to collect data on the evaluation criteria of interest prior to the administration of any intervention of the study and will develop appropriate pedagogical tools to support the uptake of each cleaning strategy during subsequent intervention periods. After the reference period, a one-month introductory period will allow the organization of the first intervention at each site (ie - a soap and water cleansing administered by the carers in a structure or - a cleaning HCG administered by caregivers in the other facility) followed by eight months of active follow-up of the study with the first intervention. Following the eight months of active follow-up with the first intervention, there will be a crossover with an introductory period of one month and eight months of active follow-up with the other intervention. A final period of interruption will occur during the last eight months of the study.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>To determine whether, when accompanied by the caregiver, children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM), daily cleaning with wipes containing 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (HCG) reduces the incidence of nosocomial bacteremia suspected and / or confirmed by the laboratory compared to baseline data and compared to daily soap and water cleanup administered by the caregiver.</description>
