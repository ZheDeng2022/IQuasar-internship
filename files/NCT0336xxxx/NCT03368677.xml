  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Multiple Sclerosis (MS), plaques in the white and grey matter of the brain represent the&#xD;
      best known pathological changes of the disease, but a significant inflammation process has&#xD;
      also been detected outside these plaques in connection with the disease. This extensive,&#xD;
      diffuse inflammatory process correlates with the progression of the disease, measured by EDSS&#xD;
      score (Expanded Disability Status Scale status) and reduction in patients' cognitive level.&#xD;
      According to neuropathological research, the diffuse inflammatory process outside the plaques&#xD;
      is connected with powerful activation of microglia, oxidative stress, and deficiencies in&#xD;
      mitochondrial activity. The activation of microglial cells can be measured in vivo in&#xD;
      patients using positron-emission tomography (PET) scanning and so-called TSPO radioligands,&#xD;
      such as the 11C-PK11195 radioligand. 11C-PK11195 radioligand binds to TSPO molecules, which&#xD;
      manifest on the surface of activated, but not un-activated, microglia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teriflunomide treatment is expected to slow down the process of increasing microglial&#xD;
      activation. TSPO-PET imaging allows in vivo follow-up of the pathogenic process associated&#xD;
      with the gradual MS disease evolution, and allows to evaluate whether teriflunomide treatment&#xD;
      has an effect on disease progression-related pathology.&#xD;

        The research will recruit MS patients who are using teriflunomide treatment and are&#xD;
        followed-up at the Neurology Outpatient Clinic at the Turku University Hospital. The study&#xD;
        will not interfere with the initiation or dosage of the medication in any manner. The&#xD;
        patient's treating neurologist will select the most suitable medication on the basis of the&#xD;
        patient's clinical status, and patients using teriflunomide medication will be offered the&#xD;
        option to participate in this imaging research.&#xD;
