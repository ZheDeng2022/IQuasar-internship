  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is open to adults with hypoparathyroidism who complete the SHP634-101 study&#xD;
      (PARALLAX Study). The purpose of this study is to see if rhPTH(1-84) is safe and effective in&#xD;
      adults with hypoparathyroidism who previously participated in the SHP634-101 study. All&#xD;
      participants enrolled in this study will receive rhPTH(1-84) once-daily for 52 weeks via an&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who complete the SHP634-101 study will have the option to screen for this extension&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be related to investigational product or not) that at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital abnormality/birth defect, and is an important medical event. TEAEs were defined as AEs with a start date on or after the first dose of investigational product or a start date before the date of the first dose of investigational product that increased in severity or after the date of the first dose.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive rhPTH(1-84) subcutaneous (SC) injection in the thigh (alternate thigh every day) once daily (QD) of an escalating dose from 50 microgram (mcg) to a maximum of 100 mcg increased in increments of 25 mcg no more frequently than every 2 to 4 weeks, with the goal of achieving or maintaining albumin-corrected serum calcium (ACSC) levels in the range of 2-2.25 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) (8.0-9.0 milligrams per deciliter [mg/dL]). Once a participant achieves a stable ACSC (2-2.25 mmol/L [8.0-9.0mg/dL]) and has minimized supplement doses, they will be maintained at that dose of rhPTH(1-84). If ACSC is greater than (&gt;) 2.25 mmol/L (&gt;9.0 mg/dL), a starting dose of 25 mcg will be administered.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Participants with hypoparathyroidism (HPT) who completed SHP634-101 (NCT02781844) study were eligible and enrolled in this extension study which was conducted at 10 sites in the United States, Denmark, Hungary and Canada between 26 September 2018 (first participant first visit) and 14 April 2020 (last participant last visit).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 22 participants were enrolled and treated in the study, of which 14 participants completed the study.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>rhPTH(1-84)</title>
          <description>Participants received recombinant human parathyroid hormone (rhPTH) (1-84) (Natpara) 50 microgram (mcg), injection, subcutaneously, once daily in the thigh (alternate thigh every day) up to 52 weeks (end of treatment [EOT])/ early termination (ET). Dose escalation was done up to 100 mcg in increments of 25 mcg no more frequently than every 2 to 4 weeks, with the goal of achieving or maintaining albumin-corrected serum calcium (ACSC) levels in the range of 2-2.25 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) (8-9 milligrams per deciliter [mg/dL]). Administered dose was maintained once a participant achieved a stable ACSC level of 2-2.25 mmol/L (8-9 mg/dL) and had minimized supplement (active vitamin D and calcium supplement) doses. If ACSC was greater than (&gt;) 2.25 mmol/L (&gt;9.0 mg/dL), a starting dose of 25 mcg was administered.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious TEAEs</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be related to investigational product or not) that at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital abnormality/birth defect, and is an important medical event. TEAEs were defined as AEs with a start date on or after the first dose of investigational product or a start date before the date of the first dose of investigational product that increased in severity or after the date of the first dose.</description>

Administered dose was maintained once a participant achieved a stable ACSC level of 2-2.25 mmol/L (8-9 mg/dL) and had minimized supplement (active vitamin D and calcium supplement) doses. If ACSC was &gt;2.25 mmol/L (&gt;9.0 mg/dL), a starting dose of 25 mcg was administered.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious TEAEs</title>
          <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be related to investigational product or not) that at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital abnormality/birth defect, and is an important medical event. TEAEs were defined as AEs with a start date on or after the first dose of investigational product or a start date before the date of the first dose of investigational product that increased in severity or after the date of the first dose.</description>

            <description>Participants received rhPTH(1-84) (Natpara) 50 mcg, injection, subcutaneously, once daily in the thigh (alternate thigh every day) up to 52 weeks (EOT])/ET). Dose escalation was done up to 100 mcg in increments of 25 mcg no more frequently than every 2 to 4 weeks, with the goal of achieving or maintaining ACSC levels in the range of 2-2.25 mmol/L (8-9 mg/dL). Administered dose was maintained once a participant achieved a stable ACSC level of 2-2.25 mmol/L (8-9 mg/dL) and had minimized supplement (active vitamin D and calcium supplement) doses. If ACSC was &gt;2.25 mmol/L (&gt;9.0 mg/dL), a starting dose of 25 mcg was administered.</description>
