  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a group of diseases including both the heart and blood&#xD;
      vessels, thereby including coronary heart disease (CHD). To date, diabetics have a higher&#xD;
      incidence and prevalence of multivessels CHD. Treatments in multivessels CHD in diabetics&#xD;
      include full medical anti ischemic therapy, and revascularization therapy (Percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention (PCI) and/or Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)). Randomized trials&#xD;
      comparing multivessel PCI to CABG have consistently demonstrated the superiority of CABG in&#xD;
      reducing mortality, myocardial infarctions and need for repeat revascularizations. After the&#xD;
      CABG treatment, diabetics vs. non-diabetics evidenced a worse prognosis, and an increased&#xD;
      mortality. Numerous molecular, epigenetics (as microRNAs), and other metabolic risk factors&#xD;
      may condition the worse prognosis in diabetics vs. non diabetics after CABG. In this context,&#xD;
      an increased epicardial fat tissue thickness may be independently associated with the&#xD;
      prevalence of diabetes, and diabetics have an higher epicardial fat tissue thickness,&#xD;
      volumetry, and enhanced metabolism. Therefore, after CABG, lifestyle and medical improvements&#xD;
      may lead to the reduction of epicardial fat thickness, extension, and metabolism in both&#xD;
      non-diabetics, and diabetics, ameliorating the prognosis. At moment, epicardial tissue&#xD;
      function in diabetics is not well investigated in literature, and no data has been reported&#xD;
      about new hypoglycemic drugs, and its pleiotropic effects on diabetics after CABG. Indeed,&#xD;
      our study hypothesis was that, epicardial fat tissue dimension, and metabolic activity may be&#xD;
      related to a different expression of inflammatory, oxidative, and apoptotics molecules, and&#xD;
      epigenetic effectors in diabetics vs. non-diabetics. Secondary, these effectors, and&#xD;
      epicardial tissue dimension and activity, may be controlled, after CABG, by incretin&#xD;
      treatment in diabetics. Therefore, incretin therapy may be associated to the reduction in&#xD;
      epicardial fat tissue thickness, and extension, with down regulation of different&#xD;
      inflammatory, oxidative and apoptotics molecules, and epigenetic effectors involved in&#xD;
      epicardial fat metabolism. Moreover, in this study authors will evaluate in diabetics vs. non&#xD;
      diabetics, and in diabetic incretin-users vs. never.-incretin-users, all cause mortality,&#xD;
      cardiac mortality, and Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) after CABG in diabetics vs. non&#xD;
      diabetics, and diabetic incretin-users (6 months of incretin therapy) vs. diabetic&#xD;
      never-incretin-users. Authors will correlate these clinical endpoints to the study of the&#xD;
      epicardial fat anatomy and metabolism before and after CABG, and to circulating inflammatory&#xD;
      and pro-apoptotic markers, epigenetic effectors, and stem cells in diabetics vs. non&#xD;
      diabetics, and diabetic incretin-users (6 months of incretin therapy) vs. diabetic&#xD;
      never-incretin-users.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a group of diseases that include both the heart and blood&#xD;
      vessels, thereby including coronary heart disease (CHD) and coronary artery disease (CAD),&#xD;
      and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) among several other conditions. CHD causes about one-third&#xD;
      of all deaths in people older than 35 years. Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is independently&#xD;
      associated with a 2 to 4-fold increased mortality risk from heart disease, and with an&#xD;
      increased mortality after myocardial infarction (MI), and worse overall prognosis with CAD.&#xD;
      To date, DM patients have a higher incidence and prevalence of multivessels CAD. Treatments&#xD;
      in multivessels CAD diabetics include full medical anti ischemic therapy (antiplatelets&#xD;
      drugs, beta blockers, anti-remodelling drugs, anti-diabetic drugs etc), and revascularization&#xD;
      therapy (Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and/or Coronary artery bypass grafting&#xD;
      (CABG)). Randomized trials comparing multivessel PCI to coronary artery bypass grafting&#xD;
      (CABG) have consistently demonstrated the superiority of CABG in reducing mortality,&#xD;
      myocardial infarctions and need for repeat revascularizations. After the CABG treatment,&#xD;
      diabetics vs. non-diabetics evidenced a worse prognosis, and an increased mortality at follow&#xD;
      up. The causes of the worse prognosis after CABG in diabetics are not well known, and&#xD;
      under-investigated. Authors may speculate that, numerous molecular, epigenetics (as&#xD;
      microRNAs), and other metabolic risk factors may condition the worse prognosis in diabetics&#xD;
      vs. non diabetics after CABG. In this context, recently authors investigated the impact of&#xD;
      epicardial adipose fat tissue dimension and metabolism on cardiovascular clinical outcomes.&#xD;
      Intriguingly, an increased epicardial fat tissue thickness may be independently associated&#xD;
      with the prevalence of diabetes. Consequently, diabetics have an higher epicardial fat tissue&#xD;
      thickness, volumetry, and enhanced metabolism. Therefore, authors may speculate that,&#xD;
      epicardial fat tissue may work as a metabolically active tissue, by a direct action on the&#xD;
      heart, and by a cross talking with various metabolic derangements in the body leading to&#xD;
      insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      Moreover, after CABG, lifestyle and medical improvements may lead to the reduction of&#xD;
      epicardial fat thickness, extension, and metabolism in both non-diabetics, and diabetics.&#xD;
      Therefore, a part of the lifestyle modifications, also the hypoglycemic drugs therapy may&#xD;
      lead to modification of epicardial fat tissue. However, authors may speculate that, the&#xD;
      epicardial fat tissue thickness, volumetry, and metabolism, probably due to inflammatory and&#xD;
      oxidative molecules activity, and epigenetic and anti-apoptotic pathways (as Sirtuins&#xD;
      expression), may lead to a balance between epicardial fat tissue growth and/or reduction, and&#xD;
      then all these pathways may be consequently involved in the prognosis of diabetics vs. non&#xD;
      diabetics patients after CABG. At moment, all these pathways remain not well investigated in&#xD;
      literature, and no data has been reported about new hypoglycemic drugs, and its pleiotropic&#xD;
      effects on diabetics after CABG. Indeed, authors study hypothesis was that, epicardial fat&#xD;
      tissue dimension, and metabolic activity may be related to a different expression of&#xD;
      inflammatory, oxidative, and apoptotics molecules, and epigenetic effectors in diabetics vs.&#xD;
      non-diabetics. Secondary, these effectors, and epicardial tissue dimension and activity, may&#xD;
      be controlled, after CABG, by incretin treatment in diabetics. Moreover, higher epicardial&#xD;
      fat tissue thickness, and tissue extension, may be associated with worse prognosis in&#xD;
      diabetics after CABG. Secondary, in diabetics with better response to CABG, there may be a&#xD;
      more important reduction of epicardial fat tissue tickness at follow up. This effect may be&#xD;
      due to the control of different inflammatory, oxidative, and apoptotics molecules, and&#xD;
      epigenetic effectors in diabetics undergoing CABG, and related to better clinical outcomes.&#xD;
      Authors study hypothesis, is that incretin therapy may be associated to the reduction in&#xD;
      epicardial fat tissue thickness, and extension. This effect in diabetics incretin-users vs.&#xD;
      never-incretin-users may be due to the down regulation of different inflammatory, oxidative&#xD;
      and apoptotics molecules, and epigenetic effectors involved in epicardial fat metabolism.&#xD;
      Moreover, in this study authors will evaluate in diabetics vs. non diabetics, and in diabetic&#xD;
      incretin-users vs. never.-incretin-users, all cause mortality, cardiac mortality, and Major&#xD;
      adverse cardiac events (MACE) after CABG in diabetics vs. non diabetics, and diabetic&#xD;
      incretin-users (6 months of incretin therapy) vs. diabetic never-incretin-users. Authors will&#xD;
      correlate these clinical endpoints to the study of the epicardial fat anatomy and metabolism&#xD;
      before and after CABG, and to the study of circulating inflammatory and pro-apoptotic&#xD;
      markers, epigenetic effectors, and stem cells in diabetics vs. non diabetics, and diabetic&#xD;
      incretin-users (6 months of incretin therapy) vs. diabetic never-incretin-users. A part of&#xD;
      this, authors may speculate to recognize new cellular, molecular, and inflammatory processes,&#xD;
      and epigenetic effectors epicardial fat derived related to these effects on clinical&#xD;
      outcomes, and then used as specifical targets to improve clinical outcomes after CABG in&#xD;
      diabetics.&#xD;
