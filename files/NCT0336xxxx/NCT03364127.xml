    <textblock>
      This study evaluates acupuncture for the treatment of vulvodynia; specifically if it reduces&#xD;
      vulvar pain and pain with intercourse. It also examines how long the effect of acupuncture&#xD;
      lasts in women with vulvodynia. Half of the women will receive acupuncture and the other half&#xD;
      will receive placebo acupuncture. Women who get a reduction in pain will monitor there pain&#xD;
      once a week for up to 12 weeks to see how long the acupuncture effect lasts.&#xD;

      The investigators' goal is to demonstrate the effects of acupuncture for the treatment of&#xD;
      vulvodynia. Up to 14 million American women have vulvodynia, a debilitating pain syndrome&#xD;
      characterized by pain (burning, irritation, stinging or rawness) in the vulva and dyspareunia&#xD;
      that renders sexual intercourse virtually impossible and leaves these women desperate for&#xD;
      relief. Not only are women in pain, but they often lose their partners or have relationship&#xD;
      difficulties due to their inability to have sexual intercourse. No therapies have been proven&#xD;
      efficacious and rapid pain relief is unpredictable and rarely possible. After exhausting&#xD;
      Western Medicine options, these women often turn to acupuncture. But in contrast to other&#xD;
      pain conditions, there have been no acupuncture sham control studies of vulvodynia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only four studies, including one of the investigators', provide some evidence of the effect&#xD;
      of acupuncture on vulvodynia. In three, single-group acupuncture studies, women had less&#xD;
      pain, better quality of life, improved sexual health, and improved mental health. The&#xD;
      investigators' randomized wait-list controlled pilot study of 36 women with vulvodynia showed&#xD;
      great promise. The investigators found a statistically significant and clinically meaningful&#xD;
      reduction in vulvar pain and dyspareunia, and an increase in overall sexual function after a&#xD;
      5-week, 13-needle, 10 session acupuncture protocol. This newly developed, standardized&#xD;
      acupuncture treatment protocol is the first breakthrough in the treatment of this puzzling&#xD;
      disorder. It includes acupuncture points that relieve pain in the genitals. The results of&#xD;
      the investigators' initial pilot study provided the first evidence from a two-group design&#xD;
      that the acupuncture protocol could reduce pain intensity, pain during intercourse, and&#xD;
      increase overall sexual function. These findings, however, warrant stronger evidence to&#xD;
      support the inference that the effect is indeed due to the acupuncture since ours or no other&#xD;
      study included a sham control or provided follow-up data beyond immediate posttest, which&#xD;
      means that the duration of the acupuncture effect is unknown. The investigators' recent&#xD;
      feasibility study paves the way to overcome this gap by use of double-blind acupuncture&#xD;
      needles. Findings from these two studies support the investigators' proposal for the world's&#xD;
      first double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) of acupuncture for vulvodynia while&#xD;
      exploring its duration of effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a phase 2 double-blind, pretest/posttest RCT to compare effects of&#xD;
      penetrating needles or the skin touch placebo needles on vulvar pain in our 13-needle,&#xD;
      10-session acupuncture treatment protocol. A sample of 130 women, with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      vulvodynia, either generalized or provoked vestibulodynia, 18 to 45 years of age will be&#xD;
      recruited from clinical and community settings and 80 subjects are expected to complete the&#xD;
      study. Stratified by type of vulvodynia, participants will be randomized 1:1 either to the&#xD;
      penetrating needle group or the skin touch placebo needle group. These double-blind needles&#xD;
      will provide a strong sham procedure to mask both the acupuncturist and subject to the type&#xD;
      of needle used for the 10-treatment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Compare the penetrating needle group and the skin touch placebo needle group for&#xD;
      effects on the: (a) primary outcome: vulvar pain (PAINReportIt® average pain intensity,&#xD;
      0-10), and (b) secondary outcomes: dyspareunia (FSFI dyspareunia) and sexual function (FSFI&#xD;
      total). The investigators hypothesize that controlling for baseline values, at posttest there&#xD;
      will be statistically significant less vulvar pain (primary) and dyspareunia and better&#xD;
      sexual function in the penetrating needle group compared to the skin touch placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. In participants with a clinically meaningful reduction in pain intensity (at least 1.5&#xD;
      points) at posttest compared to pretest, describe the duration of the acupuncture treatment&#xD;
      and placebo effects weekly until pain returns to pretest or up to 12 weeks after posttest.&#xD;
      The investigators will describe the variability over time in vulvar pain intensity (0-10)&#xD;
      after a tampon insertion-removal stimulus and thereby explore the duration of the effect by&#xD;
      intervention group, vulvodynia subgroups, and demographic subgroups (e.g., age, race,&#xD;
      occupation). These findings will provide insights to guide future research on initial and&#xD;
      maintenance acupuncture for vulvodynia.&#xD;
