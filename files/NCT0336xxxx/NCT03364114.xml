  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the clinical trial is to evaluate the EndoRotor®'s ability to completely remove&#xD;
      areas of Barrett's esophagus considered refractory after 3 failed ablation treatments&#xD;
      (Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) and/or Cryotherapy) or in patients with at least 1 failed&#xD;
      ablative procedure (RFA and/or Cryotherapy) and are intolerant to the procedure due to pain,&#xD;
      where intolerant is defined as post-dysphagia or odynophagia persisting for 24 hours or&#xD;
      greater or requiring narcotic analgesia for a duration of more than 24 hours.&#xD;

      Prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled trial, pivotal, investigational device&#xD;
      exemption (IDE) to compare the safety and performance of the EndoRotor® Mucosal Resection&#xD;
      System with continued ablative therapy in subjects with refractory Barrett's Esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EndoRotor® Endoscopic Mucosal Resection System is an automated mechanical endoscopic&#xD;
      mucosal resection system for use in the gastrointestinal tract for benign neoplastic or&#xD;
      pre-malignant tissue removal by interventional gastroenterologists and GI surgeons. The&#xD;
      EndoRotor® System performs both tissue dissection and resection with a single device through&#xD;
      an endoscope's instrument biopsy channel.&#xD;
