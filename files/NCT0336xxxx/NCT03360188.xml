      A medical record review of historic and current information on 237 patients attending 5&#xD;
      tertiary referral centers [Kasr Al-Ainy Multiple Sclerosis Research Unit (KAMSU) - Cairo&#xD;
      University Hospitals, Abo El Reesh Pediatric Hospital and 3 private centers] in Cairo, Egypt&#xD;
      from period between 2011 and December 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, medical records of 251 patients with the first acquired demyelinating events&#xD;
      started before age of 18 years were reviewed. Fourteen patients (5.58%) were excluded due to&#xD;
      missing data that could not be obtained.&#xD;

      The International Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Study Group (IPMSSG) criteria were applied on&#xD;
      all included patients who were stratified into the following groups: (1) those with 2 or more&#xD;
      non-encephalopathic clinical CNS events (NEE) separated by &gt; 30 days and involving &gt; one area&#xD;
      of the CNS; (2) one non-encephalopathic episode typical of MS which is associated with MRI&#xD;
      findings consistent with 2010 Revised McDonald criteria for dissemination in space and in&#xD;
      which a follow up MRI shows at least one new enhancing or non-enhancing lesion consistent&#xD;
      with dissemination in time MS criteria; (3) one acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)&#xD;
      attack followed by a non-encephalopathic clinical event, 3 or more months after symptom&#xD;
      onset, that is associated with new MRI lesions fulfilling 2010 Revised McDonald DIS criteria;&#xD;
      or (4) a first, single, acute event that does not meet ADEM criteria and whose MRI findings&#xD;
      are consistent with the 2010 Revised McDonald criteria for DIS and DIT (applies only to&#xD;
      children ≥12 years old).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These criteria were applied retrospectively in patients diagnosed before 2013. Procedures All&#xD;
      medical records were analyzed from June 2016 till April 2017 to collect the following data;&#xD;
      (1) demographic characteristics; (2) clinical data including age at first symptoms, age at&#xD;
      diagnosis, disease course, time to conversion to secondary progressive (SP) course, duration&#xD;
      of follow-up, initial and last Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, time to (EDSS)&#xD;
      score of 4, family history of MS, disease-modifying treatments (DMTs), number of relapses in&#xD;
      the first year and the annualized relapse rate (ARR); (3) laboratorial data: oligoclonal&#xD;
      bands in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and IgG index; (4) characteristics of the initial&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord including: typicality of&#xD;
      lesions on T2 weighted sequence, presence of brain black holes in T1 weighted sequence,&#xD;
      presence of spinal cord T2 lesions, presence of gadolinium (Gd) enhancing lesions,&#xD;
      distribution of brain lesions (supratentorial and/or infratentorial).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data quality. To ensure high-quality data, the accuracy and completeness were systemically&#xD;
      assessed. The medical records, administrative data, laboratory and diagnostic tests reports&#xD;
      were screened independently by 2 authors (NS and AE) and relevant data was extracted to a&#xD;
      standard electronic form according to KAMSU registry. An assigned coordinator from each&#xD;
      center was requested to facilitate data collection from site-specific records; an audit&#xD;
      site-specific data abstractor was continuously monitoring the records. Data accuracy was&#xD;
      checked by separate investigators (MA, HS, AH) who reviewed the electronic forms for&#xD;
      resemblance. Scheduled monthly meetings between abstractors were held to resolve any data&#xD;
      conflicts. In case of incomplete documentation or unclear information, verification was done&#xD;
      by the on-site data coordinator either by phone or during a face-to-face interview with the&#xD;
      patients or caregivers during routine follow up or unscheduled visits.&#xD;

        A total of 237 patients were finally analyzed in the current study, 64.56% (153) were&#xD;
        females and 35.44% (84) were males. At time of data collection; MS was diagnosed in 186&#xD;
        patients (78.48%); and the diagnosis of 10 patients (4.22%) were not yet settled. We&#xD;
        identified 47/186 patients (25.27%) with EOPMS. Positive family history of MS [at least one&#xD;
        first and/or second degree relatives] was reported in 15/186 patients (8.06%). The median&#xD;
        (IQR) time between the first manifestation and confirmation of the diagnosis was 6 months&#xD;
        (3 - 9) months.&#xD;
