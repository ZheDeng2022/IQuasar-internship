      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many people with colorectal cancer get liver metastases. Standard treatment for this is a&#xD;
      combination of chemotherapy drugs. Directing the chemotherapy to the liver may be effective.&#xD;
      A device that does this a pump that delivers drugs over 2 weeks at constant rate into the&#xD;
      hepatic artery. The person s body temperature causes the drug to flow from the pump.&#xD;
      Researchers want to see if this helps people with colorectal metastases to the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the effectiveness of a hepatic artery infusion pump at treating colorectal&#xD;
      metastases to the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults at least 18 years old with colorectal metastases to the liver&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart, blood, and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay in the hospital a few days. A small plastic tube (catheter) will be&#xD;
      inserted in an artery into the liver. The catheter will be attached to the pump. That will&#xD;
      lie under the skin on the abdomen. It will be small and participants will be able to feel it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get treatment in 28-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every Day 1, they will have physical exam, symptom review, and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 2 weeks, they will come to the clinic to get chemotherapy by a catheter or port.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 12 weeks, they will have a scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue samples may be taken during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When they finish the drug, participants may have the pump removed. They will repeat the Day 1&#xD;
      tests. They will be called every 6 months to see how they are doing.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nearly 60% of patients with colorectal cancers will develop liver metastases over the&#xD;
           course of their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, the liver will be the sole site of&#xD;
           recurrence or the survival-limiting site of disease for 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver directed therapy, which has taken many forms over the last several decades, is a&#xD;
           potential means to prolong survival for properly selected patients and delay progression&#xD;
           at that site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatic artery infusion of floxuridine (FUDR) via an implantable hepatic artery infusion&#xD;
           pump (HAIP) induces objective clinical response rates of nearly 50% in heavily&#xD;
           pretreated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer to the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The identification of patients likely to respond to HAIP and those likely to suffer&#xD;
           pumprelated adverse events is currently unknown, and has limited the wide-spread&#xD;
           adoption of this otherwise well tolerated intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To assess the safety of hepatic artery infusion therapy using the Medtronic pump with the&#xD;
&#xD;
      Codman catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine the response rate in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer&#xD;
      treated with HAIP chemotherapy as measured by RECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma metastatic to the&#xD;
           liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with liver metastases not amenable to resection to No Evidence of Disease (NED)&#xD;
           in one stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have received systemic chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Single arm, phase II study of HAIP chemotherapy.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of colorectal&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma, confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology, NCI.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have progressed on, been intolerant of or have residual disease after&#xD;
             oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-containing, fluorouracil-based, chemotherapeutic regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  platelets &gt; 90,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR eGFR within normal as predicted&#xD;
                  by the CKD-EPI equation &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The hepatic artery infusion pump chemotherapy has potential teratogenic and/or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation and for 3&#xD;
             months after completion of study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect&#xD;
             she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should&#xD;
             inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Arterial anatomy on CT angiogram amenable to placement of the HAIP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients may be considered for this study only after consultation with an&#xD;
             HIV trained physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must agree to co-enroll on the Surgical Oncology Program s tissue collection&#xD;
             protocol 13C0176, 'Tumor, Normal Tissue and Specimens from Patients Undergoing&#xD;
             Evaluation or Surgical Resection of Solid Tumors'&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with liver metastases amenable to resection to No Evidence of Disease (NED)&#xD;
             in one stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with incontrovertible radiographic evidence of disease outside of the&#xD;
             colon/rectum (primary) and liver given unlikelihood of benefit from liver-directed&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: The exception to this exclusion is patients with fewer than five lung lesions greater&#xD;
        than 1 cm that have not increased in size by more than 10% over a 4-month period of time,&#xD;
        and are amenable to resection should subsequent problematic growth occur. Lesions less than&#xD;
        1 cm are indeterminant as far as etiology is concerned and will be ignored. Patients with&#xD;
        liver metastases and oligometastatic lung lesions (we define oligometastatic as less than 5&#xD;
        amen ble to thoracoscopic removal) are still likely to benefit from liver directed therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone extra-hepatic metastasectomy and have a documented&#xD;
             disease-free interval less than or equal to 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  MSI-high patients who need to be treated with a check-point inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements. This also includes any condition, including the presence of&#xD;
             laboratory abnormalities, which in the opinion of the Principal Investigator places&#xD;
             the subject at unacceptable risk if they were to participate in the study or confounds&#xD;
             the ability to interpret data from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active concurrent malignancies within the last five years other than colorectal&#xD;
             primary except basal cell skin carcinoma and thyroid carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation to liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the potential for teratogenic&#xD;
             or abortifacient effects of the HAIP chemotherapy. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with HAIP, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated. These&#xD;
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active Hepatitis B or C infection because of the potential for increased&#xD;
             liver toxicity given the damaging effects of the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical composition&#xD;
             to FUDR or heparin.&#xD;
