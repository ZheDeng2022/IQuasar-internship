  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study drug elotuzumab, has been clinically shown to be effective in treating&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory MM in combination with either bortezomib, or lenalidomide and&#xD;
      dexamethasone. Elotuzumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone is currently&#xD;
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      multiple myeloma. Carfilzomib is also FDA approved for treating multiple myeloma and&#xD;
      frequently given in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for treatment of&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory MM. Based on these findings, this study will look at how subjects with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory MM respond to a combination treatment with the following drugs:&#xD;
      elotuzumab, carfilzomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone. The combination of these four drugs&#xD;
      is not FDA approved and is experimental.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single arm, open-label phase II study is designed with the primary objective of&#xD;
      evaluating the efficacy of induction therapy comprised of 4 cycles of carfilzomib,&#xD;
      lenalidomide, dexamethasone and elotuzumab (KRd+elotuzumab) in terms of very good partial&#xD;
      response or better (VGPR+) in subjects with relapsed and/or refractory MM, and comparing to&#xD;
      relevant historical controls. Post induction, all subjects will undergo disease evaluation&#xD;
      for assessment of the primary endpoint. Maintenance therapy comprised of elotuzumab and&#xD;
      lenalidomide (R+elotuzumab) will start directly after induction and continue until relapse or&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subject must meet all of the following applicable inclusion criteria to participate in this&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health&#xD;
             information signed by the subject or his/her legally authorized representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age &gt;= 18 years at the time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0-2 (see Appendix A,&#xD;
             Section 18.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Documented history of relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma per IMWG 2016&#xD;
             criteria [22] as defined below (biochemical and/or clinical relapse per IMWG&#xD;
             criteria); (NOTE: subjects refractory to bortezomib and/or lenalidomide are eligible;&#xD;
             subjects who previously received carfilzomib are eligible provided they experienced a&#xD;
             minimal response or better and relapsed &gt;60 days after completion of treatment [see&#xD;
             exclusion criteria #2]):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Relapse is defined as progression of disease after an initial response to&#xD;
                  previous treatment, more than 6 months after discontinuation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Refractory is defined as lack of response to previous treatment, progression of&#xD;
                  disease during treatment, or progression of disease within 6 months of&#xD;
                  discontinuation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Prior treatment with one line (and no more than one line) of systemic therapy for MM;&#xD;
             NOTE: A new line of therapy is considered to start when a planned course of therapy is&#xD;
             modified to include other treatment agents (alone or in combination) as a result of&#xD;
             progressive disease (PD), relapse, or toxicity or when a planned period of observation&#xD;
             off therapy is interrupted by a need for additional treatment for the disease.&#xD;
             Induction therapy and stem cell transplant followed by planned maintenance therapy&#xD;
             (provided there is no intervening PD) are considered to be a single line.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject must have recovered from any treatment-induced toxicities to ≤ grade 1 or&#xD;
             baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Adequate washout from previous therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Prior chemotherapy is completed &gt;3 weeks prior to day 1 of treatment (6 weeks for&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Autologous transplant completed (referring to day of stem cell infusion) &gt;12&#xD;
                  weeks prior to day 1 of treatment; allogeneic transplant &gt;16 weeks prior to day 1&#xD;
                  of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Prior radiotherapy completed at least 2 weeks prior to day 1 of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Corticosteroid therapy at a dose equivalent to dexamethasone &gt;4mg/day has been&#xD;
                  completed at least 2 weeks prior to day 1 of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Measurable disease defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Serum M-protein &gt; 0.5 g/dL OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Urine M-protein ≥200 mg/24 h OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Involved free light chain (FLC) level ≥10 mg/dL provided serum FLC ratio is&#xD;
                  abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Demonstrate adequate organ function within 1 week of day 1 of treatment as defined in&#xD;
             the table in Sec.tion 3.2 of protocol (#8)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Adequate cardiac function as defined by ≥45% Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF)&#xD;
             by ECHO or MUGA within 28 days prior to day 1 of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to day&#xD;
             1 of treatment, and be willing to undergo serial serum or urine pregnancy testing.&#xD;
             NOTE: Females are considered of child bearing potential unless they are surgically&#xD;
             sterile (have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy) or are postmenopausal (at least 12 consecutive months with no menses&#xD;
             without an alternative medical cause).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. FCBP must be willing to use a highly effective contraceptive method (i.e., achieves a&#xD;
             failure rate of &lt;1% per year when used consistently and correctly) plus a second&#xD;
             contraceptive method (considered acceptable [failure rate of &gt;1% per year] or highly&#xD;
             effective) from the time of informed consent until 6 months after the last protocol&#xD;
             prescribed therapy has been discontinued. NOTE: estrogens may further increase the&#xD;
             risk of thrombosis (beyond that associated with lenalidomide) and their use should be&#xD;
             based on a benefit-risk decision. For the highly effective contraceptive method, a&#xD;
             method with low user dependency is preferable but not required (see tables, adapted&#xD;
             from:&#xD;
&#xD;
             http://www.hma.eu/fileadmin/dateien/Human_Medicines/01-About_HMA/Working_Groups/CTFG/2&#xD;
             014_09_HMA_CTFG_Contraception.pdf).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Male subjects (even those who have had a vasectomy) who are sexually active with a&#xD;
             FCBP must be willing to use latex or synthetic condoms from the time of informed&#xD;
             consent until 180 days after the last protocol prescribed therapy has been&#xD;
             discontinued. The FCBP partner should also consider contraception recommendations (see&#xD;
             inclusion #11).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. As determined by the enrolling physician, ability of the subject to understand and&#xD;
             comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Pregnant or breastfeeding (NOTE: breast milk cannot be stored for future use while the&#xD;
             mother is being treated on study, and any female subject must agree not to donate eggs&#xD;
             during the study and for 4 months after the last protocol prescribed therapy has been&#xD;
             discontinued).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has a known additional malignancy that is active and/or progressive requiring&#xD;

             ng/mL or other cancer for which the subject has completed treatment, been disease-free&#xD;
             for at least five years, and is considered by Sponsor-Investigator to be at &lt;30% risk&#xD;
             of relapse, or on hormonal therapy for a history of either prostate cancer or breast&#xD;
             cancer, provided that there has been no evidence of disease progression during the&#xD;

             suspected amyloidosis, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements as determined by the&#xD;
             investigator, or any other condition (including laboratory abnormalities) that would,&#xD;
             in the opinion of the Sponsor-Investigator, place the subject at unacceptable risk if&#xD;
             he/she were to participate in the study.&#xD;

                  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA&#xD;
                  levels. Subjects who are PCR positive will be excluded. Exception: subjects with&#xD;
                  serologic findings suggestive of HBV vaccination (anti-HBs positivity as the only&#xD;
                  serologic marker) and a known history of prior HBV vaccination do not need to be&#xD;
                  tested for HBV DNA by PCR.&#xD;
