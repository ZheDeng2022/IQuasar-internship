&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men able to father a child must agree to&#xD;
             use highly effective contraception (any contraceptive method with a failure rate of&#xD;
             less than 1% per year) while on study drug and for 23 weeks (for women) or 31 weeks&#xD;
             (for men) after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 24 hours of&#xD;
                  initiation of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not&#xD;
                  undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who&#xD;
                  is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea&#xD;
                  in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In&#xD;
                  addition, women under the age of 55 must have a documented serum follicle&#xD;
                  stimulating hormone (FSH) level less than 40 mIU/mL to be defined as&#xD;
                  post-menopausal.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. WOCBP receiving nivolumab will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a&#xD;
                  period of 23 weeks after the last dose of investigational product. Men receiving&#xD;
                  nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to&#xD;
                  contraception for a period of 31 weeks after the last dose of investigational&#xD;
                  product. These durations have been calculated using the upper limit of the&#xD;
                  half-life for nivolumab (25 days) and are based on the protocol requirement that&#xD;
                  WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 30 days and men who are sexually&#xD;
                  active with WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Highly effective contraceptive measures include: stable use of oral&#xD;
                  contraceptives such as combined estrogen and progestogen and progestogen only&#xD;
                  hormonal contraception or other prescription pharmaceutical contraceptives for 2&#xD;
                  or more menstrual cycles prior to screening; intrauterine device [IUD];&#xD;
                  intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS); bilateral tubal ligation; vasectomy&#xD;
                  and sexual abstinence.&#xD;

&#xD;
               6. Pregnancy testing and contraception are not required for women with documented&#xD;
                  hysterectomy or tubal ligation.&#xD;
