  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a single arm phase Ib study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combined&#xD;
      Tomuzotuximab and Gatipotuzumab therapy in patients with metastatic solid tumors expressing&#xD;
      EGFR for whom no standard treatment is available. Patients who had relapsed following their&#xD;
      most recent line of chemotherapy and who met all other entry criteria at Screening were&#xD;
      enrolled to receive Tomuzotuximab and Gatipotuzumab in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the extension phase, instead of Tomuzotuximab a commercially avalaible anti-EGFR&#xD;
      antibody, i.e. Cetuximab (including any approved biosimilar), Panitumumab, or Necitumumab&#xD;
      could be given to patients with cancers for which their use is approved.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tomuzotuximab (CetuGEX®) is an improved second-generation anti-epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor (EGFR) antibody that specifically binds to EGFR and acts as a competitive antagonist&#xD;
      at the EGFR ligand binding site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gatipotuzumab (PankoMab-GEX®) is a novel glyco-engineered humanized monoclonal antibody,&#xD;
      which recognizes the tumor-specific epitope of mucin-1 (TA-MUC1). Gatipotuzumab targets and&#xD;
      binds TA-MUC1 epitopes on the surface of tumor cells, potentially activating the immune&#xD;
      system to induce ADCC against TA-MUC1 expressing tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on compelling preclinical evidence suggesting a complex interaction between EGFR and&#xD;
      TA-MUC1 expressed on the tumor cell surface in driving carcinogenesis, this study assessed&#xD;
      the tolerability, safety and preliminary activity of targeting EGFR and TA-MUC1 with&#xD;
      glycoengineered antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the safe treatment of 20 patients and the absence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), the&#xD;
      combination of the two antibodies was considered safe and was started in the second week of&#xD;
      treatment for the additional 30 patients to be enrolled in the extension cohort.&#xD;
