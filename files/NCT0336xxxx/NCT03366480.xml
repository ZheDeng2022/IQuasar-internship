      A phase I/ II, open label study to assess the efficacy and safety of ABTL0812 in combination&#xD;
      with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with advanced endometrial cancer or squamous&#xD;
      NSCLC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II multicenter divided in two phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Safety and dose escalation&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is not randomized, and all included patients will receive ABTL0812 in addition to&#xD;
      paclitaxel + carboplatin (SOC). In this phase, patients can be selected from both&#xD;
      indications, regardless of the number of each indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase will be divided in 2 periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dose de-escalation phase will be performed with a 3 + 3 design, in which up to four&#xD;
      different ABTL0812 dose levels will be tested in combination with SOC. Then, 12 patients will&#xD;
      be included in an expansion phase. All patients will receive one week of ABTL0812 alone&#xD;
      followed by ABTL0812 + SOC (up to 8 SOC cycles) as combined treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the finalization of the SOC cycles, ABTL0812 will be taken as single therapy, at 1300&#xD;
      mg tid, up to 12 months from initiation of period 1. This is the Recommended Phase 2 Dose&#xD;
      (RP2D) as monotherapy for ABTL0812 determined in the previous phase I clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Efficacy and safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase of the study will include up to 33 patients per indication (up to 66 patients&#xD;
      overall). The final number will depend on the number of patients included in the phase I. The&#xD;
      number of patients selected per indication will depend on the number already selected in&#xD;
      phase I, as it is necessary to compensate both indications to have a final number of 40&#xD;
      patients per indication approximately.&#xD;
