  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Late-life depression affects 2-8% of seniors and causes high rates of caregiver distress and&#xD;
      risk of suicide. To exacerbate the problem, antidepressants, the cornerstone of therapy, are&#xD;
      resistant in 55-80% of this population. Hence, this group of patients is labeled as having&#xD;
      treatment-resistant late-life depression (TR-LLD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-pharmacological interventions like meditation could offer significant benefits as&#xD;
      augmentation strategies to improve response rate of antidepressants in TR-LLD. One such&#xD;
      breath-based meditation intervention called Sudarshan Kriya Yoga is of interest based on&#xD;
      highly significant preliminary data in adult patients with treatment-resistant depression,&#xD;
      its scalability and relatively low cost to learn this lifelong skill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty patients diagnosed with TR-LLD will learn this intervention over 5 consecutive days by&#xD;
      a certified para-professional trainer. This will be followed by 3 weekly 90 min follow-up&#xD;
      sessions and then bimonthly sessions for 8 more weeks. SKY consists of a series of breathing&#xD;
      techniques, including Sudarshan Kriya (SK), a sequential rhythm-specific breathing exercise.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to practice this technique for 25-30 minutes daily over the next&#xD;
      11 weeks. The investigators will collect clinical as well as feasibility outcome measures.&#xD;
      The investigators will also explore if it is feasible to assess the antioxidant Glutathione&#xD;
      (GSH) in the brain using a sophisticated magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The investigators&#xD;
      suspect that GSH levels are reduced in TR-LLD and they will improve with SKY.&#xD;

      RECRUITMENT AND CONSENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from Victoria Hospital, London Health Sciences Centre or Parkwood&#xD;
      Mental Health, St. Joseph's Health Care London. Patients will be screened and recruited after&#xD;
      giving valid consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY INTERVENTION (Sudarshan Kriya Yoga, SKY):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 30 recruited TR-LLD participants will be invited to attend training sessions on SKY. The&#xD;
      SKY program is a highly structured and standardized mind-body resilience building program.&#xD;
      Through SKY breathing, interactive discussions, journaling, yoga and guided meditations, the&#xD;
      workshop builds a framework for resilience and empowerment, and develops self-awareness,&#xD;
      connectedness and community, and a positive outlook. This is a minimally invasive treatment&#xD;
      and is not routinely available as standard of care. SKY involves rhythmic, cyclical forms of&#xD;
      breathing in which there are no pauses between inhalation and exhalation. The breathing&#xD;
      practices of this program include: (a) a three-stage Pranayama with Ujjayi, also called&#xD;
      Victory Breath or Ocean Breath (b) Bhastrika or Bellow's Breath and (c) Sudarshan Kriya (SK)&#xD;
      or the Rhythmic Breath Technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SKY will be consistently taught to the participants by two instructors from The Art of Living&#xD;
      Foundation, an international humanitarian and charitable organization. SKY training will take&#xD;
      place in a group-format with group sizes varying between 4-6 participants. The investigators&#xD;
      will conduct these training sessions in an appropriately sized and accessible community hall&#xD;
      in London, Ontario. SKY training involves attending a 5-day course that teaches the basic&#xD;
      principles of SKY over 2.5-3 hour daily sessions. These will be followed by once weekly&#xD;
      follow up sessions (90 min/wk) for 3 weeks and then bimonthly sessions (every 2 weeks) for&#xD;
      the next 8 weeks. In addition, participants will be asked to practice SKY at home daily (25&#xD;
      min/day) throughout the duration of the study period and log practice frequency and any other&#xD;
      noteworthy observations in a log sheet that will be provided to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MENTAL HEALTH ASSESSMENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened for eligibility using criteria described below , the&#xD;
      Anti-Depressant Treatment History Form, and if applicable an MRI pre-screening checklist.&#xD;
      Prior to the start of the intervention, trained raters will meet with eligible participants&#xD;
      to obtain demographic information. Participants will complete baseline measures of&#xD;
      depression, comorbid anxiety, quality of life and caregiver burden. Specifically, the&#xD;
      following scales will be administered: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D 17 item&#xD;
      version), Geriatric Anxiety Inventory, European Quality of Life (EQ-5D-5L) and the Zaritz&#xD;
      Caregiver burden. The abovementioned scales will be administered again at three other time&#xD;
      points, weeks 4, 8 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven healthy control participants will be recruited by advertising via flyers in waiting&#xD;
      areas of the clinic. In addition, spouses and other family members accompanying the patient,&#xD;
      who appear to be of eligible age, will be offered a letter of information about this research&#xD;
      study. All thirty recruited TR-LLD participants will also be offered the option of&#xD;
      participating in the MRI portion of the study in addition to the study activities described&#xD;
      above. Our goal is to recruit 13 TR-LLD to complete MRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All MRI participants will complete the MRI screening questionnaire. Control participants will&#xD;
      additionally be asked to complete a Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to confirm an&#xD;
      absence of any mental health diagnosis. Both control and TR-LLD participants who are eligible&#xD;
      to take part in the MRI portion of the study will be asked to attend a one-hour appointment&#xD;
      at the Western Centre for Functional and Metabolic Mapping at University Hospital campus of&#xD;
      LHSC. Control participants will attend only one such appointment, while TR-LLD participants&#xD;
      will be asked to attend one MRI visit pre-intervention and one MRI visit post-intervention.&#xD;
      The Research Coordinator or Research Assistant will accompany participants to the MRI visit,&#xD;
      while the MRI analysis itself will be completed by an in-house MRI technician at the Western&#xD;
      Centre for Functional and Metabolic Mapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct semi-structured interviews by trained raters on study&#xD;
      completers as well as drop outs. If a participant consented to be part of the study but then&#xD;
      decided against participation at any point, he/she will be offered the opportunity to&#xD;
      identify any problems with our approach by participating in a short interview conducted by a&#xD;
      trained research assistant.&#xD;

    <measure>Quality of Life of TR-LLD participants using the European Quality of Life (EQ-5D-5L) scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The European Quality of Life (EQ-5D-5L) scale will be used to assess the quality of life of study participants. This scale has two scores; the descriptive system and the EQ Visual Analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system consists of 5 questions each with 5 possible answers allowing for 5 possible health states. A score of 1 indicates no problems with the 5 measured dimensions, while a score of 5 would indicate the most severe possible state for each dimension. The descriptive system includes 5 sub-scores ranging from 1 (no issues) to 5 (severe problems), which will be converted to a specific single index value. The EQ VAS consists of only one question ranging from 0 (worst possible state of health) to 100 (best possible state of health).</description>
