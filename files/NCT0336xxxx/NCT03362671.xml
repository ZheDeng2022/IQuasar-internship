  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mandibular advancing oral appliances (OAm) are an effective and increasingly common treatment&#xD;
      modality for the management of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of OAm therapy, however, is dependent on a high level of patient adherence,&#xD;
      which may be negatively impacted by treatment side effects - the most significant of which&#xD;
      are occlusal changes and tooth movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed pilot study will evaluate the efficacy of a novel implant supported OAm in 10&#xD;
      OSA patients who have already been successfully treated with a traditional OAm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will compare OSA specific outcomes with traditional OAm use against novel oral&#xD;
      appliance use after one month. This study could potentially validate the novel design&#xD;
      features of an effective treatment option for OSA that does not result in tooth movement,&#xD;
      which is a significant side effect shared by all existing OAm devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultimately, this study could lead to increased treatment adherence and better OSA patient&#xD;
      health outcomes in the future.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mandibular advancement oral appliances (OAm) are devices that keep the airway open during&#xD;
      sleep by pulling the lower jaw forward. OAm have been shown to be an effective treatment for&#xD;
      both mild and severe OSA. OSA is a chronic disease and there is no cure. OSA treatments&#xD;
      depend on high patient adherence for long term effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently marketed OAm devices attach to the teeth as a way of holding the jaw in position.&#xD;
      However, attaching directly to the teeth causes unwanted tooth movement with long term OAm&#xD;
      use. As a result, some long-term users of OAm have stopped treatment due to a decrease in&#xD;
      quality of life caused by tooth movement. Accordingly, the changes in tooth position can be&#xD;
      seen as a limitation of the existing appliances. For this reason, there is a strong need for&#xD;
      a type of treatment that can effectively pull the jaw forward without causing movement of the&#xD;
      teeth, which is inevitable with the way the current OAm devices work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is a pilot study to find out if a novel OAm device is an effective treatment for&#xD;
      OSA. The novel OAm device does not contact the teeth directly but instead attaches to&#xD;
      orthodontic mini implants (OMIs) in the jaw. 10 OSA patients who have previously been&#xD;
      successfully treated with a traditional OAm appliance will be fitted with the novel oral&#xD;
      appliance. Participants will be fitted with 6 OMIs following standard practice and the&#xD;
      bespoke oral appliance will be manufactured and delivered to the patient for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to receiving treatment, participants will undergo a baseline assessment where&#xD;
      demographic, anthropometric, and specific periodontal health data will be collected. Daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness will be assessed and at-home sleep test will be used to establish baseline sleep&#xD;
      parameters with the existing appliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up sleep tests will be completed 1 month after initiation of treatment with the new&#xD;
      appliance. ESS questionnaires and treatment experience interviews will be completed at 1&#xD;
      month and 4 months after the start of treatment with the new appliance. Treatment adherence&#xD;
      and OMI side effects will be monitored throughout the study. Patients will be given the&#xD;
      option of continuing treatment with the novel device or having the implants removed and&#xD;
      returning to treatment with their previous OAm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To directly address the primary aim of this study, OSA related parameters will be measured by&#xD;
      a combination of methods including at-home sleep tests and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)&#xD;
      questionnaires. Secondary outcome variables to assess treatment adherence and satisfaction&#xD;
      include self-reported adherence data using sleep diaries, experience interviews and assessing&#xD;
      OMI side effects throughout the study.&#xD;

    <description>Evaluation of OSA specific fatigue using Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questionnaire. ESS measures daytime sleepiness via 8 questions that ask about daytime sleepiness during common everyday conditions. The potential range of scores for any questions is from 0 to 3. Higher values represent worse outcomes. Their are no subscales for ESS. The answers to the questions are all summed up. Total score ranges between 0 and 24. A score above 10 indicates daytime sleepiness with higher scores indicating more sleepiness.</description>
