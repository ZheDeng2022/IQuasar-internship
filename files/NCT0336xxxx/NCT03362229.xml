    <textblock>
      Medial malleolus: Operative Or Non-operative (MOON study) Ankle fractures are a common&#xD;
      Orthopaedic trauma presentation, accounting for approximately 10% of the workload. There has&#xD;
      been debate regarding the significance of the contribution of the medial malleolus to ankle&#xD;
      stability. Some deem the lateral malleolus as the key stabiliser. With this anatomically&#xD;
      aligned the ankle joint should be stable. Operating on the medial malleolus fracture often&#xD;
      requires a second generous skin incision, soft tissue stripping and insertion of metalwork.&#xD;
      This carries with it the risk of wound complications, infection and increased operation time.&#xD;
      High risk patients including the elderly, diabetics and those with significant swelling&#xD;
      following injury are particularly vulnerable. The study will include adult patients (≥16&#xD;
      years) with capacity to consent and complete post-operative questionnaires, presenting to a&#xD;
      single Orthopaedic trauma unit. Participants will be randomised to fixation or non-fixation&#xD;
      of associated medial malleolus fractures at the same time as fixation of the lateral&#xD;
      malleolar fracture to assess if this impacts on validated patient outcomes, failure,&#xD;
      operative time and complications over a one-year follow-up. Only one trial has been&#xD;
      published, showing no significant difference between failure rates or outcomes, but reduced&#xD;
      operative time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled into the trial following informed consent. The final decision&#xD;
      on whether a participant is eligible can only be made during surgery when the medial&#xD;
      malleolus fracture has reduced with no more than 2mm displacement. If this is confirmed the&#xD;
      participant will be randomised to receive either fixation or non-fixation of the medial&#xD;
      malleolus. Randomisation therefore occurs at the time of surgery. Participants will be&#xD;
      reviewed at set post-operative checkpoints, with X-rays and patient reported outcome scores.&#xD;
      Trial data will hopefully enable surgeons to make better informed decisions when managing&#xD;
      patients with ankle fracture dislocations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will include adult patients (16 years) presenting to the single centre; Edinburgh&#xD;
      Orthopaedic Trauma Unit, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, with an isolated unstable fracture of&#xD;
      the ankle joint requiring operative intervention. Both NHS research ethics committee (REC)&#xD;
      approval and NHS R&amp;D Management approval have been granted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated in the Emergency Department (ED) with closed reduction and&#xD;
      casting under procedural sedation and then referred to Orthopaedics via the on-call service.&#xD;
      Patients will be considered for the trial if the following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Aged 16 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An unstable fracture dislocation of the ankle joint, defined as a bimalleolar or&#xD;
           trimalleolar fracture pattern with or without any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Radiographic evidence of talar shift&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Posterior malleolar fracture of &gt;25% articular involvement or &gt;2mm step-off&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Syndesmosis injury&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who consent to participate in the trial will be enrolled into the trial&#xD;
      pre-operatively, but the result of their randomisation will not be revealed until after&#xD;
      fibular fixation and assessment of medial malleolus reduction intra-operatively. Patients&#xD;
      will only be eligible to continue in the trial if the medial malleolus reduces to acceptable&#xD;
      limits without open reduction (≤2mm of displacement as seen on a radiographic&#xD;
      antero-posterior view). If the medial malleolus fracture does not reduce within this 2mm&#xD;
      limit, the patient will require formal open reduction and internal fixation and consequently&#xD;
      not suitable to continue in the trial. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for this trial&#xD;
      are displayed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vulnerable populations, including patients unable to give consent and complete post-operative&#xD;
      questionnaires, will not be recruited. A participant information sheet will be provided for&#xD;
      them to read before agreeing to take part. The study protocol will then be reviewed in detail&#xD;
      and a member of the research team member will complete the informed consent process. With the&#xD;
      permission of the patient, a letter will be sent to their General Practitioner informing them&#xD;
      of their involvement in the trial and patients will be given a copy of their consent form.&#xD;
      Patients may take as long as they like to consider participation, provided that they still&#xD;
      meet all the eligibility criteria documented above. Patients who require additional time to&#xD;
      make a decision will be contacted the following day by a further face-to-face inpatient&#xD;
      discussion. They will also be given the contact details of an Orthopaedic specialist,&#xD;
      independent of the trial to allow them access to further information if they require. Upon&#xD;
      agreeing to take part, participants will be randomised into one of two treatment groups&#xD;
      intra-operatively by closed opaque envelope: operative or non-operative management of the&#xD;
      medial malleolus fracture. Randomisation will be stratified according to age to allow an even&#xD;
      distribution of both young (&lt;65 years) and older (65+ years) patients between the operative&#xD;
      groups. The result of their randomisation will only be revealed if the fracture reduces&#xD;
      spontaneously following lateral malleolus fixation with ≤2mm of residual displacement. On&#xD;
      enrolment, a data collection form will be started with demographic and injury-related&#xD;
      information collected. Regardless of the treatment allocation, the patients will be followed&#xD;
      up at the following post-operative stages: 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and one year.&#xD;
      This will be either in person in the outpatient clinic or via postal questionnaire. At each&#xD;
      visit physical examination, treatment, complications and re-operation (e.g. hardware removal)&#xD;
      for each patient will be recorded. Participants will be asked to complete their outcome&#xD;
      scores independently, as they would with the postal questionnaires. The presence or absence&#xD;
      of a medial sided incision and obvious differences with respect to metalwork on radiographs&#xD;
      means neither the patient nor the investigator can be blinded to the treatment group. The&#xD;
      investigators will also follow up patients' records to assess whether they underwent any&#xD;
      subsequent surgery on the affected ankle during the study period. This would include&#xD;
      debridement/irrigation for infection and/or removal of metalwork for a variety of reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions - Patients randomised to operative management of the associated medial&#xD;
      malleolus fracture will be treated routinely with standard medial malleolus fixation&#xD;
      techniques. The most common being the use of 2x 3.5mm partially threaded cancellous screws&#xD;
      (35mm - 45mm length) inserted at 90 degrees to the fracture line, following satisfactory open&#xD;
      reduction. Other techniques, used far less frequently include the use of a tension band wire&#xD;
      construct and Kirschner wires. The technique employed will be at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating surgeon and aims to reproduce the decisions that are made in day-to-day trauma care.&#xD;
      Those participants who are not suitable for randomisation intra-operatively as the medial&#xD;
      malleolus does not reduce within acceptable limits will be excluded from the trial. The&#xD;
      result of their randomisation will not be revealed and their envelope will be return to the&#xD;
      study office and allocated in order to the next eligible patient. This will limit disruption&#xD;
      to the randomisation sequence. The subsequent care of that patient will then be at the&#xD;
      discretion of their treating consultant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative immobilisation and weight bearing restrictions will be at the discretion of&#xD;
      the treating surgeon, which again reflects everyday practice when managing this common&#xD;
      orthopaedic injury. However, the default immobilisation will be in a removable supportive&#xD;
      orthosis (walking boot) and patients will be allowed to fully weight bear unless there is a&#xD;
      clinical indication, as highlighted above. Post-operative physiotherapy will be arranged at&#xD;
      the discretion of the treating surgeon, as occurs in routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis - Prior to the study a power analysis determined the number of patients&#xD;
      required in each arm of the trial. The primary outcome measure will be the OMAS at one year.&#xD;
      To show a clinically meaningful difference in means OMAS at one year between the groups of 10&#xD;
      points, assuming a common standard deviation of 20 points, 80% power and 5% level of&#xD;
      significance the study would require 64 participants per groups (i.e. a total of 128).&#xD;
      However, to account for potential dropouts through the duration of the study this number will&#xD;
      increase by 20% to 77 per group (i.e. a total of 154).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis for the trial will be performed by an independent statistician employed&#xD;
      through the local University statistics department/Edinburgh Clinical Research Facility.&#xD;
      Primary and secondary outcome measures are displayed in the relevant section below.&#xD;

    <description>The OMAS is a functional rating scale developed in 1984, which has been used extensively as a research tool in foot and ankle surgery. It includes nine parameters: pain, stiffness, swelling, stair climbing, running, jumping, squatting, supports and work/activities of daily living. The sub-score parameters are summated to generate a final score from 0 - 100, with '100' representing an excellent functional outcome and '0' being the worse possible outcome.</description>
