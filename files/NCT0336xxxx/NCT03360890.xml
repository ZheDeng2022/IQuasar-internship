      Phase II, 2-cohort, single arm trial treated with the combination of the following two&#xD;
      agents:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pembrolizumab (MK3475) 200mg, every three weeks, iv&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Docetaxel 75mg/m2, every three weeks, iv&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be divided into two cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: salivary gland tumors without SOC treatment option Cohort 2: 'aggressive' thyroid&#xD;
      cancer without SOC treatment option&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both cohorts will undergo a biopsy and will begin immunotherapy plus chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab and steroid sparing taxane: docetaxel will be given every three weeks for 3 to&#xD;
      6 cycles. For accessible tumors only, at week three patients will receive an on-treatment&#xD;
      biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will move on to immunotherapy maintenance after completing their cycles.&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab will be given every three weeks until disease progression or up to 35 cycles&#xD;
      (about 2 years).&#xD;

             within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 3 weeks prior to study&#xD;
             Day 1, or targeted small molecule therapy within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1, or who&#xD;
             has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents&#xD;
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier, with the exception of lymphopenia or&#xD;
             asymptomatic aberrancies of sodium, amylase, lipase or alkaline phosphatase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has not recovered from prior surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy from adverse&#xD;
             events due to a previous treatment/administered agent (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or return to&#xD;
             baseline prior to treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy, any grade hearing loss or tinnitus, or&#xD;
             typical side effects from radiotherapy are an exception to this criterion and may&#xD;
             qualify for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the&#xD;
             toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.&#xD;
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical or other&#xD;
             cancers that are not likely to influence life expectancy in the subsequent 3 years&#xD;
             without active treatment (e.g. low grade prostate cancer in absence of therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known active (growing) central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or&#xD;
             carcinomatous meningitis. Prior radiation or resection is acceptable if clinically&#xD;
             stable for at least 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids in excess of prednisone&#xD;
             10mg/24h equivalent or immunosuppressive drugs) and would represent significant&#xD;
             morbidity risk in judgement of investigator. Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine,&#xD;
             insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary&#xD;
             insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.&#xD;

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;

             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit&#xD;
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection (HIV 1/2&#xD;
             antibodies). Patients with treated HIV, as evidenced by stable CD4 &gt; 200 for at least&#xD;
             6 months, are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA&#xD;
             [qualitative] is detected).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of organ transplant that requires use of immunosuppressives.&#xD;

             infarction within 6 months from Day 1 of study drug administration, New York Heart&#xD;
             Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure, and arrhythmia requiring therapy&#xD;
             Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines&#xD;
             and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live&#xD;
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed within 30 days prior to initiation of&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
