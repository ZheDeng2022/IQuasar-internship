    <textblock>
      Despite the wide-spread use of botulinum toxin (BT) to treat spasticity (increased muscle&#xD;
      tone) in central neurological disease, evidence-based guidance on dosing, dilution, and&#xD;
      injection technique is limited. The wide-spread use of BT in spasticity management, expense&#xD;
      of these agents, and detrimental impact from movement into non-injected muscles mandates a&#xD;
      better understanding of BT movement within muscles. A proof-of-concept paper written by&#xD;
      investigators at Weill Cornell Medicine introduced a non-invasive MRI approach with &quot;voxel&#xD;
      thresholds&quot; that was able to detect intramuscular effects of BT at 2 and 3 months&#xD;
      post-injection of BT. The purpose of the current set of studies is to refine this MRI&#xD;
      technique to better visualize the movement of botulinum toxin through muscle. In addition,&#xD;
      the investigators plan to explore, using the imaging technique, how spastic muscle and&#xD;
      differing dilutions affect BT movement in an effort to support the development of better&#xD;
      research techniques to study toxin movement in human muscle.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research questions for the present study series are as followed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How does the movement and morphology of BT muscle effect (BTME) differ between&#xD;
           standardized, research injections into spastic and non-spastic lateral gastrocnemius&#xD;
           muscle (LGM)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How does the movement and morphology of BTME differ between a standardized, research&#xD;
           injection into spastic LGM versus an injection using the same dose in a 100% greater&#xD;
           dilution?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is there a predictable BTME within a given muscle following lower extremity BT clinical&#xD;
           injections based on clinical need?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two hypotheses are as followed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, it is predicted that BT muscle effect (BTME) will be greater in normal muscle than in&#xD;
      spastic muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, it is predicted that BTME will increase with increasing dilution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard BT injection will be an injection of 25 units of onobotulinumtoxinA (Botox®)&#xD;
      diluted in 0.25cc of saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental BT injection will be an injection of 25 units of onobutilinumtoxinA (Botox®)&#xD;
      diluted in 0.50cc of saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical BT injection will be an injection of up to 200 units of onobutilinumtoxinA&#xD;
      (Botox®) to any clinically indicated muscle or combinations of muscle in the spastic leg.&#xD;
      Dose, dilution, and site of injection will be determined by the PI and all parameters of each&#xD;
      injection tracked for future reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, subjects will receive research injections that are decided based on the research&#xD;
      protocol. Given the very small dosage of the research BT injections, the investigators do not&#xD;
      anticipate seeing any symptomatic effects in subjects. At 3 months following research&#xD;
      injections, subjects will receive clinical injections that are decided based on their&#xD;
      clinical need and are anticipated to result in clinical benefit for subjects. All subjects&#xD;
      will have an MRI at baseline (MRIB), at 2M (months) following research injections (MRI2), and&#xD;
      at 2M following clinical injections (MRI3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment #1 - Pilot:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot experiment will be done to inform the study design for the subsequent experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the pilot experiment, after a baseline MRI, 6 subjects will be randomized into three&#xD;
      groups (N=2 in each group): standard injection in LGM, experimental injection in LGM, or&#xD;
      experimental injection in medial gastrocnemius muscle (MGM). All 6 subjects will receive a&#xD;
      standard injection to the non-spastic LGM. Subjects will undergo a second MRI 2 months after&#xD;
      the research injections, which will be used to confirm the design of the subsequent&#xD;
      experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If, for the data from the investigator's pilot study of N=6 subjects, the investigators find&#xD;
      on MRI2 a similar appearance and volume of BTME (BTME volume +/- 20%) for both the LGM and&#xD;
      MGM receiving the experimental injection and that the BTME is contained within each muscle,&#xD;
      the investigators will have the option of proceeding with the within-subject design where&#xD;
      each subject serves as his or her own control, receiving either the research or experimental&#xD;
      injection in the spastic LGM and the alternative injection in the spastic MGM. If the&#xD;
      within-subject design is used, 15 subjects will be recruited. If the BTME volumes for the LGM&#xD;
      and MGM receiving the experimental injection are not within +/- 20% of each other, or the&#xD;
      investigators see on the MRI that the BTME is not contained within each injected muscle, then&#xD;
      a between subject design will be used where subjects will be randomized to receive either the&#xD;
      experimental or standard injection to the spastic LGM and 25 subjects will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive clinical injections 3 months following the research injections and&#xD;
      undergo a final MRI 2 months following clinical injections. Recruitment for the subsequent&#xD;
      experiments will begin after data analysis from the second MRI in experiment #1 is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment #2 (Effect of dilution, answer Research Question #1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      If using a within-subject design, subjects will be randomized to receive a standard injection&#xD;
      to either the LGM or MGM. The experimental injection will be delivered to the muscle not&#xD;
      receiving the standard injection. If using a between-subjects design, subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either a standardized injection in the LGM or an experimental injection&#xD;
      in the LGM. On the same day of, but before the injection, the MRIB will be acquired. Using&#xD;
      the localization schema proposed in the investigator's proof-of-concept study, the baseline&#xD;
      scan will be used to determine the coordinates and depth of the injection into a given&#xD;
      muscle. Two months (+/- 1 week) after the injection, subject will report for MRI2 and will be&#xD;
      considered finished with Experiment #2. He/she will be scheduled for the &quot;clinical&quot; injection&#xD;
      5 weeks (+/- 1 week) from that time, which will be evaluated in Experiment #4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment #3 (spastic vs. non spastic muscle, answer Research Question #2):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment #3 will take place simultaneously and within the same subject population as&#xD;
      Experiment #2. Regardless of whether a within- or between subject design is adopted in&#xD;
      Experiment #2, all subjects will also receive a standard injection to the non-spastic LGM.&#xD;
      The same technique using MRIB for muscle localization and the same protocol for obtaining&#xD;
      MRI2 employed in Experiment #2 will be used for Experiment #3, at the same time points.&#xD;
      Subjects will be scheduled for the &quot;clinical&quot; injection 5 weeks (+/- 1 week) from the time of&#xD;
      MRI2, as mentioned under the description for Experiment #2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment #4:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As described previously, all subjects that participated in Experiments #2 and #3 will undergo&#xD;
      a cycle of clinically-based BT injections to the spastic lower extremity no sooner than 3&#xD;
      months after the research injections and about 1 month after MRI2. Potentially, any lower&#xD;
      extremity muscle or combination of muscles may be injected based on clinical evaluation and&#xD;
      need. The investigators reserve the right to limit the total dose of toxin injected to no&#xD;
      more than 200 units of onobotulinumtoxinA. This would be a reasonable dose in clinical&#xD;
      practice for the first cycle of lower extremity injections in a toxin-naive patient. All&#xD;
      subjects will receive a third and final leg MRI3 2 months following the clinical injection,&#xD;
      marking the end of this study approximately 5 months after the initial randomization in&#xD;
      Experiment #2.&#xD;
