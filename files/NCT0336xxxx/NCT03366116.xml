      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, tissue, and tumor cells contain genes. Genes are made up of DNA. DNA is the&#xD;
      instruction book for each cell. In some people with cancer, the genes that might have slowed&#xD;
      the growth of their tumor were turned off. Researchers want to see if a new drug can turn the&#xD;
      genes back on and slow the tumor growth. The drug is called Aza-TdC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the safety of Aza-TdC, and to find out the dose of this drug that can be safely given&#xD;
      to humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older who have advanced cancer that has gotten worse after standard&#xD;
      treatment, or for which no effective therapy exists&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scans to measure their tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test to measure the electrical activity of the heart&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take the study drug by mouth. The drug is given in cycles. Each cycle is 21&#xD;
      days (3 weeks) long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 1 and week 2: participants will take the study drug once a day for 5 days. Then they&#xD;
      will have 2 days without the drug. Week 3: no study drug is taken. This completes one cycle&#xD;
      of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cycle 1, participants will repeat the screening tests several times. For all other&#xD;
      cycles, participants will have blood tests and pregnancy tests. They will have scans of their&#xD;
      tumor every 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cycle will be repeated as long as the participant tolerates the drug and the cancer is&#xD;
      either stable or gets better.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methylation-mediated silencing of genes is an epigenetic mechanism implicated in&#xD;
      carcinogenesis; agents that inhibit this mechanism are of clinical interest because of their&#xD;
      potential to re-activate silenced tumor suppressor genes. Two DNA hypomethylating&#xD;
      nucleosides, 5-azacytidine (azacytidine) and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) have been&#xD;
      approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and certain&#xD;
      leukemias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nucleoside analog 5-aza-4 -thio-2 -deoxycytidine (Aza-TdC) is incorporated into DNA,&#xD;
      where it engages the active site of DNA methyltransferase I (DNMT1), a maintenance&#xD;
      methyltransferase that contributes to the hypermethylation and silencing of tumor suppressor&#xD;
      genes. DNMT1 can become trapped in a covalent complex with DNA, thus depleting free enzyme&#xD;
      and inhibiting the normal maintenance methylation of CpG sites, resulting in re-activation of&#xD;
      tumor suppressor genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data suggest a correlation between Aza-TdC activity in solid tumor xenograft models and&#xD;
      decreased levels of DNMT1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aza-TdC offers an improvement over traditional DNA methyltransferase inhibitors by virtue of&#xD;
      a higher incorporation rate into DNA at lower levels of cytotoxicity; Aza-TdC has greater&#xD;
      antitumor activity than another recently developed DNMT1 inhibitor, TdCyd, in some solid&#xD;
      tumor xenograft models. Treatment with Aza-TdC is anticipated to result in the inhibition of&#xD;
      tumor growth due to DNMT1 depletion at oral doses that are well tolerated in extended dosing&#xD;
      schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish the safety, tolerability, and MTD of oral Aza-TdC administered daily for 5 days&#xD;
      a week for 2 weeks, with one week off, q 21-day cycles, to patients with refractory solid&#xD;
      tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the pharmacokinetics of oral Aza-TdC&#xD;
&#xD;
      To document preliminary evidence of Aza-TdC activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine effect of study treatment on re-expression of select genes silenced by&#xD;
      methylation in circulating tumor cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effects of Aza-TdC on DNA damage response (DDR) signaling and on genome-wide&#xD;
      DNA methylation in tumor biopsy tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effects of Aza-TdC on global RNA expression and on levels of DNMT1, DNMT3a,&#xD;
      DNMT3b, and other select proteins in tumor biopsy tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine genomic alterations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) that may be associated with&#xD;
      Aza-TdC response or resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients &gt;= 18 years of age must have histologically documented solid tumors whose disease&#xD;
      has progressed on standard therapy or for which there is no available standard therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aza-TdC will be administered orally once a day for 5 days of each week for 2 weeks, with one&#xD;
      week off, in 21-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will follow an accelerated titration design, changing to a traditional 3+3 dose&#xD;
      escalation design (3-6 patients per cohort) once specified toxicity criteria are met.&#xD;
      Intrapatient dose escalation will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis and to isolate circulating tumor&#xD;
      cells to assess re-expression of genes silenced by methylation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 21 patients will be accrued to a PD expansion cohort at the MTD to further assess&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic endpoints in tumor and blood.&#xD;
