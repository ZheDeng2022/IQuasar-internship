      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stem cells are found in body tissues. They can regenerate into more of the same cells or&#xD;
      become other types of cell. Researchers want to use stem cells from taste buds to try to make&#xD;
      cells that secrete insulin. Taste buds are found mostly on the tip and sides of the tongue.&#xD;
      Researchers also want to study if the number of taste buds and stem cells decrease as people&#xD;
      age. They will remove small pieces of tongue tissue (about the size of a pen tip). The taste&#xD;
      buds will grow back. It is hoped that studying taste bud stem cells can lead to new diabetes&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if stem cells from taste buds can be isolated in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults at least 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tongue photograph and mouth inspection. Food coloring will be applied to the tongue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 1 study visit. They will not eat or drink anything 8 hours before.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will give blood and urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will have a tongue biopsy. Vital signs will be checked. The inside of the mouth&#xD;
           will be examined. The tongue may be cleaned. The tongue will be numbed. Five small&#xD;
           pieces of tissue will be taken with a small scissor. Any bleeding will be blotted with&#xD;
           cotton and should stop in minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be monitored for about 30 minutes. They will get a snack or meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will be told how to take care of the tongue for the rest of the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be called a week later to see how the&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES AND SPECIFIC AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this proof-of-concept study are: (1) to investigate whether stem cells,&#xD;
      normally present in tongue epithelium at the base of taste buds, can be propagated in the&#xD;
      lab; if it is, then we wish (2) to investigate whether the stem cells can be differentiated&#xD;
      into glucose-responsive insulin-secreting cells; (3) to investigate if the number of&#xD;
      lingual-derived stem cells and their propagation rate are affected by age; (4) to investigate&#xD;
      if the differentiation capability of the stem cells changes as a factor of aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ninety participants, thirty in each age group: ages 18-39 years, 40-59 years and 60 years old&#xD;
      or older will be recruited for this pilot study. Of the thirty participants in each age&#xD;
      group, fifteen will be men and fifteen will be women. Each eligible participant will have up&#xD;
      to 5 fungiform papillae biopsied on the anterior part of the tongue during Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEDICAL RELEVANCE AND EXPECTED OUTCOME:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of this technique and its standardization to harvest these stem cells in&#xD;
      humans is important for future therapeutic interventions, and may be an invaluable method for&#xD;
      assessing novel cell based regenerative treatments for diabetes.&#xD;
