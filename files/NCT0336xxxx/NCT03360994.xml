  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Princess Margaret's Multidisciplinary Testicular Cancer (TCa) Clinic sees over 25% of&#xD;
      Ontario's testicular cancer patients, many of whom travel long distances. Fortunately, the&#xD;
      majority of cases are confined to the testicle and are managed by &quot;active surveillance&quot; (AS),&#xD;
      whereby blood work and imaging at regular intervals look to detect relapse at a curable&#xD;
      stage. This currently requires multiple clinic visits over 5-9 years. This follow-up can be&#xD;
      time-consuming, costly, difficult to adhere to and unsatisfying for patients. The goal of&#xD;
      this project is to develop an efficient technological platform to perform virtual cancer&#xD;
      follow-up. The platform has been named, &quot;WATChmAN&quot; which stands for Web-based virtual&#xD;
      Testicular CANcer clinic. It will provide a secure, online interface to all virtual follow-up&#xD;
      visits as an alternative to costly and time-consuming travel for in-person visits. The&#xD;
      investigators anticipate improved patient satisfaction and dramatic reductions in the cost of&#xD;
      cancer care follow-up. Moreover, the investigators anticipate improved compliance, which will&#xD;
      lead to safer care. While TCa serves as the working platform, the investigators envision the&#xD;
      end-product to be scalable and generalizable to other cancers (e.g. prostate cancer&#xD;
      surveillance) across the province.&#xD;

      Patients randomized to the standard of care arm will be required to follow the active&#xD;
      surveillance protocol created by the Multidisciplinary Testicular Cancer Clinic at Princess&#xD;
      Margaret Hospital. This involves blood marker and CT tests at predetermined intervals for 5-9&#xD;
      years depending on the patient's testicular cancer diagnosis (seminoma vs. non-seminoma). If&#xD;
      randomized to this group, participants will be required to return to the Multidisciplinary&#xD;
      Testicular Cancer Clinic to receive the results of their surveillance testing face-to-face in&#xD;
      a medical appointment. In addition to these surveillance testing and follow-up visits,&#xD;
      participants will also be asked to complete surveys regarding their satisfaction with the&#xD;
      in-person active surveillance program. These surveys will take approximately 10-15 minutes to&#xD;
      complete and will be predominantly multiple choice. These surveys will be emailed to&#xD;
      participants at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years after the study begins. As per current&#xD;
      standard of care practice, participants may choose to have their imaging completed at a&#xD;
      centre outside of the UHN. In these cases, participants will be required to obtain and send&#xD;
      CDs with their imaging and reports to their most responsible oncologist at Princess Margaret.&#xD;
      Blood marker visits can be performed anywhere without sending the results to Princess&#xD;
      Margaret.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the WATChmAN group will also be required to follow the active&#xD;
      surveillance protocol created by the Multidisciplinary Testicular Cancer Clinic at Princess&#xD;
      Margaret Hospital. If randomized to this group, a physician from the Multidisciplinary&#xD;
      Testicular Cancer Clinic will still review the participant's surveillance testing results but&#xD;
      will interact with the WATChmAN platform instead of receiving their results face-to-face in a&#xD;
      medical appointment. Specifically, if randomized to this group participants will be required&#xD;
      to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Asked, but not required, to have their picture taken to be uploaded into the WATChmAN&#xD;
           platform. Their photo will only be stored on the password-protected WATChmAN database&#xD;
           and will serve to cue facial recognition in the physicians reviewing their results and&#xD;
           therefore enhance recall of their personal history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirm their registration in the WATChmAN program via a welcome email&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respond to WATChmAN generated messages and reminders requesting whether or not their&#xD;
           upcoming surveillance testing (e.g. blood tests and/or CT imaging scans) has been&#xD;
           completed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respond to WATChmAN generated messages to confirm where their upcoming testing (e.g.&#xD;
           blood tests and/or CT imaging scans) has been completed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check their results on the WATChmAN platform and express any concerns/issues they might&#xD;
           have about their treatment and/or health to their most responsible oncologist through&#xD;
           the WATChmAN platform&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirm receipt of messages concerning whether they need or do not need to come in for&#xD;
           an in-person follow up visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Return to the Multidisciplinary Testicular Cancer Clinic to see a physician face-to-face&#xD;
           for a final exit follow-up appointment when their active surveillance treatment is&#xD;
           complete&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If getting their CT imaging visits outside the UHN, obtain and send CDs with their&#xD;
           imaging and reports to the WATChmAN research coordinator for upload into the WATChmAN&#xD;
           system (please note: this requirement is identical for patients in the standard of care&#xD;
           group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants do not need to send in their blood test results. Their blood marker visits&#xD;
           can be performed anywhere without needing to send them to the WATChmAN coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, in addition to these surveillance testing and WATChmAN interactions, participants&#xD;
      will also be asked to complete surveys regarding their satisfaction with their virtual active&#xD;
      surveillance program. These surveys will take approximately 10-15 minutes to complete and&#xD;
      will be predominantly multiple choice. These surveys will be emailed to participants at 6&#xD;
      months, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years after the study begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is predicted that the WATChmAN virtual platform will take at least one year to construct;&#xD;
      however, the researchers involved in this study believe there is value in launching this&#xD;
      virtual clinic without delay. This will also allow further improvements to the design of the&#xD;
      WATChmAN platform as it is being built. Therefore, this study will be divided into two&#xD;
      stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage I: During this stage, a clinical research coordinator alongside a nurse from the&#xD;
      Genitourinary Clinic at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre will manually perform all the&#xD;
      anticipated functions of the WATChmAN platform. The clinical research coordinator will be&#xD;
      responsible for all the administrative roles of WATChmAN including sending appointment&#xD;
      reminders and scheduling follow-up virtual appointments. The nurse will be responsible for&#xD;
      all the clinical functionalities of the WATChmAN platform. They will manually track patients'&#xD;
      blood and imaging test results and work closely with the Multidisciplinary Testicular Cancer&#xD;
      Clinic physicians to ensure that all patient surveillance results are reviewed. Patients&#xD;
      randomized to the in-person AS group will receive the traditional standard of care which&#xD;
      includes returning to clinic to meet with physicians face-to-face to receive imaging and&#xD;
      blood testing results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage II: During stage 2 of this investigation, the WATChmAN platform will be responsible for&#xD;
      automatically populating the virtual clinic with blood and imaging results, sending&#xD;
      appointment reminders and scheduling follow up appointments. The responsibilities of patients&#xD;
      randomized to the WATChmAN group will be to acknowledge these email/text appointment&#xD;
      reminders (i.e. yes/no to being aware of upcoming appointments), checking their results&#xD;
      virtually and scheduling follow-up appointments through the WATChmAN platform. The research&#xD;
      coordinator and nurse will continue to oversee the WATChmAN function but will not be manually&#xD;
      collating surveillance results (markers/imaging etc.). Patients randomized to the in-person&#xD;
      AS group receive the traditional standard of care, returning to the clinic to meet with a&#xD;
      physician face-to-face to receive their surveillance imaging and blood marker results.&#xD;
