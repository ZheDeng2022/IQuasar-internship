    <textblock>
      This pilot early phase I trial studies the side effects of vaccine therapy in treating&#xD;
      patients with glioblastoma that has come back. Vaccines made from a person's white blood&#xD;
      cells mixed with tumor proteins from another person's glioblastoma tumors may help the body&#xD;
      build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Giving vaccine therapy may work&#xD;
      better in treating patients with glioblastoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and feasibility of malignant glioma tumor lysate-pulsed autologous&#xD;
      dendritic cell vaccine (autologous dendritic cell [DC] / allogeneic glioblastoma multiforme&#xD;
      [GBM] culture lysate vaccination) in glioblastoma patients at first or second recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To document survival and progression-free survival in glioblastoma patients at first or&#xD;
      second recurrence receiving autologous DC / allogeneic GBM culture lysate vaccination and&#xD;
      compared to historical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the ability of autologous DC / GBM culture lysate vaccination to generate&#xD;
      multiple tumor-associated antigen (TAA)-specific immune responses in GBM patients at first or&#xD;
      second recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess the relationship between ability tumor induced TAA-specific immune responses and&#xD;
      evidence of immunosuppression (peripheral blood immunophenotyping by flow cytometry)&#xD;
      following autologous DC / allogeneic GBM culture lysate vaccination in GBM patients at first&#xD;
      or second recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess the relationship between efficacy endpoints (survival, progression-free survival,&#xD;
      tumor response) and tumor-associated antigen immune response following autologous DC /&#xD;
      allogeneic GBM culture lysate vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess the relationship between efficacy endpoints (survival, progression-free survival,&#xD;
      tumor response) and evidence of immunosuppression at baseline and over time with autologous&#xD;
      DC / allogeneic GBM culture lysate vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive malignant glioma tumor lysate-pulsed autologous dendritic cell vaccine&#xD;
      intradermally (ID) on days 1, 3, and 5 of courses 2 and 3, and on day 1 of subsequent&#xD;
      courses. Treatment with malignant glioma tumor lysate-pulsed autologous dendritic cell&#xD;
      vaccine repeats every 21 days for up to 13 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 5 years.&#xD;

    <description>Change in immunologic correlates before and after vaccination treatment will be evaluated and summarized both quantitatively and graphically.
