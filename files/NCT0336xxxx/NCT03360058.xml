  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To ensure that patients who are overweight or obese and have type 2 diabetes are identified,&#xD;
      receive personalised diabetes care, have the issue of weight raised and explained in a&#xD;
      non-judgemental manner by staff in primary care, and are referred on to weight management&#xD;
      services as appropriate ensuring equity of access across NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims of the whole project:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To improve GP/ primary care staff knowledge of the evidence base for the management of&#xD;
           diabetes when there is co-existing obesity and local care pathways&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To increase GP/ primary care staff knowledge of and confidence in their role in raising&#xD;
           the issue of weight management,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To improve primary care referral rates of appropriate patients who are overweight or&#xD;
           obese and have type 2 diabetes, and are &quot;ready to change&quot; to NHS funded weight&#xD;
           management services&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To improve patient uptake of and attendance at NHS funded weight management services NB&#xD;
           This is a service evaluation of a training programme being delivered by NHS Greater&#xD;
           Glasgow and Clyde Health Improvement. Full ethical approvals are being sought due to the&#xD;
           randomised design and so that results can be generalised and published.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Glasgow and Clyde weight management service (GCWMS) delivers a specialist&#xD;
      multi-disciplinary, multi-component weight management programme throughout the Glasgow and&#xD;
      Clyde area. In a recent evaluation of the service, the authors highlighted that 27% of the&#xD;
      patients who are referred to the programme do not opt into the service. This describes&#xD;
      patients who are referred via their GP practice and do not contact the service to opt into an&#xD;
      initial assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, Brook et al described initial uptake and engagement of a small weight management&#xD;
      programme of 502 patients. In addition to completing an extensive questionnaire, patients&#xD;
      were requested to call to make an appointment with the service personally. Of those referred&#xD;
      to the programme, 46% did not opt in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Engaging patients in a weight management programme is especially difficult, even when the&#xD;
      intervention is provided via the primary care route. For example, The Counterweight Project,&#xD;
      a weight management programme delivered via the GP surgery, has been taken up by a number of&#xD;
      surgeries in Scotland, however after 2 years, one fifth of enlisted practices failed to enrol&#xD;
      patients onto the programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even when GP's do address matters of weight related behaviour, there is often disagreement&#xD;
      from the patient that the topic has been raised. In a sample of 456 patients, 39% of patients&#xD;
      disagreed with GP reporting about the content of the discussion during consultations&#xD;
      regarding weight, diet and physical activity. In particular, GP's reported more occasions of&#xD;
      discussing weight than patients in 12.5% of consultations. Patients' likeliness to engage in&#xD;
      a weight management programme is also influenced by practice endorsement and opinion of the&#xD;
      GP of the intervention available in addition to other factors: clear understanding of the&#xD;
      programme, clear understanding of the programme goals, structured pro-active follow-up and&#xD;
      perception of positive outcomes.&#xD;
