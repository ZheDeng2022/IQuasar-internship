  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our treatment, SENSE Theatre, combines several well-documented, effective behavioral&#xD;
      strategies and theatre techniques. The proposed project will extend previous findings showing&#xD;
      improving improvement in memory for faces. The multisite randomized control trial will&#xD;
      include a large sample of 240 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) randomly assigned&#xD;
      to the experimental (SENSE Theatre) or an active control condition (Tackling Teenage&#xD;
      Together).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent findings from a randomized control trial (RCT) show immediate between-group effects&#xD;
      and evidence of target engagement on the hypothesized mechanism of action, memory for faces,&#xD;
      which was evaluated by neuropsychological and event-related potential (ERP) measures.&#xD;
      Moreover, the RCT demonstrated treatment effects on social communication skills that&#xD;
      generalized to home and community settings. Finally, maintained treatment effects were&#xD;
      observed on communication symptoms. The proposed project will extend these findings and&#xD;
      provide a stronger test of efficacy using a multisite RCT of SENSE Theatre with a large&#xD;
      sample of participants with ASD (8 to 16 years) randomized to an experimental and an active&#xD;
      control group. The RCT will assess target engagement of memory for faces and functional&#xD;
      change in social interaction with peers. Thus, the overarching aim of the study is to&#xD;
      determine whether detected changes in face memory and social interaction are due to the SENSE&#xD;
      Theatre treatment and the extent to which these changes generalize and maintain. If predicted&#xD;
      results occur, it will provide strong empirical support for a community-based treatment that&#xD;
      has generalized effects on a set of core deficits that otherwise have life-long consequences&#xD;
      for children and adolescents with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8/18/2021: Record was updated to delete the outcome measure &quot;Computer memory for faces&quot; as it&#xD;
      was not included as a primary outcome variable in the IRB approved protocol dated 9/13/2017.&#xD;

    <measure>NEPSY Memory for Faces Delayed</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to end of treatment (10 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>A measure of face memory following a delay. Possible score ranges from a scaled score of 1-19 with high scores reflecting better face memory.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidental Face Memory (IFM) Event-Related Potential (ERP) task</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to end of treatment (10 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>The IFM involves passive viewing of novel faces one of which repeats. The dependent measure is the difference in ERP amplitude of 250-500 ms time window between the repeated and single face presentation. Positive values indicate better face memory.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-treatment (10 weeks), and two-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The SRS is a measure of social competence that is administered by parents pertaining to behaviors characteristic of children with autism. T scores range from 38-90 with higher scores reflecting more pathology.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adaptive Behavior Scales for Children (ABAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-treatment (10 weeks), and two-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The ABAS is a parental rating scale pertaining to various adaptive behaviors in a child, such as social and communication skills. Standard scores for the subscales range from 1 to 19. Higher scores reflect better skills in each domain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Contextual Assessment of Social Skills (CASS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-treatment (10 weeks), and two-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The CASS is an observational measure of social interaction skills with two similar age peers. There are two conditions which include a Interested Condition and a Bored Condition. The behaviors will be coded based on raw scores from 1 to 7 with 7 reflecting better ability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-treatment (10 weeks), and two-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The CBCL is a parent report measure of a variety of symptom domains relevant for children with autism and related neurodevelopment disorders. T scores range from 40 to 100.</description>
