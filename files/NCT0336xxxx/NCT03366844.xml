  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to assess the feasibility of pembrolizumab (study drug) combined&#xD;
      with standard radiation to the tumor (tumor boost) before patients undergo standard treatment&#xD;
      that can consist of one or more of the following: breast-conserving surgery, radiation to the&#xD;
      entire breast/chest wall after surgery, and chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will receive two doses of the study drug intravenously (through the vein)&#xD;
      before their planned breast surgery or chemotherapy. The study drug will be administered&#xD;
      three weeks apart. At the time of the second dose, radiation to the tumor in the affected&#xD;
      breast will be given. This type of radiation treatment is called a &quot;tumor boost&quot;, which is a&#xD;
      standard part of radiation therapy for breast cancer that may occur either before or after&#xD;
      planned breast-conserving surgery. Patients will receive breast surgery or begin chemotherapy&#xD;
      approximately six weeks after your first dose of the study drug.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With more than 1 million new cases diagnosed yearly worldwide, breast cancer is a global&#xD;
      public health burden. Over the past decade, molecular subtyping of breast cancer has&#xD;
      identified intrinsic subtypes that may be at enhanced risk for both local and distant&#xD;
      recurrence. This study focuses on the immunogenicity of high-risk breast cancer subtypes that&#xD;
      are likely to display a dense lymphocytic infiltration including including TNBC and HR+/HER2-&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune build up via immune co-stimulatory molecules permits the ensuing immune response to&#xD;
      strengthen and destroy cancer systemically. Thus, the effect of the anti-tumor immune&#xD;
      response initiated by the radiation to an intact tumor by combination with checkpoint&#xD;
      blockade is increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is an optimal immunotherapy agent to study, as this agent has recently been FDA&#xD;
      approved for use in multiple tumor types. It is therefore ready to be tested for efficacy in&#xD;
      other disease sites and in combination with other treatments.&#xD;
