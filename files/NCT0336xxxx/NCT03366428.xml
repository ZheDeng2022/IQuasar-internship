    <description>Adverse events (AEs) were to be coded using MedDRA Version 20.1 and assigned severity grades based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an AE that occurred, having been absent before the first dose of study drug, or had worsened in severity or seriousness after initiating the study drug until 47 days after last dose of study drug.</description>
