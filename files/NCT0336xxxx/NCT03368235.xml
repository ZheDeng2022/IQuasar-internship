  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2a study to be run in 2-3 countries in European Union involving 5-6 sites. It&#xD;
      will enroll approximately 80 patients to ensure 40 randomized with active rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis. The treatment period is 2 weeks and total study duration per patient is&#xD;
      approximately 1 month. The study drugs are AZD9567 40 mg (an oral SGRM) and the comparator is&#xD;
      prednisolone 20mg. The primary endpoint is DAS28 including evaluation of 28 joints and&#xD;
      C-reactive protein. Safety parameters will also be evaluated and a biomarker program is&#xD;
      included for future research.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This randomized double blind with double dummy technique phase 2a study will be run in 2-3 EU&#xD;
      countries, most likely Sweden, Denmark and The Netherlands involving 5-6 sites. It is&#xD;
      estimated that 80-100 patients have to be enrolled to ensure the randomization target of 40.&#xD;
      The study population is patients with rheumatoid arthritis on stable treatment with&#xD;
      conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) with an active flare. It is a&#xD;
      two-arm parallel study and the randomization ratio is 1:1 to the two weeks of once daily&#xD;
      treatment of 40 mg of AZD9567 and 20 mg prednisolone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of AZD9567 40 mg, compared to prednisolone 20&#xD;
      mg in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis in spite of stable treatment with&#xD;
      conventional and/or s.c/i.v. biological DMARDs and the primary variable is change from&#xD;
      baseline in 28 joint Disease Activity Score using CRP (DAS28 - CRP). As secondary variables&#xD;
      swollen and tenderness of 66-68 joints and safety variables are also included. For&#xD;
      exploratively purposes there is also a biomarker program, collecting blood samples for future&#xD;
      research.&#xD;

    <measure>Least Square (LS) Mean Change From Baseline in 28 Joint Disease Activity Score Using C-Reactive Protein (DAS28-CRP) at Day 15</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28-CRP is a measure of disease activity in RA. The score includes the number of tender and swollen joints (out of 28), CRP level (a measure of inflammation in the blood), and the patient's global assessment (PGA) of health (ranging from very well to very poor). The DAS28-CRP was derived as follows: 0.56 x √[tender joint count 28 (TJC28)] + 0.28 x √[swollen joint count 28 (SJC28)] + 0.014 x global health (GH) + 0.36 x Ln(CRP+1) + 0.96 to produce the overall DAS28-CRP score on a scale ranged from 0-10 with higher score indicating worse RA symptoms. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing assessment (scheduled or unscheduled) prior to the first dose of study treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>A total of 66 joints (33 left, 33 right) were evaluated for swelling. The swollen joint count represents the number of joints in which there was synovial fluid and or soft tissue swelling, but not if bony overgrowth was found. A swollen joint was scored as 0 (absent) and 1 (present) for each joint. The SJC66 was calculated as sum of swollen joints with present status on electronic case report form (eCRF). The swollen joint count ranged from 0-66 with higher score indicating disease severity. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing assessment (scheduled or unscheduled) prior to the first dose of study treatment.</description>

A tender joint was scored as 0 (absent) and 1 (present) for each joint. The TJC68 was calculated as sum of tender joints with present status on eCRF. The tender joint count ranged from 0-68 with higher score indicating disease severity. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing assessment (scheduled or unscheduled) prior to the first dose of study treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>TJC28 was evaluated as one of the components that comprised the DAS28-score. A total of 28 joints (14 left, 14 right) were evaluated for tenderness as obtained from the joint count right or left eCRF. The tender joint count represents the number of joints in which pain was reported. A tender joint was scored as 0 (absent) and 1 (present) for each joint. The TJC28 was calculated as sum of tender joints with present status on eCRF. The tender joint count ranged from 0-28 with higher score indicating disease severity. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing assessment (scheduled or unscheduled) prior to the first dose of study treatment.</description>

    <description>SJC28 was evaluated as one of the components that comprised the DAS28-score. A total of 28 joints (14 left, 14 right) were evaluated for swelling as obtained from the joint count right or left eCRF. The swollen joint count represents the number of joints in which there was synovial fluid and or soft tissue swelling, but not if bony overgrowth was found. A swollen joint was scored as 0 (absent) and 1 (present) for each joint. The SJC28 was calculated as sum of swollen joints with present status on eCRF. The swollen joint count ranged from 0-28 with higher score indicating disease severity.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>GH was evaluated as one of the components that comprised the DAS28-score. Participant's GH was measured using PGA of disease activity by means of the visual analogue scale (VAS). The PGA VAS consists of a 100 millimeter (mm) long scale ranging from 0 (very well) to 100 (very poor). Higher score indicated greater disease severity. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing assessment (scheduled or unscheduled) prior to the first dose of study treatment.</description>

        <title>Least Square (LS) Mean Change From Baseline in 28 Joint Disease Activity Score Using C-Reactive Protein (DAS28-CRP) at Day 15</title>
        <description>The DAS28-CRP is a measure of disease activity in RA. The score includes the number of tender and swollen joints (out of 28), CRP level (a measure of inflammation in the blood), and the patient's global assessment (PGA) of health (ranging from very well to very poor). The DAS28-CRP was derived as follows: 0.56 x √[tender joint count 28 (TJC28)] + 0.28 x √[swollen joint count 28 (SJC28)] + 0.014 x global health (GH) + 0.36 x Ln(CRP+1) + 0.96 to produce the overall DAS28-CRP score on a scale ranged from 0-10 with higher score indicating worse RA symptoms. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing assessment (scheduled or unscheduled) prior to the first dose of study treatment.</description>

        <title>LS Mean Change From Baseline in SJC66 Score at Day 15</title>
        <description>A total of 66 joints (33 left, 33 right) were evaluated for swelling. The swollen joint count represents the number of joints in which there was synovial fluid and or soft tissue swelling, but not if bony overgrowth was found. A swollen joint was scored as 0 (absent) and 1 (present) for each joint. The SJC66 was calculated as sum of swollen joints with present status on electronic case report form (eCRF). The swollen joint count ranged from 0-66 with higher score indicating disease severity. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing assessment (scheduled or unscheduled) prior to the first dose of study treatment.</description>

        <title>LS Mean Change From Baseline in GH Score at Day 15</title>
        <description>GH was evaluated as one of the components that comprised the DAS28-score. Participant's GH was measured using PGA of disease activity by means of the visual analogue scale (VAS). The PGA VAS consists of a 100 millimeter (mm) long scale ranging from 0 (very well) to 100 (very poor). Higher score indicated greater disease severity. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing assessment (scheduled or unscheduled) prior to the first dose of study treatment.</description>

          <title>LS Mean Change From Baseline in Participant's Assessment of Physical Function Score at Day 15</title>
          <description>Participant's assessment of physical function score was evaluated as one of the components that comprised the ACR. The participant's assessment of physical function across 8 functional areas was measured by health assessment questionnaire. The total score ranging from 0 (no difficulty) to 24 (inability to perform tasks). Higher score indicated greater disease severity. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing assessment (scheduled or unscheduled) prior to the first dose of study treatment.</description>
