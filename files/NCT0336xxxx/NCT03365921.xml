      This study is a mono-center, randomization, double-blind clinical trial in healthy subjects&#xD;
      between 18 to 50. Under the premise of full informed consent, 360 subjects that meet the&#xD;
      requirement of clinical trial in the age of 18-50 will be divided into 3 groups and injected&#xD;
      3 consecutive batches of Hecolin® separately. The main outcome measures are the&#xD;
      immunogenicity evaluation and safety surveillance after inoculation according to prescribed&#xD;
      immunization procedure.&#xD;
