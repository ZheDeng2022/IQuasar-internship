  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To evaluate embolization as a treatment for OA related knee pain versus placebo to&#xD;
      demonstrate the actual effect of embolization on pain and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: There will be 21 subjects enrolled over the age 40 with knee pain secondary to&#xD;
      arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): This will be a single-blinded randomized-controlled study of GAE versus&#xD;
      placebo in a small population with knee pain secondary to arthritis to determine safety and&#xD;
      efficacy. Clinical procedures and evaluations will consist of a preoperative screening&#xD;
      assessment to determine if the potential study subject meets the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, enrollment, surgical procedure for geniculate artery embolization, and follow-up&#xD;
      visits at 24 hours, 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6, &amp; 12 months. An MRI may be performed after the 1-month&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-blinded randomized-controlled study of GAE versus placebo in a small&#xD;
      population with knee pain secondary to arthritis to determine safety and efficacy. After&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval of a written informed consent and over,&#xD;
      approximately a 24 month duration, N=21 subjects will be recruited. Only subjects â‰¥ 40 years&#xD;
      will be screened for study recruitment. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio of&#xD;
      GAE:Placebo and will be blinded from study treatment (see flow chart below). The placebo&#xD;
      procedure will be a diagnostic angiogram of the knee, without embolization. Appropriate&#xD;
      measures will be taken to ensure patients and nursing staff caring for the patient are&#xD;
      blinded to assignment. Each patient will be told at the time of recruitment that they may be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to sham, but if after 1 month they have not had symptom improvement, their&#xD;
      assigned procedure would be revealed and, if they had undergone a sham procedure, they will&#xD;
      be allowed to proceed with embolization. This second procedure should be shorter than a&#xD;
      complete angiogram and embolization, as the detailed angiogram will not need to be repeated,&#xD;
      and therefore both arms will have similar total radiation dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical procedures and evaluations will consist of a preoperative screening assessment to&#xD;
      determine if the potential study subject meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      enrollment, surgical procedure for geniculate artery embolization, and follow-up visits at 24&#xD;
      hours, 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6, &amp; 12 months. An MRI may be performed after the 1-month visit.&#xD;

    <measure>Mean WOMAC Scores at Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months following procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) will be used to measure function. This is a score derived from a questionnaire in which the patient answers questions regarding rheumatic symptoms in the subcategories of pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and physical function (17 items). Individuals select the level of difficulty they have performing various tasks using a 5 point Likert scale (0=None, 1=Slightly, 3=Very, 4=Extremely). Then, results are scored with a total score (minimum 0; maximum 96). A higher score indicates more difficulty in each of the categories.</description>

    <measure>Mean Patient Pain as Measured by VAS at Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months following procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The pain intensity is assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS), which is a horizontal line 100 mm in length. Subjects mark the VAS with a single vertical line to indicate their current pain level, with 0 mm representing &quot;No Pain&quot; and 100 mm representing &quot;Worst Possible Pain&quot;. Pain will be assessed at each of the patient's follow-up visits and used to measure the change from baseline (prior to the GAE procedure). The investigators will use this to measure if the patient's pain level decreases.</description>

Individuals select the level of difficulty they have performing various tasks using a 5 point Likert scale (0=None, 1=Slightly, 3=Very, 4=Extremely). Then, results are scored with a total score (minimum 0; maximum 96). A higher score indicates more difficulty in each of the categories.</description>

          <description>The pain intensity is assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS), which is a horizontal line 100 mm in length. Subjects mark the VAS with a single vertical line to indicate their current pain level, with 0 mm representing &quot;No Pain&quot; and 100 mm representing &quot;Worst Possible Pain&quot;. Pain will be assessed at each of the patient's follow-up visits and used to measure the change from baseline (prior to the GAE procedure). The investigators will use this to measure if the patient's pain level decreases.</description>

          <title>Mean WOMAC Scores at Month 6</title>
          <description>Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) will be used to measure function. This is a score derived from a questionnaire in which the patient answers questions regarding rheumatic symptoms in the subcategories of pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and physical function (17 items). Individuals select the level of difficulty they have performing various tasks using a 5 point Likert scale (0=None, 1=Slightly, 3=Very, 4=Extremely). Then, results are scored with a total score (minimum 0; maximum 96). A higher score indicates more difficulty in each of the categories.</description>
          <population>One participant was excluded from the GAE arm due to increased pain that resulted in additional medication and was excluded from the analysis. All sham participants crossed over to receive treatment after 1 month, thus no 6-month data available for this group. One crossover participant did not have WOMAC data available for the 6 month visit.</population>

        <description>The pain intensity is assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS), which is a horizontal line 100 mm in length. Subjects mark the VAS with a single vertical line to indicate their current pain level, with 0 mm representing &quot;No Pain&quot; and 100 mm representing &quot;Worst Possible Pain&quot;. Pain will be assessed at each of the patient's follow-up visits and used to measure the change from baseline (prior to the GAE procedure). The investigators will use this to measure if the patient's pain level decreases.</description>

        <title>Mean WOMAC Scores at Month 3</title>
        <description>Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) will be used to measure function. This is a score derived from a questionnaire in which the patient answers questions regarding rheumatic symptoms in the subcategories of pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and physical function (17 items). Individuals select the level of difficulty they have performing various tasks using a 5 point Likert scale (0=None, 1=Slightly, 3=Very, 4=Extremely). Then, results are scored with a total score (minimum 0; maximum 96). A higher score indicates more difficulty in each of the categories.</description>

        <population>One participant was excluded from the GAE arm due to increased pain that resulted in additional medication and was excluded from the analysis. One additional participant in this arm did not have data available at the 3 month visit. All sham participants crossed over to receive treatment after 1 month, thus no 3-month data available for this group. One patient in the crossover arm did not have WOMAC data available for the 3 month visit.</population>

        <title>Mean Patient Pain as Measured by VAS at Month 3</title>
        <description>The pain intensity is assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS), which is a horizontal line 100 mm in length. Subjects mark the VAS with a single vertical line to indicate their current pain level, with 0 mm representing &quot;No Pain&quot; and 100 mm representing &quot;Worst Possible Pain&quot;. Pain will be assessed at each of the patient's follow-up visits and used to measure the change from baseline (prior to the GAE procedure). The investigators will use this to measure if the patient's pain level decreases.</description>
