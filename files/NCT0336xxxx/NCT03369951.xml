  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV, multi-center open-label pharmacokinetic trial studying the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single dose of Minocin IV. Up to 67 subjects will&#xD;
      be enrolled to obtain 50 evaluable, ICU patients who are already receiving antimicrobial&#xD;
      therapy for a known or suspected Gram-negative infection. The entire study duration will be&#xD;
      approximately 16 months and each subject participation duration will be approximately 2 days.&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at approximately 13 clinical sites. Each subject will receive a&#xD;
      single 200 mg dose of Minocin IV infused over approximately 60 minutes. Each subject will&#xD;
      have 7 PK samples collected (1 pre-dose, 6 post-dose) at designated time points over a ~48&#xD;
      hour period following the start of the Minocin IV infusion. The primary objectives are: 1) To&#xD;
      characterize minocycline PK at the population level in critically-ill adults, with illness&#xD;
      known or suspected to be caused by infection with Gram-negative bacteria and 2) To assess&#xD;
      patient-level and clinical covariates associated with minocycline pharmacokinetic properties&#xD;
      in critically-ill adults, with illness known or suspected to be caused by infection with&#xD;
      Gram-negative bacteria.&#xD;

      Gram-negative bacteria. Up to 67 subjects will be enrolled in order to obtain 50 PK evaluable&#xD;
      subjects in the study. To be considered PK evaluable, a subject must receive the full&#xD;
      infusion of study drug, and is required to have at least 3 PK samples collected in the first&#xD;
      12 hours post dose and at least 1 PK sample collected 24-48 hours post dose. Subjects who are&#xD;
      dosed with minocycline but do not meet this PK sampling requirement will still be included in&#xD;
      the population PK analysis, but an additional subject will be enrolled as a replacement to&#xD;
      meet the goal of having 50 PK evaluable subjects with intensive PK sampling.&#xD;
