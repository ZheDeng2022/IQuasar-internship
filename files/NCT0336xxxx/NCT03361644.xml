  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare the effects of High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) with Moderate&#xD;
      Intensity Continuous Training (CMIT) as part of a lifestyle intervention program on BMI&#xD;
      change in adolescents age 12-16 with obesity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents will be randomized to a 12-week lifestyle intervention including behavioral and&#xD;
      dietary interventions, and one of two exercise training conditions, HIIT or CMIT).&#xD;
      Adolescents in the HIIT treatment will participate in treadmill exercise in 1-minute&#xD;
      intervals of challenging intensities with recovery periods in between, gradually increasing&#xD;
      the number of intervals over the course of the study. Adolescents in the CMIT treatment will&#xD;
      participate in a constant moderate intensity treadmill exercise, gradually increasing the&#xD;
      duration of the exercise over the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both parents and teens will have height and weight measurements taken, complete behavior&#xD;
      questionnaires and wear an activity monitor for one week at baseline, 12 weeks and 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescents will have a physical exam by a study medical provider before starting the&#xD;
      intervention. Adolescents will also have blood work, an oral glucose tolerance test, an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram, body composition measurements and a maximal graded exercise test done at&#xD;
      baseline, and again at one or more time points. Adolescents will also complete a detailed&#xD;
      food log at those time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescents will exercise at the study gym 3 evenings a week for 12 weeks. On one of those&#xD;
      evenings teens will also attend a 60-minute individual behavioral weight management session.&#xD;
      Nine of these are with a behavior coach, and 3 with a dietitian. Parents will also attend one&#xD;
      introductory session with the behavior coach, join the teen for the 3 sessions with the&#xD;
      dietitian, and review adolescent individual goals and identify parent support goals at the&#xD;
      end of each behavior session.&#xD;
