      low-level laser therapy and orthotic insole on pain, function and muscle strength in subjects&#xD;
      with posterior tendon insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized comparative intervention study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Place to do research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in the Prosthetic Orthotics and Biomechanics Center of the&#xD;
      Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation of the Faculty of Health Sciences of the&#xD;
      Eastern Mediterranean University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evoluotion and Sample Size Of Research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects aged 18-60 who volunteered by the physician from Eastern Mediterranean University&#xD;
      who had been diagnosed with tibialis posterior insufficiency would be included in the&#xD;
      study.According to the power analysis using G-Power program; a total of 52 subjects will be&#xD;
      included in the calculation of Cohen d = 0.8, α = 0.05, β = 0.20, assuming that the&#xD;
      nonparametric Mann Whitney-U test is used for comparison between the two groups. It was&#xD;
      decided that 60 people would be taken from the survey without a 20% loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers Including / Exploring Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Taking the diagnosis of stage 1 - 2 tibialis posterior insufficiency by the physician,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be between the ages of 18 and 60,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The absence of a different orthopedic or neurological disease that may affect the lower&#xD;
           extremity biomechanics,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not having a systemic disease that keeps feet. Having not received any treatment from&#xD;
           the foot area in the last 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Having no ambulation without help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reserch Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study consists of two groups and the subjects will be taken to these groups using a&#xD;
      random number table. One group of our study is a and orthotic insole group and the other&#xD;
      group is a low -level laser therapy group. The orthotic insole group will use their special&#xD;
      insoles for 8 weeks. The low-level laser therapy group will receive treatment at the&#xD;
      Prosthesis Orthotic Biomechanics Center of the Eastern Mediterranean University three times a&#xD;
      week for 5 weeks. Laser will be applied along the tibial posterior tendon. Before the data is&#xD;
      collected, the individual will be informed about the equipment to be used in the tests. There&#xD;
      will be 1 trial before assessment and treatment so that participants can become familiar with&#xD;
      the equipment. All assessments and insoles will be applied by the same physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Vehicles and Properties:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be applied to the patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.Pain Assessment ; with digital algometer 2.Muscle strength assessment ; with Isokinetic&#xD;
      Dynamometer 3.Evulation of Foot Function ; with Foot Function Index 4.Other Assessment ; Foot&#xD;
      Posture Index, International Physical Activity Index(short form)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pain Assessment ; It will be assessed with pain algometer. Before starting treatment,&#xD;
           measurements will be taken at three different points of the tibialis posterior tendon.&#xD;
           Three measurements from each point will be taken. The right and left foot will be&#xD;
           evaluated. the previously assessed regions will be reevaluated at the end of the&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Muscle strength assessment Using the isokinetic dynamometer (Humac Norm Isocynetic&#xD;
           Dynanometer), the force values of the inverter and the evertor muscles of the foot will&#xD;
           be measured.Before starting the test, a standard warm-up program will be applied for 3&#xD;
           minutes without resistance in the patient bicycle ergometer. At the same time, passive&#xD;
           stretching of the patients' gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. Subjects movements will be&#xD;
           evaluated at 10 repetitions at 180º / sec, 10 repetitions at a rate of 240º / sec.&#xD;
           Before each angular velocity, subjects are allowed to perform 3 repeated trials and&#xD;
           after 10 seconds rest, tests will be applied. Unilateral measurement will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evulation of Foot Function ; with Foot Function Index. This scale evaluates the severity&#xD;
           of foot pain in different situations. It consists of 3 subtitles and contains 23&#xD;
           questions in total. Turkish version adaptation study is done, valid and reliable&#xD;
           measure. Each question takes between 0 and 10 points. the total score is divided by the&#xD;
           number of questions answered and scaled by finding the value over 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Other Assessment;&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Foot Postüre Index : Index will be used to determine the flat foot of the&#xD;
                individuals. According to the scale, a total score of -12 to +12 is obtain with a&#xD;
                score under six headings during static standing. Medial longitudinal arch height&#xD;
                increases with increasing points, medial longitudinal height decreases with&#xD;
                increasing points. Our study will include individuals who have received a minimum&#xD;
                score of +6 as in similar research.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. International Physical Activity Index (short form) (IPAQ) : The index will be used&#xD;
                to determine the physical activity levels of individuals. With the scale of Turkish&#xD;
                validity and reliability studies, low, medium and high intensity activity periods&#xD;
                of the individuals in the last week will be evaluated under 7 questions and the&#xD;
                average energy expenditure value will be obtained in kcal / week.Individuals will&#xD;
                be asked to do this questionnaire on a regular basis every week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-level Laser Therapy Group; A low density laser with a power density of 0.05-0.10 (w /&#xD;
      cm2), a therapeutic dose of 0.7-7 (j / cm 2) of gallium-arsenic 904 nm will be applied. It&#xD;
      will be administered 3 times a week for 5 weeks. Laser treatment will be applied along the&#xD;
      tibialis posterior tendon. 3 different point applications will be done. Proximal tibial&#xD;
      tendon, distally tibial tendon and medial malleoli posterior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orthotic Insole Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals will be operated by pressing on a fixed pedobarograph (Medilogic, platform basic,&#xD;
      Germany) embedded in a 5-m wooden floor and foot pressure measurements will be taken. Of the&#xD;
      three successful measurements made, the one closest to the normal walk will be recorded.&#xD;
      According to the foot pressure measurement, the MLA, TA and MTK attachments will be used in&#xD;
      the insoles design developed by the modeling program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individual will use the insoles for 8 weeks with the appropriate footwear. individuals&#xD;
      will be required to fill in the international physical activity scale each week. As well as&#xD;
      how many hours a day each of his or her inviduals have been using their insoles. A table will&#xD;
      be created and given to the individuals to write how many hours they are using.&#xD;
