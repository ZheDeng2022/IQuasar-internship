  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is the realization of tests at home and in Hospitals or&#xD;
      Functional Rehabilitation for the improvement of the communication with the family and&#xD;
      medical entourage, the facility of the emotional expression, the evaluation of the pain, the&#xD;
      control of home automation to increase their autonomy, facilitated their reintegration at&#xD;
      home. The work is the last step of the research program started in 2009, with the&#xD;
      optimization of the installation of the system, the improvement of physical and computer&#xD;
      ergonomic aspects and the development of dedicated interfaces according to the type of&#xD;
      disability and needs. of each one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A work upstream of the definition of specifications taking into account the medical&#xD;
      constraints was realized and the actions of improvement of the models, the algorithms, the&#xD;
      robustness and the effectiveness of the treatment are in progress . The specific adaptation&#xD;
      to concrete cases should lead to a system that allows 90% of the population of people with&#xD;
      disabilities to exploit the system and significantly improve their level of communication,&#xD;
      autonomy and in fact their daily lives.&#xD;
