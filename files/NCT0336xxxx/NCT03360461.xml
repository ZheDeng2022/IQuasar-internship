  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EMI-137 in laparoscopic colonic resections is a single-centre stage IIa developmental study&#xD;
      to explore and evaluate the ability of EMI-137 to produce visible intra-operative&#xD;
      fluorescence of primary colon cancer and lymph node metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the ability of a fluorescent imaging agent - EMI-137&#xD;
      to produce visible fluorescence in colon cancer during laparoscopic surgery. EMI-137 consists&#xD;
      of a cyanine dye coupled to a c-Met targeted peptide. It is supplied by Edinburgh Molecular&#xD;
      Imaging Ltd. Colon cancer along with several other types of cancer over-express and/or show&#xD;
      upregulation of the c-Met receptor. We anticipate, EMI-137 will accumulate in the tumour and&#xD;
      any lymph nodes metastases when administered intravenously 1 to 3 hours before laparoscopic&#xD;
      colonic resection surgery. The intravenous administration of EMI-137 may allow real-time&#xD;
      intra-operative visualisation of colon cancer and any metastatic lymph nodes, aiding the safe&#xD;
      and accurate resection of the tumour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total 10 patients will be recruited. Patients will have a diagnosis of primary colon&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma, confirmed on biopsy or on radiological imaging, and will have been discussed&#xD;
      at the colorectal cancer MDT meeting. Imaging will have been performed less than 8 weeks&#xD;
      prior to surgery. Patients will be fit for surgical resection of the primary cancer. They may&#xD;
      have suspected or confirmed distant metastatic disease. The planned procedure may be of&#xD;
      palliative or curative intent. The anticipated recruitment period is six (6) months with one&#xD;
      (1) month of trial follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive written and verbal information, and allowed at least 24 hours to&#xD;
      consider their participation in the trial. Participating patients will provide written,&#xD;
      informed consent. Pre-operative patient demographics will be collected, including gender,&#xD;
      age, BMI, baseline FBC, U&amp;Es, LFTs and clotting profile, co-morbidities, ASA grade, and&#xD;
      medication. All patients will undergo routine preoperative assessment, to include colonic&#xD;
      imaging, and staging CT scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis. The planned procedure and&#xD;
      radiological staging will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be administered an intravenous bolus of EMI-137 at a dose of between 0.02mg/kg&#xD;
      to 0.13mg/kg EMI-137 2.5 hours (range 1 to 3 hours) prior to the surgical procedure start&#xD;
      time (this refers to expected &quot;knife to skin time&quot;). The maximum dose will be 0.13mg/mg per&#xD;
      patient for the total operative period. The time of administration will be recorded. Patients&#xD;
      will be closely monitored for any adverse reactions to the medicinal product (as per schedule&#xD;
      below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical procedure will be as per surgeon preference but must include laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgery. The procedure must use a Near Infra-Red laparoscopic system such as the Karl StorzÂ®&#xD;
      endoscopic fluorescence imaging systems. It will be used to evaluate the colon cancer and&#xD;
      regional lymph nodes under both white and red light. The presence of fluorescence within the&#xD;
      primary cancer and any draining lymph nodes will be recorded relative to background&#xD;
      fluorescence. The intensity of fluorescence will be recorded semi-quantitatively as: highly&#xD;
      fluorescent, mildly fluorescent or isofluorescent to background. Mobilisation of structures&#xD;
      to permit visualisation of the cancer and lymph nodes is permissible as long as the&#xD;
      oncological principles of the operation are not compromised. Any fluorescent lymph nodes will&#xD;
      be marked with a surgical clip (Ligaclip) to allow subsequent histopathological&#xD;
      identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative care will be as routinely provided. Patients will be monitored for any adverse&#xD;
      effects related to the medicinal product. Any adverse reactions as defined in the protocol&#xD;
      below will be reported to the CI, clinical trial team, the industrial sponsor and where&#xD;
      necessary, the appropriate regulatory bodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The histopathologists involved in the trial will examine the specimen using routine and trial&#xD;
      specific histopathological techniques. The fluorescences obtained from the fresh frozen&#xD;
      specimens will be appraised using the same semi-quantitative scale used intraoperatively;&#xD;
      highly fluorescent, mildly fluorescent and isofluorescent. The tumour stage will be&#xD;
      ascertained and compared against the pre-operative radiological stage. The degree of&#xD;
      fluorescence obtained may also be compared against the level of c-Met expression and the&#xD;
      morphological and functional characteristics of the tumour. Separate fresh tissue samples&#xD;
      (unfixed cancer and normal mucosal tissue) will be taken, if accessible, and stored in a&#xD;
      HTA-approved tissue bank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up as per routine practice. All patients will be reviewed in a&#xD;
      colorectal clinic between 2 and 3 weeks following discharge, at which point their involvement&#xD;
      in the study will cease.&#xD;

    <description>The ability of EMI-137 to detect colon cancer will be measured using the semi-quantitative descriptive terms of; highly fluorescent, mildly fluorescent and isofluorescent to background. The number of primary tumours highly or mildly fluorescent will be used to assess the success of EMI-137 as an imaging agent.

    <description>The ability of EMI-137 to detect metastatic lymph nodes will be measured using the semi-quantitative descriptive terms of; highly fluorescent, mildly fluorescent and isofluorescent to background. The number of lymph nodes deemed to be highly or mildly fluorescent intraoperatively will be used to measure the success of EMI-137 as an imaging agent.

    <measure>To investigate the concordance of visible fluorescence in colon cancer with histological stage and c-MET expression in resected specimens.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The resected specimen(s) will undergo thorough standard and trial-specific histopathological assessment. Cryosections will be taken from fresh frozen samples and analysed by fluorescent microscopy. The intraoperative fluorescence obtained will have been graded as either; highly fluorescent, mildly fluorescent or isofluorescent. The tumour stage will be ascertained and compared against the pre-operative radiological stage and the intraoperative fluorescence seen. High concordance will be a measure of success. The degree of fluorescence obtained may also be compared against the level of c-Met expression and the morphological and functional characteristics of the tumour. All comparisons will be made against the gold standard- standard histopathological assessment of the tumour, lymph nodes and the ascribed pathological stage of the tumour.</description>

    <measure>To investigate the concordance of visible fluorescence in cancer draining lymph nodes with histological evidence of metastasis.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The pre-operative predicted lymph node status will be compared against the pathological lymph node status and the intra-operative lymph node appearance with the administration of EMI-137. Step sectioning and cytokeratin staining of fluorescent nodes will be performed if metastatic disease is not identified during standard histopathological analysis. High concordance between the intraoperative appearance and the final TMN lymph node status will be used as a measure of success.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The background (noise) appearance of nearby structures will be compared against the tumour and/lymph node (signal) in each case. High contrast between structures (high signal to noise ratio) will be used to measure the success of EMI-137 as an imaging agent. Factors likely to be negatively influencing the tumour to signal ratio will be evaluated and used to modify any further larger trials with EMI-137.</description>

    <description>Baseline demographic data will be analysed against the intraoperative and pathological results to determine any patient or surgical factors that negatively influence intra-operative visualisation with EMI-137.
