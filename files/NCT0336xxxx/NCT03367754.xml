      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) attacks the immune system. Some people with HIV have a low&#xD;
      CD4+ T-cell count despite taking antiviral medicines that control HIV replication. These&#xD;
      cells fight disease, so a low count makes it easier for people to become sick. Researchers&#xD;
      want to see if a new drug can improve the immune system, including T cells. The drug is&#xD;
      called pembrolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if pembrolizumab is safe to use in people with HIV who have a low CD4+ T cell count&#xD;
      despite taking medcines that control HIV replication, and to see if it strengthens the immune&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People age 18 years or older with HIV who are taking antiretroviral drugs as treatment, have&#xD;
      blood HIV levels below detection limits of commercial assays, and have a low CD4+ T-cell&#xD;
      count (below 350 cells/mm3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart, blood, and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sexually active participants must use 2 kinds of birth control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have leukapheresis. Blood will be removed through a needle in one arm. A&#xD;
      machine will remove white blood cells. The rest of the blood will be returned into the other&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a baseline visit. They will have blood tests. They may have a&#xD;
      pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A needle will insert a thin plastic tube (IV) into an arm vein. The participants will get the&#xD;
      study drug or a placebo through the IV for 30 minutes. They will be watched for a couple&#xD;
      hours after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 11 follow-up visits over the next 48 weeks. They will have a physical&#xD;
      exam, vital signs, medical review, and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have another leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be called every 12 weeks after their last follow-up visit to talk about how&#xD;
      they feel and their health. Participation ends after the week 96 phone call.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A subset of HIV-infected patients, those with poor immunologic response to combined&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (CD4+ T-cell count of less than 300-350 cells/mm^3) despite control of&#xD;
      viremia, are at increased risk for both HIV-related and non-HIV-related complications&#xD;
      compared to immunologic responders. Thus, novel approaches for treating HIV infection are&#xD;
      needed to facilitate management of this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One potential drug target for HIV treatment is the T-cell receptor PD-1. Binding of PD-1 to&#xD;
      its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, inhibits proliferation of T cells and production of cytokines.&#xD;
      This naturally serves to dampen potentially harmful excessive immune responses. Upregulation&#xD;
      of PD-1 and/or its ligands can be observed in tumors and people with chronic viral infection,&#xD;
      including HIV. This upregulation can inhibit T-cell immune surveillance, which may result in&#xD;
      tumor growth or poor control of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is an IgG4 kappa monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-1, thus blocking the&#xD;
      receptor from binding with its ligands. In cancer indications, inhibition of PD-1 induces an&#xD;
      antitumor immune response, which in turn reduces tumor growth. The Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration has approved pembrolizumab for treatment of unresectable or metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and other&#xD;
      cancers. Similarly, in animal models of HIV and in vitro studies, PD-1 blockade was&#xD;
      associated with a decrease in viral load and an increase in CD8+ T cells. A clinical trial to&#xD;
      examine the effects of PD-1 inhibition by pembrolizumab on HIV infection is thus supported by&#xD;
      the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study, the safety and tolerability of a single dose of pembrolizumab in HIV-infected&#xD;
      participants who have controlled viremia with a low T-cell count (&gt; 100 cells/mm3 and less&#xD;
      than or equal to 350 cells/mm^3). Study participants will be followed for 96 weeks after&#xD;
      receiving the study drug and will be assessed for adverse events, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell&#xD;
      counts, PD-1 expression, CD8+ T-cell anti-HIV activity, and viral load. If a single dose of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab appears to be safe and tolerable, then larger multi-dose and efficacy studies&#xD;
      can be planned.&#xD;
