      This research study is studying a novel type of FL vaccine as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      follicular lymphoma (FL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The agents involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rituximab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personalized NeoAntigen vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Poly-ICLC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining the&#xD;
      Personalized Neoantigen Vaccine (NeoVax) in patients diagnosed with follicular lymphoma. The&#xD;
      FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the Personalized Neoantigen&#xD;
      Vaccine as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive 4 weekly doses rituximab (a CD20 monoclonal antibody) during NeoVax&#xD;
      manufacturing (see below). Patients who have stable disease or achieve a response with&#xD;
      rituximab therapy will next receiving NeoVax alone (first 5 patients) or NeoVax in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab (a PD-1 monoclonal antibody).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if it is possible to make and safely administer a&#xD;
      vaccine against FL by using information gained from specific genetic characteristics of the&#xD;
      participant's own FL cells. The investigators plan to analyze the specific genetic&#xD;
      characteristics of the participant's own FL cells and use that information to produce&#xD;
      proteins that may help the participant's immune system recognize and fight FL cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This vaccine has already been tested in clinical trials in patients with advanced melanoma (a&#xD;
      type of skin cancer) and glioblastoma (a type of brain cancer). The current study will&#xD;
      examine the ability of the vaccine to stimulate the participant's immune system when given at&#xD;
      several different timepoints, and will examine the participant's blood cells for signs that&#xD;
      the FL has changed or decreased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FL cells will be obtained from a tumor biopsy. The genetic material contained in the FL cells&#xD;
      will be examined for the presence of tumor-specific mutations. This information will be used&#xD;
      to prepare small protein fragments, which are called &quot;peptides.&quot; The vaccine will consist of&#xD;
      up to 20 of these peptides as well as a drug called Poly-ICLC. A peptide from the tetanus&#xD;
      vaccine will also be included to boost the immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Poly-ICLC (also called Hiltonol) is an experimental &quot;viral mimic&quot; and an activator of&#xD;
      immunity. Poly-ICLC binds proteins on the surface of certain immune cells to make it appear&#xD;
      as if a virus is present. When the cells detect the vaccine, they think it is a virus and&#xD;
      turn on the immune system. Poly-ICLC will be mixed with NeoAntigen peptides and administered&#xD;
      as an injection given underneath the skin. Poly-ICLC is an investigational drug, meaning the&#xD;
      FDA has not approved it as a treatment for any disease.&#xD;

    <description>The proportion of all enrolled patients for whom sequencing and analysis leads to identification of at least 7 actionable peptides to initiate vaccine production and, of the patients who generate at least 7 actionable peptides, the proportion for whom the time from sample collection to vaccine availability is less than 12 weeks.</description>

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The induction of IFN-γ T-cell response will be based on ELISPOT assessments taken prior to vaccine administration and at week 16 from both peripheral blood draws and bone marrow biopsies. The proportion of patients who achieve more than 55 SFU/106 PBMC or 3 times their baseline level will be presented with a 90% exact binomial confidence interval. Based on a cohort of size 10, the confidence interval will be no wider than 0.55. It is possible that the maximal response will occur at a different sampling time point or will vary between participants. Thus, this time point may vary from week 16.</description>

&#xD;
          -  The effects of NeoVax and poly-ICLC on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
             this reason, women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative pregnancy&#xD;

             ≤Grade 2 neuropathy may be eligible. Note: If participant received major surgery, they&#xD;
             must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the&#xD;
             intervention prior to starting study treatment&#xD;

          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous bone marrow or stem cell transplant&#xD;

          -  Concomitant therapy with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents; chronic use of&#xD;
             systemic corticosteroids at doses of 10 mg of prednisone (or equivalent) for&#xD;
             indications other than treatment of follicular lymphoma is acceptable. Use of higher&#xD;
             doses of corticosteroids after initial registration is acceptable if tapered to 10 mg&#xD;
             of prednisone (or equivalent) or les at least 7 days prior to NeoVax administration so&#xD;
             long as the corticosteroids were not administered for follicular lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of a non-oncology vaccine therapy for prevention of infectious diseases within 2&#xD;
             weeks prior to any NeoVax administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe allergic reactions attributed to any vaccine therapy for the&#xD;
             prevention of infectious diseases.&#xD;

             the exception of vitiligo, type 1 diabetes, residual autoimmune-related hypothyroidism&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Progressive disease or stable disease with residual tumor mass &gt; 5 cm by CT scan&#xD;
             (measured as long axis) following 4 weekly doses of rituximab (for treatment phase&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any documented transformation to diffuse large B cell lymphoma or grade 3Bfollicular&#xD;
             lymphoma.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Active infection with hepatitis B or C (see Study Calendar in Section 10 for screening&#xD;
             assays).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any underlying medical condition, psychiatric condition or social situation that in&#xD;
             the opinion of the investigator would compromise study administration as per protocol&#xD;
             or compromise the assessment of AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because personalized neoantigen peptides&#xD;
             and poly-ICLC are agents with unknown risks to the developing fetus. Because there is&#xD;
             an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with personalized neoantigen peptides and poly-ICLC, nursing&#xD;
             women are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with history of an invasive malignancy are ineligible except for the&#xD;
             following circumstances: a) individuals with a history of invasive malignancy are&#xD;
             eligible if they have been disease -free for at least 3 years and are deemed by the&#xD;
             investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy; b) individuals with&#xD;
             the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated: carcinoma in situ of the&#xD;
             breast, oral cavity or cervix and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin;&#xD;
             c) individuals with prostate cancer managed with active surveillance that is not&#xD;
             expected to limit their survival to &lt;10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known CNS involvement&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to poly-ICLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive participants including those on combination antiretroviral therapy are&#xD;
             ineligible because assessment of immunologic endpoints may be confounded by&#xD;
             HIV-induced alterations in patient immune status and functio&#xD;
