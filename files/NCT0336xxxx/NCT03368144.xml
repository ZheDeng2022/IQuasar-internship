      The BELTHROM trial investigates the efficacy and safety of the ClearLumen II Peripheral&#xD;
      Thrombectomy System recanalization of acute and subacute thrombotic femoropopliteal&#xD;
      occlusions (Acute Limb Ischemia (ALI); Rutherford I, IIa, IIb and III). An expected total of&#xD;
      50 patients will be treated. The lesion is located within the femoropopliteal artery (native,&#xD;
      in-stent or bypass graft). During the procedure, the device is introduced, activated and&#xD;
      slowly advanced into the occlusion to clean out the wall-adherent thrombotic material. If&#xD;
      residual underlying stenosis of &gt;30% persists additional endovascular treatment can be&#xD;
      performed according to the physician's discretion. Patients will be invited for a follow-up&#xD;
      visit at 1 month post-procedure. The primary efficacy endpoint is the technical success of&#xD;
      the ClearLumen II Peripheral Thrombectomy System, defined as removal of ≥90% acute clot as&#xD;
      documented by angiography. The primary safety endpoint is defined as the absence of&#xD;
      device-related complications, which is defined as embolization, perforation or dissection&#xD;
      caused by the ClearLumen II Peripheral Thrombectomy System. Secondary endpoints include&#xD;
      procedural success, percent clot removed by the ClearLumen II Peripheral Thrombectomy System,&#xD;
      clinical success at 1 month follow-up visit, 30-day target lesion revascularization, 30-days&#xD;
      serious adverse events and 30-days adverse events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate, in a controlled setting, the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of the recanalization of acute and subacute thrombotic (up to 6 weeks)&#xD;
      femoropopliteal occlusions with the ClearLumen II Peripheral Thrombectomy System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be selected based on the investigator's assessment, evaluation of the&#xD;
      underlying disease and the eligibility criteria. The patient's medical condition should be&#xD;
      stable, with no underlying medical condition which would prevent them from performing the&#xD;
      required testing or from completing the study. Patients should also be geographically stable,&#xD;
      willing and able to cooperate in this clinical study and remain available for follow-up. A&#xD;
      patient is considered enrolled in the study after obtaining the patients informed consent, if&#xD;
      there is full compliance with the study eligibility criteria and after successful guidewire&#xD;
      passage through the study target lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the index procedure the following tests and clinical data will be collected:&#xD;
      informed consent for data collection, demographics, medical history, medication record,&#xD;
      physical examination, clinical category of acute limb ischemia (Rutherford category) and&#xD;
      resting ankle-brachial index (ABI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the procedure, the occlusion needs first to be recanalized by conventional guidewire&#xD;
      technique, since the ClearLumen II Peripheral Thrombectomy System is an over-the-wire system&#xD;
      (0.035&quot;). After assessment of the lesion by angiography via a common femoral artery approach&#xD;
      (contralateral/ipsilateral) the occlusion is intraluminally crossed with the wire according&#xD;
      to physician's discretion. Afterwards, the device is introduced and the catheter is&#xD;
      activated. Then the catheter is slowly advances into the occlusion. Several passages of the&#xD;
      occlusion may needed to clean out all wall-adherent thrombotic material. If residual&#xD;
      underlying stenosis of &gt;30% persists additional endovascular treatment can be performed&#xD;
      according to the physician's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The regular follow-up is necessary to monitor the condition of the patient and the result of&#xD;
      the procedure. Patients will be invited for a follow-up visit 1 month after the index&#xD;
      procedure. The following data will be collected during this follow-up visit: medication&#xD;
      record, physical examination, rutherford categorization, ABI and color flow doppler&#xD;
      ultrasound.&#xD;
