  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives of this study are comparison of the incidence of intraoperative air&#xD;
      embolism and the extent of blood loss in patients undergoing posterior cranial fossa (PCF)&#xD;
      and pineal region (PR) surgeries in sitting and horizontal position. Additionally, the&#xD;
      overall treatment outcome, neurological functional outcome, degree of tumor removal, clinical&#xD;
      course in the postoperative period, and the patient satisfaction will be compared between the&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;

      This was a prospective observational study to assess the effects of patient positioning&#xD;
      during craniotomies on surgical outcomes. Patients were distributed into 2 major groups based&#xD;
      on the surgical position: sitting and horizontal. Each group was further divided into&#xD;
      subgroups based on the type and location of the lesion. To achieve the study goals,&#xD;
      comparison of the 2 approaches in equivalent patient groups was performed, including&#xD;
      comparable demographics, diagnoses, topographic location of the lesions, anesthetic&#xD;
      approaches, and surgical experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operating surgeons decided patient positioning based on clinical judgment. Type of&#xD;
      anesthesia was defined by the anesthesiologist in charge of the patient however, it was&#xD;
      maximally standardized for both sites. All the surgeries were performed by neurosurgeons with&#xD;
      sufficient experience of sitting craniotomies.&#xD;

        Patients undergoing elective craniotomies on posterior cranial fossa or pineal region were&#xD;
        identified on each site before surgery. Patients were asked to be part of the study&#xD;
        explaining that no intervention was necessary besides a phone call performed by the&#xD;
        research team 3 months after their surgery.&#xD;
