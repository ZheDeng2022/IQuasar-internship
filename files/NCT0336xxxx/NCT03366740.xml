    <textblock>
      Diarrhea is the 2nd leading cause of death in under-five children. When diarrhea continued&#xD;
      for 14 days or more it is known as Persistent Diarrhea (PD). In low and middle income&#xD;
      countries (LMIC), 3%-23% of acute diarrheal episodes turn to PD. PD causes 32-62% of all&#xD;
      diarrheal deaths in LMIC, and &gt;25% in Bangladesh in contrast to 0.8% is caused by acute&#xD;
      diarrhea. The prevalence of PD varied from 6.3 to 16.4 %. However, no larger prospective&#xD;
      study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of green banana in the management of PD among&#xD;
      children older than 6 months.An open-labeled randomized controlled clinical trial is designed&#xD;
      to assess the efficacy of green banana mixed full strength rice suji, and full strength rice&#xD;
      suji alone compared to 3/4th strength rice suji in the management of persistent diarrhea (PD)&#xD;
      in children aged &gt; 6 months to 36 months in the Dhaka Hospital of icddr,b.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diarrhea, defined as passage of loose or watery stool 3 times or more in a 24 hour period, is&#xD;
      the 2nd leading cause of death in under-five children. It accounts for 531,000 deaths among&#xD;
      5.9 million globally and 7,140 deaths among 119,000 Bangladeshi under-five deaths in 2015.&#xD;
      Countries of Africa and South-East Asia, particularly India, Nigeria, Congo, Afghanistan,&#xD;
      Pakistan, Ethiopia and Bangladesh face around 80% of total diarrhea related death of the&#xD;
      world. Use of ORS and zinc reduced the number of diarrheal deaths, especially from acute&#xD;
      diarrhea to 0.8%. However, when diarrhea continued for 14 days or more and which does not&#xD;
      include recurrent or chronic diarrhea, such as coeliac disease, cystic fibrosis or congenital&#xD;
      diarrheal disorders, it is known as persistent diarrhea (PD). In low and middle income&#xD;
      countries 3%-23% of acute diarrheal episodes turn to PD. PD has been responsible for 30-62%,&#xD;
      diarrhea associated deaths of young children in low- and middle- income countries. And in&#xD;
      Bangladesh, PD accounted for more than 25% of all diarrhea related deaths among children aged&#xD;
      1-4 years and 40% of them were found malnourished.An international working group had&#xD;
      developed and tested an algorithm through a multi country cohort for the treatment of PD&#xD;
      nearly twenty years ago.However, this stepwise dietary algorithm increases the duration of&#xD;
      hospital stay. To reduce the osmotic burden frequently children are given 3/4th strength&#xD;
      diet. Though these diets are iso-osmolar, they provide suboptimal energy to the children.&#xD;
      Several studies demonstrated the beneficial effect of green banana (GB) (whole green banana&#xD;
      fruit, Musa paradisiacal sapientum) in the resolution of PD.The anti-diarrheal action of GB&#xD;
      is postulated to be mediated by its high content of amylase-resistant starch (ARS), which is&#xD;
      not digested in the small intestine of humans. On reaching the colon, it is fermented by&#xD;
      resident bacteria into the short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) butyrate, propionate, and acetate.&#xD;
      In the colon, SCFA stimulate salt and water absorption as well as provide energy and induce a&#xD;
      trophic effect on the colonic as well as small-bowel mucosa. As 3/4th strength rice suiji is&#xD;
      not providing sufficient calorie we are proposing to give full-strength rice suji as one&#xD;
      intervention, and to ascertain the efficacy of GB in children suffering from undernutrition&#xD;
      and/or co-morbidities we are proposing to give GB mix full strength rice suiji as another&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This will be an open-labeled randomized controlled clinical trial with three&#xD;
      treatment arms (3/4th strength rice suji, full strength rice suji with modification and GB&#xD;
      mixed full strength rice suji). Investigators will prospectively screen, children &gt; 6 to 36&#xD;
      months of age admitted to the Dhaka hospital of icddr,b, with PD or developed PD during their&#xD;
      treatment period and failed to respond with milk suji and enroll them for the study.&#xD;
      Thereafter permuted block randomization technique will be followed to select treatment arms&#xD;
      for each child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Area: The study will be conducted at the Dhaka hospital of the International Centre for&#xD;
      Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b), Dhaka, Bangladesh.This hospital provides&#xD;
      care and treatment to over 140,000 patients annually of all ages and either sex, among them&#xD;
      the number of under-five children were 83285. For critically ill patients there is an&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) facility present within the hospital, equipped with necessary life&#xD;
      support measures including mechanical ventilators, syringe pump for vasopressor support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usually children having PD will be admitted to the longer stay unit of the Dhaka hospital. An&#xD;
      initial routine investigation will be done by the treating unit to identify the etiology of&#xD;
      diarrhea whether infectious or noninfectious by doing stool RE and RS; TC, DC, Hb%. If stool&#xD;
      RE suggestive of invasive diarrhea, appropriate antibiotic will be provided according to&#xD;
      hospital protocol. During this period, milk suji, a low lactose diet, will be given as a&#xD;
      routine diet. If child's PD resolved with milk suji, the child will be discharged with common&#xD;
      health related advices. On day 4 (3 days after milk suji), if PD doesn't resolve, the child&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study and randomization will be done. The child will get either of&#xD;
      the three diets- green banana mixed full strength rise suji, full strength rice suji, or&#xD;
      3/4th strength rice suji. With any of these diets, a child will be followed for 7 days. If&#xD;
      there is deterioration of diarrhea (either increased frequency or watery consistency) for 3&#xD;
      days or condition remains static up to 7 days the child will be declared as treatment&#xD;
      failure. Because this study duration will be for 7 days, after these one week of management,&#xD;
      the child will not remain in the study and will receive standard management of the Dhaka&#xD;
      hospital of icddr,b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With 80 % power and 5% type I error and considering three treatment arms, Investigators need&#xD;
      40 children in each arm. If 45 children is enrolled in each arm,it will be able to&#xD;
      accommodate up to 11 % attrition&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, the total sample size = 45*3= 135&#xD;
