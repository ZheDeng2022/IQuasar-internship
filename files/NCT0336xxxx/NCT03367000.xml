  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dialysis population has a strikingly high incidence of mortality. The life expectancy of&#xD;
      chronic dialysis patients is 20 years less than that of the general population. Approximately&#xD;
      50% of individuals with end stage renal disease (ESRD) die from a cardiovascular (CV) cause&#xD;
      with mortality being 15 to 30 times higher than the age-adjusted CV mortality in the general&#xD;
      population. There is also a steady increase of patients with diabetes and the older age&#xD;
      groups coming into dialysis. The treatment of patients with ESRD aims at prolonging life,&#xD;
      achieving good nutritional status and promoting the best possible functioning and quality of&#xD;
      life (QOL). Several factors that are beyond adequacy of dialysis predict high mortality in&#xD;
      ESRD patients. Associated co-morbidities and malnutrition factors are independently&#xD;
      associated and the combined presence of both malnutrition and co-morbidities manifest the&#xD;
      worst survival.Therefore this study investigates the efficacy of protein supplementation in&#xD;
      improving health status and quality of life among peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. This&#xD;
      research will also generate basic data about significant health markers critical to the&#xD;
      health status of PD patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomised, open labeled controlled trial where a total of 74 PD patients (37&#xD;
      supplemented; 37 control) were recruited from government and private settings. Subjects were&#xD;
      randomised to either the intervention or control group. The intervention group received&#xD;
      hydrolysed whey protein supplement and diet counselling for 6 months while the control group&#xD;
      received only diet counselling for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who consented were first subjected to a screening for identification of eligible&#xD;
      subjects. The screening involved basic anthropometry measures (height, weight, BMI), routine&#xD;
      biochemistry result obtained from medical record, assessment of nutritional status and&#xD;
      dietary evaluation. About 4ml of pre-dialysis blood was also collected by respective nurses&#xD;
      for additional laboratory parameters (hsCRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 6 months of treatment period, patients in both control and intervention groups&#xD;
      were assessed at baseline and end of the study (at 6 months) for anthropometry assessment,&#xD;
      laboratory results, medical condition, hospitalisations, nutritional status, dietary intake&#xD;
      and compliance towards supplementation (intervention group only).&#xD;
