    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and how well trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride&#xD;
      combination agent TAS-102 (TAS-102) and nanoliposomal irinotecan work in treating patients&#xD;
      with gastrointestinal cancers that have spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or&#xD;
      cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in the chemotherapy, such as trifluridine/tipiracil&#xD;
      hydrochloride combination agent TAS-102 and nanoliposomal irinotecan, work in different ways&#xD;
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the recommended phase II dose for the combination of TAS-102 and nanoliposomal&#xD;
      irinotecan (nanoliposomal [nal]-IRI). (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the activity of the combination of TAS102 and nal-IRI in previously treated&#xD;
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Define the toxicity profile of the combination of TAS-102 and nal-IRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the response duration, progression free, and overall survival of the combination&#xD;
      of TAS-102 and nal-IRI in previously treated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive nanoliposomal irinotecan intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1 and&#xD;
      trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride combination agent TAS-102 orally (PO) twice daily (BID)&#xD;
      on days 1-5. Cycles repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 8 or&#xD;
      12 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
