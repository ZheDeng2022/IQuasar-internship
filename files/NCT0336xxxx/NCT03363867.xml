  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the ninth most common cause of cancer in Australian women,&#xD;
      with an estimated 1500 new diagnoses in Australia in 2015, and remains the seventh most&#xD;
      common cause of cancer death in Australian women. High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) is&#xD;
      the most common form of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer, and accounts for the most deaths due to a&#xD;
      gynaecological cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of women diagnosed with High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer present with advanced&#xD;
      disease, and are typically managed with a combination of cytoreductive surgery and&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy. Despite initial good response rates to chemotherapy, High Grade&#xD;
      Serous Ovarian Cancer recurs in up to 70% of patients who present with Stage III/IV disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research project is to test how safe and effective the combination&#xD;
      treatment of cobimetinib, bevacizumab and atezolizumab is as a treatment for patients with&#xD;
      platinum resistant or refractory high grade serous ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cobimetinib is a drug that blocks a protein called Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK).&#xD;
      MEK proteins are involved in the multiplication of cancer cells. By binding to the MEK&#xD;
      protein, cobimetinib may help to stop the growth of your cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is an antibody (a type of protein produced by the immune system) that is&#xD;
      specifically designed to block a protein called Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF).&#xD;
      VEGF is a protein that can increase the growth of tumour cells and binding to VEGF may help&#xD;
      to stop the growth of tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atezolizumab is a type of drug called a Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor.&#xD;
      PD-L1 binds to PD-1 which is a type of protein found on the surface of cells in your body's&#xD;
      immune system, and it controls the ability of your body's natural immune response to trigger&#xD;
      the death of tumour cells. Tumour cells can hide from the immune system by using PD-L1, which&#xD;
      stops your immune system from triggering tumour cell death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atezolizumab is a drug designed to block this PD-1/PD-L1 interaction by binding to PD-L1 so&#xD;
      that PD-1 cannot bind to it and stops it from turning off your immune cells. This helps your&#xD;
      immune system to recognise and destroy tumour cells. In turn, this potentially can stop or&#xD;
      reverse the growth of your cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cobimetinib, bevacizumab and atezolizumab have been used alone or in combination in the&#xD;
      treatment of many other cancers. Each of them are individually licensed for the treatment of&#xD;
      cancers such as advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and bladder cancer in&#xD;
      Australia. However, this treatment combination is experimental and is not approved to treat&#xD;
      ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancers in any country.&#xD;
