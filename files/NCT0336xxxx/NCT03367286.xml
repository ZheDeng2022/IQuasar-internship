  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute ischemia stroke (AIS) is the leading cause of death in China. Thrombolytic therapy with&#xD;
      recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has been proven to reduce disability in AIS&#xD;
      patients within 4.5 hours after symptom onset. However, only 2% of AIS patients received&#xD;
      thrombolytic therapy in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perfusion imaging is demonstrated to increase the rate of thrombolytic therapy by identifying&#xD;
      the ischemic infarct core (the brain tissue that is irreversibly injured) and the ischemia&#xD;
      penumbra (the brain tissue surrounding the ischemia infarct core that is hypoperfused but&#xD;
      still viable) for those patients with extending therapeutic window (beyond the current 4.5&#xD;
      hours after symptom onset), as well as minor stroke or those with atypical symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three prospective clinical trials, DEFUSE, DEFUSE-2 and EPITHET, has confirmed that mismatch&#xD;
      between perfusion weighted-imaging (PWI) and diffusion weighted-imaging (DWI) correspond to&#xD;
      the ischemic penumbra whereas DWI provides information of the ischemia infarct core and major&#xD;
      reperfusion relate to good clinical outcome in extending therapeutic window AIS patients with&#xD;
      DWI-PWI mismatch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) may be a potential alternative technology for recognition&#xD;
      of reversibly damaged brain tissue in AIS patients, with the prominent advantage of fast&#xD;
      scan. Recent studies also demonstrated that CTP could select eligible candidates for&#xD;
      reperfusion therapy. More recently, with data of EXTEND-IA, reperfusion therapy in AIS&#xD;
      patients with CTP mismatch (using a CT time to maximum &gt;6 s as ischemic hypoperfusion volume&#xD;
      and a CT relative cerebral blood flow &lt;30% of that in normal tissue as ischemic core volume)&#xD;
      were related to good clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, plenty of studies demonstrated CT cerebral blood volume did not always predict&#xD;
      ischemic infarct core in AIS patients. A recent study also confirmed the poor contrast: noise&#xD;
      ratios of CT cerebral blood volume and CT cerebral blood flow result in large measurement&#xD;
      error, compared with those of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), making it problematic to&#xD;
      substitute DWI in selecting individual AIS patients for reperfusion treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on those studies, it is still remained unclear whether CTP can be an alternative choice&#xD;
      to replace magnetic resonance perfusion (MRP) in AIS patients with extending therapeutic&#xD;
      windows. So in this study, the investigators try to determine whether baseline CTP profiles&#xD;
      have a comparable ability to MRP in identifying patients who have a robust clinical response&#xD;
      after early reperfusion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-blind, single-center clinical trial to evaluate whether baseline&#xD;
      computed tomography perfusion (CTP) profiles have a comparable ability to magnetic resonance&#xD;
      perfusion (MRP) in identifying acute ischemia stroke (AIS) patients who have a robust&#xD;
      clinical response after early reperfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 1000 patients, and patients will be divided into 2 groups according to&#xD;
      the imaging available situation (to see which can provide immediately): CTP scan group and&#xD;
      MRP scan group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core: CT: cerebral blood flow &lt;30% of that in normal tissue / MR: ADC &lt; 600 ×D10-6 mm2 / s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoperfusion: CT / MR: time to maximum &gt;6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients accepting CTP or MRP over 4.5 hours after stroke onset, only patients who meet&#xD;
      imaging criteria (infarct core volume &lt; 70mL, perfusion lesion volume / infarct core volume&#xD;
      &gt;1.2, and absolute mismatch &gt;10 mL) at baseline will receive recombinant tissue plasminogen&#xD;
      activator (rt-PA) intravenous thrombolysis. CTP or MRP will be performed at 24 hours after&#xD;
      thrombolytic therapy. Modified Rankin score (mRS) will be measured at 3 months after stroke&#xD;
      onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints: Primary endpoint: mRS 0-2 at 3 months. Secondary endpoints: (1) symptomatic&#xD;
      intracranial haemorrhage, (2) reperfusion, (3) recanalization, and (4) infarct growth at 24&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
