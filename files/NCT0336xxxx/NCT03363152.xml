      Laparoscopic surgical suboptimal outcomes in patient safety measures are correlated with (i)&#xD;
      cognitive load / level of attention of the operating surgeon, (ii) the frequency and degree&#xD;
      of disruptions to the surgical workflow, and (iii) the misalignment of visual and motor axes&#xD;
      in laparoscopic equipment / setting (eye-hand coordination).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will create the foundational, design and operational principles of future,&#xD;
      surgeon-friendly minimal invasive surgery operating room information technologies (MIS-IT),&#xD;
      which -given the ever growing complexity in surgical workflows, as well as instrument and&#xD;
      equipment settings- will have to build on human attention as a scarce resource.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the formal model's and methods' side, MinIAttention will identify types of human&#xD;
      attention, as well as cognitive and physiological mechanisms revealing its relation to&#xD;
      perception, memory, decision making, and learning. Starting with established theories of&#xD;
      individual attention (Capacity Theory, Multiple Resource Theory, Feature Integration Theory)&#xD;
      and the respective attention models (Broadbent, Kahneman, Wickens), we will characterize&#xD;
      aspects of attention of surgeons during MIS operations. MinIAttention will empirically&#xD;
      evidence its models on the dynamics of a surgeon's attention along the workflow of a MIS&#xD;
      operation. A multi-sensor attention recognition reference framework will be implementation,&#xD;
      involving externalized signals of a surgeons attention (eye gaze, head and hand gesture, head&#xD;
      and full body pose, physiological signals, as well as communication and social interaction).&#xD;
      Evidenced MinIAttention attention models will represent the core body of aware surgeon&#xD;
      assistance systems, covering (i) sensory assistance, enhancing the surgeons perceptual&#xD;
      capacities, (ii) motor assistance, enhancing the surgeons motor and manipulative capacities&#xD;
      (iii) decision making assistance, guiding the surgeon towards informed, evidence based,&#xD;
      rational, transparent and timely decisions during operation, and (iv) cognitive assistance,&#xD;
      enhancing the surgeons memory management capacities with background digital memory systems.&#xD;
      On the purpose of supporting this research proposal with an early impression of the&#xD;
      feasibility of the proposed research method and approach, the proposing partners have&#xD;
      voluntarily set up prototypical attention capturing system. With this preliminary proposal&#xD;
      support study we have evidenced that ensembles of sensors together with our attention models&#xD;
      can serve as a nonobtrusive, yet potentially effective means to determine indicators of a&#xD;
      surgeon's attention during live surgeries. Above that, the pattern recognition methods an&#xD;
      machine learning techniques appear viable for the task of automated attention and cognitive&#xD;
      load diagnosis, and the proposed assistance and mulitmodal feedback system reveals feasible.&#xD;
      We can thus say, that the research method and approach which MinIAttention will build upon is&#xD;
      solid, promising, and preliminarily evidenced beforehand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aside the MIS-IT focus of this project, MinIAttention will serve as a reference to a very&#xD;
      general, observably upcoming information society dilemma: information overload and attention&#xD;
      scarcity. In today's information-rich world, where people are overflooded with signals and&#xD;
      messages at all levels of perception and modalities (visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory),&#xD;
      the need to allocate attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources&#xD;
      appears to be among the most demanding challenges for ICT mediated communication today. For&#xD;
      the design and implementation of novel, future ICT systems of all kinds, it is of high&#xD;
      interest to understand how spontaneous, local, individual attention to novel information&#xD;
      items occurs. Some two decades of HCI and pervasive/ubiquitous computing research have&#xD;
      clearly revealed that out of the many indicative design factors for modern ICT, human&#xD;
      attention is the first source of perception, consequently also awareness towards information&#xD;
      and other individuals. MinIAttention will create the foundational basis for attention-aware&#xD;
      ICT, i.e. develop (i) formal models of human attention along with (ii) multisensory&#xD;
      recognition architectures and reasoning algorithms to estimate and assess levels of human&#xD;
      attention, together with their (iii) embedding into ICT systems of everyday use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five international groups will collaborate to develop MinIAttention. JKU IPC has introduced&#xD;
      attention aware ICT in the Pervasive Computing scientific community, developed pionieering&#xD;
      methods and systems, and also promoted cognitive ICT to become a European research priority&#xD;
      (H2020). AKH KUK runs Austrias most advanced laparoscopic operation theater with cutting edge&#xD;
      technological equipment, Karl STORZ ENDOSKOPE is a worldwide leading surgical instrument&#xD;
      supplier. SUSSEX is among the worlds most renowned institutions in machine learning related&#xD;
      to wearable computing, as is FRI for vital state recognition.&#xD;
