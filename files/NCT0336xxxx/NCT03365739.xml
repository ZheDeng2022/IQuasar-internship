      The primary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the relative bioavailability and absorption/kinetic profile of&#xD;
           phytochemicals after acute consumption of mango pulp.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the systemic accumulation or generation of new mango pulp phytochemicals /their&#xD;
           metabolites in blood after regular mango intake for an extended time frame.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To enhance the bioavailability of polyphenols in mango pulp by addition of Vitamin C to&#xD;
           the mango pulp.&#xD;

      The trial is designed as a randomized, 3 arm, within-subject crossover, study design.&#xD;
      Subjects meeting eligibility criteria will participate in 3 in-lab visits where they will&#xD;
      receive 1 of 3 treatments: Mango (pulp/flesh) (500 g), Mango (500 g) + Vitamin C (100 mg) or&#xD;
      Vitamin C (100 mg) only. The study day visit will last for approximately 10.5 h with a follow&#xD;
      up visit the next day (24 h) for blood and urine collection to allow for the characterization&#xD;
      of target mango pulp phytochemicals and metabolites in plasma and urine. And then after a&#xD;
      2-week wash out period, a 14-day feeding trial will be conducted in which subjects will be&#xD;
      given mango pulp (500 g) to take home and instructed to consume every day for 14 days, to&#xD;
      study the accumulation of polyphenols and their metabolites in blood. A fasting blood sample&#xD;
      will be collected on day 1 of the trial and then again on the 15th day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be required to meet several inclusion and exclusion criteria, which will be&#xD;
      assessed through online survey and on-site clinic assessments, including questionnaires,&#xD;
      blood analysis and anthropometric measures. Eligible subjects will be invited to participate&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Screening Visit, subjects will read, sign and date a written Institutional Review&#xD;
      Board approved Informed Consent Form prior to performing any study procedure. And then they&#xD;
      will be assessed their qualification, if eligible to participate, subjects will be instructed&#xD;
      on the process for completing study questionnaires and counseled to restrict intake of&#xD;
      colored plant foods rich in phytonutrients the 7 days prior to each Study Day. They will be&#xD;
      asked to restrict alcohol intake, coffee/tea/ caffeinated beverage intake and moderate /&#xD;
      vigorous physical activity and to drink plenty of water to maintain hydration in the 24 h&#xD;
      prior to each Study Day. They will be instructed to come to the Clinical Nutrition Research&#xD;
      Center (CNRC) the day before each Study Day to pick up their dinner meal and evening snack.&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to get a usual night of sleep and to come to the CNRC after a 10-h&#xD;
      overnight fasting on each Study Day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study visit will involve with blood samples collection at time points 0 (fasting), 0.5,&#xD;
      1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 10 and 24 hour (h) for assessment of change in plasma and metabolites.&#xD;
      A drink will be provided immediately after the 0 h blood collection, a breakfast meal will be&#xD;
      provided immediately after the 2 h blood collection, and lunch after 6 h blood collection.&#xD;
      Urine samples will be collected at 0 (fasting)-2, 2-6, 6-10 and 24 h.&#xD;
