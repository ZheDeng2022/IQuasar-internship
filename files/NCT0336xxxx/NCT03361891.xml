  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted to hospital typically experience periods of decreased activity or bed-rest.&#xD;
      This reduced activity level leads to deconditioning - a loss of muscle mass, muscle strength&#xD;
      (by 2-5% per day), and muscle shortening. Even among patients who were ambulatory at the time&#xD;
      of admission, deconditioning has been linked with deleterious effects, such as increased&#xD;
      rates of falls, functional decline, and frailty. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the&#xD;
      physiological stresses associated with hospitalization - including deconditioning, as well as&#xD;
      sleep deprivation and poor nutrition - makes discharged patients vulnerable to recurrent or&#xD;
      new illnesses and to frailty. This physiological stress-induced vulnerability has been coined&#xD;
      post-hospital syndrome and is thought to have a role in most hospital readmissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that by engaging ambulatory patients to walk with trained&#xD;
      volunteer coaches, patients will increase their amount of walking, have less deconditioning&#xD;
      and functional decline, and consequently, fewer falls. Furthermore, the investigators&#xD;
      anticipate that patients who walk with a trained coach will have reduced length-of-stay in&#xD;
      hospital and decreased likelihood of readmission. Finally, as shown in other programs&#xD;
      trialing health coaches, the investigators anticipate an overall improvement in the patient&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is to demonstrate the feasibility of an intentional walking protocol called WalkMORE,&#xD;
      which pairs trained volunteer coaches with ambulatory patients admitted to the Internal&#xD;
      Medicine unit (4th floor University Hospital), aimed at decreasing deconditioning through&#xD;
      increased walking.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      WalkMORE is a single-center randomized controlled trial. The investigators will enroll up to&#xD;
      300 ambulatory patients admitted to the Internal Medicine unit (located on the 4th floor of&#xD;
      University Hospital) who are &gt;18 years of age and are anticipated to require a &gt;48 hour&#xD;
      hospital admission. A maximum of 6 patients will be assigned to each treatment arm at any&#xD;
      given time. The investigators will recruit patients into the WalkMORE program over a 3-month&#xD;
      period. The research coordinator (RC) will screen patients admitted to the Internal Medicine&#xD;
      unit in the preceding 24-hour period to identify patients who fulfill the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria. Patients will be randomized via REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), a&#xD;
      secure, centralized web-based randomization module to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard of care; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. WalkMORE Ambulation program + Standard of care. Patients will ambulate with a trained&#xD;
           WalkMORE Volunteer Coach two times per day; once in the morning (0900-1200hrs) and once&#xD;
           in the afternoon (1300-1700hrs), Monday- Friday, until hospital discharge. Patients&#xD;
           randomized to the WalkMORE intervention will be assessed daily by the RC to ensure&#xD;
           patients remain fit for independent ambulation. The duration of each walking session&#xD;
           will be determined daily by the RC and the medical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining written informed consent from eligible patients the RC will randomize&#xD;
      patients, collect demographics, hospital admission details and perform a quality of life&#xD;
      survey (EQ-5D) with all patients. All patients will be assigned a scientific pedometer on the&#xD;
      day of randomization. The modus Health StepWatch™ is an activity monitor worn on the ankle&#xD;
      via a velcro strap. It is a small, lightweight device that will count and record patients'&#xD;
      steps throughout their hospital stay. The device is smaller than a deck of cards (7.5 x 5.0 x&#xD;
      2.0 cm) and weighs 38 grams and will be installed by the RC. The total number of steps&#xD;
      recorded on the pedometer will be collected for each patient every day until hospital&#xD;
      discharge. For patients randomized to the WalkMORE intervention arm, the total number of&#xD;
      minutes walked with a volunteer coach will also be recorded for each session until discharge.&#xD;
      Functional ability will be measured on the third day post-randomization and every three days&#xD;
      thereafter until hospital discharge, using the Timed Up and Go test (patients will be asked&#xD;
      to stand up from a chair, walk three metres, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit).&#xD;
      After hospital discharge the RC will follow up with patients for 2 brief telephone&#xD;
      interviews. On day 3 after discharge, Patient Satisfaction surveys will be conducted by the&#xD;
      RC to assess patient satisfaction with their experience with the WalkMORE program. These&#xD;
      telephone surveys will be reviewed and approved by Lisa Hawthorne of the Patient Experience&#xD;
      Office. On day 30 after discharge the RC will contact patients to conduct a brief quality of&#xD;
      life survey and to collect data regarding clinical outcomes (ER visits, re-hospitalizations,&#xD;
      and falls). Each telephone interview is expected to last approximately 10-15 minutes.&#xD;
