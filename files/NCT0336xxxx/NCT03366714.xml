      variable pressure using nasal or nasopharyngeal interfaces without endotracheal intubation or&#xD;

      RAM cannula (Neotech ™, Valencia, CA), a new nasal interface, is increasingly used in NID&#xD;
      applications in newborn infants. The RAM cannula is available in the inspiration and&#xD;
      expiration arms of the stroke while reducing the dead space in the respiratory tract due to&#xD;
      the low nasal prong diameter. There are not enough studies comparing the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      RAM cannula with other short binasal prongs or nasal masks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the past years endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation with surfactant therapy&#xD;
      was the standard treatment of moderate to severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).&#xD;
      Especially in the last 10 years, prolonged intubation and positive pressure ventilation have&#xD;
      been shown to increase the frequency of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a kind of chronic&#xD;
      pulmonary disease. Intubation and positive pressure ventilation cause volu-trauma,&#xD;
      baro-trauma, and alveolar secondary to bio-trauma, leading to excessive distension and&#xD;
      inflammation, disrupting alveolar formation, resulting in fibrosis and bronchopulmonary&#xD;
      dysplasia. Intubation and mechanical ventilation also involve ventilator-associated&#xD;
      pneumonia. For this reason, strategies for lung protective ventilation have become&#xD;
      increasingly widespread in recent years and noninvasive ventilation (NNV) applications&#xD;
      without endotracheal intubation have become the first choice in neonatal ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noninvasive ventilation defines methods of providing ventilation support with constant or&#xD;
      variable pressure using nasal or nasopharyngeal interfaces without endotracheal intubation or&#xD;
      tracheostomy. Noninvasive ventilation can be performed in a variety of forms such as&#xD;
      continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) nasal intermittent positive-pressure ventilation&#xD;
      (NIPPV) and high-flow nasal cannulae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different nasal interfaces are used to provide noninvasive ventilation support. For this&#xD;
      purpose, there is no standard apparatus used in neonatal intensive care units (NICU).&#xD;
      Nasopharyngeal cannulae are not currently recommended for use with NIV because they cause&#xD;
      extensive resistance during spontaneous breathing, nasopharyngeal area damage and&#xD;
      colonization, although they have been widely used in previous years. Today, short binasal&#xD;
      prongs and different types of nasal masks are the most commonly used nasal interfaces in the&#xD;
      NICU with the aim of providing NIV. Nasal interfaces are recommended to be placed on the&#xD;
      surface without causing pressure loss. For this purpose, hoods and fixing apparatus are&#xD;
      frequently used. For this reason, babies often become restless and agitated during NIV&#xD;
      applications. In addition, necrosis and deformities may develop in septum due to pressure of&#xD;
      nasal septum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RAM cannula (Neotech ™, Valencia, CA), a new nasal interface, is increasingly used in NID&#xD;
      applications in newborn infants. RAM seems ideal to allow effective and cranium development&#xD;
      in the prevention of pressure damage to the face due to the design of the cannula and the&#xD;
      need for head or face access to detect it. The RAM cannula is available in the inspiration&#xD;
      and expiration arms of the stroke while reducing the dead space in the respiratory tract due&#xD;
      to the low nasal prong diameter. Although the use of RAM cannula as a NIV interface in&#xD;
      newborn intensive care units is becoming increasingly widespread, the number of studies&#xD;
      related to RAM cannula is limited. Most of the studies investigating the effectiveness of&#xD;
      this interface were made on artificial lung models. In the study of &quot;Mukerji&quot; and colleagues,&#xD;
      the short binasal prong and RAM cannula were compared as interfaces in NIPPV application in&#xD;
      the artificial lung model and it was found that carbon dioxide excretion in short binasal&#xD;
      prongs was better than RAM cannula with an increase in peak inspiratory pressure. Studies&#xD;
      conducted by Iyer and colleagues in the artificial lung model show that RAM leakage rates&#xD;
      below 30% lead to adequate pressure transfer to the cannulae, while leakage rates above 50%&#xD;
      reduce pressure transfer to the lungs. Similar results have also been found in the work of&#xD;
      &quot;Gerdes&quot; et al. A number of studies have been conducted on the clinical use of RAM as a&#xD;
      noninvasive ventilation interface and in these studies it has been shown that the use of RAM&#xD;
      cannula as an interface in NCPAP, NIPPV or even nasal high frequency ventilation applications&#xD;
      to provide NIV is not well tolerated and does not cause gastric perforation or nasal septum&#xD;
      damage. In the study of &quot;Nzegwu&quot; et al. It has been shown that in two-thirds of the patients&#xD;
      who were treated with RAM cannula and NIV support, the respiratory support was successfully&#xD;
      cut off. Nevertheless, none of these studies compared the RAM cannula activity with the other&#xD;
      binasal prongs or nasal masks. Investigators compared the effectiveness (rates of surfactant&#xD;
      therapy application, rates of intubation, total NIV duration) and nasal injury rates of RAM&#xD;
      cannula and short binasal prong as NIV interfaces in preterm infants at neonatal intensive&#xD;
      care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the studies made in the artificial lung models of RAM cannulas, which are&#xD;
      becoming increasingly widespread in the NICUs, because of their simple and simple design and&#xD;
      easy connection to the standard circuits of the ventilators without any intervention,&#xD;
      investigators think that the effectiveness of NIV application is insufficient compared to the&#xD;
      short binasal cannula.&#xD;
