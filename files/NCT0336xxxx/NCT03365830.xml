  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reproduction is in fact the most basic instinct of all living things. The fertility of a&#xD;
      woman is both a biological fact and a determinant of gender role in society. Motherhood is&#xD;
      still seen as the primary role for women in society. Infertility, which manifests itself as a&#xD;
      sudden and unexpected life crisis, is an unexpected, perhaps unexplained, condition that&#xD;
      spreads over a long period of time, creates extreme stress and forces adjustment mechanisms.&#xD;
      Infertility can affect the quality of life by adversely affecting the physical, emotional,&#xD;
      social and relational living spaces of people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study examines the effects of reproductive problems on the quality of life in&#xD;
      women who receive infertility treatment, and in the direction of the results obtained, the&#xD;
      treatment recipients of the health workers are planned to help develop a holistic perspective&#xD;
      that takes into account not only reproductive problems but also other affected living areas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infertility is a psychological threat, emotional stress, economically expensive, painful and&#xD;
      complex life crisis for the treatment for couples. Infertility has negative effects on social&#xD;
      and psychological well-being rather than physical health. Infertile people accept this&#xD;
      situation as a serious apology, and as a result of their emotional feeling, they are isolated&#xD;
      from their surroundings over time. Therefore, infertility is not a simple gynecologic&#xD;
      syndrome, and it is a condition that especially affects the woman very biologically,&#xD;
      psychologically and socially, resulting in a decrease in health and quality of life. While&#xD;
      infertility is not a life threatening health problem, the couple threatens healthy life with&#xD;
      negative effects on mental health and quality of life and is defined as a life crisis by some&#xD;
      authors. Studies in infertile couples have shown that women experience more anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, stress and hostility in their lives than men, and that sexual life is negatively&#xD;
      affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, unforeseen infertility, often unexplained and unpredictable, is considered to have&#xD;
      created a stressful situation that pushes the coping mechanisms for a couple and destroys the&#xD;
      sense of health and integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The more a woman's identity is defined by her being a mother, the greater the amount of her&#xD;
      psychological distress and disability. The longer the duration of infertility, the more&#xD;
      dominance and hopelessness dominate and this can result in a greater depression. Generally,&#xD;
      psychosocial effects of infertility also affect the components of quality of life in a&#xD;
      negative way. The most affected areas are mental health, emotional behavior, environmental&#xD;
      psychology, physical and social functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In many studies, it was determined that stress, anxiety and depression scores of infertile&#xD;
      couples were higher than the fertile population. Anger, nervousness, decreased self-esteem,&#xD;
      poor interpersonal relationships, reduced life satisfaction, anxiety and depression are&#xD;
      frequently seen psychological disorders associated with infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, infertility is a stressful event for couples with children, and it is also a&#xD;
      condition that affects the relationship of couples. The infertile couples have profoundly&#xD;
      affected their marriages and social lives because of the long treatment duration, the&#xD;
      destructive effect on the continuing mental health, the complexity of the treatment&#xD;
      procedures, the unusual and long steps required and the consequences of the IVF treatment.&#xD;
