    <textblock>
      The aims of the study are to evaluate the effect of low-phosphate diet on FGF23 level and to&#xD;
      determine the optimal amount of dietary phosphate restriction in hemodialysis patients. In&#xD;
      particular, the investigators will assess the comparing effect of pre-specified low-phosphate&#xD;
      diets, very low-phosphate diet, phosphate-to-protein ratio (PPR) value of 8 mg/g, versus&#xD;
      low-phosphate diet, PPR value of 10 mg/g, on the change of FGF23 and phosphate level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with hemodialysis, the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is high, and is&#xD;
      the leading cause of death. Among several cardiovascular risk factors of hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients, elevated fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) level is common, and plays major role&#xD;
      in the development of CVD with independent pathophysiologic mechanisms. Evidence from animal&#xD;
      studies demonstrated that low-phosphate diet reduced FGF23 level. Clinical trials assessing&#xD;
      the effect of dietary phosphate restriction on FGF23 focused on non-dialysis populution.&#xD;
      However, little is known about the effect of low-phosphate diet on FGF23 in hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients who have higher prevalence of hyperphosphatemia and severely elevated FGF23 level.&#xD;
      In addition, current clinical guideline, based on evidence from observational studies of&#xD;
      non-dialysis population, has recommended that dietary phosphate intake should be restricted&#xD;
      to 800-1000 mg/day (adjusted for dietary protein needs) when serum phosphate levels are&#xD;
      greater than 5.5 mg/dL in those with kidney failure. For hemodialysis population, the optimal&#xD;
      amount of dietary phosphate restriction has not been determined. The aims of the study are to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of low-phosphate diet on FGF23 level and to determine the optimal amount&#xD;
      of dietary phosphate restriction in hemodialysis patients. In particular, the investigators&#xD;
      will compare the effect of pre-specified low-phosphate diets, very low-phosphate diet,&#xD;
      phosphate-to-protein ratio (PPR) value of 8 mg/g, versus low-phosphate diet, PPR value of 10&#xD;
      mg/g, on the change of FGF23 and phosphate level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is to conduct a randomized, active-controlled trial with cross-over design at a&#xD;
      hemodialysis unit of tertiary teaching hospital in Northern Taiwan. Subjects with aged older&#xD;
      than 20 years, end-stage renal disease undergoing thrice-weekly hemodialysis for more than&#xD;
      three months, having adequate dialysis (urea reduction ratio equal to or greater than 65%)&#xD;
      and the most recent serum phosphate level greater than 5.5 mg/dL or between 3.5 and 5.5 mg/dL&#xD;
      with regular phosphate binder use will be randomly assigned into two groups: those in group A&#xD;
      will receive 2-day diet with known PPR of 8 mg/g, followed by 5-day washout period and then&#xD;
      receive another 2-day diet with PPR of 10 mg/g. The opposite order of diets will be&#xD;
      prescribed in group B. The study diets will be prepared and cooked at hospital cafeteria.&#xD;
      Dietary compositions of the study diets were analyzed before the start of the study. Primary&#xD;
      outcome measures are difference in change-from-baseline intact FGF-23 level between the two&#xD;
      dietary interventions. Secondary outcomes include changes in serum phosphate, intact&#xD;
      parathyroid hormone and C-terminal FGF-23 level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since food additives include readily absorbable inorganic phosphorus, only natural food&#xD;
      sources were chosen for study diets. All study food items had the following unique&#xD;
      characteristics including: 1. Using locally produced raw materials. 2. Meeting healthy and&#xD;
      safety requirements. 3. Complying with national quality standards. Prior to enrollment of the&#xD;
      eligible patients, the study diets were prepared and cooked with the food hygiene practice&#xD;
      using Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system at hospital cafeteria and&#xD;
      dietary composition of study diets were analyzed for chemical analysis. With reference to&#xD;
      Association of Official Analytical Communities (AOAC) Official Method 984.27, phosphorus, and&#xD;
      calcium were determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES)&#xD;
      analysis with the detection limit of 0.1 mg/L. In brief, the sample weight were obtained, the&#xD;
      edible portions of samples were ashed at high temperature, digested in nitric acid, and used&#xD;
      inductively coupled plasma to determine their actual contents of phosphorus and calcium. With&#xD;
      reference to Taiwanese official methods, study diets were measured for analyses of protein,&#xD;
      fat, saturated fat, sugar, moisture, and ash. Carbohydrates were calculated by the formula:&#xD;
      100 - (Protein + Fat + Moisture + Ash) (g/100 g). Calories were calculated by the formula:&#xD;
      Protein (g) x 4 kcal + Fat (g) x 9 kcal + Carbohydrate (g) x 4 kcal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the measured values of food items, dietitian had crafted low-phosphate diets. Less&#xD;
      than 800 mg per day of phosphate amount is designed to fulfill the current clinical&#xD;
      recommendation. Two different contents of phosphate diets were prepared to find out the&#xD;
      optimal amount of dietary phosphate. Each of the diets was designed to have similar calcium,&#xD;
      protein and total caloric contents but only differ in phosphate contents. To enhance&#xD;
      nutrition, and to reduce phosphate amount and bioavailability, study diets were designed to&#xD;
      fulfill the following criteria including high protein diet (≧1.2 g/kg/day), adequate calories&#xD;
      (≧ 30 kcal/kg/day), low phosphate-to-protein ratio (&lt; 10 mg/g), and higher percentage of&#xD;
      plant source of phosphate than that of animal source. In addition, meats were sliced and&#xD;
      boiled for 30 minutes before cooking to reduce the amount of phosphate while preserving&#xD;
      protein content.&#xD;
