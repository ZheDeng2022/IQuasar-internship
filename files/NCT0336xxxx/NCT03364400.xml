    <textblock>
      This study is an an open-label Phase I trial of VT1021 in patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors. Patients must have recurrent or advanced cancer (i.e., solid tumors) for which&#xD;
      standard therapy offers no curative potential.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase I study of VT1021 in patients with advanced solid tumors. The&#xD;
      study will include a Dose Escalation Phase and a Dose Expansion Phase. Upon determination of&#xD;
      the Recommended Phase 2 Dose in the Dose Escalation Phase, the Dose Expansion Phase will be&#xD;
      opened. The Dose Expansion Phase will include cohorts in ovarian, pancreatic, triple negative&#xD;
      breast cancer, glioblastoma and CD36-high patients in order to confirm the tolerability of&#xD;
      VT1021 against specific tumor types.&#xD;
