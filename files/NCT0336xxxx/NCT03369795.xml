  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent double-blind placebo-controlled study has tested the effect of methotrexate as an&#xD;
      add-on treatment for patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, administering&#xD;
      10 mg of methotrexate or placebo once a week for a period of three months to 72 patients&#xD;
      (Chaudry, Husain et al. 2015). Results showed improvement both in positive symptoms, as&#xD;
      measured by the Positive symptoms subscale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale&#xD;
      (PANSS), and in total PANSS scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to replicate Chaudry et al.'s study. This proposed study will&#xD;
      randomize schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder patients to methotrexate or placebo for a&#xD;
      period of four months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll patients with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective&#xD;
      disorder confirmed by the Modified Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis (SCID). In&#xD;
      order to be eligible to enter the study, the patient must have a score of 4 (moderately ill)&#xD;
      or greater on the Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) scale. In addition, inclusion&#xD;
      criteria reflect patients with moderate or more severity on positive symptoms, hence having a&#xD;
      score of 4 (moderate) or above on two of the following four PANSS items: delusions,&#xD;
      hallucinatory behaviors, conceptual disorganization or suspiciousness/ persecution. Patients&#xD;
      receiving more than one anti-psychotic or depot antipsychotic will be allowed to participate,&#xD;
      and patients receiving anti-cholinergic agents, beta-blockers, anti-depressants,&#xD;
      mood-stabilizers, sedatives, and anti-anxiety agents will be allowed in the study. Because&#xD;
      the clinical status of patients sometimes improves in the days following admission to the&#xD;
      hospital, newly hospitalized patients will have their baseline visit 3 days or more after&#xD;
      being hospitalized.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of Methotrexate compared to&#xD;
      placebo, as add-on to anti-psychotics in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia or&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDPOINTS Primary outcome measure: PANSS positive score at the end of the trial. Secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures: PANSS total, negative and general psychopathology scales, Clinical Global&#xD;
      Impression Scale-Severity (CGI-S) and Global Impression Scale-Improvement (CGI-I), Social&#xD;
      Functioning Scale Assessment (PSP) and rates of drop outs before the end of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN Randomized, add-on to anti-psychotics, double blind, placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASSESSMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). PANSS is a 30-item rating scale widely&#xD;
           used in assessment of medication effects in schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement&#xD;
           (CGI-I). CGI-S and CGI-I will be used to assess severity of the illness and global&#xD;
           improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser (UKU) Side Effect Rating Scale: will be used to&#xD;
           assess commonly occurring side effects caused by anti-psychotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The methotrexate toxicity checklist includes rash, oral ulceration, nausea and vomiting,&#xD;
           diarrhea, new or increasing dyspnea, new or increasing dry cough, severe sore throat,&#xD;
           and abnormal bruising.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale will be used to assess social&#xD;
           functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURE At the screening visit informed consent will be obtained, inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be examined, and demographic information will be collected. The PANSS, CGI-S&#xD;
      and SCID assessment will be administered, a physical examination will be done, psychiatric&#xD;
      and medical history obtained, and blood samples for chemistry and CBC, and urine samples for&#xD;
      urinalysis will be taken. Patients will liver function levels higher than normal will be&#xD;
      excluded. Females of child-bearing potential will be tested for pregnancy. Patients will be&#xD;
      screened for HIV, Hepatitis B and C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline visit, The PANSS, CGI-S, UKU, and PSP will be administered. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to start study medication: Methotrexate 10 mg/week or equivalent dose of placebo&#xD;
      will be administered to patients. Medication dose will start at 10mg for the first two weeks&#xD;
      and will then be increased to 15 mg. Patients will also be instructed to take 5 mg/day of&#xD;
      folic acid for 6 days/week in order to avoid vitamin deficiencies due to the methotrexate&#xD;
      use. In order to monitor potential side-effects, blood tests for CBC and SMA will be taken at&#xD;
      screening, week 2, week 4, week 8, week 12, and week 16 (EOS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assessed at clinic visits according to timelines described above.&#xD;
      Additionally, during the weeks in which patients will not come for clinic visits, they will&#xD;
      have phone visits in order to monitor medication adherence and adverse events. Throughout all&#xD;
      the visits between baseline and end of study, patients will be checked for methotrexate&#xD;
      toxicity using the methotrexate toxicity checklist which inquires for includes rash, oral&#xD;
      ulceration, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, new or increasing dyspnea, new or increasing dry&#xD;
      cough, severe sore throat, and abnormal bruising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A final, End-of-Study, clinical evaluation will occur on Week 16, or at the time of early&#xD;
      discontinuation from the study, and will include a physical examination; vital signs; rating&#xD;
      of the PANSS, CGI-S, CGI-I, UKU, PSP, review of adverse events, methotrexate toxicity&#xD;
      checklist and concomitant medications. Blood samples will be taken for SMA, CBC, and urine&#xD;
      samples for urinalysis. Females of child-bearing potential will be tested for pregnancy, and&#xD;
      a blood sample for medication levels will be taken.&#xD;
