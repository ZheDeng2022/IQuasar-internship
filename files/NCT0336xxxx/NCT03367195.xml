  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-arm, prospective, double-blind double-dummy, randomized-controlled study&#xD;
      comparing DLBS2411 at a dose of 250 mg twice daily with omeprazole at a dose of 20 mg twice&#xD;
      daily, given before morning and evening meals, for an 8-week course of therapy. Subjects&#xD;
      should avoid taking meals 2-3 hours before bedtime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bioactive fraction of DLBS2411 has been proved at cellular and genetic levels to have an&#xD;
      antiulcer effect through both suppressing the gastric acidity and enhancing gastric mucosal&#xD;
      protection. The anti-secretory effect of DLBS2411 is exerted through the inhibition of H+/K+&#xD;
      ATPase 'pump' as well as down-regulation of the H+/K+ ATPase gene expression, thus&#xD;
      suppressing gastric acid secretion; while its cytoprotective defense mechanism works through&#xD;
      the promotion of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) derived prostaglandin (PgE2) synthesis, thus&#xD;
      promoting gastrointestinal submucosal blood-flow, stimulating secretion of gastric-epithelial&#xD;
      mucous and bicarbonate; anti-oxidative activity; and endothelial-nitric oxide (NO) formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent study of DLBS2411 which was conducted in healthy volunteers, demonstrated the&#xD;
      effective role and safety of DLBS2411 in suppressing intragastric acidity. Having such&#xD;
      mechanisms of action, DLBS2411 is hypothesized to benefit patients with gastric acid&#xD;
      disorders such as in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      There will be 2 groups of treatment; each group will consist of 129 subjects with the&#xD;
      treatment regimens for 8 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment I : 1 capsule of Omeprazole 20 mg and 1 placebo caplet of DLBS2411, twice daily&#xD;
      Treatment II : 1 caplet of DLBS2411 250 mg and 1 placebo capsule of omeprazole, twice daily&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study medication will be administered twice daily, 30 minutes before morning (the first)&#xD;
      and evening (the last) meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligible subjects will be randomly allocated to receive study medication (Treatment 1 or&#xD;
      Treatment 2) for 8 weeks of treatment, in a double blind fashion. They will be asked to come&#xD;
      to the clinic every 4-week interval throughout the study period. Treatment Group 1 will&#xD;
      receive Omeprazole twice daily and Placebo DLBS2411 twice daily. While Treatment Group 2 will&#xD;
      receive DLBS2411 twice daily and Placebo Omeprazole twice daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated for treatment efficacy at baseline and at interval of 4 weeks over&#xD;
      the 8-week course of therapy. Throughout the 8-week therapy, subjects should record the&#xD;
      frequency (presence and absence) of each of GERD symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation,&#xD;
      epigastric pain, nausea) daily in the provided Patient's Diary. The severity of each symptom&#xD;
      experienced should also be self-evaluated and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety profile of study medication other than vital signs and adverse event will be&#xD;
      measured at baseline and end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along the study, subjects should avoid taking meals 2-3 hours before bedtime. All subjects&#xD;
      will be under direct supervision of a medical doctor during the study period.&#xD;

    Very low recruitment rate. The Study Site classifies as tertiary referral hospital. Therefore,&#xD;
