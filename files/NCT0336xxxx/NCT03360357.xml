    <textblock>
      A recent survey of obstetrics and gynecology fellowship program directors showed that&#xD;
      graduating OB/GYN residents may be underprepared for advanced laparoscopic training,&#xD;
      necessitating an evaluation of the current structure of resident and fellow curriculum.&#xD;
      Specifically, only 46% of first year fellows were able to independently perform an abdominal&#xD;
      hysterectomy. Out of 28 residents tested using a previously validated laparoscopic cuff&#xD;
      suturing model, only 8 (28.6%) passed the assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, it is necessary to identify the most effective and efficient educational&#xD;
      approaches to obtain procedural proficiency. Time and effort has been placed in developing&#xD;
      simulation programs. Simulation has shown promising outcomes in improving the performance of&#xD;
      trainees and attending physicians with the ultimate objective of generating better surgeons.&#xD;
      A previous meta-analysis of simulation-based educational assessments demonstrated that these&#xD;
      assessments correlate positively with patient-related outcomes. However, there are limited&#xD;
      studies with adequate validity to use simulation for summative evaluations of performance for&#xD;
      gynecology residents. The widely used Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) program is&#xD;
      used for credentialing of general surgeons, however, a systematic review suggested that more&#xD;
      validity evidence is required to support its content (selection of tasks and scoring rubric)&#xD;
      and the consequences (favorable and unfavorable impact) assessment. Although there has been&#xD;
      an increase in the number of models available to teach OB/GYN common gynecologic procedures,&#xD;
      there is a lack of evidence to support that these methods are actually allowing residents to&#xD;
      create better surgical skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the current limitations in OB/GYN training, the investigators have developed&#xD;
      short, guided drills that cover the steps required for laparoscopic suturing and allow&#xD;
      residents opportunities for deliberate practice. These drills will be tested compared to&#xD;
      residents watching a laparoscopic suturing video and practicing using a high fidelity,&#xD;
      suturing simulation model. Both of these methods are standard educational approaches for&#xD;
      teaching laparoscopic skills, but it is unknown if one of the approaches is more effective&#xD;
      than the other.&#xD;

      Methods: Describe, in detail, the research activities that will be conducted under this&#xD;
      protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized controlled trial comparing laparoscopic suturing skills,&#xD;
      specifically vaginal cuff closure, of OBGYN residents, fellows, and faculty using two&#xD;
      different teaching methods and evaluate if there is any significant difference in their&#xD;
      performance after teaching with the two different educational approaches. The laparoscopic&#xD;
      camera/scope within a box trainer will video record the drills and the cuff suturing&#xD;
      evaluation anonymously. These anonymous videos will be used to set proficiency standards for&#xD;
      the drills and evaluate which educational approach is most effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The educational video and high fidelity simulation practice group will watch a 10 minute&#xD;
      educational video on how to suture laparoscopically and then practice using a high fidelity&#xD;
      simulation model for 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second group is going to consist of &quot;guided drills&quot; as their laparoscopic training for 15&#xD;
      minutes. The residents will perform 5 set of exercises:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. &quot;Needle Dance&quot; (Learning to manipulate the suture)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. &quot;Loopy Loop&quot; (Learning to place needle through a loop)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. &quot;Slalom Course&quot; (Passing the needle and suture through 5 rings right handed and left&#xD;
           handed)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. &quot;Dense Matter&quot; (Passing the needle through dense material without losing control of the&#xD;
           needle)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. &quot;Respect for tissue&quot; (Passing the needle through flimsy material without tearing)&#xD;
&#xD;
      After these exercises have been completed the participants will proceed to the 5 minute&#xD;
      laparoscopic suturing evaluation. The evaluation will consist of closing the vaginal cuff in&#xD;
      a previously validated simulator. The residents will have a determined amount of time to&#xD;
      complete this task and the laparoscopic suturing will be filmed anonymously. Once the&#xD;
      encounter is finished, the video will be saved, reviewed and graded using the previously&#xD;
      validated global operative assessment of laparoscopic skills (GOALS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  needle handling,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  getting the needle into the loop&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  vaginal mucosa incorporation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  depth perception&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  bimanual dexterity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  efficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tissue handling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autonomy. Each area will consist of a score between 1 and 5. The &quot;passing score&quot; that&#xD;
           defines proficiency will be 32 points as this number has been related to advance&#xD;
           novice-expert in the past.&#xD;
