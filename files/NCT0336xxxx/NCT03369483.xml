      During abdominal surgery, the intra abdominal pressure may increase determining lung bibasal&#xD;
      atelectasis. The investigators hypothesized that the application of Positive End Expiratory&#xD;
      Pressure (PEEP) promptly after extubation through Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)&#xD;
      would improved gas exchange, especially in those patients with abdominal pressure values&#xD;
      close to those applied by CPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have therefore designed this subset study enrolling patients randomized to&#xD;
      receive CPAP in the &quot;Prevention of Respiratory Insufficiency after Surgical Management&#xD;
      (PRISM)&quot; Trial in order to ascertain the abdominal pressure in post-surgical patients&#xD;
      (abdominal open surgery procedures) enrolled in PRISM trial. In addition they would evaluate&#xD;
      the effects of CPAP on abdominal pressure and consequently on arterial blood gas, and whether&#xD;
      there is a correlation between PEEP values, abdominal pressure values and arterial blood gas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred patients included in CPAP group of the PRISM trial will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      subset study. The investigators will perform measurements of the abdominal pressure an&#xD;
      urinary catheter connected with an intra-abdominal pressure device (Uno-Meter ® -&#xD;
      Uno-medical) in all patients undergoing on open-surgical procedures after mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation withdrawal and extubation, 30 minutes and 4 hours after the application of CPAP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major abdominal surgery is associated with adverse changes in respiratory function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia can cause reduced vital capacity, hypoxaemia and impaired central respiratory&#xD;
      drive, while surgical manipulation can restrict ventilation, damage the respiratory muscles&#xD;
      and cause atelectasis. These factors interact with pre-existing respiratory disease and&#xD;
      postoperative pain to create a significant risk of pneumonia and respiratory failure, which&#xD;
      may result in death. Evidence from one study suggests that the risk of mortality within 30&#xD;
      days of surgery is increased from 1% to 27% in patients with respiratory failure. Usual&#xD;
      treatments including supplemental oxygen or respiratory physiotherapy may not always prevent&#xD;
      deterioration in respiratory function. Subsequent respiratory failure can lead to&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, which is in turn associated with a range&#xD;
      of serious morbidities. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a non-invasive method&#xD;
      of supporting respiratory function. The patient breathes through a pressurized circuit&#xD;
      against a threshold resistor that maintains a pre-set positive airway pressure during both&#xD;
      inspiration and expiration. The findings of several trials have demonstrated the efficacy of&#xD;
      CPAP as preventative treatment for high-risk patients following abdominal surgery by reducing&#xD;
      the incidence postoperative pulmonary complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have hypothesized that the application of Positive End Expiratory Pressure&#xD;
      (PEEP) promptly after extubation through CPAP would improved gas exchange, especially in&#xD;
      those patients with abdominal pressure values close to those applied by CPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have therefore designed this subset study enrolling patients randomized to&#xD;
      receive CPAP in the &quot;Prevention of Respiratory Insufficiency after Surgical Management&#xD;
      (PRISM)&quot; Trial in order to ascertain the abdominal pressure in post-surgical patients&#xD;
      (abdominal open surgery procedures) enrolled in PRISM trial. In addition they would evaluate&#xD;
      the effects of CPAP on abdominal pressure and consequently on arterial blood gas, and whether&#xD;
      there is a correlation between PEEP values, abdominal pressure values and arterial blood gas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred patients included in CPAP group of the PRISM trial will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      subset study. To be included in the PRISM trial, patients are required to be 50 years/old or&#xD;
      over and to undergo major, open, intra-peritoneal surgery. Patients are excluded of meeting&#xD;
      one or more of the following: 1) inability or refusal to provide informed consent; 2)&#xD;
      anticipated requirement for invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation or at least four&#xD;
      hours after surgery as part of routine care; 3) pregnancy or obstetric surgery; 4) previous&#xD;
      enrolment in PRISM trial; 5) participation in a clinical trial of a treatment with a similar&#xD;
      biological; 6) mechanism or related primary outcome measure and 7) clinician refusal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPAP will be provided for at least four hours, with minimal interruption, started soon after&#xD;
      the patient has left the operating room after surgery. Administration of CPAP will only take&#xD;
      place under the direct supervision of appropriately trained staff in an adequately equipped&#xD;
      clinical area. The monitoring of patients receiving CPAP will be in accordance with local&#xD;
      hospital policy or guidelines. Alterations to the administered dose will be recorded along&#xD;
      with the reason for this change. Clinicians may only use commercially available CPAP&#xD;
      equipment to deliver the intervention. The starting airway pressure should be 5 cmH2O and the&#xD;
      maximal permissible airway pressure is 10 cmH2O.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform measurements of the abdominal pressure an urinary catheter&#xD;
      connected with an intra-abdominal pressure device (Uno-Meter ® - Uno-medical) in all patients&#xD;
      undergoing on open-surgical procedures after mechanical ventilation withdrawal and&#xD;
      extubation, 30 minutes and 4 hours after the application of CPAP. Moreover, arterial blood&#xD;
      will be sample for gas analysis at every aforementioned time-step.&#xD;
