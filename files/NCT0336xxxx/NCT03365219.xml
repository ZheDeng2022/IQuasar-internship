  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post cesarean section surgical site infection (SSI) is a common complication that can affect&#xD;
      patient recovery and overall outcome. Several approaches have been studied to improve SSI&#xD;
      rates such as timing of antibiotic administration and skin preparation. Alexis retractors&#xD;
      have been suggested as a reasonable option to decrease SSI. However, to date there is only&#xD;
      one randomized controlled study assessing its efficacy. The aim of this study is to whether&#xD;
      Alexis wound retractors are beneficial in preventing cesarean section SSI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design was a randomized controlled study to evaluate wound infection rates in&#xD;
      patients undergoing a cesarean delivery. The patients were randomized into two sub- groups;&#xD;
      the first group received routine hand-held metal retractors as needed by the surgical team,&#xD;
      and the second group received an Alexis Wound Retractor. Inclusion criteria included:&#xD;
      maternal age of at least 18 years, a gestational age of at least 24 0/7 wks by best obstetric&#xD;
      estimate, a viable gestation, a non-emergent cesarean delivery, and a planned transverse skin&#xD;
      incision. Deliveries included: primary cesarean for failed induction, maternal request, or&#xD;
      other obstetric indications; and repeat cesarean deliveries that were elective or had&#xD;
      obstetric indications (such as spontaneous labor in a subject with a term gestation and with&#xD;
      history of 2 or more prior cesarean deliveries). Exclusion criteria included&#xD;
      chorioamnionitis, chronic corticosteroid therapy, a prior abdominal vertical skin incision&#xD;
      scar or planned vertical incision, history of a prior wound infection or separation, a&#xD;
      planned cesarean hysterectomy, or maternal or fetal complications requiring an emergent&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was done using a web-based randomization generator. Variables were allocated&#xD;
      as: 1 for Alexis, and 0 for conventional surgical retractors. Packages including consent&#xD;
      forms, data sheets, and the randomized allocation were prepared for the entire study and were&#xD;
      stored in one office. Study packets were prepared to include a sealed envelope indicating&#xD;
      randomization to be opened after the consent form was signed. Only after randomization, the&#xD;
      Alexis retractor was opened and placed on the surgical field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to initiation of the study, in-service sessions were conducted with OB surgical teams&#xD;
      to facilitate the use of the retractors. Information provided included optimal use of the&#xD;
      retractor and selection of the appropriate retractor size. The primary surgeon of each case&#xD;
      was previously trained by the principle investigator in placement of the retractor on actual&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a decision was made to proceed with cesarean delivery, the subject was approached and&#xD;
      offered to participate in the study. After the patient had been enrolled and consent forms&#xD;
      signed, an allocated envelope for each study subject determined which arm of the study to&#xD;
      which the patient would be randomized; no other management decisions was made as part of the&#xD;
      RCT. Surgical decisions were independent of the patient's designated study arm and retractor&#xD;
      type. Such decisions included: type of anesthesia, length of transverse skin incision ,&#xD;
      method of tissue dissection (blunt vs. instrumental), creation of bladder flap, size and&#xD;
      nature of uterine incision (transverse, low vertical, classical, J-type, T-incision),&#xD;
      surgical material used, exteriorization of the uterus, manual vs. spontaneous delivery of&#xD;
      placenta, layer closure techniques (bladder flap, peritoneum, subcutaneous tissue), and skin&#xD;
      closure technique (staples, subcuticular sutures). Skin preoperative preparation was&#xD;
      performed as standard with ChloraPrepÂ® Applicator (2% Chlorhexidine gluconate and 70%&#xD;
      isopropyl alcohol). Intravenous antibiotics were given preoperatively in accordance to&#xD;
      national guidelines (12). The primary outcome of this study was the development of a surgical&#xD;
      site infection after cesarean delivery within two weeks after cesarean.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incisions were checked daily in-house. However, the exams that were used in this study to&#xD;
      determine the occurrences of SSI were the first exam done in the outpatient setting for&#xD;
      removal of staples (post op days 5 - 7), and the two week post partum visit (post op days 14&#xD;
      - 18). SSIs were diagnosed according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&#xD;
      criteria.(13). The most commonly seen characteristics were purulent drainage or localized&#xD;
      swelling and/or redness of the surgical wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, other wound complications were also assessed and included: seroma (wounds with&#xD;
      clear drainage) and/or hematomas. Other secondary outcomes included skin time to uterine&#xD;
      incision (minutes) , exteriorization of the uterus(yes, no), total operative time (minutes),&#xD;
      estimated blood loss (mL) estimated by the primary surgeon, and postoperative pain based on a&#xD;
      subjective 1-10 pain scale, assessed 4 times daily while hospitalized and at the outpatient&#xD;
      visits previously mentioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial sample size estimate was performed using the frequentist approach with an&#xD;
      assumption of power 80% and Type 1 error = 5% (2-sided). The primary outcome of the study is&#xD;
      expected to occur in 15% of women in the &quot;usual care&quot; group. In order to detect a 50%&#xD;
      reduction (15% to 7.5%) in the rate of wound complications with the use of the Alexis&#xD;
      retractor, a total sample size of 564 women will be needed (282 per group). The planned study&#xD;
      was to be carried out at two distinct sites: the University of Texas Medical Branch in&#xD;
      Galveston (UTMB) and the University of Texas in Houston. The Institutional Review Board of&#xD;
      UTMB-Galveston IRB # 10-188 approved the study.&#xD;
