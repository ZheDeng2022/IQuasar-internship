  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to apply best-practice stated-preference methods to&#xD;
      quantify the extent to which women with ovarian cancer accept the risks, side effects, and&#xD;
      out-of-pocket costs associated with treatment in return for progression-free survival benefit&#xD;
      afforded by a treatment, regardless of whether there is an overall survival benefit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to perform a preferences survey to be administered to women with&#xD;
      ovarian cancer.The investigators anticipate that about 1/3 of the study cohort will include&#xD;
      patients who are receiving treatment with an oral ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi).&#xD;
      The investigators will begin by conducting interviews with 5 pilot subjects as they test the&#xD;
      preferences survey. Based on their feedback the survey may be updated for clarity. During the&#xD;
      final survey phase, subjects will be recruited and invited to participate in the choice&#xD;
      experiment by Biologics, Inc., a specialty pharmacy company that dispenses oral PARPis.&#xD;
      Subjects may also be recruited through ResearchMatch.org and at the Gynecologic Oncology&#xD;
      division at Duke. Up to 300 women may be included in this study, at least 100 women will have&#xD;
      received treatment with a PARPi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discrete choice experiment (DCE) questions generate limited dependent-variable,&#xD;
      cross-section/time-series data. The study team will use random-parameters logit (RPL) to&#xD;
      analyze the choice-format conjoint data collected in the DCE survey. Unobserved variation in&#xD;
      preferences across the sample can bias estimates in conventional conditional-logit choice&#xD;
      models. RPL avoids this potential bias by estimating a distribution of preferences around&#xD;
      each model parameter that accounts for variations among individual preferences not accounted&#xD;
      for by the variables in the model. The flexible correlation structure of RPL also accounts&#xD;
      for within-sample correlation in the question sequence for each respondent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no physical risks to subject participation in this survey protocol.&#xD;
