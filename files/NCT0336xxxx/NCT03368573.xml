  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a condition that affects 3-5% of young&#xD;
      people under 18-years-old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Young people with ADHD have difficulties with attention, impulsivity and hyperactivity that&#xD;
      make it harder for them to learn, form relationships and prepare for adulthood. Clinical&#xD;
      guidelines state that young people taking medication for ADHD should be closely monitored and&#xD;
      have their medication reviewed regularly to ensure they receive the correct dose to improve&#xD;
      their symptoms. However, many young people aren't monitored as closely as guidelines&#xD;
      recommend. This can lead to lack of improvement or worsening of symptoms meaning that&#xD;
      children may not experience the benefits of medication as quickly as they should. At the&#xD;
      moment, assessing whether or not medication is working relies on the opinions of teachers and&#xD;
      parents, collected through questionnaires. The difficulties of this are: differences of&#xD;
      opinion between people, lack of information provided by them, and not returning the&#xD;
      questionnaires. A test performed on a computer (QbTest) provides doctors with a report of the&#xD;
      young person's symptoms and can therefore show whether medication is working. This may help&#xD;
      doctors reach accurate decisions about medication dose more quickly, reducing the need for&#xD;
      questionnaires. The study team met with families and young people with ADHD and medical&#xD;
      experts and developed a procedure for using QbTest to measure medication effects. The study&#xD;
      team will measure how well this procedure works in the real world by asking a group of young&#xD;
      people to complete the test when they first start taking medication and at their follow-up&#xD;
      appointments. The study team will ask doctors and families/young people for their opinions on&#xD;
      the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team shall share our findings with other researchers and with the public by&#xD;
      attending local support groups and providing summaries of the study results. The findings&#xD;
      will be used to prepare for a future study.&#xD;

      The primary objective of the study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the&#xD;
      study design using a feasibility RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end-points to assess this objective are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceptability of randomisation. The number of patients who do not participate and state&#xD;
           randomisation as the reason for non-participation. The study team shall also monitor&#xD;
           drop-out rates immediately after randomisation and the number of errors in randomisation&#xD;
           at each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceptability of study design. The number of eligible patients at each site and the&#xD;
           numbers who consent to take part/withdraw. Withdrawal rates will be recorded alongside&#xD;
           time point in the trial to ascertain acceptability of the study duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceptability of outcome measures. Completion rates for outcomes to determine most&#xD;
           appropriate methods of data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceptability/feasibility of protocol. Record non-adherence of healthcare professionals&#xD;
           to the protocol and explore reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility of future RCT. Estimate the hours per week needed to run the RCT and&#xD;
           therefore the number of research assistants/fellows required and time commitment&#xD;
           required by HCPs.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants in the experimental arm (QbTest) protocol will also undergo standard assessment as usual plus a QbTest. If a QbTest was not conducted within 12 weeks prior to starting medication (as part of the ADHD diagnostic assessment procedure) the young person will sit a QbTest at baseline (off medication). Once on medication they will sit another QbTest 2-4 weeks after commencing medication and again 8-10 weeks later (and no later than 12 weeks).&#xD;
Participants in the control arm will undergo standard treatment as usual for ADHD. This will involve the clinician reviewing the child's symptom improvement once on medication and altering the dose according to their clinical judgement which may be informed by rating scales (completed by the parent, teacher and/or young person) and interviews with the parent and young person.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>QbTest is a computerised assessment which takes approximately 20mins. The test combines a continuous performance test alongside an infrared camera which measures the participant's movements. The infrared camera measures motor activity of the participant whilst they undertake the task. During the test, the participant is presented with continuously changing stimuli. Embedded within these stimuli is a given target. Participants have to respond by pressing a hand-held button only when the target appears. Attention is measured through omission errors and reaction time to response. Impulsivity is assessed through commission errors and anticipatory errors. Motor activity is measured through head movements during the task. The test is approved by the FDA (Ref: K133382) and CE marked.</description>
