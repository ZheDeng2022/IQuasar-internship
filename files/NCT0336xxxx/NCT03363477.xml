      To demonstrate the pharmacodynamic (PD) equivalence of enoxaparin Rovi (100 mg/mL) 100-mg SC&#xD;
      injection to Clexane® (100 mg/mL) 100-mg SC injection in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;

      This is a single-dose, randomized, double-blind, 2-period, 2 sequence crossover study.&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened up to 30 days before the study begins and admitted to the clinic on&#xD;
      Day -1 of Period 1 for baseline assessments. Before dosing on Day 1 of Period 1, subjects&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to a treatment sequence. Subjects will receive a single dose of&#xD;
      study drug on Day 1 of each treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Period 1, subjects will receive a single dose by subcutaneous route of the&#xD;
      assigned study drug: enoxaparin (100 mg/mL) 100-mg SC injection manufactured by Rovi Spain,&#xD;
      or Clexane (100 mg/mL) 100-mg SC injection manufactured by Sanofi EU; after an overnight&#xD;
      fasting period of at least 10 hours. Subjects will continue fasting for at least 4 hours&#xD;
      after study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The washout period between administrations of study drug in each period will be at least 7&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Period 2, subjects will cross over to receive the dose of the other drug, after&#xD;
      an overnight fasting period of at least 10 hours. The total duration of the study will be&#xD;
      approximately 6 weeks.&#xD;

    <masking_description>This study will be double blinded in that the subjects and laboratories will be blinded. While the enoxaparin (manufactured by Rovi, Spain) and Clexane (manufactured by Sanofi, EU) solutions for SC injection may be identical in appearance, the prefilled syringes for both study drugs may not be identical. Therefore, the unblinded pharmacist will be responsible for dispensing the study drug in a manner consistent with maintaining the blind and a dedicated unblinded team member will perform study drug administration.</masking_description>
