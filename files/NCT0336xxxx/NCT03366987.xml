  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are two pathological conditions that&#xD;
      are highly prevalent worldwide and share multiple CVD risk factors. There is rare research&#xD;
      performed among elderly adults. The investigators are conducting a cross-sectional analysis&#xD;
      of elderly adults (≥65 years) to investigate the association between atrial fibrillation and&#xD;
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in an elderly Chinese population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because of the aging population and improvements in cardiovascular treatments, its prevalence&#xD;
      is expected to increase substantially over the next few decades. AF has been reported to be&#xD;
      associated with high rates of hospitalization and death. Along with older age, there are many&#xD;
      independent risk factors for AF like obesity, hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease,&#xD;
      heart failure and valvular heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is one of the most prevalent liver diseases in the world&#xD;
      whose prevalence ranges from 6% to 35%, with a median of 20% in the general population. In&#xD;
      recent years, an increasing body of evidence have indicated that NAFLD is linked to&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, myocardial abnormalities, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction,&#xD;
      heart failure, aortic valve sclerosis and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAFLD has also been observed to be significantly associated with AF in patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. Furthermore, a cohort study showed that NAFLD was associated with an increased risk&#xD;
      of prevalent AF in a middle-aged population. However, whether the association between NAFLD&#xD;
      and AF also holds true in the elderly population remains uncertain. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators conducted this cross-sectional study to explore the association between NAFLD&#xD;
      and AF in an elderly Chinese population.&#xD;
