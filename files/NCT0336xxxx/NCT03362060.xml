      This research study is studying immunotherapy as a possible treatment for metastatic Triple&#xD;
      Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) in participants who are HLA-A2+.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PVX-410&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase Ib clinical trial, which tests the safety of an&#xD;
      investigational drug combination and also tries to better understand how the investigational&#xD;
      intervention affects the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved&#xD;
      the combination of PVX-410 and pembrolizumab as a treatment regimen for this specific&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has not approved PVX-410 as a treatment for any disease. PVX-410 is a type of vaccine&#xD;
      that may help the immune system stimulate immunity against the cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has not approved pembrolizumab for this specific disease but it has been approved in&#xD;
      the United Sates for other types of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is a drug that may treat cancer by working with the immune system. The immune&#xD;
      system is the body's natural defense against disease. The immune system sends types of cells&#xD;
      throughout the body to detect and fight infections and diseases, including cancer. For some&#xD;
      types of cancer, the immune cells do not work as they should and are prevented from attacking&#xD;
      the tumors. Pembrolizumab is thought to work by blocking a protein in the cells called&#xD;
      Programmed Death-1 (PD-1), which then allows these cells and other parts of the immune system&#xD;
      to attack tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are studying the body's immune response to the&#xD;
      PVX-410 study vaccine in combination with pembrolizumab. This study will help researchers&#xD;
      understand if the vaccine and pembrolizumab can work together to help the body's immune&#xD;
      system recognize and treat triple negative breast cancer. The investigators are also studying&#xD;
      the safety of the PVX-410 together with the pembrolizumab&#xD;

          -  Female aged ≥18 years on the day of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HLA A2+ by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence analysis (by history with&#xD;
             documentation or as part of this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histopathological diagnosis of metastatic or inoperable locally advanced TNBC that&#xD;
             meets the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             --Triple negative defined as Estrogen Receptor (ER)&lt;1%, Progesterone Receptor (PR)&lt;1%,&#xD;
             and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) negative according to American&#xD;
             Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines&#xD;
             by local testing according to institutional standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For tumors with equivocal interpretation of receptor status (e.g., ER/PR ≥1% &quot;weak&quot; or&#xD;

             triple-negative status. For tumors with discrepant receptor results between 2 or more&#xD;
             biopsies (including metastatic and/or early stage biopsies), the Principal&#xD;
             Investigator will have final determination of triple negative status, but in general&#xD;
             the most recent biopsy can be used for eligibility purposes. If receptor testing is&#xD;

             resection; or, radiological or clinical evidence suggestive and supportive of&#xD;
             metastatic disease without a documented metastatic biopsy, provided the patient has a&#xD;
