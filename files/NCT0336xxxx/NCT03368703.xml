    <textblock>
      Patients with COPD have lower cortical activation and higher cortical inhibitory levels. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to test the reversibility the lower cortical activation by&#xD;
      counterbalancing the increased cortical inhibitory levels with neuro-modulation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients exhibit not only respiratory symptoms&#xD;
      but also a peripheral muscular weakness. This weakness is characterized by a loss in&#xD;
      strength, harmful for the patients' life quality and vital prognostic. Even if many papers&#xD;
      have enlightened damages at a peripheral level, the muscular atrophy itself cannot totally&#xD;
      explain the loss in force. Furthermore, the contractile properties of COPD muscles fibres are&#xD;
      preserved. Consequently, it seems that the peripheral muscle weakness cannot only be&#xD;
      explained by peripheral factors and central structures may be involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent work showed that during quadriceps voluntary contraction, cortical activation in&#xD;
      COPD patients was significantly lower than in healthy subjects, contributing in the loss in&#xD;
      strength. However, the pathophysiology underlying this loss of strength is still unclear and&#xD;
      two hypotheses can be advanced: 1) the influence of anatomical lesions in the brain of COPD&#xD;
      patients and 2) the particular metabolism of this population. Indeed, COPD patients show a&#xD;
      reduced oxidative activity and an increased glycolytic contribution (decreased type I fibres&#xD;
      and increased type II fibres, increased glycolytic enzymes activity, increased metabolites&#xD;
      production). This specific metabolic may lead to an over-activation of type III-IV afferents,&#xD;
      projecting onto somatosensory cortex sensitive to metabolites at a peripheral level, and&#xD;
      produce inhibitory activity on the primary motor cortex, seat of the motor control. What is&#xD;
      reported in the literature so far, is that COPD patients display increased cortical&#xD;
      inhibitory values than healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, beyond understanding better the nervous mechanisms involved in the COPD's&#xD;
      peripheral muscle weakness, the aim of this study is to counterbalance this increased&#xD;
      cortical inhibitory level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that modulating inhibitory processes at a cortical level would induced a&#xD;
      reduction of inhibitions in patients with COPD and an increase in the force produced. In case&#xD;
      this hypothesis would be verified, we will be able to confirm that this increased cortical&#xD;
      level in COPD patients is reversible and may be a target for rehabilitation.&#xD;

    <description>Sham tDCS consists of only 30s of ramp up followed by 30s of ramp down and no further stimulation.&#xD;
Participants therefore have the same feeling for both modalities : slight itching due to the induced current at the beginning of the protocol (during around 30s) allowing no differentiation by the participant between the anodal or sham sessions.</description>
