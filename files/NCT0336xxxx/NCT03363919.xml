    <textblock>
      The Researchers are going to gather information regarding the use of rTMS as a treatment for&#xD;
      depression in adolescents with Major Depressive Disorder. The researchers also hope to learn&#xD;
      if measures of brain activity (cortical excitability and inhibition) collected with&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be used to identify which patients will benefit&#xD;
      from certain types of rTMS treatment.&#xD;

      Phase I is a double-blind, randomized, biomarker-stratified trial of 1 Hz vs. 10 Hz rTMS.&#xD;
      Phase II is for participants who do not respond to Phase I treatment and is a biomarker&#xD;
      guided, double-blind trial of continuous vs intermittent theta burst stimulation (TBS).&#xD;
      Please note that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) biomarkers will be collected in this&#xD;
      protocol during the course of the proposed interventions. Participants in Phase I will be&#xD;
      offered enrollment in a separate protocol with baseline and posttreatment 7 Tesla Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) scans&#xD;

    <measure>Total Children's Depression Rating Scale, Revised (CDRS-R) score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The children's depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) (Poznanski and Mokros 1996) has become the most widely used rating scale for assessing severity of depression and change in depressive symptoms for clinical research trials in children and adolescents with depression. The CDRS-R, which was based on the adult Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, was originally developed as a rating scale for children aged 6-12 years. It is a 17-item scale, with items ranging from 1 to 5 or 1 to 7 (possible total score from 17 to 113), rated by a clinician via interviews with the child and parent. A score of ≥40 is indicative of depression, whereas a score ≤28 is often used to define remission (minimal or no symptoms)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intracortical Facilitation ICF</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly for 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Intracortical Facilitation will be the secondary continuous outcome measure. A within-Participants linear mixed model analysis of repeated measures will be used to examine the change in ICF over 6 weeks of rTMS treatment in depressed adolescents. We will consider the inclusion of pubertal state and treatment resistance (as defined by ATHF score) during the study period as a covariate in the mixed model. A mixed model analysis will be conducted on ICF for those who receive 6 weeks of low frequency (1 Hz) rTMS treatment (Hypothesis 2a) and, in a separate model, for those who receive 6 weeks of high frequency (10 Hz) rTMS treatment (Hypothesis 2c).</description>
