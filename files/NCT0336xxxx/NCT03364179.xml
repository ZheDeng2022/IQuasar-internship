  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From a scientific view, palliative care issues in dementia are neglected in Germany. Neither&#xD;
      in Germany nor internationally research has been conducted on palliative care issues in young&#xD;
      onset dementia (YOD), although significant differences compared to late onset dementia (LOD)&#xD;
      are expected. Most international studies have focused on patients in long term care (LTC)&#xD;
      facilities but have neglected patients that are cared for at home. We hypothesize that in&#xD;
      advanced and terminal stages of YOD and LOD unmet care needs exist and that they differ&#xD;
      between YOD and LOD. By prospectively assessing and surveying 200 patients with YOD and LOD&#xD;
      in advanced stages who are cared for in LTC facilities and at home and investigating&#xD;
      circumstances of death of 100 YOD- and LOD-patients, it is possible 1) to describe symptoms&#xD;
      and management, health care utilization, palliative care provision, quality of life and&#xD;
      death, elements of advance care planning, family caregivers' needs and satisfaction; 2) to&#xD;
      compare YOD and LOD; 3) to develop expert-consensus recommendations derived from study&#xD;
      results for the improvement and implementation of strategies and interventions for palliative&#xD;
      care provision. 4) to communicate the recommendations nationally and internationally in order&#xD;
      to improve and adapt guidelines, to implement the recommendations into daily practice and to&#xD;
      give a basis and perspectives for future research projects; to communicate the results to&#xD;
      patients and their families in order to counsel and support them in their decision making&#xD;
      processes and their dialogue with professional caregivers and physicians.&#xD;
