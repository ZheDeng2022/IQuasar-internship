  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, open-label, interventional clinical trial that will study the response&#xD;
      rate of pediatric glioma and plexiform neurofibroma (PN) to oral administration of&#xD;
      trametinib. Patients meeting all inclusion criteria for a given study group will receive the&#xD;
      study medication at a daily dose of 0.025 mg/kg up to a total of 18 cycles, in 28-day cycles.&#xD;
      A total of 150 patients will be recruited as part of this clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged between 1 month (corrected age) and 25 years old will be eligible, in order to&#xD;
      include a maximum of patients affected by low-grade glioma (LGG) and PN. This study includes&#xD;
      four groups: patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and LGG, NF1 patients with PN,&#xD;
      patients with LGG with a B-Raf Serine/Threonine-protein Kinase/Proto-oncogene Encoding B-Raf&#xD;
      (BRAF) fusion and patients with glioma of any grade with activation of the Mitogen-activated&#xD;
      Protein Kinase/Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinases (MAPK/ERK) pathway. All patients except&#xD;
      patients with PN must have failed at least one line of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also explore the molecular mechanisms behind tumor development, progression&#xD;
      and resistance to treatment. Furthermore, this study will also explore important aspects for&#xD;
      patients with brain tumors by including assessment of quality of life and neuropsychological&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
