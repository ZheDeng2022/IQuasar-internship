  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) constitute a heterogeneous group of clonal bone marrow&#xD;
      neoplasms that predominate in the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of 70 years. MDS&#xD;
      are characterized by peripheral blood cytopenia and morphologic dysplasia for one or more&#xD;
      hematopoietic cell lineage, reflecting ineffective hematopoiesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic work-up of MDS includes a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, which is an&#xD;
      invasive procedure, for cytomorphologic and cytogenetic evaluations. Because the prevalence&#xD;
      of disease is lower than 20% in subjects referred for suspected MDS, many patients are&#xD;
      exposed to unnecessary bone marrow aspiration-related discomfort and harms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An objective assay is highly desirable for accurately ruling out MDS based on peripheral&#xD;
      blood samples, which may obviate the need for invasive bone marrow aspiration and biopsy in&#xD;
      patients with negative results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have investigated the value of peripheral blood flow cytometric analysis for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of MDS and/or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Although promising, these&#xD;
      studies lacked replication of their results, used a case-control design, which was prone to&#xD;
      spectrum bias, or yielded imprecise diagnostic accuracy estimates due to relatively limited&#xD;
      sample sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anecdotal evidence supports the potential of flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood&#xD;
      neutrophil myeloperoxidase expression for the diagnosis of MDS and CMML. Myeloperoxidase is&#xD;
      an enzyme synthetized during myeloid differentiation that constitutes the major component of&#xD;
      neutrophil azurophilic granules. Myeloperoxidase expression may reflect neutrophil&#xD;
      hypogranulation, which is a classical although subjective dysplastic feature of MDS. Flow&#xD;
      cytometric analysis of myeloperoxidase expression in bone marrow neutrophil granulocytes has&#xD;
      been used for discriminating low versus high grade MDS. Yet a study reporting on the accuracy&#xD;
      of flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood neutrophil myeloperoxidase expression for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of MDS is still lacking, to our knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators hypothesize that flow cytometric analysis of neutrophil&#xD;
      myeloperoxidase expression in peripheral blood may accurately rule out MDS and obviate the&#xD;
      need for bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, with sensitivity approaching 100%, in routine&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this observational diagnostic accuracy study, burden will be null for recruited patients.&#xD;
      No specific intervention is assigned to participants. All diagnostic testing, procedures, and&#xD;
      medication ordering are performed at the discretion of attending physicians. Flow cytometry&#xD;
      analysis of peripheral blood neutrophil myeloperoxidase expression will not require&#xD;
      additional blood sample. A test result will have no impact on patient management. No&#xD;
      follow-up visits are planned in this cross-sectional study.&#xD;

      The primary objective of MPO-MDS-pilot study is to estimate the accuracy of flow cytometric&#xD;
      analysis of neutrophil myeloperoxidase expression in peripheral blood for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and/or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to provide accuracy estimates for prespecified thresholds of neutrophil myeloperoxidase&#xD;
           expression in peripheral blood in ruling out MDS and/or CMML.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to estimate the prevalence of alternate diagnosis established by bone marrow&#xD;
           cytomorphology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MPO-MDS-pilot project is a multicenter, phase II, cross-sectional, diagnostic accuracy&#xD;
      study of consecutive unselected patients referred for suspected MDS or CMML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: All consecutive patients referred to the immuno-hematology lab at the study sites&#xD;
      for suspicion of MDS will be screened for eligibility. A lab physician will review inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria, using computerized medical and laboratory records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Participants will be included in the study once all the screening activities&#xD;
      have been conducted and only if the patient meets all inclusion and none exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      The consent for flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood sample and data collection&#xD;
      through chart review will be sought under a regime of &quot;non-opposition&quot; (opt-out): after&#xD;
      appropriate written information is delivered, cross-sectional data will be collected except&#xD;
      in case of opposition from the patient. All patients included in the study will be assigned a&#xD;
      unique patient identification number. This number will be used to identify the patient&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Index test: Flow cytometry analysis of neutrophil myeloperoxidase expression in peripheral&#xD;
      blood will be performed within 24 h of MDS diagnostic evaluation and blinded to the reference&#xD;
      standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference standard: The diagnosis of MDS will be established according to the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) classification, based on clinical data, peripheral blood cytopenia,&#xD;
      cytomorphology of peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate, and cytogenetic analysis. The&#xD;
      criteria for MDS diagnosis are 1) the presence of ≥10% dysplastic cells in any hematopoietic&#xD;
      lineage, 2) the exclusion of acute myeloid leukemia (defined by the presence of ≥20%&#xD;
      peripheral blood or bone marrow blasts), and 3) the exclusion of reactive etiologies of&#xD;
      dysplasia. Cytopenia is defined by hemoglobin concentration &lt;10 g/dL, platelet count&#xD;
      &lt;100x109/L, and/or absolute neutrophil count &lt;1.8 x109/L. Yet a diagnosis of MDS could be&#xD;
      made with milder levels of cytopenia. Idiopathic cytopenia of uncertain significance (ICUS)&#xD;
      is defined by unexplained mild persistent cytopenia for at least 6 months and the failure to&#xD;
      establish the diagnosis to MDS according to published guidelines. Consistent with WHO&#xD;
      classification, MDS subcategorization will rely on the degree of dysplasia (unilineage versus&#xD;
      multilineage), blast percentages, presence of ring sideroblasts, and cytogenetic analysis&#xD;
      (del(5q)). The criteria for CMML diagnosis are 1) the presence of persistent peripheral blood&#xD;
      monocytosis ≥1 x109/L, and 2) monocyte accounting for more than 10% of the white blood cell&#xD;
      differential count. Evaluation of bone marrow cytomorphology will be performed prospectively&#xD;
      by experienced hematopathologists who are blinded to the index test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with confirmed suspicion of MDS: Participants for whom the diagnosis of MDS (or&#xD;
      CMML) is confirmed by the reference standard will be categorized as patients with confirmed&#xD;
      suspicion of MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with unconfirmed suspicion of MDS: Participants for whom the diagnosis of MDS (or&#xD;
      CMML) is ruled out by the reference standard will be categorized as patients with unconfirmed&#xD;
      suspicion of MDS. This latter subgroup will include patients with ICUS, as defined in&#xD;
      accordance with published guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: No follow-up visit is planned in this cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study.&#xD;

    <description>Flow cytometry analysis of neutrophil myeloperoxidase expression in peripheral blood samples will be performed within 24 h of MDS diagnostic evaluation and blinded to the reference standard. Peripheral blood samples will be collected in 5 ml (EDTA) anticoagulant plastic tubes and processed within 24 h maximum of collection. The samples will be stored at 4°C overnight.&#xD;
Blood samples containing at least 105 neutrophils will be incubated with a panel of antibodies conjugated to fluorochromes, according to the manufacturers' recommendations.&#xD;
At least 10,000 cell events will be acquired on a 3-laser, 8-color flow cytometer and analyzed using Becton Dickinson (BD) Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) Diva Software version 6. Each marker will be expressed as median, geometric and arithmetic mean, regular and robust coefficient of variation.</description>
