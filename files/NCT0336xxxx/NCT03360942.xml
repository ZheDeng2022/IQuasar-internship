  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long term follow up of a pilot study in which the invesitagors proposed to test whether&#xD;
      high frequency stimulation of the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) is a safe and efficacious&#xD;
      antidepressant treatment in five TRD patients, to compare the effects of left-sided vs.&#xD;
      right-sided stimulation, and to investigate potential mechanisms of action of this&#xD;
      intervention. Importantly, this study will be used to assess the need for and assist in&#xD;
      planning a larger, more definitive trial of SCC DBS for TRD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The U.S. lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) is 17%. A number of&#xD;
      treatments are available for depression including medications, psychotherapy and various&#xD;
      somatic treatments. Unfortunately, up to two-thirds of patients remain symptomatic following&#xD;
      first-line treatment and a third fail to achieve remission (defined as full resolution of&#xD;
      depressive symptoms) after four established treatments; approximately 10%-20% of depressed&#xD;
      patients may show virtually no improvement despite multiple, often aggressive treatments.&#xD;
      Thus, a conservative estimate places the U.S. prevalence of treatment-resistant depression&#xD;
      (TRD) at 1%-3%. TRD has a high risk of suicide, is a major cause of disability and is&#xD;
      responsible for doubling of overall health care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with TRD there are limited evidence-based treatment options. Transcranial&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) may have efficacy for patients that have failed no more than one&#xD;
      antidepressant medication 10-12, but response and remission rates are relatively low (under&#xD;
      30% and 20% respectively). Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may have efficacy in patients that&#xD;
      have failed 4-6 antidepressant treatments but long-term response and remission rates are&#xD;
      again low (about 20% and 10% respectively). Electroconvulsive therapy(ECT) can be effective&#xD;
      in TRD patients with remission rates of 50%-60%. However, more than 70% of TRD patients will&#xD;
      relapse within 6 months following a successful acute treatment course. For patients that have&#xD;
      failed ECT, there are no evidence-based treatment options. Therefore, there is great need for&#xD;
      novel treatment approaches for TRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior clinical trials have shown that SCC DBS has the potential to be a valuable treatment&#xD;
      option for patients with TRD. Further developing this treatment will involve confirming its&#xD;
      effectiveness and identifying ways to optimize its use. In this study the investigators&#xD;
      intend to test the safety and efficacy of chronic SCC DBS as a treatment for TRD and compare&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of left-sided versus right-sided stimulation using a double-blind,&#xD;
      randomized, cross-over design.&#xD;

    <description>During this phase, patients will be evaluated every 12 months by the study psychiatrist (via in-person, phone or video call visit) to assess device functioning, adverse events and current status of depression. Collectively, this information will be used to evaluate each patient's current status. No formal instruments will be used to collect these data. This information will be documented in a note to file.</description>

        Patients who are enrolled in the DBS for TRD study at DHMC will be given the opportunity to&#xD;
        enroll in the ten year follow-up study at the end of the DBS for TRD study in which they&#xD;
        are currently enrolled. Patients will be informed of the option during the screening phase&#xD;
        of the DBS for TRD study as well as a reminder 2 weeks prior to completion of the study. A&#xD;
        total of five (5) patients will be enrolled in this study&#xD;
