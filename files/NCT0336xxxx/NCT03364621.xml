    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study investigating the disease course of patients with colorectal&#xD;
      cancer that have had their cancer spread to their liver. The aim of this study is find&#xD;
      potential biomarkers for disease recurrence and therapeutic targets for prognostic&#xD;
      information.&#xD;

      Colorectal cancer (CRC), the 2nd leading cause of cancer mortality, often has a pattern of&#xD;
      targeting the liver during initial metastases. The Comprehensive Genomic Profiling of&#xD;
      Colorectal Cancer Patients with Isolated Liver Metastases to Understand Response and&#xD;
      Resistance to Cancer Therapy (COMPARISON) study aims to assess the disease course of CRC by&#xD;
      collecting primary tumor and metastatic liver specimens following pre-operative chemotherapy.&#xD;
      If relapse occurs following surgical resection of the liver, biopsies will also be done for&#xD;
      molecular analysis. As a result, these samples can be analyzed for chemotherapy resistance&#xD;
      mechanisms and therapeutic targets to determine potential clinical outcomes for this&#xD;
      particular subset of CRC patients.&#xD;

        Eligibility Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have histologically confirmed CRC with isolated liver metastasis&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must be planned for a hepatic metastasectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have received at least 3 cycles of chemotherapy (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI with&#xD;
             or without Bevacizumab) prior to the planned hepatic metastasectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Primary tumor must be considered resectable with a plan for this to either occur&#xD;
             concurrently with the liver resection or subsequent to this.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If primary has already been resected before liver resection, archival tissue must be&#xD;
             available for genomic analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must be 18yrs of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Ability to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with un-resectable or borderline resectable isolated liver metastases as&#xD;
             judged by the multidisciplinary hepatobiliary tumor board at PM or BCCA after a course&#xD;
             of pre-operative chemotherapy will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with evidence of possible metastatic disease at any sites outside the liver&#xD;
             are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with any major co-morbidity or co-morbidities that will render liver&#xD;
             resection very high risk in investigator's opinion&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate the&#xD;
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance&#xD;
             with clinical study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with a previous history of another primary cancer treated within 5 years of&#xD;
             study entry are not eligible except those with basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
             of the skin and intraepithelial neoplasia.&#xD;
