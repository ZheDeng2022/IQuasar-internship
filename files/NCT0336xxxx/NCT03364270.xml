  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the ability of a new investigational agent&#xD;
      compound [F-18] labeled RGD-K5 to detect unstable atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid&#xD;
      artery of subjects being considered for carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and to confirm this&#xD;
      ability through tissue analysis of samples of carotid artery plaques that will be collected&#xD;
      during the planned carotid surgery. [F-18] RGD-K5 is a radioactive tracer used in imaging to&#xD;
      detect active growth of new blood vessels and presence of macrophages. Patients with unstable&#xD;
      plaque may be prone to rupture of the plaque due to increase in macrophage activity and&#xD;
      growth of new blood vessels. [F-18] RGD-K5 is an investigational agent, which means that it&#xD;
      has not yet been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unstable atherosclerotic plaque that is prone to rupture is characterized by an increase in&#xD;
      the number of macrophages and enhanced angiogenesis. Both neovascular endothelium and&#xD;
      macrophages exhibit increased Alpha-v beta3 integrin expression. PET (Positron Emission&#xD;
      Tomography) imaging of [F-18] RGD-K5 uptake may identify carotid plaque with increased&#xD;
      inflammation and neovascularization and may therefore detect unstable plaque in participants&#xD;
      with carotid artery stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to Dr. Tamarappoo's relocation to Cedars Sinai Medical Center (CSMC), 5 subjects were&#xD;
      enrolled at the Cleveland Clinic where PET-CT (Positron Emission Tomography - Computed&#xD;
      Tomography) was performed. 6 subjects will be scanned at Cedars using PET-MRI (Positron&#xD;
      emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging). Based on preliminary data with PET-CTA, the&#xD;
      investigator strongly believes the study will be able to reproducibly detect significant&#xD;
      [F-18] RGD-K5 uptake in plaque from symptomatic patients. Ultimately, demonstrating&#xD;
      preferential [F-18] RGD-K5 uptake in symptomatic patients will significantly impact the way&#xD;
      in which patients with carotid plaque (at risk for stroke) are treated and it may prevent&#xD;
      unnecessary surgical and endovascular procedures in this population&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this exploratory study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the uptake of [F-18] RGD-K5 by carotid plaque with PET/MRI imaging in&#xD;
           participants prior to carotid endarterectomy and thereby determine if carotid plaque&#xD;
           that causes significant stenosis [in participants being considered for carotid&#xD;
           endarterectomy (CEA)] is characterized by increased integrin expression and enhanced&#xD;
           angiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect safety data of [F-18] RGD-K5 in participants with carotid atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects will be identified and approached during an inpatient or outpatient&#xD;
      clinical visit by a member of the research team. Potential subjects will be identified by&#xD;
      their treating physicians and referred to the researchers. Patients' private and identifiable&#xD;
      information will not be shared prior to receiving permission from the patient to do so&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of research procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam and vital Signs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Height, weight, temperature, heart rate and blood pressure will be checked before beginning&#xD;
      the imaging tests. Subjects' heart rate and blood pressure will be checked again after each&#xD;
      of the two PET/MRI images, and as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also be asked about the presence of ICD, pacemaker or any metallic implants&#xD;
      that would not be compatible with the MRI magnet (presence of MRI non-compatible devices will&#xD;
      be an exclusion criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If labs have been done and the lab values meet the criteria to participate in this study, the&#xD;
      investigators will not need to collect these labs again on the day of testing. If these labs&#xD;
      have not been collected within 30 days prior to the research imaging tests, the investigators&#xD;
      will draw a tube of blood to check kidney function and other necessary blood values prior to&#xD;
      the research testing. Patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;40ml/min will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine Pregnancy test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will only need to be done in female subjects of childbearing potential. This will need&#xD;
      to be checked prior to scheduling subjects' research imaging tests. If subjects' tests are&#xD;
      schedules more than 2 days (48 hours) since first checked, this test will need to be&#xD;
      rechecked on the day of subjects' research imaging testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ECG (electrocardiogram) will be done to assess subjects' heart rhythm before the testing&#xD;
      begins, and after each of the PET scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV insertion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A catheter will be inserted into subjects' arm. It is through this IV catheter that the dose&#xD;
      of [F-18] RGD-K5 will be given prior to imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research PET/MRI Imaging of the Carotid Arteries:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 hours after receiving the dose of [F-18] RGD-K5 PET/MRI imaging of subjects' neck (carotid&#xD;
      arteries) will be performed. Subjects will be lying on subjects' back with a head fixation&#xD;
      device supporting subjects' head to prevent Subjects from moving subjects' head while the&#xD;
      images are taken. This scan will take about 30-45 minutes. Subjects will be permitted to get&#xD;
      up and move around between receiving the radiotracer and imaging. Subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      drink a glass of water before receiving the dose of [F-18] RGD-K5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histology and Immunohistochemistry:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Subjects carotid endarterectomy(CEA) which is a clinically indicated procedure,&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque will be removed. A sample of this plaque will be collected and taken&#xD;
      to the histology laboratory at Cedars Sinai for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow Up phone call:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be contacted by phone the day after subjects' PET scans to ask if Subjects have&#xD;
      had any medical problems and what medications Subjects have taken since the PET scan. If&#xD;
      Subjects were seen by a doctor to be evaluated for a medical problem, the investigators may&#xD;
      ask permission to contact the doctor or hospital to obtain copies of subjects' medical&#xD;
      records&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research poses greater than minimal risk&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no personal benefit to participants by participating in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The knowledge to be gained from this research may be beneficial for other patients, society&#xD;
      or science.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detection by the imaging protocol of unstable atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid&#xD;
      artery will not result in any change in their standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential benefit of the study to the patient is that it will allow the physician&#xD;
      treating the patient to know the entire extent of the carotid plaque, plaque composition and&#xD;
      will inform them of the anatomy of the carotid artery in question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, it will provide information about plaque in the contralateral carotid artery and&#xD;
      if that plaque has a high degree of inflammation. If a high inflammatory burden is noted in&#xD;
      the contralateral carotid artery, there will be more vigilance in monitoring these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of process by which confidentiality will be maintained:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research records will be stored in a locked cabinet in a secure location Electronic research&#xD;
      records will be stored in a shared network folder on the CSMC network. The list linking the&#xD;
      assigned code number to the individual subject will be maintained separately from the other&#xD;
      research data. Only certified research personnel who are listed on the approved Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board (IRB) application will be given access to identifiable subject information.&#xD;
      Research related data and patient/subject information will never be stored on a researcher's&#xD;
      personal (private) computer or laptop. Study data will be coded upon abstraction so that&#xD;
      Direct Identifiers** are maintained separately from the data set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of data and safety monitoring plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be monitored only by the study investigators and/or sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How does participation in the research differ from the receipt of standard care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISKS OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      As with any research study, there may be adverse events or side effects that are currently&#xD;
      unknown and it is possible that certain of these unknown risks could be permanent, serious or&#xD;
      life threatening. The study doctor will inform subjects of any significant new information&#xD;
      that is discovered during this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks of the Study Drug Based upon the toxicity profile to be administered as a single dose,&#xD;
      the purity and impurity profile of [F-18] RGD-K5, no risk of adverse events is anticipated&#xD;
      for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation Risk:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is very unlikely that participants will see any harmful effects because of the&#xD;
           radiation exposure participants will receive from taking part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At high levels of exposure, scientists agree that radiation can cause cancer. This&#xD;
           research study involves exposure to radiation from the RGDK5-PET scan. The total amount&#xD;
           of radiation exposure participants will receive is equivalent to a uniform whole-body&#xD;
           exposure of 0.8 rem. This is comparable to approximately three years' worth of radiation&#xD;
           exposure from typical environmental sources (about 0.3 rem per year, which includes&#xD;
           radon, natural background radiation, and cosmic rays). This is also comparable to 16% of&#xD;
           the maximum annual exposure for radiation workers (5 rem) allowed by the Nuclear&#xD;
           Regulatory Commission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI is not associated with any radiation risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI non-compatible devices such as pacemakers, ICD (implantable cardioverter defibrillator)&#xD;
      and metallic implants may cause artifacts in imaging and device malfunction as well as local&#xD;
      tissue injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrast used for MRI is associated with minimal risk among patients who are free of&#xD;
      significant renal dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When injected into the body, gadolinium contrast medium makes certain tissues, abnormalities&#xD;
      or disease processes more clearly visible on a magnetic resonance imaging scan. They are used&#xD;
      to improve the clarity of the scanned images or pictures of the body's internal structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gadolinium contrast medium is given by intravenous injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of gadolinium contrast is minimal in patients without severe renal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common adverse effects of gadolinium agents are&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Itching of the skin (5%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Headache (4%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nausea (4%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Very small risk of local pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypersensitivity (allergic reaction)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rarely (&lt;1% of the time) it can cause low blood pressure and lightheadedness. This can&#xD;
           be treated immediately with IV fluids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More serious allergic reactions that are life threatening are rare. Gadolinium is not safe&#xD;
      for people with late stage kidney disease or who have had a liver transplant.&#xD;
      Gadolinium-based contrast agents increase the risk for a rare, but serious adverse reaction,&#xD;
      called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) among patients with impaired elimination of the&#xD;
      drugs. Patients with kidney disease are at increased risk of developing NSF. NSF may cause&#xD;
      skin thickening, joint pain and/or swelling, causing feelings of burning, itching and pain&#xD;
      that can be severe. In very rare cases, NSF can lead to lung and heart problems and may be&#xD;
      life threatening. Participants will have a blood test to measure kidney function and if the&#xD;
      blood test is abnormal, they will not be permitted to receive gadolinium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a very small risk of mild headache and local pain. Rarely (&lt;1% of the time) it can&#xD;
      cause low blood pressure and lightheadedness. This can be treated immediately with IV fluids.&#xD;
      More serious allergic reactions that are life threatening are rare. Gadolinium is not safe&#xD;
      for people with late stage kidney disease or who have had a liver transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As with all research procedures and administration of study drugs, subjects will be monitored&#xD;
      at all times.&#xD;
