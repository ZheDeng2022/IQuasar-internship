      The purpose of this phase study is to confirm the efficacy and safety by compare ilaprazole&#xD;
      and omeprazole in the treatment and prevention of peptic ulcer bleeding. Patients with&#xD;
      endoscopically diagnosed peptic ulcer bleeding were enrolled in a multi-center, stratified&#xD;
      randomized, non-inferiority test, double-blind, parallel and positive-controlled trial. They&#xD;
      were randomly assigned into two groups, ilaprazole and omeprazole, to be treated for up to 30&#xD;
      days. The primary endpoint was the hemostasis rate at the end of 72 hours. Secondary end&#xD;
      points include ulcer staging changes within 72 hours, effective rate of hemostasis,&#xD;
      hemostasis duration, average blood transfusion and rebleeding rate, etc.&#xD;

      Patients with endoscopically diagnosed gastric and duodenal ulcer bleeding were randomly&#xD;
      assigned into two groups, ilaprazole and omeprazole. 360 patients were administrated 10 mg&#xD;
      ilaprazole daily (at day 1-3) through intravenous infusion within 30min with first dose&#xD;
      doubling. Other 180 patients were administrated 40 mg omeprazole twice daily (at day 1-3)&#xD;
      through intravenous infusion for 30min. Since 4th day, both group taken oral ilaprazole&#xD;
      tablets 10mg each day till 30th day; And the Patients who with helicobacter pylori infection&#xD;
      were provided amoxicillin and clarithromycin as complimentary therapy for two weeks. The&#xD;
      efficacy of ilaprazole and omeprazole was evaluated by the primary endpointthe-hemostasis&#xD;
      rate at the end of 72 hours in the total population, high-risk groups and low-risk groups and&#xD;
      secondary end points including ulcer staging changes within 72 hours, effective rate of&#xD;
      hemostasis, hemostasis duration, average blood transfusion, the need to switch to other&#xD;
      treatments (endoscopic treatment or surgery, etc.), the disappearance time of ulcer pain and&#xD;
      rebleeding rate. This phase Ⅲ clinical trial was designed to confirm the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of ilaprazole in the treatment of peptic ulcer bleeding and to pride a basis for&#xD;
      registration.&#xD;
