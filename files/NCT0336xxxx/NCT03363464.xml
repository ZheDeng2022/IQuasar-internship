  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Empagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, was launched as a&#xD;
      treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the U.S. in August 2014. In contrast with&#xD;
      several previous cardiovascular outcomes trials, which failed to demonstrate an association&#xD;
      with a higher or a lower risk of cardiovascular outcomes associated with members of other&#xD;
      recently marketed antidiabetic classes, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial has shown that patients at&#xD;
      high cardiovascular risk randomized to empagliflozin vs. placebo, were associated with a&#xD;
      reduced risk of hospitalization for heart failure, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause&#xD;
      mortality.However, these and other findings arising from an extensive clinical trial program&#xD;
      aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety profile for empagliflozin have yet to be&#xD;
      demonstrated in a non-trial environment. This study aims to investigate the transferability&#xD;
      of the effects demonstrated in dedicated randomized clinical studies to a broader population&#xD;
      under real world conditions.&#xD;
