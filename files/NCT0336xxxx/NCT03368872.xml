  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the effect of oral administration of an&#xD;
      Astaxanthin formulation compared to placebo after one month alone and after an additional 3&#xD;
      months of exercise training on mitochondrial and skeletal muscle function in elderly subjects&#xD;
      with evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction/sarcopenia.&#xD;

             the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hospitalization within 3 months for major atherosclerotic events (defined as combined&#xD;
             incidence of myocardial infarction, urgent target-vessel revascularization, coronary&#xD;
             bypass surgery and stroke) and for any hospitalization within 2 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Donated blood or blood products within the past 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who in the opinion of the Investigator have a clinically significant abnormal&#xD;
             12-lead ECG during the screening period. Presence of atrial fibrillation, varying&#xD;
             degrees of AV block, existence of a left bundle branch block, or evidence of previous&#xD;
             myocardial infarction.&#xD;

             throughout the confinement period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are currently enrolled in a clinical trial involving an investigational product or non&#xD;

             research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study Have&#xD;
             participated, within the last 30 days from a clinical trial involving an&#xD;
             investigational product. If the previous investigational product has a long half life,&#xD;
