  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute cellular and/or humoral rejection and early graft infections after pulmonary transplant&#xD;
      (&lt;2.5 years) are common and can lead to chronic dysfunction of the transplanted organ or&#xD;
      Chronic Lung Allograft Dysfunction, CLAD. These complications increase the number of&#xD;
      unplanned and life-threatening hospitalizations. Regular multi-weekly monitoring of&#xD;
      respiratory function is necessary to detect these complications early and to make their&#xD;
      management more effective and less costly. Monitoring by micro spirometers with forced&#xD;
      expirations at home proved difficult to perform (patient and effort dependent), often poorly&#xD;
      coordinated (transmission of data to practitioners) and not sensitive in the prediction of&#xD;
      post-transplant complications. Aqsitania has developed an innovative analysis of resting&#xD;
      respiratory signals. This innovative analysis is called &quot;Anharmonic Morphological Analysis of&#xD;
      Respiratory Signals (AMARS)&quot;. This automated analysis is based on a measurement of the&#xD;
      respiration collected by a spirometry device communicating and allowing a remote home&#xD;
      monitoring (Ventilotel®). We hypothesize that this Anharmonic Morphological Analysis of&#xD;
      Respiratory Signals at rest could predict unplanned hospitalizations and allow for more&#xD;
      reliable monitoring of pulmonary transplant patients. Inclusion visit: Explanation of the&#xD;
      study and collection of consent, measurement of resting breath and explanation on the mode of&#xD;
      use of the measuring device at home, clinical examination, respiratory functional&#xD;
      exploration. Follow-up at home for 12 months with a resting breath measurement for 2 to 3&#xD;
      min, in the morning on waking and in the evening before bed, 2 days / week with automatic&#xD;
      sending of data on the Aqsitania server. The first month, a visit at home can be made if the&#xD;
      subject feels the need. At each measurement, Aqsitania transmits the data in the e-CRF, a&#xD;
      report that gives the anonymised values of the markers and the current personal respiratory&#xD;
      profile. In order to avoid &quot;motivational&quot; bias, patients will have instructions to use the&#xD;
      device but no &quot;coaching&quot; call will be made during the study. Patients will have their monthly&#xD;
      or quarterly follow-up visits, including clinical examination, respiratory functional&#xD;
      exploration and an analysis of adverse events. No additional search-specific visits will be&#xD;
      carried out.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acute cellular and/or humoral rejection and early graft infections after pulmonary transplant&#xD;
      (&lt;2.5 years) are common and can lead to chronic dysfunction of the transplanted organ or&#xD;
      Chronic Lung Allograft Dysfunction, CLAD. These complications increase the number of&#xD;
      unplanned and life-threatening hospitalizations. Regular multi-weekly monitoring of&#xD;
      respiratory function is necessary to detect these complications early and to make their&#xD;
      management more effective and less costly. Monitoring by micro spirometers with forced&#xD;
      expirations at home proved difficult to perform (patient and effort dependent), often poorly&#xD;
      coordinated (transmission of data to practitioners) and not sensitive in the prediction of&#xD;
      post-transplant complications. Aqsitania has developed an innovative analysis of respiratory&#xD;
      signals at rest. This innovative analysis is called &quot;Anharmonic Morphological Analysis of&#xD;
      Respiratory Signals (AMARS)&quot;. This automated analysis is based on a measurement of the&#xD;
      respiration collected by a spirometry device communicating and allowing a remote home&#xD;
      monitoring (Ventilotel®). We hypothesize that this Anharmonic Morphological Analysis of&#xD;
      Respiratory Signals at rest could predict unplanned hospitalizations and allow for more&#xD;
      reliable monitoring of pulmonary transplant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual benefit (s): From an individual point of view, this is a descriptive study with no&#xD;
      direct benefit expected for the patients participating in the research. Nevertheless, if the&#xD;
      hypothesis is confirmed, the benefits for the transplant patients will be considerable&#xD;
      because a prediction of the occurrence of post-transplant complications at a much earlier&#xD;
      stage, probably infra-clinical, would allow a more efficient management thus a better&#xD;
      prognosis for these patients grafted. This is added the advantage of the telecommunication&#xD;
      system which will allow a reliable and automated transmission of the parameters evaluated at&#xD;
      home, which can improve the coordination of the care and the reactivation of the caregivers.&#xD;
      Lastly, it is possible to emphasize the medical and psychological safety of the patient by&#xD;
      the use of this device, which is an important element for this type of risky situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collective Benefit (s): Provided that subsequent randomized studies confirm this, it is&#xD;
      likely that monitoring of respiratory function by this innovative connected device will&#xD;
      significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality of post-transplant follow-up. Collective&#xD;
      benefits are also economic. Significant savings in the use of care and hospitalizations&#xD;
      avoided or reduced in anticipation of the risk of serious complications following pulmonary&#xD;
      transplantation can be expected from this new mode of surveillance. The challenge would be to&#xD;
      significantly increase the cost effectiveness of this costly therapeutic in 2015 to&#xD;
      eventually have a QALY &lt;100 000 €.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected benefits: If the analysis of respiration at home allows prediction of complications&#xD;
      after a pulmonary transplant, it will then be necessary to demonstrate that an early&#xD;
      management strategy, probably subclinical and based on this analysis, Avoid post-transplant&#xD;
      complications, reduce morbidity and mortality and care for pulmonary transplant patients. The&#xD;
      results for this research are therefore considerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical device used in research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device used for home monitoring of respiratory function of pulmonary transplant patients&#xD;
      will be Ventilotel®, developed by Aqsitania and manufactured by Thor Medical Systems, an&#xD;
      internationally recognized manufacturer of this type of equipment. This device is marked CE&#xD;
      and class IIa. Ventilotel® is a communicating device for measuring the respiratory function&#xD;
      of a patient in calm ventilation. The measure consists in breathing a patient by the mouth,&#xD;
      for about 3 minutes in a ventilometer, the nose blocked by a nose clip. The measure taken is&#xD;
      transmitted, anonymised, by the GSM 3G network to Aqsitania's digital analysis platform for&#xD;
      the signal processing and the calculation of the associated markers. Then the platform sends&#xD;
      the data directly into the e-CRF. The Ventilotel® is composed of 3 main parts: 1. a USB&#xD;
      ultrasonic ventilometer or pneumotachograph, intended for the measurement itself (2 hull&#xD;
      variants: reinforced with silicone, or light). The white plastic tube through it is the place&#xD;
      where the patient will breathe, protected by an antiviral / antibacterial filter to change&#xD;
      every month. 2. a computer case for controlling the ventilometer and for transmitting the&#xD;
      acquired information to the remote signal analysis platform. 3. a USB barcode reader,&#xD;
      designed to read the barcode of the patient's paper file, to perform a measurement for which&#xD;
      it is desired to request a calculation of the Aqsitania bio-markers. It comes with a USB port&#xD;
      reducer for use with the computer case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the month preceding a scheduled hospitalization for assessment, the investigating&#xD;
      physician validates the first eligibility criteria based on the patient's medical record. In&#xD;
      case of eligibility, the CRA calls the patient to inform him / her of the possible&#xD;
      participation in the protocol and gives an initial information on the protocol. He sends him&#xD;
      the information note by post with a delay of at least a week between the receipt of the mail&#xD;
      and the planned hospitalization. During the hospitalization scheduled for assessment, the&#xD;
      investigating physician re-informs the patient and answers all his questions concerning the&#xD;
      objective, the nature of the constraints, the foreseeable risks and the expected benefits of&#xD;
      the research. It also specifies the rights of the subject in the context of biomedical&#xD;
      research. The investigating physician is responsible for obtaining the informed informed&#xD;
      consent of the subject. The consent form must be signed prior to any clinical or paraclinical&#xD;
      examination required by the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtaining consent: If the participant gives his / her participation agreement, the&#xD;
      participant and the investigator enter their first and last names in clear, date and sign the&#xD;
      consent form in two original copies. The different copies of the information memorandum and&#xD;
      the consent form are then distributed as follows: a copy of the information memorandum and&#xD;
      the signed consent is given to the subject, the other copy is retained by the investigating&#xD;
      physician in a place Inaccessible to third parties. At the end of the inclusions or at the&#xD;
      latest at the end of the search, a copy of each consent form shall be forwarded to the&#xD;
      proponent or its representative according to procedures communicated to investigators in a&#xD;
      timely manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct of the visit: The inclusion visit, provided by the investigating physician, includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examination: weight, height, temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate,&#xD;
           respiratory rate, pulmonary auscultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spirometry with Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), Forced Vital Capacity&#xD;
           (FVC), Forced Expiratory Flow between 25 and 75% of FVC (FEF 25-75), Functional Residual&#xD;
           Capacity (FRC), the Total Lung Capacity (TLC), the Residual Volume (VR) and the&#xD;
           Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A measure of peak expiratory flow (PEF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A demonstration of the use of the instrument for measuring spontaneous breathing&#xD;
           parameters (Ventilotel®, Aqsitania) as well as its putting into operation: at the&#xD;
           inclusion visit, the casing is connected momentarily to the barcode reader, The patient&#xD;
           code is read and stored in the case which will emit measurements with this code,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A measurement of breathing at rest with Ventilotel® and delivery of the device to the&#xD;
           patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will be done at the usual rythm defined for each patient according to the&#xD;
      age of his or her transplant or his / her status (usually: monthly visits the first&#xD;
      post-transplant year, quarterly the second year). These visits will be in accordance with the&#xD;
      usual follow-up except for an additional measure carried out with the Ventilotel®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures at home:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the patient's home, the patient will be asked to measure breathing at rest with&#xD;
      Ventilotel® in the morning and evening, twice a week and for 1 year. During the first month,&#xD;
      a visit to the patient's home can be made if the patient feels the need to assist in the&#xD;
      handling of Ventilotel®. The measure consists of breathing through the mouth, for about 3&#xD;
      minutes in the ventilometer, the nose blocked by a nose clip. Then the data is transmitted to&#xD;
      the Aqsitania servers, which will send the data directly to the e-CRF. If the GSM signal is&#xD;
      temporarily lost during the measurement, the Ventilotel® can store the respiratory data and&#xD;
      send it to Aqsitania later when the GSM signal is returned. During a week without data&#xD;
      transmission, the CRA referent of the site from which the patient is born will call Aqsitania&#xD;
      in order to know if the box is connected to the network. In this case, the absence of data&#xD;
      will result from a non-observance of the patient at Ventilotel® and nothing will be done in&#xD;
      addition. If, on the contrary, the Ventilotel® appears to be disconnected from the Aqsitania&#xD;
      servers, a call will be sent to the patient in order to know if he has disconnected the&#xD;
      device because it no longer uses it or if it has broken down . If it is unplugged, nothing&#xD;
      will be done. If it fails (device plugged in but does not start or does not transmit data&#xD;
      despite good network quality), a home visit will be made by the CRA to simply replace the&#xD;
      defective hardware (without motivate the patient to use the device). The patient continues to&#xD;
      use the Spirotel provided after the transplant as recommended by the transplant team. The&#xD;
      Spirotel is a mini-spirometer for measuring Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Forced Expiratory&#xD;
      Volume in 1 second (FEV1) and FEV1/FVC (forced maneuvers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      End search visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end-of-study visit at 12 months will correspond to the closest visit of 12 months&#xD;
      programmed in the usual follow-up of the patient. It will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examination: weight, height, temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate,&#xD;
           respiratory rate, pulmonary auscultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spirometry with Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), Forced Vital Capacity&#xD;
           (FVC), Forced Expiratory Flow between 25 and 75% of FVC (FEF 25-75), Functional Residual&#xD;
           Capacity (FRC), the Total Lung Capacity (TLC), the Residual Volume (VR) and the&#xD;
           Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A measure of Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A measure of resting breathing with Ventilotel® and delivery of the device to the CRA&#xD;
           referent of the study on the site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compendium of unplanned hospitalizations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any hospitalization additional to the schedule of hospitalizations scheduled for follow-up&#xD;
      will be considered as an unplanned hospitalization. All causes of unplanned hospitalization&#xD;
      will be retained. The causes of unscheduled hospitalizations will be reported in the&#xD;
      hospitalization reports. Consultations (programmed or not) will not be included in the&#xD;
      primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMARS Settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 8 &quot;morphological&quot; Aqsitania markers characterizing breathing at rest are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 parameters measured at &quot;inspiratory&quot; times&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A1 Amplitude of the inspiratory front&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B1 Asymmetry of the inspiratory front&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  R1 Anharmonicity of the inspiratory front&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T1 Position of the inspiratory front 4 parameters measured at expiratory times&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A2 Amplitude of the expiratory front&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B2 Asymmetry of the expiratory front&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  R2 Anharmonicity of the expiratory front&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T2 Position of the expiratory front&#xD;
&#xD;
      These 8 parameters are evaluated on each of the breathing cycles at rest of a set of 30 to 50&#xD;
      consecutive respiratory cycles measured from 2 to 3 minutes on a day in the morning and&#xD;
      evening. The mean value and the standard deviation of each morphological parameter are&#xD;
      evaluated on this set of cycles. The reference values of these 8 parameters are determined&#xD;
      for each patient during the inclusion visit. The results of each measure at home are&#xD;
      expressed in absolute values and in percentage of variation compared to the reference values.&#xD;
      These 8 parameters are analyzed alone or combined at different times before each event. In&#xD;
      addition to the 8 specific parameters, the tidal volume and respiratory rate are also&#xD;
      measured as well as the stability of the Personal Respiratory Profile. The AMARS parameters&#xD;
      and the unplanned hospitalizations will be coded independently in the e-CRF: the AMARS&#xD;
      parameters will be automatically transferred to the e-CRF; Hospitalizations coded by a&#xD;
      clinical research associate. The statistical analysis will be carried out after the database&#xD;
      has been frozen and the statistician who analyzes the data will not have participated in the&#xD;
      coding of the events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Graphical analysis of the evolution of the parameters of breath at rest according to the&#xD;
           occurrence of unplanned hospitalizations:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  per patient,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  overall.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This graphical analysis will be performed for each of the 8 parameters of normal&#xD;
           breathing as well as for some parameter associations. This step will identify which&#xD;
           parameters or associations of parameters fluctuate according to the occurrence of&#xD;
           unplanned hospitalizations (predictive power), as well as the time in days between the&#xD;
           fluctuation of the parameter and the hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ROC curve analysis: These ROC curves will be performed only for parameters or parameters&#xD;
           associations that have shown a predictive power in step 1. The ROC curves will determine&#xD;
           the threshold of discrimination of the parameters or combination of parameters which&#xD;
           provides the best sensitivity and the best specificity for the prediction of&#xD;
           hospitalizations. The PPV and NPV will also be determined. Internal validation using a&#xD;
           bootstrap technique will be carried out. This internal validation will make it possible&#xD;
           to evaluate the optimism bias. A calibration will be performed by a Hosmer-Lemeshow&#xD;
           analysis or another suitable model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Analysis of ANOVA variance and Bonferroni test: This step will be performed only for&#xD;
           parameters or associations of parameters that have shown a predictive power in step 1.&#xD;
           ANOVA will identify factors influencing parameters or associations of parameters such as&#xD;
           the severity of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome or restrictive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Calculation of the correlation coefficients (Pearson or Spearman coefficient, depending&#xD;
           on whether the variables follow a normal distribution) between the parameters of&#xD;
           classical spirometry and those of respiration at rest.&#xD;
