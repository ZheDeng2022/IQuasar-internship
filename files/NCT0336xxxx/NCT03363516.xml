      Insulin resistance (IR), beyond its well-defined role in the appearance and progression of&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (DM), is the recognized pathogenetic factor underlying vascular aging.&#xD;
      Recently, the existence of a &quot;cerebral&quot; IR, responsible of the appearance and progression of&#xD;
      many forms of dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), has been hypothesized. On the&#xD;
      other hand, it is well known that DM acts as a cardiovascular (CV) risk factor per se. In the&#xD;
      last years it has been demonstrated that also glucose normotolerant subjects who exhibit&#xD;
      plasma glucose levels &gt;155 mg/dL 1h-post load, have a CV risk similar to that of diabetic&#xD;
      patients. Thus, these category of subjects is characterized by IR and, being MCI the&#xD;
      expression of IR in the brain, the principal hypothesis of our study is that these subjects&#xD;
      may also develop neuropsychological alterations, earlier with respect of the general&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance (IR), beyond its well-defined role in the appearance and progression of&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (DM), is the recognized pathogenetic factor underlying vascular aging, in&#xD;
      the continuum from endothelial dysfunction to atherosclerotic vascular lesions. Two different&#xD;
      types of IR have been described: 1) a &quot;central&quot; IR, particularly expressed in the liver,&#xD;
      affecting all the metabolic pathways operating at this site, and 2) a &quot;peripheral&quot; IR,&#xD;
      particularly expressed in the muscle. Recently, the existence of a &quot;cerebral&quot; IR, responsible&#xD;
      of the appearance and progression of many forms of dementia and mild cognitive impairment&#xD;
      (MCI), has been hypothesized. On the other hand, for decades DM was considered only as a&#xD;
      hyperglycemic status, disregarding its important negative impact on vascular function and its&#xD;
      role as a cardiovascular (CV) risk factor per se. For these reasons, in the past, DM&#xD;
      management only consisted in reducing plasma glucose levels. In the last years our group&#xD;
      demonstrated that also glucose normotolerant subjects who exhibit plasma glucose levels &gt;155&#xD;
      mg/dL 1h-post load, have a CV risk similar to that of diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and Significance The hypothesis of this study is based on the concept that glucose&#xD;
      normotolerant subjects with 1h-post load glycemia &gt;155 mg/dL exhibit an insulin-resistant&#xD;
      status characterized by enhanced insulin production but reduced tissues sensitivity to the&#xD;
      hormone action. This reduced insulin sensitivity is present many years before the appearance&#xD;
      of the clinical conditions such as DM, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, etc. Insulin,&#xD;
      insulin receptor, and its substrates are expressed in the whole central nervous system; in&#xD;
      this site, insulin regulates food intake and body weight, and it is also involved in&#xD;
      neurotransmitters release and synaptic plasticity. It is thus plausible that insulin may have&#xD;
      an important role in many cognitive processes. Evidences indicate that the cognitive&#xD;
      impairment commonly seen in many diabetic patients could be mediated by an altered signaling&#xD;
      insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1)-insulin. In fact, a stream of human and experimental&#xD;
      studies has provided convincing evidence that many forms of dementia, such as Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease, are metabolic diseases characterized by the brain loss of its capacity to&#xD;
      efficiently utilize glucose for energy production and respond to critical trophic factor&#xD;
      signals due to insulin as well as insulin-like growth factor (IGF) resistance. Thus, being&#xD;
      MCI the expression of IR in the brain, the principal hypothesis of our study is that these&#xD;
      subjects may also develop neuropsychological alterations, earlier with respect of the general&#xD;
      population. This hypothesis may have an important clinical significance and a great social&#xD;
      impact, since a great amount of health costs are due chronic diseases, included all forms of&#xD;
      dementia. Furthermore, the results of this study will add important information about the&#xD;
      understanding of the complex network of pathways operating in the appearance and progression&#xD;
      of many of the chronic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus and dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study To investigate the presence of early neuropsychological and/or cerebral&#xD;
      morphological alterations in two groups of subjects (Group 1: glucose normotolerant subjects&#xD;
      with 1h-post load glycemia &gt;155 mg/dL; Group 2: healthy subjects with 1h post-load glycemia &lt;&#xD;
      155 mg/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: evaluation of inclusion/exclusion criteria, MMSE, clinical visit, all laboratory&#xD;
      determinations, OGTT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: neuropsychological assessment (refers to the measurement of cognitive functions and&#xD;
      processes with the aim to establish whether a cognitive impairment is present in individuals.&#xD;
      It is preferably performed by clinical neuropsychologists who have expertise in the study of&#xD;
      the neural correlates of behavior and cognition. The cognitive processes to be investigated&#xD;
      in the present study include functions such as memory, language, praxia, attention, executive&#xD;
      functions and intelligence. The following tests will be used: MMSE, RAVLT, FCSRT, COWAT, FAB,&#xD;
      TMT and Stroop Test, Weigl Test, BDI II, HAMA&#xD;
&#xD;
      3Tesla (T) brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Subjects will be examined using a 3 Tesla&#xD;
      MR750 GE MRI scanner with an eight-channel head coil. All participants will undergo the same&#xD;
      MRI protocol, including: whole-brain 3D T1-weighted spoiled gradient recalled (SPGR) (BRAVO,&#xD;
      voxel size of 1 × 1 × 1 mm3), DTI (voxel size 2 × 2 × 2 mm3, 27 directions with gradients at&#xD;
      a b-value of 1,000 s/mm2 and 4 b = 0 images) and conventional 2D T2-weighted,T2 (FLAIR) and&#xD;
      T2 gradient echo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodologies and statistical analyses The investigators planned to conduct an observational&#xD;
      perspective longitudinal study. The planned number of patients is 15 for each group. In&#xD;
      particular, will be enrolled 15 glucose normotolerant subjects with 1h post-load glycemia&#xD;
      &gt;155 mg/dL (Group 1), and 15 healthy subjects with 1h post-load glycemia &lt;155 mg/dL (Group&#xD;
      2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo the following study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insulinemic curve&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological tests administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3T brain MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected in a case report form (CRF) mantained at the University Magna Graecia&#xD;
      of Catanzaro. Data collected will be analyzed through descriptive statistic methodologies,&#xD;
      t-test, ANOVA, linear and multiple regression, when appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes On the basis of previously published literature and of pathophysiologic&#xD;
      hypothesis, the expected outcomes of this project are the early recognition of&#xD;
      neuropsychological and/or neuroimaging alterations suggestive of mild cognitive impairment in&#xD;
      insulin-resistant subjects without clinical evidence of metabolic diseases typical of the&#xD;
      insulin-resistant status (diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, metabolic syndrome,&#xD;
      etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance and Innovation The results of this study could represent an important milestone&#xD;
      in the comprehension of the complex pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the appearance&#xD;
      of cognitive disorders in subjects with apparently different risk factors. If this hypothesis&#xD;
      -that IR is the trait d'union between metabolic and cerebral alterations- will be confirmed,&#xD;
      a new important link (i.e.: the relationship between IR/glucose metabolism and cerebral&#xD;
      functions) could be further explored in future studies in order to plan&#xD;
      preventive/therapeutic strategies for subjects with any type of insulin resistance, before&#xD;
      the appearance of the clinical manifestations of IR in any of the target organs. The major&#xD;
      innovation of this study is represented by the fact that IR could be considered not only as a&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk factor, but also as a cerebral one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translational relevance This study has an important scientific relevance since it is, to the&#xD;
      investigators' knowledge, the first one merging both neuropsychological and metabolic aspects&#xD;
      in a pre-clinical status. Thus, if the hypothesis of the study will be confirmed, the&#xD;
      management of patients with IR could also include neuropsychological and neuroimaging&#xD;
      assessments in order to early detect cognitive impairment.&#xD;
