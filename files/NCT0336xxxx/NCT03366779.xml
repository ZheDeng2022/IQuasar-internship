  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multi-center study to monitor the early safety and performance&#xD;
      of one iteration of the Barricaid Anular Closure Device (ACD) - 6mm anchor width, when used&#xD;
      as an adjunct to limited discectomy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is planned to collect information on use of the Barricaid ACD with an anchor width&#xD;
      of 6mm. Other iterations of the device are made with an 8mm wide anchor. The narrower anchor&#xD;
      was designed to optimize surgeon visualization during implantation, and has undergone all&#xD;
      appropriate rigorous testing prior to release. Safety will be evaluated to demonstrate&#xD;
      acceptable levels of device-related and procedure-related complications. This limited market&#xD;
      release will allow its performance to be evaluated by examining the effects on reoperation,&#xD;
      device deficiencies, patient pain scores and disability after discectomy with ACD.&#xD;
