  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas, myomas, fibroids) are benign tumors of the uterus that can&#xD;
      cause heavy menstrual bleeding, pain, and/or infertility. Fibroids can be managed with&#xD;
      medication, surgery, or interventional radiology. While conservative methods that avoid&#xD;
      surgical risks and complications are becoming more common, there are limitations to medical&#xD;
      therapies including side effects, short durations of use, and incomplete response to&#xD;
      treatment. To optimize patient outcomes, it is imperative clinicians and researchers better&#xD;
      understand which patients may benefit from medical therapies and which may not. Fibroids with&#xD;
      less blood supply can degenerate and take on a variety of histological characteristics (e.g.&#xD;
      cystic, red, fatty, calcific) which may decrease response to medical management. These&#xD;
      histological characteristics in degenerated fibroids correspond to altered mechanical&#xD;
      properties, ranging from very soft to very hard. There is currently no guidance on how to&#xD;
      predict medical responsiveness based on such fibroid characteristics. As a result, physicians&#xD;
      treat patients empirically with medications, without the ability to counsel on effectiveness&#xD;
      or failure rates. Our research goal is to understand if and how uterine fibroid tissue&#xD;
      stiffness can predict response to medical therapies. To achieve this, the investigators will&#xD;
      use a new ultrasound technology, called shear wave elastography (SWE), that non-invasively&#xD;
      measures tissue stiffness and is currently used in practice for staging of chronic liver&#xD;
      diseases; however, given that this technology is very new, evidence of its clinical&#xD;
      application in gynecology is limited. Through implementing an innovative and&#xD;
      multidisciplinary approach, the investigators will (1) systematically establish SWE as a&#xD;
      feasible and reliable tool for measuring non-neoplastic myometrial and uterine fibroid tissue&#xD;
      stiffness, and (2) use SWE to classify and monitor fibroid tissue properties in&#xD;
      pre-menopausal women undergoing medical intervention for symptomatic uterine fibroids.&#xD;
      Understanding the connection between pathological tissue properties and the success of&#xD;
      medical therapies is essential to streamline assessment and intervention planning and improve&#xD;
      overall patient outcomes for the many Canadian women who suffer from uterine fibroids.&#xD;

      Aims and Objectives The goal of this project is to understand if and how uterine fibroid&#xD;
      tissue stiffness, measured by SWE, can be used to predict and monitor response to medical&#xD;
      therapy in patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To assess the feasibility of using SWE for measuring stiffness of non-neoplastic&#xD;
      myometrium and uterine fibroid tissue in pre-menopausal women Objective 1.1: Assess the&#xD;
      inter- and intra-session reliability of measuring uterine tissue stiffness with SWE in 60&#xD;
      women with uterine fibroids and 60 healthy matched control participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1.2: Using data acquired from the 60 women with uterine fibroids, the validity of&#xD;
      SWE will be assessed by comparing in vivo uterine tissue stiffness measured by SWE to the&#xD;
      stiffness of surgically excised uterine tissue samples measured ex vivo by a mechanical&#xD;
      tester.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1.3: To assess the confounding effect of age, parity, contraceptive use, and&#xD;
      presence of fibroids on myometrial stiffness measured by SWE in 60 women with uterine&#xD;
      fibroids and 60 healthy matched control participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To assess the clinical applicability of using tissue stiffness measured by SWE for the&#xD;
      classification and monitoring of uterine fibroids in pre-menopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2.1: Determine if SWE is sensitive enough to identify differences in tissue&#xD;
      stiffness between non-degenerative and degenerative fibroids, as validated by histology from&#xD;
      surgically excised tissue samples of 60 women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2.2: Determine if SWE is sensitive enough to identify differences in fibroid tissue&#xD;
      stiffness in 60 women with uterine fibroids before and after two 3-month courses of SPRM&#xD;
      therapy and evaluate if medical responsiveness (i.e. symptom relief) is related to baseline&#xD;
      SWE measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This will be a prospective case-control study that will used a mixed model&#xD;
      (within and between subject) study design (Figure 1). Women with uterine fibroids and healthy&#xD;
      matched control participants will be recruited and attend two or three US imaging sessions&#xD;
      (depending on group assignment). Participants with fibroids will have both their myometrium&#xD;
      and fibroid stiffness measured using SWE. Healthy matched controls will have their myometrium&#xD;
      measured only. Participants with fibroids receiving surgical intervention will undergo a&#xD;
      hysterectomy or myomectomy and tissue samples will be harvested and tested in a jig that&#xD;
      measures stiffness under mechanical tension. Participants with fibroids seeking medical&#xD;
      management will have an US imaging session before and after two 3-month courses of ulipristal&#xD;
      acetate (UPA; an SPRM prescribed in Canada20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Three groups of 60 premenopausal women over the age of 18 will be recruited:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients seeking surgical management for uterine fibroids (FIB-Sx) will be recruited&#xD;
           from a list of patients consented for surgery (hysterectomy or myomectomy with primary&#xD;
           indication of fibroids) by a member of The Ottawa Hospital Minimally Invasive Gynecology&#xD;
           Group (led by Nominated Principal Applicant, S. Singh). FIB-Sx will be excluded if they&#xD;
           have &gt;5 fibroids identified on US or suspicion of leiomyosarcoma based on clinical,&#xD;
           surgical, or gross pathological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients seeking medical management for uterine fibroids (FIB-Mx) will be screened from&#xD;
           a list of referrals to the Shirley E. Greenberg Women's Health Center (SEGWHC) at The&#xD;
           Ottawa Hospital and recruited at the time of consult if they have been prescribed a&#xD;
           course of UPA by their attending physician. FIB-Mx will be excluded if they have &gt;5&#xD;
           fibroids identified on US or previous course of SPRM/GnRH analogues within 3 months of&#xD;
           recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Healthy control participants (CON) (matched to FIB in age, parity, and BMI) will be&#xD;
           recruited from the Ottawa community through advertisement posters, word of mouth, and&#xD;
           social media. CON will be excluded is they have a history of uterine pathology (e.g.&#xD;
           adenomyosis, hyperplasia, endometriosis), have irregular menstrual cycles, are currently&#xD;
           pregnant or have been pregnant within the last six months prior to recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial assessment: Consented women in the control (CON) and surgical (FIB-Sx) streams will&#xD;
      attend two evaluations. Consented women in the medical stream (FIB-Mx) will attend one visit&#xD;
      at their earliest convenience after recruitment, another at three months after treatment&#xD;
      initiation, and third visit at 6 months after treatment initiaition. At each visit, women&#xD;
      will undergo shear wave elastography (SWE) and 3D US (Supersonic UltrafastTM Aixplorer®,&#xD;
      Apexium Medical, Canada) assessments of their uterus as a whole, at 10 healthy sites and at&#xD;
      up to 5 fibroid sites. SWE and volumes will be recorded in series of 10 frame clips.&#xD;
      Morphologic measurements of the uterus and selected fibroids will be made and fibroids will&#xD;
      be given identification numbers based on a 3D size and location map. SWE will be used to take&#xD;
      relevant measures of tissue stiffness at all sites of interest. Three repetitions of each&#xD;
      measurement will be performed. Women in the CON and FIB-Sx streams will receive a second&#xD;
      identical imaging session during their first visit and a single imaging session during the&#xD;
      second visit. Participants in the FIB-Mx stream will receive a single imaging session at each&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Intervention: the surgical approach (abdominal vs laparoscopic) will be recorded as&#xD;
      well as secondary outcomes including operating time, blood loss, surgical technique&#xD;
      conversions, failed/incomplete excisions, and additional procedures performed. These data&#xD;
      will be used for descriptive purposes and contribute to the development of a database for our&#xD;
      long-term research goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue Sampling: For participants in the FIB-Sx stream, the surgical approach (myomectomy or&#xD;
      hysterectomy + abdominal or laparoscopic), course of resection and secondary outcomes&#xD;
      including operating time, blood loss, surgical technique, failed/incomplete excisions, intra-&#xD;
      or post-operative complication and additional procedures will be recorded for descriptive&#xD;
      purposes. Morcellated tissue specimens will be excluded. All surgically excised tissue will&#xD;
      be sent to pathology for gross inspection and processing following standard procedures. For&#xD;
      hysterectomy cases, a pathology assistant (trained and under the supervision of collaborator&#xD;
      S. Strickland) will excise five 1cm3 samples of non-neoplastic tissue from myometrial&#xD;
      sites-of interest and 1cm3 sections from each fibroid of interest. For myomectomy cases, 1cm3&#xD;
      sections from each fibroid of interest will similarly be excised. In surgical cases with &gt;3&#xD;
      fibroids excised, the participating surgeon will include the study specific fibroid&#xD;
      identification number given at the US imaging session in the pathology requisition. A member&#xD;
      of the research team will meet the pathology assistant at the time of dissection to ensure&#xD;
      each sample is placed in individual bottles with isotonic saline and labelled with its unique&#xD;
      study identification number. Samples will be transported to M. Labrosse's (collaborator)&#xD;
      laboratory at the Ottawa Heart Institute for mechanical testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Intervention: Medical treatment will be recorded as well as secondary outcomes&#xD;
      relating to patient symptoms and quality of life.These data will be used for descriptive&#xD;
      purposes and contribute to the development of a database for our long-term research goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical Testing: All samples will be stored in saline and tested within 24 hours of&#xD;
      excision. Samples will be further dissected into 2x10mm slices and loaded into a mechanical&#xD;
      jig (Biotester, CellScale, Waterloo, Canada) at collaborator M. Labrosse's laboratory and&#xD;
      tested at 37°C, cyclically in tension (1Hz, 2-3% strain) following procedures developed in&#xD;
      the literature for mechanical testing on uterine tissue. The modulus of elasticity (E, kPa),&#xD;
      analogous to stiffness, and stiffness contrast ratio (E_fibroid/E_myometrium ) will be&#xD;
      calculated three times for each sample and averaged. The mechanical testing protocol will&#xD;
      take approximately 2 hours to complete. Mechanical loading will be under displacement control&#xD;
      (2-3% strain) to eliminate the risk damaging tissues, allowing for repeated measurements and&#xD;
      histological analysis. All samples will be placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin&#xD;
      immediately after testing and returned to pathology for definitive diagnosis. Pathology&#xD;
      reports and slides will be retrospectively reviewed to extract descriptive fibroid&#xD;
      characteristics. Members of the research team acquiring subsequent SWE measurements,&#xD;
      mechanical stiffness measurements, and reviewing pathology reports will be blinded to results&#xD;
      of initial SWE measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses:All data will be tested for normality and equivalent non-parametric&#xD;
      tests to those described below will be used as appropriate. All tests will be performed using&#xD;
      SPSS statistical software (v25, IMB Corp., Armonk, USA) and significance will be accepted as&#xD;
      p&lt;0.05. Appropriate post-hoc comparisons will be performed. Dependent variables of SWE peak&#xD;
      and mean stiffness are assumed to be interrelated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1.1: Two-way (3x2) multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) will test for&#xD;
      significant differences in mean and peak stiffness (kPa) as they relate to the independent&#xD;
      variable of test time (repetition and session) for each measurement site. One-way analyses of&#xD;
      variance (ANOVAs) and dependent t-tests will be used for post-hoc Bonferroni corrected&#xD;
      evaluation of significant main effects. Dependent t-tests will determine if measurement plane&#xD;
      significantly affects SWE stiffness measures. Intra-class correlation coefficients and&#xD;
      standard error of measurements will evaluate intra- and inter-session, and between-plane&#xD;
      reliability of SWE stiffness measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1.2: Univariate linear regressions will map the relationship between SWE mean and&#xD;
      peak stiffness and the complex modulus of elasticity, with the complex modulus of elasticity&#xD;
      considered the criterion standard. For non-linear relationships, appropriate transformations&#xD;
      will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1.3: Two-way multivariate analyses of covariance will test the effect of site&#xD;
      (cervical junction, isthmus, fundus) and group (FIB vs CON) on peak and mean myometrial&#xD;
      stiffness and the confounding effects of age, parity and contraceptive use on the adjusted&#xD;
      group mean difference. Independent t-tests will be used for post-hoc evaluation if a&#xD;
      significant main effect/interaction is observed. Logistic regressions will map the&#xD;
      relationship of age, parity, and contraceptive use to myometrial stiffness at each&#xD;
      measurement site. Acceptable regressions will explain &gt;80% of the variance in the data. For&#xD;
      non-linear relationships, appropriate transformations will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2.1: Based on the pathology report, fibroids will be classified as either&#xD;
      non-degenerative (i.e. normal) or degenerative (inclusive of all variations in presentation).&#xD;
      One-way MANOVAs will evaluate between group differences in fibroid type (non-degenerative vs&#xD;
      degenerative) and uterine tissue peak and mean stiffness measured with SWE, while post-hoc&#xD;
      evaluation of significant main effects will involve independent t-tests using appropriate&#xD;
      Bonferroni corrections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2.2: SWE measurements will be ensemble averaged across intra-session repetitions&#xD;
      for each site. Two-way MANOVAs will evaluate site and time (pre, post-course 1, post-course&#xD;
      2) differences in mean and peak stiffness measured with SWE One-way ANOVAs and dependant&#xD;
      t-tests will be used for post-hoc Bonferroni corrected evaluation of significant main&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
