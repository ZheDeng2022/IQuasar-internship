      HD SAGA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is increasing evidence that having AF is associated with some scarring of the upper&#xD;
      chamber of the heart, the left atrium. There is also evidence that the amount of scarring can&#xD;
      predict ablation success rates. Recently, rapid ultra high density mapping equipment has&#xD;
      become available and this has the capability of defining the electrical scar in the atrium in&#xD;
      detail. The equipment used to do this is standard approved equipment for the procedure but&#xD;
      its use for making scar maps has not been fully assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the mapping phase of the study therefore, the aim will be to collect high density scar&#xD;
      maps in AF and normal rhythm to see how they compare. Maps will be collected in different&#xD;
      ways to see if that changes their accuracy. The study will also assess if the values&#xD;
      previously suggested as representing scar with lower density mapping systems are still&#xD;
      appropriate where high density mapping equipment is used. The results from this study will&#xD;
      help to improve the understanding of scar in the atrium and help demonstrate the most&#xD;
      efficient way to collect scar information using this high density mapping equipment. In the&#xD;
      future, clinicians may be able to use these very detailed scar maps to tailor and refine the&#xD;
      way they ablate patients with AF, though the focus of the current study is just on collecting&#xD;
      the scar information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While identifying areas requiring ablation is important to an ablation procedure, the other&#xD;
      important aspect is the efficacy of ablation. Until now, we have been reliant on assessing&#xD;
      our inputs into an ablation (such as the level of contact and the power delivered) but have&#xD;
      been limited in the assessment of the output of an ablation in terms of lesion&#xD;
      characteristics. New ablation catheter technology is now available which can assess the&#xD;
      localised impedance drop with ablation. This is likely a better surrogate for lesion&#xD;
      parameters than what we have previously had available and merits further study. Based on such&#xD;
      study, we may be able to define targets for ablation which would help to guide future&#xD;
      ablations.&#xD;

      HD SAGA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study would propose to use the Rhythmia Ultra High Density (UHD) mapping system (Boston&#xD;
      Scientific) firstly to generate scar maps to determine if the results are comparable with&#xD;
      previous work using lower density systems. Scar maps would be acquired in 3 groups of&#xD;
      patients. The first group would be Redo-persistent AF ablation cases as these patients would&#xD;
      have expected LA scar (iatrogenic and non-iatrogenic) from their previous ablation procedure.&#xD;
      De novo persistent AF patients who would be expected to have non-iatrogenic scar. De novo&#xD;
      paroxysmal AF patients who would be expected to have no or minimal scar. In redo AF patients,&#xD;
      the validity of the scar maps would be further explored by undertaking re-isolation of veins&#xD;
      based on discontinuities in the pulmonary vein isolation lines. If this is proven to be&#xD;
      effective, it would demonstrate that the scar picked up by the system is genuine and may also&#xD;
      suggest a more effective use of UHD systems for redo-pulmonary vein isolation (PVI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the ablation phase, we would be assessing the effect of ablation on the localised ablation&#xD;
      characteristics of the tissue to assess how this is affected by ablation. From previous work,&#xD;
      using conventional, wide area impedance measurements, there is a notable plateau in the&#xD;
      impedance drop with ablation suggesting a point beyond which there is minimal efficacy gain&#xD;
      from further ablation. One would expect this would be even more apparent with localised&#xD;
      impedance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Original Hypothesis - mapping phase An UHD mapping system can be utilised to generate&#xD;
      automated, rapid, high density atrial scar maps in AF to guide a scar-based ablation&#xD;
      strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Original Hypothesis - ablation phase Localised Impedance will fall during ablation and this&#xD;
      fall will plateau, suggesting a biophysical target for ablation&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a small body of literature addressing contact mapping of atrial scar but this has&#xD;
      mainly relied on lower density mapping approaches. UHD mapping systems offer the advantage of&#xD;
      true high-density mapping with improved signal to noise ratios that one would predict will&#xD;
      lead to the generation of more accurate maps. These advantages are also such that one would&#xD;
      predict scar maps in AF would be more accurate. Extending the scar maps to incorporate the RA&#xD;
      is also novel in this context and would give an insight into the degree to which AF is a&#xD;
      bi-atrial fibrotic cardiomyopathy. As the use of UHD mapping is novel, it is important to&#xD;
      establish how relevant criteria used in lower density, lower fidelity mapping systems are&#xD;
      when the newer system is used, especially in defining scar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No clinical studies have been published assessing localised impedance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Fifteen patients listed for persistent AF ablation would be recruited including&#xD;
      redo-ablation patients (aiming for 5 de novo and 10 redo patients). All these patients would&#xD;
      be in AF at the time of the procedure. A further 5 patients with paroxysmal AF would also be&#xD;
      recruited. Procedures would be performed on uninterrupted anticoagulation with a&#xD;
      pre-procedural TOE as dictated by local guidelines. Moderate sedation or general anaesthetic&#xD;
      procedures would be included. Intravenous heparin would be used to maintain the ACT at a&#xD;
      therapeutic level throughout the study. All mapping would be undertaken using the Orion high&#xD;
      density multipolar mapping catheter with the Rhythmia system. The ablation catheter used&#xD;
      would be the IntellaNav MiFi Open Irrigated Temperature Ablation Catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An RA scar map would be obtained using WCT as a reference. Double transseptal access would be&#xD;
      obtained and the mapping and ablation catheters passed into the LA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An LA scar map would be taken with the mapping catheter. For paroxysmal AF cases in sinus&#xD;
      rhythm, this would be the only LA map taken. For patients in AF, maps would be taken in AF&#xD;
      and then in sinus rhythm. In redo cases, the veins which the scar map suggests are likely to&#xD;
      be reconnected would be noted (based on discontinuities in the wide area circumferential&#xD;
      ablation (WACA) lines). The mapping catheter would then be used to confirm the presence of&#xD;
      electrical reconnection of each vein. The patient would then be cardioverted if in AF and the&#xD;
      mapping process repeated using a WCT reference. With all maps, the aim would be complete LA&#xD;
      coverage. For the sinus rhythm maps, the LA will be divided into 5 sites: roof, posterior&#xD;
      wall, inferior wall, septum, anterior wall bordering left atrial appendage. Within each of&#xD;
      these sites, the pacing threshold will be assessed at 3 locations incorporating a spread of&#xD;
      bipolar voltages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the mapping phase, the case would then proceed as per the operator's standard&#xD;
      methodology. The aim would be to collect at least 30 static study ablation points as&#xD;
      discussed above. Vein re-isolation would be performed without any catheter measuring&#xD;
      electrical activity in the vein, purely based on the scar map, targeting discontinuities in&#xD;
      the WACA lines. Ablations would be static rather than drag ablations and at each point, the&#xD;
      electrogram from the MiFi electrodes would be recorded at the start and end of ablation.&#xD;
      Pacing would be performed during ablation and the impedance value at which pacing capture was&#xD;
      lost would be noted. Following this ablation, the mapping catheter would be utilised to&#xD;
      establish if the vein has been electrically disconnected based on the scar map.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the case, in sinus rhythm, scar maps of the RA would be taken. In sinus rhythm,&#xD;
      pacing would be undertaken as for the LA at the following sites: anterior wall, posterior&#xD;
      wall, septum and lateral wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scar maps would be exported offline to allow quantitative analysis, as would the&#xD;
      electrogram and impedance data. The analysis would be performed using the Matlab programming&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scar analysis will exclude any portions of the LA distal to the WACA lines. The initial&#xD;
      step will be to give a low voltage zone percentage. The next step will be to identify&#xD;
      congruent low voltage zones and give advice regarding the ablation strategy for these -&#xD;
      whether this involved delivering lines, for instance for a large posterior wall scar, and if&#xD;
      the ablation needs to be extended to other inexcitable structures to prevent leaving a narrow&#xD;
      conducting isthmus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Follow up There would be no additional follow up for this study - the participants'&#xD;
      follow up will follow the normal clinical practice at University Hospital Southampton.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HD SAGA S:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty patients will be recruited for the HD-SAGAS cohort, all with persistent AF who will be&#xD;
      in AF at the time of the procedure. These can be de novo or redo procedure patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures would be performed on uninterrupted anticoagulation with a pre-procedural imaging&#xD;
      as dictated by local guidelines. Moderate sedation or general anaesthetic procedures would be&#xD;
      included. Intravenous heparin would be used to maintain the ACT at a therapeutic level&#xD;
      throughout the study. All mapping would be undertaken using the Orion high density multipolar&#xD;
      mapping catheter with the Rhythmia system. The ablation catheter used would be the&#xD;
      Stablepoint catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An LA scar map would be taken with the mapping catheter. The first map would be collected in&#xD;
      AF. Following this, at 5 locations in the LA, aiming for a spread of voltages and locations,&#xD;
      the contact force would be increased from 0-40g and the LI noted. The patient would then be&#xD;
      cardioverted and a map taken in sinus rhythm with right atrial pacing. With all maps, the aim&#xD;
      would be complete LA coverage. After cardioversion, at the same spots assessed in AF, the&#xD;
      contact force would again be increased from 0-40g and the LI noted once more. Pacing&#xD;
      thresholds would also be checked at these locations with a stable contact force of 10-20g to&#xD;
      ensure good contact. The pacing phase could be after the ablation phase depending on rhythm&#xD;
      stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the mapping phase, the case would then proceed as per the operator's standard&#xD;
      methodology. The operator will be allowed to use whichever powers they wish to during&#xD;
      ablation. Sites of acute reconnection would be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the case, in sinus rhythm, pacing thresholds would be assessed in 5 areas in&#xD;
      the LA, aiming for a spread of areas and voltages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HD SAGA H:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study would use the HD Grid catheter and Precision mapping system from Abbott. The HD&#xD;
      Grid catheter has a unique arrangement of electrodes that allows for 3D electroanatomical&#xD;
      maps to be generated between bipoles of different orientations. Following this a novel&#xD;
      algorithm (HD Wave) provides the the point with largest amplitude. This abrogates the&#xD;
      directional limitations of conventional bipolar mapping. Thus smaller more accurate areas of&#xD;
      scar could be seen with the left atrium as has been generated in previous studies in the left&#xD;
      ventricle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The use of HD Wave mapping and the best duplicate algorithm will lead to more&#xD;
      reliable voltage maps in AF - both throughout the LA body and in the PVI lines. The gold&#xD;
      standard to compare with here will be the sinus rhythm maps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary comparison:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sinus rhythm HD wave versus AF HD wave map Scar volume PVI gaps&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary comparisons:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scar volumes and PVI gaps Sinus rhythm HD wave versus conventional AF HD wave versus&#xD;
      conventional&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol 20 patients listed for redo ablation of persistent AF, in AF at the time of&#xD;
      procedure. All procedures would be performed using the precision mapping system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operator would collect a voltage map of the left atrium using the HD Grid catheter in AF.&#xD;
      Following this, the patient would be cardioverted and another map collected with the same&#xD;
      mapping catheter during CS proximal pacing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure would then proceed as per usual care. Subsequent to the procedure, the mapping&#xD;
      functions would be applied to the data by Turbo mapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sites of PV reconnection would be noted based on the ablations performed by the operator.&#xD;
