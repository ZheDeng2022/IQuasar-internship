  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of two different sedation protocols during transvaginal oocyte retrieval will be&#xD;
      investigated on propofol consumption as a rescue sedative and on IVF success. One group will&#xD;
      receive dexmedetomidine and fentanyl while the other will receive midazolam and remifentanil.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Women will be consecutively allocated into one of the following two groups using a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      in order to avoid any potential source of bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group DEX: women will receive dexmedetomidine (solution 4 γ/ml) continuously infused at a&#xD;
      dose of 1 γ/kg/ and fentanyl 100γ iv. Dexmedetomidine infusion will start 10 min before the&#xD;
      start of transvaginal oocyte retrieval and will stop at the end of procedure. At that time&#xD;
      point, both total volume (ml) and dose (γ) of dexmedetomidine administered will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group MZM: women will receive remifentanil (solution 50γ/ml) continuously infused at a dose&#xD;
      of 0.2 γ/kg/min και midazolam 1 mg iv. Remifentanil infusion will start 10 min before the&#xD;
      start of transvaginal oocyte retrieval and will stop at the end of the procedure. At that&#xD;
      time point, both total volume (ml) and dose (γ) of remifentanil administered will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, in case of non-co-operation of the woman (e.g. kinetic response), propofol&#xD;
      will be given as a bolus rescue dose as follows: the 1st rescue dose will be 1mg/kg while all&#xD;
      the next doses will be 0.5 mg/kg. At the end of the procedure, the number of rescue doses and&#xD;
      the total rescue dose (mg) of propofol given will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative monitoring will include ECG, noninvasive blood pressure, SpO2, EtCO2 and depth&#xD;
      of sedation using BIS values and ΟΑSS scale. Also, adverse effects such as hypotension,&#xD;
      bradycardia, nausea &amp; vomiting, rigidity, airway obstruction, and need for bag-mask&#xD;
      ventilation will be recorded. The use of vasoactive drugs will also be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the procedure, the time and quality of recovery will be assessed using ΟΑSS&#xD;
      scale (max score=5), while postoperatively the Post Anesthesia Discharge Scoring System, as&#xD;
      well as woman's and gynecologist's (physician) overall satisfaction related to the sedation&#xD;
      techniques used, will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the IVF outcome, the following parameters will be recorded: number of oocytes&#xD;
      retrieved, the percentage of mature oocytes, embryo quality, percentage of positive pregnancy&#xD;
      test, percentage of clinical pregnancy, the percentage of live birth.&#xD;
