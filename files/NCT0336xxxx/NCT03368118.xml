      profile of ABX464 given once a day (o.d) at 50 mg in subjects who have been previously&#xD;

      This study is an open-label study aiming at evaluating the long-term safety and the efficacy&#xD;
      profile of ABX464 given once a day (o.d) at 50 mg in subjects who have been previously&#xD;
      enrolled in the ABX464-101 clinical study (induction study) and who are willing to continue&#xD;
      their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive ABX464 given at 50 mg o.d irrespective of their previous treatment&#xD;
      received in the ABX464-101 study (i.e. ABX464 or Placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The actual treatment received by a subject throughout the previous study (ABX464-101) will&#xD;
      not be known at the time the subjects enter this follow-up study. This treatment group will&#xD;
      be communicated (throughout the investigators) to the subjects at the end of the ABX464-101&#xD;
      study (planned in Q3/2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrolment in this follow-up study will be based on the willingness of the subject to&#xD;
      carry on his/her participation and also based on investigator's judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be treated with ABX464 for an overall period of 48 months. Subjects will be&#xD;
      followed up weekly during the first month, every two weeks during the second month and then&#xD;
      on a monthly basis until M24, then quaterly from M24 to M48.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if ALL of the following&#xD;
        criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects previously enrolled in the ABX464-101 clinical study who have completed the&#xD;
             initial 2-month treatment phase;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects able and willing to comply with study visits and procedures;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with hematological and biochemical laboratory parameters as follows at the&#xD;
             D56 visit of the ABX464-101 study:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g dL-1;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 750 mm-3;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000 mm-3;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total serum creatinine ≤ 1.3 x ULN (upper limit of normal);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL min-1 by the Cockcroft-Gault equation;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alkaline phosphatase, AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt; 1.5 x ULN;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects should understand, sign and date the written voluntary informed consent form&#xD;
             at the enrolment visit prior to any protocol-specific procedures being performed;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects should be affiliated to a social security regimen (for French sites only);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females and males receiving the study treatment and their partners must agree to use a&#xD;
             highly effective contraceptive method during the study and for 3 months after end of&#xD;
             study or early termination. Contraception should be in place at least 3 months prior&#xD;
             to study participation. Women must be either postmenopausal (at least 12 months of&#xD;
             amenorrhea), surgically sterile or if of childbearing potential must use a highly&#xD;
             effective contraceptive method. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) will enter the&#xD;
             study after confirmed menstrual period and a negative pregnancy test. Highly effective&#xD;
             methods of contraception include: true abstinence, intrauterine device (IUD),&#xD;
             intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS), hormonal contraception (estrogen and&#xD;
             progestogen or progestogen only) associated with inhibition of ovulation, bilateral&#xD;
             tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner. True abstinence is defined when this is in line&#xD;
             with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. In each case of delayed&#xD;
             menstrual period (over one month between menstruations) confirmation of absence of&#xD;
             pregnancy is required. This recommendation also applies to WOCBP with infrequent or&#xD;
             irregular menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following criterion should be checked at the time of screening. If this exclusion&#xD;
        criterion applies, the subject will not be included in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        ▪ Any condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, could compromise the subject's&#xD;
        safety or the adherence to the study protocol.&#xD;
