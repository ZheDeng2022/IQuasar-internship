  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center, open-label, pharmacokinetic study will evaluate the bioequivalence (BE) or&#xD;
      relative bioavailability (rBA) of three new idasanutlin-tablet variants compared to the&#xD;
      reference tablet formulation following oral administration of a 300 milligrams (mg) dose in&#xD;
      participants with solid tumors for whom no further treatment options are available. Following&#xD;
      the four administrations of idasanutlin in the BE/rBA cycle of the study (Cycle 1),&#xD;
      participants who have no clinically defined progressive disease and who recover from any&#xD;
      prior treatment toxicity to Grade less than or equal to (&lt;/=) 1 may enter the optional&#xD;
      treatment extension phase. This extension phase will continue for additional 28-day cycles or&#xD;
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity is observed.&#xD;
