  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Group A Streptococcus (GAS) infection is a major cause of death and disability globally with&#xD;
      a disproportionately high burden in settings of disadvantage worldwide. Acute infections due&#xD;
      to GAS range from very common superficial skin infections (&gt;150 million prevalent cases) and&#xD;
      pharyngitis (over 600 million incident cases) to life-threatening invasive disease (&gt;600,000&#xD;
      incident cases) such as necrotising fasciitis. Post-infectious GAS sequelae of GAS include&#xD;
      acute rheumatic fever (ARF, ~500,000 incident cases) leading to rheumatic heart disease (RHD,&#xD;
      ~34 million prevalent cases), and acute glomerulonephritis. The health services impact of GAS&#xD;
      disease in all its forms is immense and strikes at every level from primary to intensive&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controlled human infection models (CHIMs) have a long history of critical contributions to&#xD;
      vaccine development. Data from CHIMs meeting modern scientific, regulatory, and ethical&#xD;
      standards, are aiding efforts to control over 25 major human pathogens, including bacteria&#xD;
      (e.g. pneumococcus, cholera), viruses (e.g. respiratory syncytial virus, influenza), and&#xD;
      parasites (e.g. malaria, schistosomiasis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A reliable and safe controlled human infection model of GAS pharyngitis will be an important&#xD;
      part of the global vaccine development effort. To build the model, the investigators are&#xD;
      undertaking a dose-ranging study using an observational, dose-escalation, inpatient trial to&#xD;
      determine the dose of GAS administered by direct oropharyngeal inoculation (bacteria&#xD;
      'painted' onto throat) required to reliably produce a pharyngitis attack rate of ≥ 60% in&#xD;
      carefully screened healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a ubiquitous human pathogen. Its impact begins in early&#xD;
      childhood and is felt most by those who have the least. Globally, the health services impact&#xD;
      of GAS disease in all its forms is immense and strikes at every level from primary to&#xD;
      intensive care. Despite recognition of the need for GAS vaccine development, there are major&#xD;
      obstacles impeding progress. A human challenge model promises to help to shift inertia in GAS&#xD;
      vaccine development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to use an observational, dose-escalation, inpatient trial to&#xD;
      determine the dose of GAS administered by direct oropharyngeal inoculation required to&#xD;
      reliably produce a pharyngitis attack rate of ≥ 60% in carefully screened healthy adult&#xD;
      volunteers. A GAS strain has been specially selected and prepared for this study to ensure&#xD;
      safety and clinical relevance. Potential participants aged 18 to 40 years, the age range&#xD;
      associated with the lowest risk of invasive GAS disease, will be carefully screened to&#xD;
      minimise risk and maximise the likelihood of achieving the pharyngitis endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of three human GAS pharyngeal vaccine-challenge studies from the 1970s are&#xD;
      encouraging, and reassuring. GAS challenge did cause pharyngitis and was safe, with all&#xD;
      participants responding to antibiotics and none experiencing complications, despite these&#xD;
      studies using more aggressive GAS strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design involves direct oropharyngeal inoculation of GAS to sequential cohorts. Up&#xD;
      to four doses will be tested, from 1-3 x 10^5 cfu/mL (lower than previous GAS challenge&#xD;
      studies) to a maximum of 1-3 x 10^8 cfu/mL. A minimum of 20 and maximum of 80 participants&#xD;
      will be challenged. The challenge procedure aligns closely that used successfully in the&#xD;
      1970s GAS human challenge studies. An incubation period of 36 to 72 hours is expected before&#xD;
      onset of symptoms. Participants will be intensively monitored inpatients for up to six days&#xD;
      after challenge. The primary outcome measure is GAS pharyngitis, as defined by a combination&#xD;
      of positive clinical and laboratory features. All participants developing pharyngitis will be&#xD;
      treated with antibiotics and and those without pharyngitis will also be treated after 5 days.&#xD;
      Participants will be followed as outpatients at 1 week, and 1, 3, and 6 months after&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Due to an unexpectedly very high proportion of participants developing pharyngitis at the&#xD;
      starting dose, scope for dose de-escalation was subsequently included in a protocol&#xD;
      amendment, using a dose of 1-3 x 10^4 cfu/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A challenge model also promises an unprecedented opportunity to use modern techniques to&#xD;
      describe the immunobiology of GAS infection. Blood and saliva samples will be collected at&#xD;
      multiple timepoints before, during, and after the challenge. Testing of serial samples will&#xD;
      add a dynamic next level to the clinical foundations of the challenge model, enabling&#xD;
      in-depth comparison between participants developing pharyngitis or not and paving the way to&#xD;
      identifying immune correlates of protection.&#xD;

             echocardiogram, non-clinically significant laboratory profiles, vital signs, and&#xD;
             12-lead ECG at screening, as deemed by the investigator.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Resting heart rate (HR), as measured by ECG of 40bpm - 100 bpm (confirmed by one&#xD;
             repeat at screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females must be non-pregnant, non-lactating or postmenopausal for at least 1 year (as&#xD;
             confirmed by follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH]), or surgically sterile for at least 6&#xD;

             receiving or having previously received immunosuppressive therapy, including systemic&#xD;
             steroids including adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) or inhaled steroids in dosages&#xD;
