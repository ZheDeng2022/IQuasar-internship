      The overall objective of this randomized trial is to evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of&#xD;
      intravascular cooling using the ZOLL Thermogard XP3 IVTM System, as an adjunctive therapy for&#xD;
      patients presenting with acute anterior myocardial infarction and undergoing PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the Phase A trial is to demonstrate successful incorporation of&#xD;
      intravascular cooling into US standard of care.&#xD;
