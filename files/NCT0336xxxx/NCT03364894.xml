      Background Our understanding of PD has stagnated, partly due to the limited patient diversity&#xD;
      and brief followup captured in most study cohorts. Additionally, potentially valuable&#xD;
      biomarkers derived from different types of measurements are rarely analyzed in an integrated&#xD;
      fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective This study aims to create a longitudinal dataset of clinical, molecular, imaging,&#xD;
      and continuous wearable sensor-based data from a representative Parkinson's disease (PD)&#xD;
      cohort. Data will be made available to researchers worldwide to accelerate the discovery of&#xD;
      novel etiological insights, development of new therapeutic approaches, and personalized&#xD;
      disease management. For this purpose, an extensible norm for sharing research data will be&#xD;
      developed, meeting the latest data privacy and security standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Supported by a multinational, public-private partnership, a prospective cohort study&#xD;
      was designed to include 650 representative PD patients (disease duration &lt;5 years).&#xD;
      Comprehensive follow-up for at least 2 years includes: (1) annual assessment at the study&#xD;
      center for acquisition of detailed clinimetric data, magnetic resonance imaging, and&#xD;
      biospecimens (plasma, serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), stool) and (2) collection of data&#xD;
      from the home environment, using self-assessments and an advanced wrist-worn wearable device&#xD;
      to continuously measure biological and environmental signals. Collection, storage, and&#xD;
      sharing of these research data will be facilitated by a new method to protect privacy and&#xD;
      enhance security using polymorphic encryption and pseudonymization (PEP), a methodology that&#xD;
      combines advanced encryption with distributed pseudonymization and data access management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion This study is unique, as it includes a cohort of unbiased subjects with recently&#xD;
      diagnosed PD, creating an unprecedented dataset that combines longitudinally collected&#xD;
      clinical, molecular, imaging, and data from wearable sensors using state of the art&#xD;
      technology. The single-center study design minimizes measurement variability. Finally, the&#xD;
      innovative methodology for data privacy and protection might serve as a new international&#xD;
      standard for sharing research data.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Personalized Parkinson Project proposes an unbiased approach to biomarker development&#xD;
      with multiple clinical, genomic and other molecular, and imaging biomarkers measured in a&#xD;
      large population, measured at 3 time points (baseline visit, one year follow-up, and two&#xD;
      years' follow-up). In addition, the study protocol includes day-to-day patient monitoring&#xD;
      with a multisensor wearable device, the Verily Study Watch, that continuously collects data&#xD;
      (movement, pulse, skin temperature, ambient information) and allows for real-time data&#xD;
      collection between study visits. The goal of the device is to collect high-resolution,&#xD;
      continuous biological signals from the body. These measurements of physiology, activity, and&#xD;
      environmental conditions over the course of a 2-year study will be used to create a&#xD;
      quantified functional assessment of patients with PD. Mapping these signals with clinical&#xD;
      outcomes such as disease progression will allow the investigators to evaluate the&#xD;
      relationship between biosensor data and the clinical variables, genotypic, and imaging&#xD;
      biomarkers collected in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is intended to create a unique resource of genotypic, functional, and phenotypic&#xD;
      data collected longitudinally on a cohort of Dutch subjects with PD (n=650), allowing the&#xD;
      Research Collaborators to address a series of hypothesis-driven research questions. The aim&#xD;
      is to develop novel etiological insights, to identify biomarkers that can assist in&#xD;
      predicting differences in prognosis and treatment response between patients, to improve&#xD;
      existing treatments, to develop new therapeutic approaches, and to develop a more precise and&#xD;
      personalized disease management approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the cohort will serve as a source of data that can be accessed by qualified&#xD;
      researchers worldwide, allowing them to add their research capacity to further address the&#xD;
      main aims of this study. For this reason, data governance will be managed by dedicated&#xD;
      advisory boards and data review committees, as specified in the study protocol. Participation&#xD;
      in this study and results from this study will not be used for patient treatment decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is threefold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary objective of the study is to perform a set of hypothesis-driven analyses on&#xD;
           the study data set, aiming to correlate established biomarkers (obtained clinically,&#xD;
           from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), from known&#xD;
           genetic factors, and from monitoring of biosensors signals) to the rate of disease&#xD;
           progression, and to responses to treatment (both pharmacological and behavioral, such as&#xD;
           participation in exercise). Also, the investigators aim to identify biomarkers that can&#xD;
           assist in predicting differences in prognosis and treatment response between patients.&#xD;
           Finally, by developing novel etiological and pathophysiological insights, the study aims&#xD;
           to improve existing treatments and to develop new therapeutic approaches, as a basis for&#xD;
           development of a more precise and personalized disease management approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the Verily Study Watch, to assess&#xD;
           how these devices could provide information about the function of patients with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The tertiary objective of this study is to create an extensive longitudinal dataset&#xD;
           describing the genetic, clinical, functional, and phenotypic characteristics of a&#xD;
           representative Parkinson's disease (PD) subject cohort (n = 650) to allow researchers to&#xD;
           investigate important unanswered questions in PD.&#xD;
