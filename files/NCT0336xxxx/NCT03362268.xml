  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of ilaprazole and omeprazole&#xD;
      in the treatment and prevention of peptic ulcer bleeding. Patients with endoscopically&#xD;
      diagnosed peptic ulcer bleeding were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, parallel and&#xD;
      positive-controlled trial. They were randomly assigned into two groups, ilaprazole and&#xD;
      omeprazole, to be treated for up to 30 days and be seen at day 3, 4, 7, 14 and 30. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint was the hemostasis rate (hemostatic groups with endoscopy check ) and&#xD;
      re-bleeding rate ( bleeding groups with endoscopy check) within 72 hours. Secondary end&#xD;
      points include effective rate of hemostasis, mean volume of blood transfusion, the length of&#xD;
      stay and re-bleeding rate, etc.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with endoscopically diagnosed gastric and duodenal ulcer bleeding were randomly&#xD;
      assigned into two groups, ilaprazole and omeprazole. 120 patients were administrated 10 mg&#xD;
      ilaprazole daily (at day 1-3) through intravenous infusion within 30min with first dose&#xD;
      doubling. Since 4th day, those patients were changed to oral administration. Other 60&#xD;
      patients were administrated 40 mg omeprazole twice daily (at day 1-3) through intravenous&#xD;
      infusion within 30min. Since 4th day, those patients were changed to oral administration. The&#xD;
      efficacy of ilaprazole and omeprazole was evaluated by the primary endpoint including the&#xD;
      hemostasis rate (hemostatic groups with endoscopy check ) and re-bleeding rate (bleeding&#xD;
      groups with endoscopy check) within 72 hours and secondary end points including effective&#xD;
      rate of hemostasis, average blood transfusion, the need to switch to other treatments&#xD;
      (endoscopic treatment or surgery, etc.), hospital stay and re-bleeding rate at day 7, 14 and&#xD;
      30. Safety assessments based mainly on the occurrence, frequency, and severity of adverse&#xD;
      events, which were monitored throughout the duration of the study, and also based on&#xD;
      comprehensive indexes,including physical examination, electrocardiography, and routine&#xD;
      laboratory investigations, which were performed at baseline and repeated at the end of the&#xD;
      treatment period. For all adverse events, where necessary, patients were withdrawn from the&#xD;
      study.This phase Ⅱ clinical trial was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      ilaprazole and omeprazole in the treatment and prevention of peptic ulcer bleeding.&#xD;
