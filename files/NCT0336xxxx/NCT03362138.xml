  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant melanoma (MM) is a deadly cancer, claiming globally about 160000 new cases per year&#xD;
      and 48000 deaths at a 1:28 lifetime incidence (2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The golden standard, dermoscopy, enables Dermatologists to diagnose with a sensitivity of&#xD;
      40%, and a 8-12% specificity, approximately. Additional diagnostic abilities are restricted&#xD;
      to devices which are either unproved or experimental.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new technology of Neuronal Network Clinical Decision Support (NNCD) was developed. It uses&#xD;
      a dermoscopic imaging device and a camera able to capture an image. The photo is transferred&#xD;
      to a Cloud Server and further analyzed by a trained classifier. Classifier training is aimed&#xD;
      at a high accuracy diagnosis of Dysplastic Nevi (DN), Spitz Nevi and Malignant Melanoma&#xD;
      detection with assistance from a Deep Neuronal Learning network (DLN). Diagnosis output is an&#xD;
      excise or do not excise recommendation for pigmented skin lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 80 subjects already referred to biopsy pigmented skin lesions will be examined by&#xD;
      dermoscopy imaging in a non interventional study. Artificial Intelligence output results, as&#xD;
      measured by 2 different dermoscopes, to be compared to ground truth biopsies, by either&#xD;
      classifier decisions or a novel Modified Classifier Technology output decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints are sensitivity and specificity detection of the NNCD techniques. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints are the positive and negative prediction ratios of NNCD techniques.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malignant melanoma (MM) is a deadly cancer, claiming globally about 160000 new cases per year&#xD;
      and 48000 deaths [1]. The incidence rate for MM ascended between 1950 and 2007 more than&#xD;
      17-fold in men (1.9 to 33.5 per 100,000) and more than 9-fold in women (2.6 to 25.3 per&#xD;
      100,000) [2]. It is estimated that 76000 new cases and 9000 deaths are diagnosed/ year (US,&#xD;
      only, 2017) [3]. European Countries yield 22000/yr. stage 4 melanomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MM starts de novo in about 70% of subjects, with a small 2 millimeters or more superficial&#xD;
      skin lesion which, if left undiagnosed, might develop into a more advanced stage cancer,&#xD;
      followed by silent lymph node spreading and invasion of vital organs such as liver and brain.&#xD;
      MM is staged by either direct invasion into the skin, the Breslow scale in mm, or by its skin&#xD;
      level involvement, a Clark 1-5 structural skin level of involvement. Both methods of&#xD;
      assessment are predictors of long term survival, which is almost unchanged at a Breslow depth&#xD;
      beneath 1 mm and much decreased beyond Clark III stage. Therefore early detection of&#xD;
      melanoma, generally tagged as small melanoma, is critical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Present Methodologies of MM detection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following different methods and diagnostic means for detection of the cutaneous melanoma&#xD;
      are currently employed as a means of diagnosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Visual recognition by an Asymmetry, Border, Color, Diameter and Evolvement (ABCDE rule).&#xD;
           A 30 year old methodology and still running, assessing: ABCDE. It is used by part of US&#xD;
           dermatologists who trust their clinical skills and instincts [4]. Due to its innate&#xD;
           complexity and myriad of recognition patterns, dermoscopy by epiluminescence microscopy&#xD;
           is considered as ineffective by 60% of the non users dermatologists and 30% report it as&#xD;
           time consuming, rendering it impracticable. The abovementioned rule was reviewed in 2015&#xD;
           [5] and teaches the use of a diameter greater than 6 mm as a criteria for melanoma&#xD;
           recognition. Consequently, it does not contribute to early detection of a melanoma,&#xD;
           which might be life saving, since 70-80% of melanomas start de novo as small melanomas.&#xD;
           An attempt to change the Diameter criteria, i.e. a decrease in the postulated 6 mm&#xD;
           Diameter, leads to a major decrease in sensitivity and specificity, rendering the ABCDE&#xD;
           ineffective for early melanoma detection. It is concluded that these basic visual&#xD;
           criteria, although widely used, are a non effective prevention method due to their&#xD;
           innate criteria which misses the evolving melanomas, since all melanomas start as small&#xD;
           melanomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Epiluminescence microscopy is a 65 years old art, which is considered the golden&#xD;
           standard of evaluation. It is highly dependent on the skills and knowledge of the&#xD;
           diagnostician. Epiluminescence microscopy is a the bridge between clinical observation&#xD;
           and histopathological diagnosis. It allows visualization of skin pigments up to the&#xD;
           papillary dermis and improves detection sensitivity and specificity. Analysis is made by&#xD;
           a clinician based on dermoscopy rules [6], which are based on a complicated dermoscopic&#xD;
           pattern analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Complete dermoscopic pattern analysis of a lesion is the mainstream of diagnosis. Each&#xD;
           of the dermoscopic patterns can diverge in extent, diameter, general or local&#xD;
           appearance, or evolve as multi patterns with various area of expression on the same&#xD;
           lesion and rendering the diagnosis beyond an encyclopedic task.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Due to the complexity of the dermoscopic pattern analysis method, different&#xD;
           modifications were proposed, such as a simplified ABCD rule, an intermediate 7 rules&#xD;
           assessment and a 11 rules checklist. The myriad of data and its interpretation render&#xD;
           even experts in dermoscopy to identify melanomas with a relative low ratio from 5:1 to&#xD;
           15:1, i.e. the number of biopsies of benign lesions performed in order to make the&#xD;
           diagnosis of one skin melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Furthermore, there are claims that one diagnostic sign might be more sensitive that&#xD;
           other signs, alike the criteria of a light brown structureless area. Dermatologists&#xD;
           commonly fail in diagnosing early small melanoma which is the critical period of growth&#xD;
           of the tumor and most efficacious prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Visual recognition by temporal total body photography is yet non standardized&#xD;
           methodology, a time consuming and patient expensive procedure. It uses the human&#xD;
           comparison assessment and is subjected to biases of pixel photo during performance of&#xD;
           the measurement, due to lighting, background and camera position. Addition of patient&#xD;
           assessment by artificial intelligence, an analysis based on computer evaluation of&#xD;
           different colorimetric and geometric parameters of a lesion in real time, confer a&#xD;
           limited advantage only, yielding sometimes more false positives compared to&#xD;
           inexperienced or even experienced clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Multi Spectrometry devices, which provide measurements of melanin, collagen and&#xD;
           hemoglobin with further use of image analysis, do not confer any advantage to&#xD;
           epiluminescence microscopy. Although displaying a higher sensitivity, these&#xD;
           methodologies specificity are considerably below that of simple epiluminescence&#xD;
           microscopy in melanoma identification rate .&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Confocal scanning microscopy, a procedure which uses a low power laser for a 3D imaging.&#xD;
           An effective means of diagnosis. However, the use of this methodology is limited by its&#xD;
           high cost, a prolonged (6 mo) learning curve of 2000-4000 images, and the requirement&#xD;
           for a highly specialized and trained personal, since this methodology is highly&#xD;
           subjected to artifacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Experimental under development methods: alike Electrical impedance spectroscopy, Optical&#xD;
           coherence tomography, High frequency ultrasound, Laser doppler perfusion imaging,&#xD;
           Dynamic thermal imaging, Photoacoustic microscopy, to be further developed and proved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is desirable to identify a new non invasive methodology which will&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improve Sensitivity of diagnosis of pigmented skin lesions, alike dysplastic nevi, Spitz&#xD;
           nevi and MM&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify small MM,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Increase Specificity of lesions to be biopsied&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Non invasive fast technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Common Practice&#xD;
&#xD;
      Commonly, a patient is evaluated by a physician due to either a skin lesion complaint or,&#xD;
      with high risk patients, a summon to visit on a regular basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only some of the dermatologists employ dermoscopy or are skilled to use it since it may seem&#xD;
      to be time consuming. There is no international standard of degree of skill. Even a golden&#xD;
      standard textbook of dermoscopy is not existent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon recognition of suspicious lesion, patient is referred to a surgeon for biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As recently reviewed and in view of the above-mentioned, the incidence of melanoma is&#xD;
      continuing to increase. All present methods commonly do not diagnose melanoma at an early&#xD;
      stage and epiluminescence microscopy is highly user dependant and commonly misses the&#xD;
      diagnosis . Early excision is the only strategy to reduce the death toll associated with&#xD;
      melanoma. Unnecessary excision of benign lesions increases morbidity and raise healthcare&#xD;
      costs associated with melanoma screening, resulting in recommended restrictions to a total&#xD;
      body screening by Surgeon General (2016) and questioning the efficacy of such a screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The requirement for a more systemized methodology and system is obvious in view of the&#xD;
      expected increase in melanoma incidence to a 1:15 within the next 15 years. A new device able&#xD;
      to capture the window of opportunity of Dysplastic Nevus to small melanoma is highly useful&#xD;
      for today healthcare systems.&#xD;
