  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigational and is not designed to treat cancer. In other words, the study&#xD;
      drug, entinostat, is not being given to treat cancer. Instead, the study team is looking at&#xD;
      the effects of entinostat on tumor tissue for research purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 246,660 cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in the United States in 2016. Its&#xD;
      detection and treatment remains a major concern in women's healthcare. In particular, TNBC&#xD;
      accounts for approximately 15-20% of all breast cancers. Research into treatment for breast&#xD;
      cancer relies more and more on understanding how the cancer cells act when they are exposed&#xD;
      to an anti-cancer drug. How most cancer cells act when exposed to anti-cancer drugs and which&#xD;
      patients as a result may benefit the most from these drugs is not well known. Additional&#xD;
      studies are required to determine the cells' reactions. The purpose of part 1 of this study&#xD;
      is to better understand how TNBC tumors react to one particular cancer drug, entinostat.&#xD;
      Entinostat is currently being studied across multiple clinical trials for the treatment of&#xD;
      breast cancer, other solid tumors and blood cancers. Entinostat is investigational and has&#xD;
      not yet been FDA approved for the treatment of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown that a good way to determine how cancer acts when exposed to anti-cancer&#xD;
      drugs is a short-term preoperative window study. In this type of study, subjects receive a&#xD;
      study drug a couple of days before surgery. Leftover tissue from surgery is then used to&#xD;
      determine some of the effects that a study drug may have on the tumor. In this study,&#xD;
      subjects will receive two doses of entinostat prior to undergoing planned surgery. Leftover&#xD;
      tissue from this surgery will then be used to determine the effects entinostat has on tumor&#xD;
      cells. For example, the study team will examine if the types of genes and proteins that the&#xD;
      tumor expresses as a result of entinostat exposure increases or decreases the likelihood that&#xD;
      the tumor will not continue to grow. A gene is a unit of DNA. Genes make up the chemical&#xD;
      structure carrying your genetic information that may determine human characteristics (i.e.,&#xD;
      eye color, height and sex). This study will focus on discovering how entinostat affects a&#xD;
      wide variety of genes in tumor cells.&#xD;

      Primary Objective and Endpoint To identify decrease in Ki-67 mRNA following treatment with&#xD;
      entinostat across TNBC breast cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives and Endpoints To identify messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) gene&#xD;
      expression changes following treatment with entinostat, across TNBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate changes in the proliferation signature by mRNA expression following treatment&#xD;
      with entinostat across TNBC.&#xD;

      TNBC&#xD;
&#xD;
      To correlate mutation and/or copy number variations by whole exome sequencing (WES) with mRNA&#xD;
      gene expression changes and reduction of proliferation signature following treatment with&#xD;
      entinostat across TNBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To correlate protein lysine hyperacetylation in peripheral blood and tumor from pre- and&#xD;
      post-entinostat treated TNBCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore molecular subtype, Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and other immune checkpoint&#xD;
      molecule expression, immune gene and innate anti-programed cell death-1 resistance (IPRES)&#xD;

      of effector and regulatory T cells, and define T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire prior to and&#xD;
      following entinostat treatment in TNBCs. We will also explore mutation and copy number&#xD;
      variation status, and predicted major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I neoantigen&#xD;
      burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To document safety of entinostat in patients with TNBC prior to their scheduled surgical&#xD;
      resection per National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE&#xD;
