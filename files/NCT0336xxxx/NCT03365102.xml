      As a first step toward investigating whether modulation of impulsivity and associated neural&#xD;
      pathways may yield clinically meaningful changes in risk for adolescent suicidal behavior,&#xD;
      the R21 is a proof-of concept study evaluating the potential for tDCS targeting brain regions&#xD;
      associated with behavioral impulsivity (right inferior frontal gyrus [rIFG]) and cognitive&#xD;
      impulsivity (left orbitofrontal cortex [lOFC]) to modulate these facets of impulsivity in a&#xD;
      sample of adolescent suicide attempters. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      anodal tDCS over the rIFG, anodal tDCS over the lOFC, or a sham stimulation condition, in a&#xD;
      three-group design. Task-based measures of behavioral and cognitive impulsivity will be&#xD;
      administered before and after tDCS or sham stimulation. Additionally, electroencephalography&#xD;
      (EEG) and event-related potential (ERP) data will be collected during the impulsivity tasks,&#xD;
      and resting-state EEG data will be collected pre- and post-tDCS administration to confirm&#xD;
      engagement of the targeted brain regions and to delineating the neural pathways underlying&#xD;
      the effects of tDCS on impulsivity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in adolescence. To improve the ability to&#xD;
      predict and prevent suicidal behavior, there is a pressing need for research in this area to&#xD;
      advance beyond identifying risk factors toward a greater focus on the mechanisms of risk for&#xD;
      this behavior. In particular, elucidating the neural pathways underlying risk for suicidal&#xD;
      behavior is important insofar as such work may yield specific and modifiable targets for&#xD;
      clinical intervention. The adoption of new experimental paradigms providing experimental&#xD;
      control over potentially modifiable risk factors has been recommended as a means of&#xD;
      meaningfully advancing the field in this regard. Although yet to be applied to the study of&#xD;
      suicidality, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), in conjunction with measures of&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs), may hold promise as an&#xD;
      experimental paradigm in the study of potentially modifiable risk factors, and underlying&#xD;
      neural mechanisms, for suicidality. One such risk factor of particular relevance to suicide&#xD;
      in adolescence is state-sensitive aspects of impulsivity. Impulsivity has been consistently&#xD;
      linked with suicidality, with this association appearing to be stronger in adolescence than&#xD;
      adulthood. As a first step toward investigating whether modulation of impulsivity and&#xD;
      associated neural pathways may yield clinically meaningful changes in risk for adolescent&#xD;
      suicidal behavior, the R21 is a proof-of concept study evaluating the potential for tDCS&#xD;
      targeting brain regions associated with behavioral impulsivity (right inferior frontal gyrus&#xD;
      [rIFG]) and cognitive impulsivity (left orbitofrontal cortex [lOFC]) to modulate these facets&#xD;
      of impulsivity in a sample of adolescent suicide attempters. Participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive anodal tDCS over the rIFG, anodal tDCS over the lOFC, or a sham&#xD;
      stimulation condition, in a three-group design. Task-based measures of behavioral and&#xD;
      cognitive impulsivity will be administered before and after tDCS or sham stimulation.&#xD;
      Additionally, EEG and ERP data will be collected during the impulsivity tasks, and&#xD;
      resting-state EEG data will be collected pre- and post-tDCS administration to confirm&#xD;
      engagement of the targeted brain regions and to delineating the neural pathways underlying&#xD;
      the effects of tDCS on impulsivity.&#xD;

    <description>The Stop-Signal Task (SST) is a task requiring inhibition of a prepotent motor response. The SST requires participants to respond to a target stimulus as quickly and accurately as possible by pressing a button, but also to withhold their response when they hear an auditory signal. Thus, this task involves a competition between activating and inhibiting processes. The primary outcome variable is change in the stop signal reaction time (SSRT) for the task administered seconds to minutes before and seconds to minutes after stimulation.</description>

    <measure>Delay Discounting Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from within an hour pre-stimulation to within an hour post-stimulation condition</time_frame>
    <description>A computerized Delay Discounting Task (DDT) will be used to assess impulsive choice. In this task, participants are asked to choose between an immediate but small monetary reward and a delayed but larger monetary reward. Delay discounting is the tendency to undervalue an anticipated future reward as the time delay to obtaining the reward increases. Participants will be presented with nine ascending and descending choices until their responses reach a convergence point where their preferences for the immediate and delayed reward are equal (the indifference point). A lower indifference point or a higher discounting rate (preference for smaller immediate rewards over larger delayed rewards) indexes greater impulsivity. The primary outcome variable is change in performance on this task administered seconds to minutes before and seconds to minutes after stimulation.</description>

    <description>In the sham condition, the current will be ramped up to 1.5 mA for 30 seconds and then ramped back down to 0. As this commonly used sham procedure produces a brief tingling sensation, participants are kept unaware of their experimental condition. Resting-state EEG for 10 minutes will be recorded immediately prior to and after the sham tDCS. After post-sham stimulation resting state EEG is acquired, EEG is recorded to extract Evoked Response Potentials in a single-blind procedure.
