  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigated the effect of caffeine on physical performance in healthy citizens&#xD;
      aged over 70 years following eight hours of abstinence from caffeine containing drinks and&#xD;
      foods. The main hypothesis was that 6 mg/kg caffeine would improve cycling endurance at 65%&#xD;
      of expected maximal heart rate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well documented that caffeine ingestion increases the endurance of young people&#xD;
      exercising at 60%-85% of their maximal oxygen uptake (13;15;47). It also seems to improve&#xD;
      endurance as measured by repeated sub-maximal isometric contraction (42), and decreases the&#xD;
      rate of perceived exertion during exercise (6;9;46). Typically, doses of approximately 6&#xD;
      mg/kg caffeine were used in these studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a growing number of elderly with a physical active lifestyle and many elderly&#xD;
      participating in rehabilitation programs the endurance enhancing effect of caffeine is of&#xD;
      increasing interest in this age group. We therefore conducted a study of healthy 75 year old&#xD;
      citizens to investigate whether 6 mg/kg caffeine improved physical performance and reduced&#xD;
      the perceived effort during work in healthy citizens aged â‰¥ 70 years. The main hypothesis was&#xD;
      that caffeine would improve cycling endurance at 65% of expected maximal heart rate. The&#xD;
      study showed that compared to placebo caffeine increased endurance by 25 % (p&lt;0.0001) and&#xD;
      isometric sub-maximal strength with 54 % (p&lt;0.0001), reduced perceived exertion after 5&#xD;
      minutes of biking by 11 % (p=0.002), but in 21 of 30 participants there was reduced postural&#xD;
      stability (with eyes open). In the above described study participants abstained from caffeine&#xD;
      containing drinks and foods for 48 hours prior to each test. Half of the participants&#xD;
      reported withdrawal symptoms. Such a long caffeine abstinence period would infer with daily&#xD;
      life for many people. We therefore invited the participants from the above study to a&#xD;
      repetition of the above study to test whether similar results would be obtained if&#xD;
      participants only abstained from caffeine containing drinks and foods for 8 hours prior to&#xD;
      each test.&#xD;
