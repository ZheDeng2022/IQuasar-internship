      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety and efficacy of repeat doses of&#xD;
      compound 1278863A in subjects with anemia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compound 1278863A is a novel small molecule agent, which stimulates erythropoiesis through&#xD;
      inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-prolyl hydroxylases (EGLNs). This compound is&#xD;
      being developed for the treatment of anemia. This study, PHI112844, will be the first&#xD;
      administration of compound 1278863A to investigate the pharmacodynamics/efficacy, safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of repeat oral doses in anemic pre-dialysis patients with&#xD;
      moderate or severe renal impairment and in hemodialysis-dependent patients.&#xD;

                  days for a scheduled 14 day ESA interval) AND The patient will not resume ESA&#xD;
                  treatment until completion of the Follow-up Visit (Day 57).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has a hemoglobin value:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. For ESA naïve patients: ≤11.0 g/dL&#xD;

                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140&#xD;
                  pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose&#xD;
                  menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception&#xD;
                  methods in Section 8.1.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.&#xD;
                  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal&#xD;
                  status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will&#xD;
                  elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends&#xD;
                  on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal&#xD;
                  status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a&#xD;
                  contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Male patients must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section&#xD;
             8.1.2. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study drug&#xD;
