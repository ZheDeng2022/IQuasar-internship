      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate safety and tolerability by using adverse events (AEs), vital signs including&#xD;
      blood pressure/pulse rate (BP/PR), electrocardiographic examinations (12 lead ECG), bleeding&#xD;
      time, evaluation of antibody titer and safety laboratory tests (biochemistry, hematology,&#xD;
      coagulation, urinalysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (collagen-induced platelet&#xD;
      aggregation)of six ascending single intravenous doses of PR-15 in healthy, male volunteers&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy, male Caucasians between 18 and 45 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normotensive subjects (systolic BP &lt; 140 mmHg and diastolic BP &lt;90 mmHg;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight of 70 to 90 kg (BMI 20 - 25.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative results in HIV antibody, HBs antigen (HBsAg) and HCV tests;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal coagulation function (aPTT between 24 and 35 seconds, PT between 70 and 130%,&#xD;
             INR between 0.85 and 1.15.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are taking or have taken any prescription medication within the last 14&#xD;
             days or any non-prescription medication, especially, anti-platelet drugs, within the&#xD;
             last seven days prior to the administration of trial medication on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intake of any investigational drug within three months prior to the administration of&#xD;
             study medication on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant use of any other medication including over-the-counter preparations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity, contraindication or serious adverse reaction to&#xD;
             inhibitors of platelet aggregation or hypersensitivity to related drugs&#xD;
             (cross-allergy) or to any of the excipients in the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history or clinical evidence of any cardiac, cardio- or cerebrovascular, hepatic,&#xD;
             renal, pulmonary, endocrine, neurological, infectious, gastrointestinal,&#xD;
             haematological, oncological or psychiatric disease or emotional problems or any other&#xD;
             clinically relevant condition, physical finding, ECG- or laboratory test abnormality,&#xD;
             which - in the opinion of the investigator - would pose a significant risk for the&#xD;
             subject, invalidate the Informed Consent or limit the ability of the subject to comply&#xD;
             with study requirements or interfere otherwise with the conduct of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any laboratory value outside the normal laboratory reference range at Screening and&#xD;
             before randomization, unless approved by the investigator.&#xD;

             smoking during the entire in-house period.&#xD;
&#xD;
