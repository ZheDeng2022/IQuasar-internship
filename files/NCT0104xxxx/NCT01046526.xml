      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals who have schizophrenia are significantly more likely to smoke than the&#xD;
           general population, which leads to increased smoking-related illnesses and high rates of&#xD;
           nicotine dependence. Research suggests that high rates of smoking and nicotine addiction&#xD;
           in people with schizophrenia are related to the fact that nicotine temporally improves&#xD;
           performance in several cognitive tasks, including sensory gating, long-term memory, and&#xD;
           visual tracking-all of which are affected by schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking among schizophrenia patients may be a form of self-medication, since nicotine&#xD;
           may temporarily treat and improve cognitive deficits caused by schizophrenia.&#xD;
           Researchers are interested in studying the effects of nicotine on the brain activity of&#xD;
           individuals with schizophrenia to better understand how nicotine affects the brain&#xD;
           regions connected to memory, visual tracking, and attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify specific brain regions involved in the anticipatory learning deficits found&#xD;
           in schizophrenia patients who smoke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether and how nicotine enhances performance in these regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Smokers (at least 10 cigarettes per day) between 18 and 50 years of age who either are&#xD;
      healthy volunteers or have been diagnosed with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to avoid consuming alcohol and restrict consuming caffeinated&#xD;
           beverages for 24 hours before the study days. Participants will provide urine and breath&#xD;
           samples at the start of the study to be tested for chemicals that may interfere with the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will require two to four visits, with two fMRI sessions and other visits for a&#xD;
           clinical interview or training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a training session with a possible mock MRI scan to learn how to do&#xD;
      tasks that track eye movement and measure ability to pay attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the fMRI scanning sessions, participants will receive either a nicotine patch or&#xD;
           a placebo patch without nicotine. After the patch is in place, participants will perform&#xD;
           tasks while receiving MRI scans. The scans will take up to 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide blood samples after finishing the MRI sessions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence rate of smoking among schizophrenia patients is as high as 88 percent. This is&#xD;
      associated with a 2-fold increase in deaths due to smoking related diseases-compounded by&#xD;
      high rates of nicotine dependence and low abstinence rates following cessation programs.&#xD;
      Converging lines of evidence suggest that high rates of smoking and nicotine addiction among&#xD;
      schizophrenic patients is influenced by the presence of disease-related abnormalities in&#xD;
      brain function. Genetic and post mortem studies show that patients exhibit abnormalities in&#xD;
      neuronal nicotinic receptors, which are involved in a number of cognitive functions.&#xD;
      Pharmacological studies show that nicotine temporally improves performance in several&#xD;
      cognitive tasks including sensory gating, long-term memory, and visual tracking. These data&#xD;
      support a growing consensus that smoking among schizophrenic patients is a form of&#xD;
      self-medication, and suggest that the success of targeted smoking cessation programs will&#xD;
      depend, in part, on finding alternative means of treating the underlying cognitive deficits.&#xD;
      One of the most reproducible neurocognitive and biological changes in schizophrenia is&#xD;
      abnormal visual tracking, or smooth pursuit eye movements. Preliminary data show that&#xD;
      previously reported deficits in visual tracking are related to anticipatory learning deficits&#xD;
      and that nicotine enhances performance in patients by temporarily treating this learning&#xD;
      deficit. A better understanding of these processes may lead to better behavioral and/or&#xD;
      pharmacological therapeutic interventions for excessive nicotine abuse and recidivism in this&#xD;
      clinically vulnerable population. In order to identify brain regions underlying this learning&#xD;
      deficit we propose to compare brain activations in 30 healthy controls and 30 patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia during anticipation of target motion using functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (fMRI). In order to identify the brain regions involved in nicotine-induced&#xD;
      enhancement of anticipatory learning we will compare activation in patients under conditions&#xD;
      of unexpected and anticipated target motion following administration of nicotine and placebo.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects (schizophrenia patients and healthy control smokers) must be between the ages of&#xD;
        18-50 and in good health based on history and physical exams. Age restrictions are based on&#xD;
        age-related declines (usually occurring after age 55-58) in eye tracking performance.&#xD;
        Schizophrenia patients are persons with a DSM-IV Axis-I diagnosis for schizophrenia, based&#xD;
        on a best-estimate diagnosis by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)&#xD;
        supplemented by family informants and medical records, done at the MPRC. Those in nicotine&#xD;
        protocols must demonstrate that they are experienced users based upon exhaled CO and must&#xD;
        smoke a minimum of 10 cigarettes/day with duration of use of at least 1 year. Subjects may&#xD;
        be users of alcohol and/or marijuana but may not meet criteria for dependence on either and&#xD;
        may not have used either for at least 24 hours prior to scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded if they are unable to undergo MRI scanning due to pregnancy,&#xD;
        implanted metallic devices (cardiac pacemaker or neurostimulator, some artificial joints,&#xD;
        metal pins, surgical clips or other implanted metal parts) or claustrophobia. Subjects will&#xD;
        also be excluded if they have 1) any major medical illnesses to include, but not limited&#xD;
        to, uncontrolled high blood pressure or high blood sugar, cardiovascular disease, asthma,&#xD;
        peripheral vascular diseases, coagulopathies, history of superficial or deep vein&#xD;
        thrombosis, HIV, or other infectious diseases (e.g. Hepatitis B), 2) mood or anxiety&#xD;
        disorders, or substance-induced psychiatric disorders, 3) neurological illnesses to&#xD;
        include, but not limited to, seizure disorders, multiple sclerosis, movement disorders, or&#xD;
        history of head trauma, CVA, CNS tumor, and other conditions that cause neurocognitive&#xD;
        sequelae, 4) significant alcohol or other drug use, other than nicotine dependence, 5) if&#xD;
        their T1 weighted images reveal gross structural abnormalities and/or, 6)have a history of&#xD;
        syncope. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed on all female volunteers of child-bearing&#xD;
        age before each experimental session. Subjects who are positive for any drug other than&#xD;
        nicotine or marijuana will be excluded. Subjects in nicotine protocols may not be actively&#xD;
        seeking or engaged in smoking cessation treatment. If a subject requires change of&#xD;
        antipsychotic medications because of exacerbation of psychotic symptoms, the subject will&#xD;
        be considered clinically unstable and his/her participation will be discontinued. Patients&#xD;
        with Axis-I mood disorders or substance-induced psychiatric disorders are excluded. We also&#xD;
        exclude patients with significant alcohol or other illicit drug use, other than nicotine&#xD;
        dependence. This is operationally defined as no SCID/DSM-IV Axis-I substance dependence in&#xD;
        the past 6 months, and no current substance abuse. Exceptions are occasional use of&#xD;
        marijuana.&#xD;
