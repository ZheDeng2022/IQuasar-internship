      Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody with proven efficacy in WM but responses are slow.&#xD;
      Bortezomib has shown significant and rapid activity in WM. Combinations of bortezomib with&#xD;
      rituximab nad dexamethasone with rituximab have shown synergistic activity in laboratory&#xD;
      studies and clinical trials. This is a Phase II multicenter study designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of the combination of Bortezomib , Rituximab and dexamethasone (BDR). BDR&#xD;
      will be administered in one 21-day treatment cycle followed by four 35-day treatment cycles&#xD;
      to patients with WM. Bortezomib will be administered as an iv push over 3 to 5 seconds at a&#xD;
      dose of 1.3mg/m2/day on days 1,4,8 and 11 of cycle 1. On cycles 2-5 bortezomib will be given&#xD;
      at a dose of 1.6mg/m2/day on days 1,8,15 and 22 of each cycle. Only on cycles 2 and 5,&#xD;
      following the administration of Bortezomib, dexamethasone 40mg iv and Rituximab 375 mg/m2 iv&#xD;
      will be administered. A total of 8 infusions of rituximab will be administered. Subsequently&#xD;
      patients rated as CR, PR, MR or SD will be followed without any treatment until there is&#xD;
      evidence of progressive disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) is a distinct B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder&#xD;
      characterized primarily by bone marrow infiltration with lymphoplasmacytic cells, along with&#xD;
      demonstration of an IgM monoclonal gammopathy. This condition is considered to correspond to&#xD;
      the lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma as defined by the REAL2 and WHO classification systems. WM is&#xD;
      a rare disease, with an incidence that is less frequent than multiple myeloma, and accounts&#xD;
      for approximately 2% of all hematologic malignancies. The age-adjusted incidence rate is 3.4&#xD;
      per million among males and 1.7 per million among females in the US, with a geometrical&#xD;
      increase with age. Despite continuing advances in the therapy of WM, the disease remains&#xD;
      incurable with a median survival of 5 to 8 years from the time of diagnosis thereby&#xD;
      necessitating the development and evaluation of novel therapeutics. Overall response rates&#xD;
      (ORR) of 30-70% with complete response (CR) rates of up to 10% have been reported with the&#xD;
      use of alkylator agents (e.g. chlorambucil), nucleoside analogues (cladribine or&#xD;
      fludarabine), and the monoclonal antibody rituximab these therapeutic agents in the upfront&#xD;
      therapy of WM with median durations of response averaging 2-3 years. Higher response rates&#xD;
      including CR rates of up to 20% have been reported in studies combining nucleoside analogues&#xD;
      with rituximab, and/or alkylator agents. Importantly, individual patients including the&#xD;
      presence of cytopenias, need for more rapid disease control, age, and in particular candidacy&#xD;
      for autologous transplant therapy should be taken into account in making the choice of first&#xD;
      line therapy. For patients who are candidates for autologous transplant therapy, and in whom&#xD;
      such therapy is seriously considered, exposure to alkylator or nucleoside analogue therapy&#xD;
      should be limited. Monoclonal antibodies have been successfully used to treat patients with&#xD;
      Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM). Most of these efforts to date have focused on the use&#xD;
      of rituximab, a chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody which targets CD20, an antigen which is&#xD;
      widely expressed in WM. Several studies employing standard dose rituximab therapy have&#xD;
      demonstrated major response (&gt;50% reduction in serum IgM) rates of 30%, and durations of&#xD;
      response of about 8 months13-17. More recently, the use of extended schedule rituximab has&#xD;
      been evaluated. Time to response after rituximab is slow and exceeds 3 months on the average.&#xD;
      In many patients a transient increase of serum IgM may occur immediately following initiation&#xD;
      of rituximab. Such an increase does not herald treatment failure and most patients will&#xD;
      return to their baseline serum IgM by 12 weeks. However, patients with baseline serum IgM&#xD;
      levels of &gt;50g/L may be particularly at risk for a hyperviscosity-related event. Bortezomib&#xD;
      is a small molecule proteasome inhibitor developed by Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (MPI)&#xD;
      as a novel agent to treat human malignancies. Bortezomib is currently approved by the US FDA&#xD;
      and by the European EMEA for the treatment of multiple myeloma. By inhibiting a single&#xD;
      molecular target, the proteasome, bortezomib affects multiple signaling pathways. The&#xD;
      anti-neoplastic effect of bortezomib likely involves several distinct mechanisms, including&#xD;
      inhibition of cell growth and survival pathways, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of&#xD;
      expression of genes that control cellular adhesion, migration and angiogenesis. Thus, the&#xD;
      mechanisms by which bortezomib elicits its anti-tumor activity may vary among tumor types,&#xD;
      and the extent to which each affected pathway is critical to the inhibition of tumor growth&#xD;
      could also differ. The mechanism of anti-tumor activity in NHL is not known; however,&#xD;
      bortezomib inhibits the growth of various human lymphoma cell lines, as well as the survival&#xD;
      primary WM cells. Bortezomib has been administered to patients with WM in the context of&#xD;
      prospective studies. Chen et al administered bortezomib to 16 patients with either untreated&#xD;
      or pretreated WM who had received ≤3 prior regimens. Six of 13 evaluable patients (46%)&#xD;
      achieved a partial response. Dimopoulos et al administered bortezomib to 10 patients with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory WM. Six of these patients achieved a partial response which occurred&#xD;
      at a median of 1 month. The median time to progression in the responding patients is expected&#xD;
      to exceed 11months. The more common toxicities were mild or moderate thrombocytopenia, fever&#xD;
      and fatigue; peripheral neuropathy occurred in 3 patients. The WM Clinical Trials Group&#xD;
      (WMCTG) conducted a Phase II Study (DFCI Protocol 03-248) of single-agent bortezomib in 27&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory WM. In an interim analysis, the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      results for 15 patients who completed at least 2 cycles of therapy were reported.37 Eight and&#xD;
      7 of these patients had relapsed and refractory disease, respectively. With a median of 3&#xD;
      completed cycles (range 2-8), 12 of 15 (80%) patients have demonstrated a response with 5&#xD;
      partial responses (&gt;50% decrease in serum IgM) and 7 minor responses (&gt;25% decrease in serum&#xD;
      IgM) observed. Three other patients remain with stable disease. Therapy was generally well&#xD;
      tolerated with greater than grade II adverse events as follows: neuropathy (n=3; 20%);&#xD;
      neutropenia (n=3; 20%); thrombocytopenia (n=1; 7%); and rash (n=1; 7%). Adverse events were&#xD;
      generally reversible and returned to baseline after holding or dose modifying the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bortezomib (velcade) in combination with Rituximab have been shown to act synergistically in&#xD;
      in vitro and in vivo models. Bortezomib plus Rituximab in combination have been used in a&#xD;
      phase 2 clinical study for previously treated patients with indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;
      Patients received either Bortezomib 1,3mg/m2 on d1,4,8,11 q21 days (Group A), or Bortezomib&#xD;
      1,6mg/m2 weekly on d1,8,15,22 q35 days (Group B). Rituximab 375mg/m2 was administered weekly&#xD;
      for 4 weeks in all patients. Response rated were similar in groups A and B, but patients in&#xD;
      Group B (weekly bortezomib at increased dose) experienced less toxicity. Furthermore,&#xD;
      glucocorticoids acte synergistically with Rituximab in inducing apoptosis against various&#xD;
      malignant NHL B cell lines. A single dose of dexamethasone administered immediately before&#xD;
      rituximab was adequate for this synergistic effect. Furthermore, we have tested this sequence&#xD;
      in vivo in the context of a prospective trial of dexamethasone, rituximab and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide for previously untreated patients with WM. This combination induced&#xD;
      responses in 74% of patients. Based on the above we investigate a combination of bortezomib,&#xD;
      dexamethasone and rituximab (BDR) as primary treatment for patients with WM. The following&#xD;
      points are of importance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Only patients who have an indication for treatment will be included and will exclude&#xD;
      asymptomatic patients. This is one of few multicenter trials designed specifically for WM&#xD;
      patients who have a predefined indication for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) By avoiding any stem cell toxic agent, we believe that we will be able to collect adequate&#xD;
      number of blood stem cells from our patients≤70 years of age. These stem cells could be used&#xD;
      to support high dose therapy at the time of relapse after BDR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Our previous experience with single agent bortezomib indicates a median time to response&#xD;
      of one month. Thus, by starting treatment with bortezomib alone, we believe that we will&#xD;
      abrogate the &quot;IgM flare&quot; phenomenon that occurs in almost 50% of patients receiving&#xD;
      single-agent rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D) We will limit the use of dexamethasone to one dose (40mg) just before the administration&#xD;
      of rituximab based on in vitro data. In contrast to multiple myeloma, there is no evidence&#xD;
      that dexamethasone is essential for the treatment of WM. Furthermore repetitive&#xD;
      administration of dexamethasone may be associated with increased risk for opportunistic&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E) We plan to administer no more than 5 cycles of bortezomib in order to avoid the increased&#xD;
      incidence of neuropathy which usually occurs with more exposure to bortezomib. Subsequently&#xD;
      the patients will be followed with no treatment until there is evidence of progressive&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
