    <textblock>
      This is a single-center open label study of the IL-1 transfusion protein rilonacept in&#xD;
      subjects with Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), or Schnitzler syndrome (SchS) in Germany.&#xD;
      Prospective subjects will be recruited from a patient population previously characterized in&#xD;
      an observational study, and from referrals within the German CAPS community; SchS subjects&#xD;
      will be recruited through the Charité Patient pool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Baseline phase will begin with the Screening visit (day -21 = Visit 1) and continue for&#xD;
      three weeks; DHAFs (Daily Health Assessment Forms) will be collected from all subjects from&#xD;
      Day - 21 to Day 0. DHAF information including MWAS (Muckle-Wells Activity Score), or SCHAS&#xD;
      (Schnitzler Activity Score) values from this period will be used for the baseline phase&#xD;
      evaluation. Inclusion to receive rilonacept will occur on day 0 (= Visit 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 0 eligible subjects will receive a loading dose of two subcutaneous (S.C.) injections&#xD;
      of rilonacept for a total of 320 mg. Subsequent study drug injections of rilonacept 160 mg&#xD;
      will be administered once a week for four weeks. After subjects complete this initial 4-week&#xD;
      treatment phase, they will be eligible to receive rilonacept 160 mg once weekly for 48 weeks&#xD;
      during the extended treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DHAFs will be used to assess symptoms throughout the study. Overall a max. of 12 subjects&#xD;
      with either MWS or SchS will be enrolled.&#xD;
