  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 4-year study will investigate the effectiveness of methylphenidate for initiating and&#xD;
      sustaining abstinence in methamphetamine dependent individuals. Approximately 90 participants&#xD;
      seeking treatment for methamphetamine dependence will be enrolled in the study for an initial&#xD;
      2 weeks to establish clinic compliance. During this compliance phase, participants will&#xD;
      receive incentives for clinic attendance. After meeting clinic attendance requirements,&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to placebo (n = 45) or active study medication (n = 45)&#xD;
      conditions, and given 18mg/daily of study drug or placebo for one week, followed by&#xD;
      36mg/daily study drug/placebo for a second week. Finally, participants will be stabilized on&#xD;
      54mg/daily study drug/placebo for the remainder of the study. Placebo participants will be&#xD;
      given placebo medications prepared to appear identical to the active medication. In addition,&#xD;
      after randomization, all participants will receive motivational incentives for&#xD;
      methamphetamine-negative urine tests and begin weekly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      provided for the duration of the study.&#xD;
