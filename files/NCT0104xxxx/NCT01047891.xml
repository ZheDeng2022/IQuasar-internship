    <textblock>
      It is assumed, that the patients of the standard arm show a median progression-free survival&#xD;
      time of 4.4 months those of the experimental arm of at least 6.9 months. Assuming a&#xD;
      recruitment period of 18 months and follow-up for at least 12 months a total sample size of&#xD;
      174 patients is required (two-sided, α=0.05, 80% power). To account for 5% drop-outs 184&#xD;
      patients will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Data Monitoring and Safety Board (DMSB) will be established. This board will evaluate the&#xD;
      safety profile of the drug combination after 6 patients and after 12 patients have received 1&#xD;
      cycle of treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer continues to be a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women and is the&#xD;
      leading cause of deaths attributed to gynecologic malignancies. Because ovarian cancer is&#xD;
      usually asymptomatic in its early stages, the disease often has spread outside of the pelvic&#xD;
      region at the time of diagnosis and requires debulking surgery followed by systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapy. First-line chemotherapy involves platinum-based treatments, including the&#xD;
      widely adopted regimens of cisplatin/paclitaxel, carboplatin/paclitaxel, and single-agent&#xD;
      carboplatin. Although these regimens yield relatively satisfactory tumor response rates, the&#xD;
      majority of patients experience disease recurrence and receive additional treatments. For&#xD;
      such patients, a number of antitumor agents with novel mechanisms of action (topotecan,&#xD;
      gemcitabine, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, docetaxel, etoposide) have been applied, in&#xD;
      addition to retreatment with platinum, with the goal of re-establishing remission or disease&#xD;
      control, minimizing disease-related symptoms, improving quality of life, and extending&#xD;
      patient survival. Of these agents, topotecan (Hycamtin®; GlaxoSmithKline) is one of the&#xD;
      best-characterized agents in the recurrent setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topotecan is an S-phase 1-dependent cytotoxic agent that targets the topoisomerase I enzyme&#xD;
      and exhibits broad activity in solid tumors and is approved for the treatment of recurrent&#xD;
      ovarian cancer in US and in most western countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from preclinical and clinical studies reported in the last 2 years demonstrate the&#xD;
      importance of several proangiogenic factors in the tumorigenesis and prognosis of ovarian&#xD;
      cancer, suggesting possible new targets for antiangiogenic therapy. Once-daily oral treatment&#xD;
      with Sorafenib produces broad spectrum antitumor efficacy in preclinical tumor models&#xD;
      including also xenograft models of ovarian carcinoma. Preliminary antitumor activity has been&#xD;
      reported in single ovarian cancer patients in several phase I and phase II studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most promising strategy in the therapy of advanced and recurrent ovarian cancer seems to be&#xD;
      the combination of cytotoxic agents and targeted therapies. Furthermore an oral therapy to&#xD;
      achieve and maintain long term tumor control seems to be very attractive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore Sorafenib and Topotecan would make a rational therapeutic strategy for combination&#xD;
      in recurrent ovarian cancer.&#xD;
