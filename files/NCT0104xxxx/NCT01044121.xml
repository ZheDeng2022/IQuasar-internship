  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary study objective is to determine whether mattress firmness affects pain in&#xD;
      patients with chronic low-back pain. We hypothesize that mattresses that differ in their&#xD;
      firmness and support should have a varying effect on low-back pain patients' level of pain&#xD;
      and pain-related disability. We also seek to test the hypothesis that the optimal mattress&#xD;
      might vary from person to person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard, we will test:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Whether there is a single mattress that is superior to the others in terms of reducing&#xD;
           low-back pain and pain related disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Whether the optimal mattress for reducing pain varies in the observed population.&#xD;

      Few treatments are effective for chronic low-back pain, a disorder that causes marked social&#xD;
      costs in developed countries. A &quot;comfortable&quot; mattress is commonly assumed to play an&#xD;
      essential role, both on a preventive and on a therapeutic basis on chronic low-back pain.&#xD;
      However, evidence supporting the beneficial effects of different levels of mattress support&#xD;
      on pain is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study objective is to determine whether mattress firmness affects pain in&#xD;
      patients with chronic low-back pain. We hypothesize that mattresses that differ in their&#xD;
      firmness and support should have a varying effects on LBP patients' level of pain and&#xD;
      pain-related disability. We also seek to test the hypothesis that the optimal mattress might&#xD;
      vary from person to person. In this regard, we will test:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. whether there is a single mattress that is superior to the others in terms of reducing&#xD;
           low-back pain and pain-related disability and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. whether the optimal mattress for reducing pain varies in the observed population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine whether there is a relationship between mattress firmness and sleep in this&#xD;
           population;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine whether there is a relationship between pain and sleep in this population;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to determine whether key sleep variables (subjective or objective) are mediating or&#xD;
           moderating factors of the relationship between mattress and level of low-back pain (LBP)&#xD;
           and disability;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to determine if different sleep surfaces have differential effects on measures of daily&#xD;
           function among patients with chronic LBP;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. to evaluate if Kingsdown's proprietary algorithm for selecting optimal mattress &quot;fits&quot;&#xD;
           with the subject's best mattress for reducing pain and improving sleep and measures of&#xD;
           daytime functioning;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. to conduct exploratory regression analyses using variables included in the proprietary&#xD;
           algorithm and other demographics and measures of physical characteristics to predict the&#xD;
           optimal &quot;fit&quot; mattress (i.e., the mattress associated with lowest morning pain ratings,&#xD;
           best sleep measures and optimal levels of daytime function);&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. to determine if different sleep surfaces have differential effects on measures of&#xD;
           partner sleep disturbance;&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. to determine if there is a relationship between partner pain level and partner sleep&#xD;
           disturbances.&#xD;
