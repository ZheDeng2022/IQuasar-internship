  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An influenza pandemic has recently been declared, involving the novel A(H1N1) 'swine flu'&#xD;
      virus. This has spread to almost 100 countries worldwide in less than two months, causing&#xD;
      widespread disease so far in Mexico, USA and Canada. It is highly likely that over the next&#xD;
      12 months, many countries including the UK will be affected by widespread illness. In the UK&#xD;
      this wave of intense flu activity is most likely to occur in late autumn 2009.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very little is known about the new H1N1 pandemic virus. For example we do not know how long&#xD;
      the virus is excreted by infected humans and how much virus is spread to surfaces and carried&#xD;
      in the air. This is very important to know as soon as possible because it affects the advice&#xD;
      that will be given to healthcare workers about controlling the spread of infection to&#xD;
      themselves and other patients. Similarly we need this information so we can give good quality&#xD;
      advice to families who will have to look after each other in their own homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The best way to obtain this information is to ask patients who get pandemic flu soon (in&#xD;
      August, September and October) to help us by agreeing to give a daily nose swab sample for&#xD;
      just over one week so we can see how much virus is in the nose day by day and how quickly&#xD;
      this disappears. At the same time we will take samples from hard surfaces in a patient's room&#xD;
      or home and sample the air using a special filter device. We can then work out how much virus&#xD;
      is being excreted, how long the 'danger period' is, whether surfaces are more or less&#xD;
      important than the air that we breathe (in terms of catching the virus) and if we can advise&#xD;
      on a 'safe distance' from the patient, beyond which there is relatively little chance of&#xD;
      catching the illness.&#xD;
