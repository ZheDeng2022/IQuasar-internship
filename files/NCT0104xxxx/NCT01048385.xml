  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of our research is to increase live birth rates in infertile women and to reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of aneuploidy leading to miscarriage and trisomies. We hypothesize that an age&#xD;
      related mitochondrial dysfunction reduces the availability of energy in the oocyte and&#xD;
      contributes to abnormal segregation of chromosomes during the meiotic division leading to&#xD;
      oocyte aneuploidy. Based on preliminary evidence we have obtained in aged mice, we propose&#xD;
      that dietary supplementation with Co enzyme Q10 in older women will improve mitochondrial&#xD;
      function in the oocytes, leading to a decrease in chromosomal non-disjunction and resulting&#xD;
      in embryos with a normal chromosomal complement. Our primary outcome measure will be&#xD;
      determination of oocyte chromosome number by multiplex PCR based assay of polar bodies&#xD;
      biopsied at the time of IVF. Outcomes of this proposal will enable us to address the&#xD;
      mechanisms of ovarian aging and may explain etiology of decreased fertility in older&#xD;
      patients. In addition, our work will add to the feasibility of single embryo transfer,&#xD;
      thereby avoiding multiple pregnancies and their associated cost to the health care system and&#xD;
      to society.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of CoQ10 administration with respect&#xD;
      to its effect on the rate of aneuploidy of oocytes and cumulative live birth rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is a prospective randomized placebo controlled study. Study participants&#xD;
      will undergo up to 3 cycles as part of this protocol. All clinical assessments will be&#xD;
      conducted at the participating infertility clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be organized on an outpatient basis at the Toronto Centre for Advanced&#xD;
      Reproductive Technology (TCART). The study will involve 54 women aged 35-43 years undergoing&#xD;
      IVF treatment. All women will collect 2 mL of saliva in a 5 mL polyethylene tube for baseline&#xD;
      measurement of coQ10 activity by arNOX assay (described below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be randomly assigned to either placebo or COQ10 capsules, (AOR -&#xD;
      Advanced Orthomolecular Research Inc. 19 St NE Calgary, Alberta, NHPD registration codes&#xD;
      135307). Study participants will take 600 mg of CoQ10 orally once a day with breakfast or&#xD;
      identical placebo capsules for 2 months prior to an IVF cycle and up to 3 cycles if pregnancy&#xD;
      does not occur. On cycle day 3, subjects will start the ovarian stimulation for in vitro&#xD;
      fertilization while continuing the consumption of the supplements. The controlled ovarian&#xD;
      stimulation (COH) will consist of the microdose GnRH agonist flare protocol, which is the&#xD;
      clinic's standard protocol for older women. COH will be done using recombinant FSH (Puregon;&#xD;
      Schering-Plough Inc.,Mississauga, ON, Canada) or human menopausal gonadotropins (Menopur,&#xD;
      Ferring Inc, Oakville, ON, Canada) 150 units twice daily S.C. and Buserelin Acetate (&#xD;
      Superfact, Sanofi-Aventis Canada Inc, Laval, Quebec) 0.05 mg subcutaneously B.I.D, and will&#xD;
      continue until the day prior to 10,000 units human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (Pregnyl,&#xD;
      Organon). The dosage will not be changed and must be maintained for the duration of the&#xD;
      study. Both drugs will continue daily until follicular development is considered adequate (at&#xD;
      least 3 follicles &gt;17 mm, and the E2 level is acceptable for the number of follicles present)&#xD;
      at which time the hCG will be injected to trigger final follicular maturation. Oocyte&#xD;
      retrieval will be done 36 hours later by vaginal ultrasound guided needle aspiration and with&#xD;
      the use of local anesthesia and mild sedation. At the time of retrieval, subjects will&#xD;
      collect 2 mL of saliva, in addition, 2 mL of follicular fluid will be collected from the&#xD;
      first follicle aspirated from each ovary for determination of coQ10 activity by arNOX assay.&#xD;
      AS it is not possible to measure CoQ10 levels in a single cells (e.g. oocytes), FF represents&#xD;
      direct cellular environment that can reflect the metabolical profile of this cell. After&#xD;
      retrieval, the oocytes will be fertilized with ICSI in order not to contaminate the maternal&#xD;
      DNA during polar body biopsy sample with sperm DNA. On the following day, all the oocytes&#xD;
      with 2 pronuclei will undergo a biopsy of one or both polar bodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polar body biopsy The oocyte is then inseminated using the intracytoplasmic sperm injection&#xD;
      (ICSI) technique and is kept in culture in an incubator. In order to biopsy the polar body,&#xD;
      the oocyte is held by the holding pipette with the polar body at the 11-12 o'clock position.&#xD;
      An opening is made in the zona pellucida and a polished glass needle is introduced into the&#xD;
      perivitelline space and the polar body is carefully removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The embryo transfer is performed on the morning of the third day after egg retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polar bodies are washed in droplets of isotonic HEPES-buffered saline and then transferred to&#xD;
      hypotonic solution, fixed in methanol: acetic acid on a glass slide, and dehydrated in&#xD;
      methanol for further genetic analysis. The whole procedure does not adversely affect either&#xD;
      fertilization or cleavage rates in biopsied oocytes, as the polar body is not involved in the&#xD;
      above processes.Karyotyping:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The polar bodies will be transferred to the UHN microarray center for chromosome number&#xD;
      determination. The analysis will be done with a commercial kit from Advalytix ( Olympus Life&#xD;
      Science Research, Munich, Germany). This is a multiplex PCR based kit that provides a fast&#xD;
      and accurate count of all 23 chromosomes and is tailored to polar body chromosome count.&#xD;
      After 2 days a single embryo with a normal karyotype will be transferred to the uterine&#xD;
      cavity under ultrasound guidance using a Cook transfer catheter (Cook, Sidney, Australia).&#xD;
      The rest of the viable embryos with a normal karyotype will be frozen (Slow freezing). Luteal&#xD;
      support will consist of progesterone suppositories 100mg (Kingsway Pharmacy,Toronto, Ontario&#xD;
      Canada) vaginally 3 times a day starting on the day of transfer and will continue for 2 weeks&#xD;
      until the end of each cycle when serum beta hCG will be drawn and if pregnant, CoQ10/ placebo&#xD;
      will be discontinued. If pregnant, luteal support will continue until 10 weeks gestation. If&#xD;
      the patient is not pregnant she will have a cycle of endometrial stimulation with micronized&#xD;
      estradiol, followed by progesterone once a sufficient endometrial thickness has been&#xD;
      measured. Four days afterwards, 1-2 embryos will be thawed and transferred. Luteal support&#xD;
      will include estradiol and progesterone which will be maintained up to 10 weeks if pregnant.&#xD;
      These cycles of frozen embryo transfer will be continued as long as there are frozen embryos&#xD;
      from the same retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study endpoints will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary outcome measure will be the number and percentage of euploid eggs per retrieval&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary outcome measures will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ovarian response&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Embryo quality&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cumulative pregnancy rate / retrieval&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cumulative live birth rate / retrieval&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CoQ10 activity in saliva and follicular fluid by arNOX assay&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coenzyme Q10 assay arNOX is a coenzyme Q10-inhibited, aging-related external NADH oxidase&#xD;
      (ECTO-NOX) protein of the cell surface that is also present in sera and saliva. It is capable&#xD;
      of superoxide generation measured as superoxide dismutase-inhibited reduction of&#xD;
      ferricytochrome c (Oxidaised cytochrome C). arNOX activity of saliva of older individuals is&#xD;
      inhibited by coenzyme Q10. The activity first appears after age 30 to a near maximum at about&#xD;
      age 55.&#xD;
&#xD;
      arNOX activity is assayed from measurements of superoxide production based on the standard&#xD;
      method where reduction of ferricytochrome c by superoxide is monitored from the increase in&#xD;
      absorbance at 550 nm with reference at 540 nm. As a further check for the specificity of the&#xD;
      arNOX activity, superoxide dismutase (SOD) is added near the end of the assay to ascertain&#xD;
      that the rate returned to base line. The assay consists of 150 μl (2 mg/ml) oxidized&#xD;
      ferricytochrome c solution and 200 μl of saliva added to 2.5 ml assay buffer (8.06 g NaC1,&#xD;
      0.2 g KC1, 0.18 g Na 2HPO4, 0.26 g KH2PO4, 0.13 g CaCl2, 0.1 g MgCl2, 1.35 g glucose&#xD;
      dissolved in 1000 ml deionized water, adjusted to pH 7.4, filtered and stored at 4◦C). Rates&#xD;
      are determined using a spectrophotometer in the dual wavelength mode with continuous&#xD;
      measurements (over 1 min every 1.5 min). After 45 min, 60 μl (containing 60 units) SOD is&#xD;
      added and the assay is continued for an additional 45 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Salivary arNOX was found to be a convenient and non-invasive method to monitor arNOX levels&#xD;
      in clinical coenzyme Q10 intervention trials with the response levels paralleling those seen&#xD;
      with serum and cellular arNOX (Morre and Morre 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 54 female patients desiring pregnancy will be enrolled in this study at TCART-&#xD;
      Toronto Center for Advanced Reproductive Technology. Each subject must meet study inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 54 patients will enter this two treatment parallel-design study. The probability&#xD;
      is 90 percent that the study will detect a treatment difference at a two sided with p-value ≤&#xD;
      0.01, if the true difference between the treatments in aneuploidy rate is 25 %. This is based&#xD;
      on the assumption that the standard deviation of the response variable is 0.180.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assignment to treatment and randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned in chronological order on the day of study enrollment to a computer&#xD;
      generated randomization. Each enrolled participant will receive a pre-assigned package&#xD;
      containing either placebo or CoQ10 for the duration of the study. The physician will be&#xD;
      blinded as to assignment of the patients. Randomization will be done prior to starting the&#xD;
      first cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will keep a separate record relating the names of the subjects to their&#xD;
      code numbers, to allow easy checking of data in subject files when required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be done with student t-test to camper between the treatment and&#xD;
      placebo group for all the outcome measures. Power analysis was calculated for alpha &lt; 0.01.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated outcomes and potential pitfalls. The number of patients needed for the study is&#xD;
      reasonable and we do not expect it to be an obstacle. If the results in this study will be to&#xD;
      the animal study we should be able to show a significant difference in the number of euploid&#xD;
      embryos between the test and control groups, as well as with the other outcome parameters. We&#xD;
      have been working for several months with the UHN microarray lab to optimize the use of the&#xD;
      Advalytics multiplex PCR kit which currently works very well. We do not expect any problems&#xD;
      with this component of the object.&#xD;
