      The purpose of the study is to assess and compare the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      allogeneic-unrelated umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cell product (Cartistem®)&#xD;
      to that of a microfracture treatment in patients with articular cartilage defect or injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cartilage is a unique avascular, aneural tissue that does not regenerate easily once&#xD;
      damaged. Chondral defects or damages to articular cartilages due to accidents, necrosis of&#xD;
      subchondral bone tissue, or arthritis have become some of the more common disorders today.&#xD;
      About 15% of the world's population is reportedly suffering from cartilage and joint damages&#xD;
      such as degenerative arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. As population aging progresses and&#xD;
      as more young people start taking up active sports, the size of the target patient group is&#xD;
      also growing. However, despite ongoing research, an effective treatment for cartilage defects&#xD;
      is yet to be discovered. Various different types of treatments are currently in use, such as&#xD;
      drug therapy, arthroscopy, and artificial joint surgery. However, they all fail to address&#xD;
      the root cause. Complete treatment, or regeneration of damaged or defective cartilage is&#xD;
      impossible and continuous drug administration or secondary surgeries are required in many&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a way of regenerating the damaged or defective cartilage tissue, treatment of localized&#xD;
      damage to articular cartilage using autologous chondrocytes is currently under review. A few&#xD;
      life science companies both home and abroad are marketing this method of treatment called&#xD;
      'autologous chondrocyte transplant'. The treatment involves the extraction of healthy&#xD;
      cartilage tissue from the patient which is then cultured and transplanted into the damaged&#xD;
      site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, this treatment requires the extraction of chondrocytes directly from the patient and&#xD;
      thus causes trauma in healthy articular cartilage. Also, this type of treatment cannot be&#xD;
      applied to large lesions, nor is the efficacy satisfactory in patients over the age of 40&#xD;
      whose cellular activation levels are low. Thus, autologous chondrocyte transplant is rather&#xD;
      limited in the number of cells harvested and their activation level and is therefore&#xD;
      restricted in terms of treatment site, severity of the condition, and the size of lesion. The&#xD;
      current technology allows the application of treatments in local cartilage defects but not in&#xD;
      degenerative arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. The technology needs to be taken up to&#xD;
      another level in order to benefit such prevalent arthritic disorders. Treatments using stem&#xD;
      cells do not cause damage to healthy articular cartilage as they don't require the harvesting&#xD;
      of healthy cartilage tissues from the patients. Moreover, the number of successfully cultured&#xD;
      cells is larger due to the excellent proliferation capability of stem cells and thus, mass&#xD;
      supply is possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial for the stem cell therapies is essential because treatment of cartilage&#xD;
      defects with umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells, known to have the highest&#xD;
      level of activity among all adult stem cells, opens the possibility of articular cartilage&#xD;
      regeneration even for aged patients and patients with large lesions unable to benefit from&#xD;
      existing treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biggest challenge faced by nations competing in the field of &quot;tissue differentiation and&#xD;
      regeneration using stem cells&quot; is the question of whether or not the use of embryonic stem&#xD;
      cells is ethical. Chondrogenesis using umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells&#xD;
      can not only avoid similar challenges, but also present an innovative treatment mode with&#xD;
      significant clinical implications for the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the clinical study, mesenchymal stem cells will be isolated from umbilical cord blood and&#xD;
      cultured, mixed with semi- solid polymer, and administered into the cartilage tissue lesion&#xD;
      by orthopedic surgery in order to stimulate the regeneration of defective cartilage tissue&#xD;
      and to improve their functions.&#xD;
