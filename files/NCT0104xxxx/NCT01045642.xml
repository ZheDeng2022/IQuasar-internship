      All study related procedures, restrictions, duration, dates and timings, information on the&#xD;
      study formulation and confidentiality of subject data were explained clearly to the&#xD;
      volunteers by clinical personnel at the time of obtaining informed consent. Volunteers who&#xD;
      signed the consent form and showed&quot;their willingness to participate in the study were&#xD;
      enrolled. Volunteers who satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria and found to be&#xD;
      healthy on physical examination with laboratory investigation values within reference limits&#xD;
      were considered eligible to be admitted into the study.&#xD;
