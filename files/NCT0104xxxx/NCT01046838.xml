      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is characterized by regional myocardial damage which may&#xD;
      lead to systolic and diastolic dysfunction with a subsequent risk of left ventricular (LV)&#xD;
      remodeling, local and systemic neurohormonal activation, vascular dysfunction and development&#xD;
      of heart failure. The pathophysiology and prognosis of LV systolic dysfunction after AMI has&#xD;
      been the focus of research for several decades. Insights from these studies have led to&#xD;
      several therapeutic interventions that improve outcome. In addition to depressed systolic&#xD;
      function, clinical or radiographic evidence of heart failure is a consistent and powerful&#xD;
      predictor of outcome in patients following AMI. Pulmonary congestion after AMI reflects&#xD;
      raised LV filling pressures but is frequently seen after what appears to be only minor&#xD;
      myocardial damage. The pathophysiological mechanism for this is incompletely understood but&#xD;
      may involve impaired active relaxation of the myocardium and increased LV chamber stiffness,&#xD;
      hence, abnormalities in diastolic function. Abnormal LV diastolic function especially when&#xD;
      chamber stiffness is increased is characterized by a disproportionate increase in filling&#xD;
      pressure during exercise and an inadequate increase of cardiac output. During ventricular&#xD;
      diastole the left atrium acts as a conduit between the left ventricle and the pulmonary&#xD;
      veins. Thus in case of increased filling pressures left atrial pressure is elevated exposing&#xD;
      the pulmonary vascular bed to increased pressures. In accordance pulmonary artery pressure is&#xD;
      frequently increased after AMI, even when systolic function is preserved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several recent studies have demonstrated that Doppler echocardiographic indices suggestive of&#xD;
      increased filling pressure and increased pulmonary arterial pressure are associated with&#xD;
      excess mortality and morbidity after AMI . The optimal management of this large group of&#xD;
      patients is unknown, but in theory lowered preload improved cardiac output especially during&#xD;
      exercise and lowering of pulmonary arterial pressure could relive symptoms and improve&#xD;
      exercise capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sildenafil is a potent selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor that suppresses degradation of&#xD;
      cyclic GMP. In the pulmonary bed this leads to pulmonary vasodilation, in addition sildenafil&#xD;
      has been shown to improve endothelium dependent vasodilation thus augmenting abnormal&#xD;
      vascular tone . In patients with systolic heart failure sildenafil has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      lower pulmonary wedge pressure, improve cardiac index and lower pulmonary arterial pressure&#xD;
      without causing systemic hypotension . Thus in theory sildenafil may have beneficial effects&#xD;
      in patients at high risk of heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with Doppler echocardiographic signs of elevated LV filling pressures despite&#xD;
      preserved LV systolic function after AMI treatment with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor&#xD;
      sildenafil 40 mg three times daily for 9 weeks will compared with placebo&#xD;

      Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      In possibly eligible patients a screening echocardiography is performed during&#xD;
      hospitalization at the coronary care unit 2144 or 3141 HS Rigshospitalet, Denmark. If&#xD;
      eligible and consent is obtained during hospitalisation an ambulatory exercise Doppler&#xD;
      echocardiography with simultaneous invasive recording of pulmonary wedge pressure, pulmonary&#xD;
      artery pressure and cardiac index and a 6 min walk test and maximal exercise test is&#xD;
      performed 1 week after revascularization. Patients are then randomized in a 1 to 1 fashion to&#xD;
      placebo or sildenafil 20 mg three times daily. If tolerated dosage is titrated every 2'nd&#xD;
      week in the outpatient clinic to a target dose of 40 mg three times daily. After 9 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment exercise echocardiography and 6 min walk test are repeated, in addition&#xD;
      conventional maximal ergometer testing is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening echocardiography 2 dimensional echocardiographic will be obtained from the&#xD;
      parasternal and apical windows. Pulsed Doppler measurements of mitral inflow will be obtained&#xD;
      with the transducer in the apical four-chamber view, with a 1-2 mm Doppler sample volume&#xD;
      placed between the tips of mitral leaflets during diastole. Tissue Doppler imagining of the&#xD;
      mitral annulus will be obtained from the apical 4-chamber view with a 1.5-mm sample volume&#xD;
      placed at the medial mitral annulus. All Doppler echocardiographic examinations are done with&#xD;
      horizontal sweep set to 100 mm/s. At least 3-5 cardiac cycles will be measured. LA volume&#xD;
      will be obtained from the apical 4 and 2 chamber views with a zoomed image of the left&#xD;
      atrium. Clinically indicted echocardiograms performed in the echolab may be used as screening&#xD;
      echocardiograms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wall motion index will semiquantitatively using a descending scoring as previously&#xD;
           validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximal left atrial volume will be measured at end-systole with the use of two&#xD;
           orthogonal apical views.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From the pulsed wave mitral inflow signal, peak E wave velocity will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From the tissue Doppler assessment of the medial mitral annulus early (E') diastolic&#xD;
           velocity will be recorded. Diastolic E/e' ratio will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting echocardiography Doppler echocardiography will be performed on a GE medical Vivid 7&#xD;
      ultrasound machine by a single investigator. Images will be obtained from the parasternal and&#xD;
      apical windows. M-mode recordings will be done in the parasternal long-axis view. Pulsed&#xD;
      Doppler measurements of mitral inflow will be obtained with the transducer in the apical&#xD;
      four-chamber view, with a 1-2 mm Doppler sample volume placed between the tips of mitral&#xD;
      leaflets during diastole. Tissue Doppler imagining of the mitral annulus will be obtained&#xD;
      from the apical 4-chamber view with a 1.5-mm sample volume placed at the medial and lateral&#xD;
      mitral annulus. All Doppler echocardiographic examinations are done with horizontal sweep set&#xD;
      to 100 mm/s. At least 3-5 cardiac cycles will be measured. Finally color coded real time&#xD;
      tissue Doppler images will be acquired in the apical windows, with the lowest possible depth&#xD;
      and smallest angle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End-systolic, end-diastolic volume and ejection fraction will be calculated according to&#xD;
           the Simpson modified biplane method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wall motion index will semiquantitatively be assessed according to the recommendations&#xD;
           of the American Society of Echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximal left atrial volume will be measured at end-systole with the use of two&#xD;
           orthogonal apical views with zoom of the left atrium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From the pulsed wave mitral inflow signal, peak E wave velocity, peak A wave velocity,&#xD;
           and mitral E-wave deceleration time will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From peak tricuspid regurgitant velocity and size of inferior v. cava pulmonary arterial&#xD;
           systolic pressure will be estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From the tissue Doppler assessment of the medial mitral annulus early (E') diastolic&#xD;
           velocity will be recorded. Diastolic E/e' ratio will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From color coded tissue Doppler images systolic longitudinal fibre shortening will be&#xD;
           assessed using tissue tracking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From 2dimensional images speckle tracing will be performed to assess radial and&#xD;
           longitudinal LV function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise echocardiography Exercise echocardiography is performed at cardiac intensive care&#xD;
      unit 2143. Before exercise a Swan Ganz catheter is introduced with a seldinger technique&#xD;
      through the right jugular vein. Simultaneous with resting echocardiography pulmonary artery&#xD;
      pressure, left atrial pressure, cardiac index and pulmonary wedge pressure is recorded.&#xD;
      Patients are then exercised on a supine bicycle with increasing workload to 100W with&#xD;
      increments of 25W every 2'nd min. At 100W echocardiography is repeated with simultaneous&#xD;
      assessment of pulmonary artery pressure, left atrial pressure, pulmonary wedge pressure and&#xD;
      cardiac index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurohormonal analyses Prior to surgery and at each follow-up visit venous blood samples will&#xD;
      be drawn for analysis of plasma N-terminal proBNP, and of plasma N-terminal ANP&#xD;
      concentrations. In addition plasma will be frozen at each visit for possible later analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six minutes walk test A 6 min. walk test will be performed at baseline 9 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise test A conventional bicycle ergometer test is performed at hospital discharge and&#xD;
      after 4 months. Maximal exercise is achieved by increments on 25W every 2'nd min. with&#xD;
      continuous ECG recording and assessment of blood pressure every 2'nd min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility and sample size estimation From a recent study at a tertiary invasive centre&#xD;
      including 380 patients with AMI, (Aberdeen AMI study, Hillis et al ESC 2006), it was found&#xD;
      that among 219 patients EF was &gt;45%. Among those patients E/e' &gt;15 was found in 41 patients,&#xD;
      and in further 48 E/e' 8-15 and left atrial volume index &gt;32 ml/m2 was found. Thus 40% of&#xD;
      patients with LVEF&gt;45% would be potentially eligible. Annually 2500 patients are admitted or&#xD;
      transferred to RH with AMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a standard deviation of E/e' of 5 (estimated from potentially eligible patients from&#xD;
      the Aberdeen AMI study), an alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.80 a sample of 70 patients will allow&#xD;
      detection of a difference in E/e' of 3.6. Sample size estimation is performed according to&#xD;
      Altmann using nomogram.&#xD;
