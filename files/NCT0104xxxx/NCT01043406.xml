      The purpose of this prospective, single-arm, unblinded, multicenter clinical study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the NeuroVista Seizure Advisory System (SAS) in&#xD;
      patients with medically refractory epilepsy. A total of 15 subjects will be implanted at up&#xD;
      to three study sites.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This research project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the SAS based on how well it&#xD;
      provides subjects with signals (or &quot;advisories&quot;) that they can see and hear to predict their&#xD;
      &quot;likelihood&quot; of having a seizure. It does this by monitoring signals in the brain. A&#xD;
      secondary purpose of the study is to learn whether the advisories improve subject quality of&#xD;
      life or that of their caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SAS is made up of three main components that work together to monitor the subject's brain&#xD;
      signals and then relay their information to the subject: the leads, the implantable telemetry&#xD;
      unit (ITU), and the personal advisory device (PAD). The leads will be placed on different&#xD;
      areas of the subject's brain to record electrical signals. The leads are tunneled down the&#xD;
      neck to an ITU that is implanted in the chest, similar to a pacemaker. The ITU wirelessly&#xD;
      transmits information to the PAD, which is carried like a pager. It records and processes&#xD;
      brain signals and may be able to advise subjects when a seizure is likely or unlikely to&#xD;
      occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following implantation with the SAS, subjects will return for five study visits for&#xD;
      neurological examinations and quality of life assessments. Throughout the study, subjects&#xD;
      must maintain their SAS; which includes daily recharging and data card replacement.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has disabling partial seizures and/or secondarily generalized partial&#xD;
             seizures. Disabling refers to seizures that are severe enough to cause injuries or to&#xD;
             significantly impair areas of function such as employment, psychological or social&#xD;
             wellbeing, or mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has failed treatment with a minimum of two AED's used in typical therapeutic&#xD;
             dosages.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. For three months prior to enrollment, subject's anti-epileptic medication dosages have&#xD;
             been stable and subject has had at least two disabling seizures per month, on average,&#xD;
             with a seizure-free interval not to exceed 45 days. Seizures must be separated by a&#xD;
             minimum of eight hours not to be considered part of a cluster. A cluster, for the&#xD;
             purpose of this criterion, shall be considered a single seizure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. For three months prior to enrollment, subject's anti-epileptic medication dosages have&#xD;
             not been stable, or subject has had more than 12 disabling seizures per month, on&#xD;
             average, or there was a seizure-free interval longer than 45 days. Clinical seizures&#xD;
             must be separated by a minimum of eight hours to not be considered part of a cluster.&#xD;
             A cluster, for the purpose of this criterion, shall be considered a single seizure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject is implanted with pacemaker, implantable cardiac defibrillator, cardiac&#xD;
             management product, or a medical device that interferes with the SAS or with which the&#xD;
             SAS interferes. This includes, but is not limited to, direct brain neurostimulators,&#xD;
             spinal cord stimulators, vagus nerve stimulators (VNS), and cochlear implants.&#xD;
             Patients with a vagus nerve stimulator implanted but turned off through the duration&#xD;
             of the study may be enrolled, provided their clinical status has been stable for at&#xD;
             least one month with VNS turned off.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has been diagnosed with primary generalized seizures.&#xD;
