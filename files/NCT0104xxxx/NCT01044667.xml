  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and health&#xD;
      related quality of life in lung transplant recipients converted from Mycophenolate Mofetil&#xD;
      (MMF) to Myfortic as part of standard immunosuppressive therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects administered MMF as part of their immunosuppression regimen after lung&#xD;
      transplantation have a high incidence of GI symptoms related to the known side-effects of&#xD;
      this drug. Previous studies have shown that GI symptoms are an important predictor of health&#xD;
      related quality of life in other solid organ transplants (1). GI complications are common&#xD;
      after lung transplant (2). We hypothesize that lung transplant patients converted from MMF to&#xD;
      Myfortic will have significant reduction in severity of GI complaints. We also hypothesize&#xD;
      that improvement in the severity of GI complaints will lead to an improved quality of life in&#xD;
      these subjects. The study also includes data to evaluate the effect of GI complaints on&#xD;
      health related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will complete questionnaires at each visit. Calls from the patients to the lung&#xD;
      transplant center with GI complaints will be queried and documented on the case report form&#xD;
      by the research nurse at each study visit. Similarly, hospital admissions for GI related&#xD;
      complaints in the cohort will be documented. Symptom severity and health related quality of&#xD;
      life will be assessed through the following questionnaires that have previously been&#xD;
      validated in populations other than lung transplant (1). These questionnaires are selected&#xD;
      specifically to capture the impact of GI complaints as related to the health related quality&#xD;
      of life. The questionnaires that will be completed by the patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i.Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      • The GIQLI is a 36-item questionnaire that assess the impact of GI distress on daily life&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii.SF-36 Health Survey • &quot;The SF-36 Health Survey is a questionnaire that capture practical,&#xD;
      reliable, and valid information about functional health and well-being from the patients'&#xD;
      point of view&quot; (4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii.EQ-5D Health Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      • &quot;The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. The EQ-5D&#xD;
      provides a simple descriptive profile and a single value for health status&quot; (5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will complete the three questionnaires at 4 outpatient visits occurring:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  when the patient comes in to an outpatient clinic visit after initial hospital discharge&#xD;
           after lung transplantation with complaints of GI distress (Day 1-Convert to Myfortic);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  60 Days;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  90 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  180 days&#xD;
