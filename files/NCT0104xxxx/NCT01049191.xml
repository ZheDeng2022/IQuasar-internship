  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a common disorder of compromised bone strength causing 40-50% of women and&#xD;
      ~25% of men to sustain fragility fractures during their lifetime. The reduction of bone&#xD;
      strength in osteoporotic people results from loss of bone density and deterioration of bone&#xD;
      quality. Bone quality is a complex amalgamation including macro- and micro-architecture,&#xD;
      mineralization, turnover and damage accumulation. Currently, medications to reduce fracture&#xD;
      risk are prescribed primarily on the basis of bone mineral density (BMD) measurement.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, currently available BMD measurement technologies do not detect the&#xD;
      aforementioned properties of bone quality; as such, less than half of individuals who sustain&#xD;
      osteoporotic fractures are classified as &quot;osteoporotic&quot; by currently available diagnostic&#xD;
      tools. Clearly, measures to enhance identification of those at high fracture risk are needed.&#xD;
      High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI) technology, such as that provided by&#xD;
      MicroMRI, Inc., has outstanding potential to be such a tool. Therefore, our long-term goal is&#xD;
      to evaluate and optimize the use of HR-MRI in fracture risk prediction; this pilot work is an&#xD;
      essential step in attaining this goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will investigate 72 postmenopausal women with normal or osteopenic BMD by&#xD;
      dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), 36 with prior low-trauma fractures will be compared&#xD;
      with 36 age-, race- and BMD matched women without fracture. We hypothesize that 1.) Women&#xD;
      with fractures will have evidence of microarchitectural deterioration on HR-MRI and 2.) Newly&#xD;
      developed, more rapid MRI sequences designed at the UW will provide similar trabecular&#xD;
      microstructure information more rapidly than the currently used, albeit investigational,&#xD;
      technology produced by MicroMRI, Inc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our specific aims are to a) Evaluate differences in MicroMRI parameters of trabecular&#xD;
      microstructure (bone volume fraction, trabecular thickness, surface/curve ratio and erosion&#xD;
      index) between age-, race- and BMD-matched postmenopausal women with and without fracture;&#xD;
      b.) Correlate T2* relaxation time (a rapid indirect MRI measure of trabecular density and&#xD;
      microstructure) with BMD measured by DXA, and microstructural parameters measured by&#xD;
      MicroMRI. As an exploratory aim we will investigate HR-MRI parameters of trabecular&#xD;
      microstructure obtained using a newly developed, rapid MRI sequence referred to as IDEAL-FSE&#xD;
      with parameters obtained using the currently available MicroMRI, Inc. sequence.&#xD;

        Seventy-two postmenopausal volunteers age ≥ 50 years will be recruited from existing&#xD;
        databases of ~3500 women with expressed interested in research. All will have normal BMD or&#xD;
        osteopenia (T-score &gt; -2.5 at the L1-4 spine, proximal femur and 1/3rd radius) by DXA.&#xD;
        Thirty-six will have sustained a &quot;fragility&quot; fracture of the spine, hip or wrist, defined&#xD;
        as a fracture occurring with everyday activities including a fall from standing height or&#xD;
        less. Historical radiographic documentation of fracture will be obtained. Thirty-six women&#xD;
        without fracture will serve as age- race- and BMD-matched controls. Age will be matched to&#xD;
        within 6 months; BMD in grams/cm2 at the non-dominant ultra-distal radius will be matched&#xD;
        to within 5%.&#xD;
