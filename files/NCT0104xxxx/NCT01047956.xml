      Material abuse nowadays become a serious public health issue, among these, abusing of opioids&#xD;
      is the most serious one. It cause HIV infection rate hiking up, recent years in Taiwan, it&#xD;
      impairing people health as well. The successive 2 year methadone substitutive abstaining&#xD;
      program makes HIV infection rate remarkable decreasing which proven this public health&#xD;
      program is successful in controlling HIV spreading. However, methadone substitutive&#xD;
      abstaining program can reduce physically and psychologically dependent with opioids for the&#xD;
      opioid abusers, collateral benefit is reducing related criminal behaviors and dangerous&#xD;
      contagious behaviors, such as sharing the hyperdermic needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, using methadone still causes sort of material dependent, for example, part&#xD;
      of participants of methadone substitutive abstaining program still keep using heroin, the&#xD;
      only change is the amount became lesser, even divert into another illegal drugs, compare&#xD;
      before participating this program. In the other word, methadone substitutive abstaining&#xD;
      program alleviate the dependence of drug abuser for the drug, but can not cure it once for&#xD;
      all. In the pass, some study use methadone and other medicine to eradicate this dependence,&#xD;
      still there is no effective way to approach it, it still has long way to go. Previous studies&#xD;
      found N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a slimy solvent ingredient in human body, by means of&#xD;
      extra-cellular glutamate exchange mechanism, not only maintain glutamate concentration inside&#xD;
      the raphe, also alleviate motivation and behavior of addictive patient. From previous&#xD;
      reports, N-acetylcysteine could be the silver bullet for the opiods addiction patients. The&#xD;
      clinical use of N-acetylcysteine is well established for safety as well as tolerance.&#xD;
      N-acetylcysteine is an acetyl-derivative of a human essential amino acid; molecular weight is&#xD;
      163.2, a white crystal chemical. N-acetylcysteine has been used in clinical for years, types&#xD;
      are intravenous injection, oral and spray, most of it was used for respiratory related&#xD;
      disease, a phlegm reducer, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis;&#xD;
      besides, N-acetylcysteine can combine with toxic metabolite, acetaminophen, prevent lever&#xD;
      necrosis of acetaminophen intoxication, therefore, is an antidote of acetaminophen&#xD;
      intoxication. Other than FAD approved for clinical using, N-acetylcysteine seems has other&#xD;
      clinical benefits such as illness of kidney from the developer, and can promote functions of&#xD;
      central nerve system. N-acetylcysteine also considered as improving cognition amnesia and&#xD;
      schizophrenia. Besides, oral N-acetylcysteine usually regards as helping health; it sells in&#xD;
      grocery, it also accepted by public as diet supplement. According long term study of oral&#xD;
      N-acetylcysteine for patients of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, only has some minor&#xD;
      side-effects, mostly uncomfortable in intestines and stomach, for example, nausea, vomiting&#xD;
      and diarrhea. As an antidote of N-acetylcysteine, some cases reported which caused&#xD;
      hypertension, chest distress, rectum breeding, respiratory distress, headache, fatigue, fever&#xD;
      and rash; those symptoms are intoxication of acetaminophen, it is hard to judge the&#xD;
      side-effects came from which one. The side-effects of intravenous N-acetylcysteine include&#xD;
      vomiting and diarrhea; some cases indicated 45 (8%) out of 529 patients of acetaminophen&#xD;
      intoxication showed allergic reactions, most are skin hypersensitive reaction, such as rash,&#xD;
      itch, 18 showed whole-body allergy include, bronchospasm, angioedema and vomiting etc. Those&#xD;
      allergies can be alleviated by antihistamine, steroids and adrenalin. Other researchers found&#xD;
      patients have 3 fold systemic allergy of asthma history than no history. In general, medicine&#xD;
      allergic history will not increase danger of allergic reaction. One case report showed a 2&#xD;
      year old girl, a acetaminophen intoxication patient, caused a serious epilepsy when treated&#xD;
      with intravenous injection. Conclude that oral and intravenous of N-acetylcysteine are safe&#xD;
      in clinical use, few cases could cause serious side-effects (especially for intravenous type&#xD;
      of N-acetylcysteine), and it needs to be careful. From the result of animal test in 2008,&#xD;
      gave N-acetylcysteine daily suppressed experimental animal addiction behavior, even still&#xD;
      held valid 40 days after stopped injection. Another animal test using male Sprague-Dawley had&#xD;
      similar results. According previous results, N-acetylcysteine was used for alleviation of&#xD;
      addiction behavior proven in certain effectiveness, if combine with methadone substitutive&#xD;
      abstaining program, should increase successful rate. In this study, double-blind prospective&#xD;
      study will be used, in methadone substitutive abstaining program to compare N-acetylcysteine&#xD;
      is be used or not. This experiment expects methadone come alone with N-acetylcysteine in&#xD;
      opioid abstaining will be better results than control group of methadone alone in 6 month&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
