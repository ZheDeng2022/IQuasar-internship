        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A male or female 18 years of age or greater at the time of the first vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At increased risk of occupational exposure to H5N1 influenza viruses based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Exposure to diseased poultry or wild birds,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Exposure, or potential exposure, to human cases of unidentified respiratory&#xD;
                  disease or known avian influenza,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Handling of human or avian microbiological specimens,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Handling of H5N1 viral isolates,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Or status critical to the implementation of emergency response measures in the&#xD;
                  event of an influenza pandemic declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stable health status as defined by absence of a health event satisfying the definition&#xD;
             of a serious adverse event, or a change in an ongoing drug therapy due to therapeutic&#xD;
             failure or symptoms of drug toxicity, within one (1) month prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Comprehension of the study requirements, ability to comprehend and comply with&#xD;
             procedures for collection of safety data, expressed availability for the required&#xD;
             study period, and ability and willingness to attend scheduled visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of evidence of substance abuse or of neurological or psychiatric diagnoses&#xD;
             which, although stable, are deemed by the investigator to render the potential subject&#xD;
             unable/unlikely to provide accurate safety reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of an oral temperature &gt;= 37.8ºC, or acute symptoms greater than &quot;mild&quot;&#xD;
             severity on the scheduled date of first vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with cancer, or treatment for cancer, within 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Persons with a history of cancer who are disease-free without treatment for 3&#xD;
                  years or more are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Persons with a history of histologically-confirmed basal cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
                  skin successfully treated with local excision only are excepted and may enroll&#xD;
                  within 3 years of diagnosis, but other histologic types of skin cancer require a&#xD;
                  3 year untreated and disease-free window as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women who are disease-free 3 years or more after treatment for breast cancer and&#xD;
                  receiving long-term prophylactic tamoxifen are excepted and may enroll.&#xD;

             history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of systemic glucocorticoids within 1 month prior to study enrollment, or any&#xD;
             other cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drug within 6 months of study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of any immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within 3 months of study&#xD;
             enrollment or planned administration of any of these products during the study period.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  An acute evolving neurological disorder or history of Guillain-Barré syndrome within 6&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Exposure to any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) during&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Receipt of analgesic or antipyretic medication with the specific intent of prophylaxis&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known pregnancy or a positive urine beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) test&#xD;
             result prior to any vaccination.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Women of child bearing potential who lack a history of reliable contraceptive&#xD;

             and obtain negative results in pregnancy urine tests prior to treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Reliable contraceptive practices include:&#xD;
