      Title: Evaluation of the tolerance and acceptability of Rasagiline in the treatment of&#xD;
      early-stage Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study: Phase IV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the tolerance and acceptability of Rasagiline versus Pramipexole (dopamine&#xD;
      agonist).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: To evaluate the clinical benefits of Rasagiline administered as a&#xD;
      monotherapy in patients presenting with early-stage Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multicentre comparative randomised parallel-group double-blind study, with a total duration&#xD;
      of fifteen weeks (three weeks of dose titration and twelve weeks of follow-up), comprising&#xD;
      four evaluations (D0, W3, W9, W15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      240 patients (i.e. 120 in each group) presenting with early stage idiopathic Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of centres:&#xD;
&#xD;
      70 neurologists distributed throughout three French regions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment studied: Rasagiline Presentation: 1 mg tablets Dosage : 1 mg/day in a single dose,&#xD;
      in the morning at breakfast-time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparator: Pramipexole Presentation: 0.125 mg, 0.25 mg and 1 mg pramipexole dihydrochloride&#xD;
      monohydrate tablets (corresponding respectively to 0.088 mg, 0.18 mg and 0.7 mg of&#xD;
      pramipexole)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose-titration: As specified in the SPC for pramipexole, the product will be administered in&#xD;
      three daily doses, preferably with meals, and the treatment will begin with a dose-titration&#xD;
      phase of three weeks' duration, during which time the dosage will be gradually increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On completion of the dose-titration phase, the minimum therapeutic dose of 1.5 mg per day&#xD;
      must be achieved by all the patients. The patients who cannot achieve this dosage will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study. The reason for stopping dose-titration (and leaving the study) will&#xD;
      be detailed in the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effective dosage of pramipexole should be adapted to the individual, depending on&#xD;
      clinical response and tolerance, in successive stages of 0.75 mg at one-week intervals,&#xD;
      without exceeding the maximum dose of 3 mg per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment prohibited during the study :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pethidine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, dextromethorphan, or any other MAOI, sympathomimetics&#xD;
      (including nasal and oral decongestants containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine), anti-H2s&#xD;
      (cimetidine, ranitidine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal evaluation criterion :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal criterion of evaluation is the percentage of patients who have presented with&#xD;
      at least one &quot; significant &quot; adverse event during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant adverse event is defined as :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a severe adverse event (SAE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an adverse event which in the opinion of the investigator requires suspension of the&#xD;
           treatment or reduction in dosage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an adverse event considered as severe or moderate by the patient (AEs of which the&#xD;
           intensity has not been evaluated will be considered as moderate to severe)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary evaluation criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  analysis of adverse events in the total population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  analysis of adverse events by degree of severity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  analysis of adverse events in subject over 65&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  analysis of adverse events by symptom&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  percentage of patients presenting with sleep problems (daytime drowsiness, narcolepsy,&#xD;
           insomnia, fragmented sleep…)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluation of Epworth Sleepiness Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluation of quality of life (PDQ-8)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluation of utilities by EuroQol (EQ-5D)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  overall clinical impression evaluated by the doctor (CGI-I) and by the patient (PGI-I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Global-Benefit-Risk (GBR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of resources&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the principal criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the principal criterion will be carried out with those patients from the&#xD;
      intention-to-treat population for whom tolerance data is available in at least one visit&#xD;
      after D0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparative analysis The percentages of patients in the two treated groups who present with&#xD;
      at least one significant adverse event will be compared using a Khi-2 test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logistic regression A logistic regression analysis will be performed in order to explain the&#xD;
      presence/absence of a significant event. The nature of the treatment and the centre will act&#xD;
      as explanatory variables, and the initial scores as covariates. Analyses will also be&#xD;
      performed on quantitative variables (ANCOVA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the Global Benefit-Risk (GBR) according to the model suggested by Chuang-Stein&#xD;
      et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subject required:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of the size is based on the hypothesis that the percentage of patients presenting&#xD;
      with at least one significant adverse event during follow-up (principal evaluation criterion)&#xD;
      will differ by 15% from one group to the other. With an alpha risk set at 5% and a beta ris&#xD;
      kat 20%, the number of subjects required, calculated using the Casagrande et Pike formula, is&#xD;
      110 subjects per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NSN was slightly overestimated in order to maintain the desired strength while taking&#xD;
      into account the possibility of lost to follow-up, and was fixed at 240 patients.&#xD;
