      Smoking among Latino males living in the U.S. is a significant public health problem, one&#xD;
      that can contribute to disparities in life expectancy and increase mortality. Latinos smoke&#xD;
      at the same rate as White males but are less likely than Whites to quit. Interventions do not&#xD;
      reach Latino smokers because many speak only Spanish and previous interventions have had&#xD;
      notable limitations. First, most have recruited volunteers, so hard-to-reach Latino smokers&#xD;
      likely did not participate. Second, cessation effects were short-term only. Third, no program&#xD;
      has attempted to boost Latino cessation rates by capitalizing on a &quot;teachable moment&quot;, a time&#xD;
      when quitting may seem especially relevant. To address these deficits, we propose to conduct&#xD;
      a teachable moment intervention trial for Latino smokers. We will attempt to capitalize on&#xD;
      the potential teachable moment of Latinas' pregnancy as an impetus for Latinos' cessation. We&#xD;
      will include couples, rather than just men, to sustain intervention effects. We will partner&#xD;
      with community leaders to develop an intervention based primarily on Social Cognitive Theory,&#xD;
      the Teachable Moment Model, and the Cognitive-Behavioral Couple Therapy Model. Some elements&#xD;
      will be at the individual level to help Latinos quit smoking and others will be couple-based&#xD;
      to improve communication and reduce stress in the postpartum relationship. The program will&#xD;
      be culturally sensitive to Latino values, such as familismo, valuing of and duty to the&#xD;
      family and personalismo, valuing warm personal relationships. We will recruit Latino couples&#xD;
      (n=366) into a Guia (control) arm in which men receive a culturally appropriate smoking&#xD;
      cessation guide, and a couple-based smoking cessation counseling arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Latino expectant fathers who receive couple-based counseling to quit smoking&#xD;
      will be more likely to be abstinent from smoking at 28 weeks in pregnancy and 12 months&#xD;
      post-randomization than Latino expectant fathers who receive a self-help smoking cessation&#xD;
      guide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Couple-based counseling will improve mediators, such as couple communication&#xD;
      about smoking, self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, stress levels, risk perceptions, emotion,&#xD;
      and self-image, which in turn, will increase cessation rates among Latino expectant fathers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Couples in the counseling arm will have a greater increase in cessation during&#xD;
      pregnancy and a lower decrease in cessation at 6 and 12 months post-randomization than&#xD;
      couples in the Guia arm.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND &amp; SIGNIFICANCE Latino men are just as likely to smoke as non-Hispanic White men;&#xD;
      [CDC, 2004] however, few smoking cessation programs have shown long term effects among&#xD;
      Latinos. Further, many Latinos cannot enter traditional smoking cessation programs because&#xD;
      they do not speak English. To be effective, programs should capitalize on a &quot;teachable&#xD;
      moment&quot;. [McBride, 2003] Pregnancy has been shown to be a teachable moment for women to quit&#xD;
      smoking; whether it is a teachable moment for partners has not been explored. Including&#xD;
      Latinas and intervening with the couple might help sustain cessation effects long term. The&#xD;
      aim of this randomized controlled trial is to compare a culturally tailored intervention to a&#xD;
      minimal intervention (self-help smoking cessation guides or Guia) in promoting and sustaining&#xD;
      smoking cessation among expectant Latino fathers during pregnancy and postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN &amp; PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      When describing this study to the pregnant women, we will explain that half of the couples&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to receive face-to-face counseling plus a self-help cessation guide&#xD;
      (Guia) while the other half will receive the self-help smoking cessation guide only. When a&#xD;
      woman agrees to have us meet with her and her husband/partner, we will send her home with two&#xD;
      consent forms, one for her and one for her husband/partner, along with a small gift for the&#xD;
      upcoming baby. We also will set up a time and place to meet the couple for their initial data&#xD;
      assessment. We will not collect information about legal status of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Couples who are randomized to the face-to-face support intervention will be asked to attend&#xD;
      two two-hour in-home sessions, one in pregnancy and one after the baby is born. Each man and&#xD;
      each woman will receive four booster calls, two in pregnancy and two post-partum. These calls&#xD;
      last approximately ten minutes. At the individual level, the intervention focuses on skills&#xD;
      training for behavior change (smoking cessation for men and diet or exercise for women) and&#xD;
      goal setting. At the couple level, the intervention focuses on skills training for&#xD;
      communication (speaking and listening skills and problem solving).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size considerations A total of 366 couples will be randomized to the two arms within&#xD;
      strata defined by whether this is their first pregnancy. The primary objectives are to test&#xD;
      whether there are arm differences in the proportion of fathers who are abstinent from smoking&#xD;
      at 28 weeks of pregnancy (time 1) and at 12 months post-randomization (time 2). We expect&#xD;
      attrition rates among fathers of 20% and 30% at time 1 and time 2, respectively; dropouts&#xD;
      will be imputed to be non-abstinent in an intention-to-treat analysis. The chi-square test&#xD;
      for a difference in two proportions will be used to test the null hypotheses of no difference&#xD;
      in abstinence rates between the two arms. The overall one-sided alpha level will be&#xD;
      controlled at 0.025 by conducting each test at a one-sided alpha of 0.0125. Based on Nevid&#xD;
      and colleagues' previous study that compared counseling to pamphlets,[Nevid, 1997] we&#xD;
      anticipate abstinence rates of 10% and 5% in the Guia only arm at time 1 and time 2,&#xD;
      respectively. The alternative hypotheses are that the arm difference at time 1 will be 15%&#xD;
      (25% versus 10%) and at time 2 will be 10% (15% versus 5%). A sample of size 366 was selected&#xD;
      to have at least 90% power for each alternative hypothesis. For the effect at time 2 to have&#xD;
      90% power, the effect at time 1 is overpowered at 97%. It is assumed that the arm effects of&#xD;
      25% versus 10% at time 1 and of 15% versus 5% at time 2 consider those participants who&#xD;
      dropout and have their outcomes imputed to be non-abstinent. Thus, under the alternative&#xD;
      hypotheses, the probabilities of response among just those 80% and 70% who do not drop out&#xD;
      are (31% versus 13%) and (21% versus 7%), respectively.&#xD;
