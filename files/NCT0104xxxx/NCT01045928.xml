      RATIONALE: Lenalidomide may stop the growth of cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor.&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some&#xD;
      block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill&#xD;
      them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving lenalidomide together with rituximab&#xD;
      may be an effective treatment for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide&#xD;
      when given together with rituximab as maintenance therapy in treating patients with B-cell&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study was originally intended to be Phase I/Phase II but it terminated early because of&#xD;
      toxicity of treatment and therefore never moved to the Phase II portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety of&#xD;
      lenalidomide in combination with rituximab in subjects with B-cell NHL following ASCT. (Phase&#xD;
      I) II. To evaluate the tolerability of maintenance therapy with lenalidomide and rituximab&#xD;
      after ASCT in subjects with B-cell NHL. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the progression-free survival of subjects with B-cell&#xD;
      NHL receiving maintenance therapy with lenalidomide and rituximab after ASCT. II. To examine&#xD;
      whether potential effects of lenalidomide and rituximab on progression-free survival after&#xD;
      ASCT, compared with historical controls, vary according to histologic subtype of B-cell NHL.&#xD;
      III. To correlate potential associations between peripheral blood levels of lymphocyte&#xD;
      subsets including NK, T, and B cells and progression-free survival after ASCT in enrolled&#xD;
      subjects. IV. To evaluate potential associations between progression-free survival after ASCT&#xD;
      and polymorphisms at position 158 of FCgammaRIIIa receptor in enrolled subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21of all courses and&#xD;
      rituximab IV on day 1of courses 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up&#xD;
      to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After&#xD;
      completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 2 years.&#xD;
