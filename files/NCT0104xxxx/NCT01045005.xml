      The investigators aim to show that quantitative analysis of doppler flow velocity waveforms&#xD;
      i.e. ultrasound which is a non-invasive and very safe means of assessing blood flow; recorded&#xD;
      in the proximity of terminal microvascular beds of interest, (i.e. the forearm and ocular&#xD;
      circulation) can sensitively detect and track local changes in microvascular haemodynamics&#xD;
      i.e. the function of the small blood vessels that are found in the back of the eye and in the&#xD;
      forearm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also aim to relate change in the doppler spectral flow velocity waveform&#xD;
      i.e. the ultrasound signal, in the central retinal artery to changes in geometry and tone of&#xD;
      the vasculature (or changes in the structure and function of small blood vessels) in response&#xD;
      to inhaled oxygen and carbon dioxide. The geometry and tone of the vasculature (or Blood&#xD;
      Vessels) can be measured by taking photographs of the back of the eye.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus significantly increases the risk for both small and large blood vessel&#xD;
      complications e.g. diabetic eye problems and coronary heart disease. Vital organs such as the&#xD;
      eye, kidney, heart and brain represent well- recognized preferential targets in patients with&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus. The presence of such end-organ damage powerfully influences cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk and the benefits of therapeutic interventions. Unfortunately, by the time symptoms&#xD;
      develop or events occur as manifestations of target-organ damage, the disease process is&#xD;
      already at an advanced stage. Although not traditionally viewed as an end-organ, it is&#xD;
      altered structure and function of arterial small blood vessels that acts as the substrate for&#xD;
      accelerated disease development and the increased occurrence of vascular events in patients&#xD;
      with diabetes mellitus. The ability to detect and monitor sub-clinical damage, representing&#xD;
      the cumulative and integrated influence of all risk factors in impairing arterial wall&#xD;
      integrity, holds potential to further refine cardiovascular risk stratification and enable&#xD;
      early intervention to prevent or attenuate disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data derived from analysis of arterial waveforms, that marks the presence of impaired&#xD;
      pulsatile function in the arterial system, has been shown to predict future cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk. As consistent abnormalities in the arterial pulse wave shape have been recognized for&#xD;
      many years in diabetic subjects there has been a growing interest in quantifying changes in&#xD;
      the pulse contour to provide information about the status of the vasculature in diabetes.&#xD;
      These original observations have been confirmed in more recent studies in patients with type&#xD;
      1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus and are detected prior to the development of clinical&#xD;
      complications of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the pulse contours recorded from sites in large conduit arteries identify&#xD;
      structural and functional abnormalities predominantly in the systemic microvasculature, as&#xD;
      small arteries and arterioles are recognised as the major sites for wave reflection that&#xD;
      alters pulse contour morphology. It is recognised that techniques providing a global&#xD;
      assessment of the circulation may not capture and cannot localise findings to a specific site&#xD;
      or target-organ of interest in the arterial system. Microcirculation is a collective term for&#xD;
      the smallest segments of the vascular system and is a major site of control of vascular&#xD;
      resistance. It includes arterioles and capillaries and is considered to be a continuum rather&#xD;
      than a distinct site of resistance control. Importantly, it is recognised as sites were the&#xD;
      earliest manifestations of cardiovascular disease, especially inflammatory processes occur.&#xD;
      The microvasculature may therefore constitute a preferential target or be primarily involved&#xD;
      in the pathogenesis of disease and represents an important regional target for therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions. Further, retinal photography and standardised grading provides a unique&#xD;
      opportunity to study retinal microvascular characteristics including retinopathy and change&#xD;
      in arteriolar (or blood vessel) structure and function. Improved methods of assessment to&#xD;
      study the retinal microvascular network holds potential to improve prediction of risk,&#xD;
      identify high risk groups and act as a window to monitor the effects of possible drug&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  To be eligible for study patients must be older than 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients will have undergone an extensive clinical evaluation performed at the&#xD;
             Belfast City Hospital diabetes clinic that includes retinal photography.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be eligible for the study if they are in stable control of their&#xD;
             diabetes with a haemoglobin of A1c between 6.5 and 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be eligible if they have background retinopathy. The control subjects&#xD;
             will be healthy individuals; and will be age and sex matched for the disease&#xD;
             population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with proliferative retinopathy or those undergoing laser therapy will be&#xD;
             excluded from study. This would make assessment of the retinal arteriolar structure&#xD;
             very difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will also be excluded if they have hypertension (a blood pressure&#xD;
             &gt;140/90mmHg) or taking antihypertensive drugs. The investigators know that the&#xD;
             presence of hypertension will have an effect on the retinal waveforms and structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will also be excluded if they have any significant renal disease (GFR &lt;60ml&#xD;
             min) or a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with microalbuminuria (&gt;3 g/min) can be included in the study but would be&#xD;
             asked to stop their medication (e.g. ACE inhibitor) for 5 days prior to the study&#xD;
             period. It should be mentioned that the risk associated with stopping this effective&#xD;
             medication for such a period of time is minimal. This has been common practice in our&#xD;
             department in a number of previous studies, and in the published literature. This will&#xD;
             be clearly communicated to the patient in the patient information sheet, in the&#xD;
             patient consent form; and in the discussion/process of obtaining informed consent with&#xD;
             the patient&#xD;
