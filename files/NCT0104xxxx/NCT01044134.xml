    <textblock>
      Advice to increase water consumption as part of a weight-reducing diet - typically to 8 cups&#xD;
      (64 fl oz, ~2 L) per day (&quot;8x8&quot; water recommendation) - is almost ubiquitously recommended by&#xD;
      healthcare professionals. Many believe that water promotes weight loss through numerous&#xD;
      physiological mechanisms. However, only limited observational data and virtually no&#xD;
      experimental data exist regarding the effects of water consumption on body weight. In this&#xD;
      study, we propose a randomized controlled pilot study in which two groups of overweight&#xD;
      adolescents will receive a standard weight loss regimen, either with (experimental&#xD;
      intervention) or without (control intervention) additional advice and support to increase&#xD;
      water consumption. We will utilize individual sessions, an innovative text messaging&#xD;
      protocol, and motivational telephone calls to promote adherence to the interventions. The&#xD;
      purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate feasibility and obtain preliminary efficacy data,&#xD;
      to inform design of a future, definitive study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that increasing water consumption will improve the efficacy of a standard&#xD;
      weight-reducing diet and will lead to decreased consumption of energy-containing beverages,&#xD;
      decreased total energy intake, improved diet quality, improved immune status, and improved&#xD;
      cardiovascular and diabetes risk factors. This simple behavioral intervention will be&#xD;
      feasible and will significantly increase water consumption among participants in the&#xD;
      experimental vs. control group.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 6-month randomized controlled trial. After the initial baseline screening and&#xD;
      assessments, 60 overweight adolescents will be randomly assigned (30 subjects per group) to a&#xD;
      standard weight-reducing diet with the advice to consume 8 cups of water per day&#xD;
      (experimental group) or the same standard weight-reducing diet without additional advice&#xD;
      (control group). The interventions will consist of nutrition education and behavioral&#xD;
      counseling by a registered dietitian, during individual sessions and telephone calls. Mobile&#xD;
      text messaging will be used to reinforce information presented at the individual sessions and&#xD;
      thereby foster adherence to dietary advice. Diet prescriptions will differ only in regard to&#xD;
      the specificity of recommendations regarding water consumption and physical activity&#xD;
      recommendations will not differ between groups. The frequency and content of text messages&#xD;
      will be consistent between the experimental and control groups, with the exception that the&#xD;
      experimental group will receive an additional phrase with each message to encourage the &quot;8&#xD;
      x8&quot; water recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A registered dietitian will communicate with each participant one time per month, either&#xD;
      during an individual session or by telephone. Individual sessions will include nutrition&#xD;
      classes, taste testing, hands-on activities, and opportunities for questions and answers.&#xD;
      Text messages will be sent on a daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at regular intervals throughout the 6 months&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSIS PLAN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blinding of the randomization will be broken on or after July 28, 2014 and the data will&#xD;
      be analyzed according to the following plan. All analyses will follow the intention-to-treat&#xD;
      principle, attributing each subject to his or her assigned diet regardless of compliance.&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics will be compared between the diet groups using the Fisher exact test&#xD;
      for categorical variables and t-test for continuous variables. The 6-month change from&#xD;
      baseline in the primary and secondary outcomes will be compared between groups using a&#xD;
      general linear model, adjusting for baseline covariates that are potentially correlated with&#xD;
      the outcome. These include demographics, socioeconomic status, anthropometrics, physical&#xD;
      activity, and beverage consumption. We will further test covariates for potential&#xD;
      interaction, i.e., differential effect on outcome in the two trial arms. The null hypothesis&#xD;
      is that the 6-month change from baseline will not differ between diet groups.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be counseled to follow a standard weight-reducing diet including consumption of 1) ample vegetables, fruits, and legumes; 2) whole rather than refined grains; and 3) high-quality proteins at most meals and snacks. Moreover, we will recommend limiting intake of added fats and sugars and avoiding juices and sugar-sweetened beverages (per standard practice). Participants will also be counseled to increase their water intake to 8 cups per day, consistent with the popular &quot;8 × 8&quot; recommendation (eight 8-oz glasses of water).</description>

    <description>Participants will be counseled on the same standard weight-reducing diet, as described above, with no specific advice regarding water consumption. Furthermore, no specific dietary recommendations will be provided on altering fluid/beverage intake, other than to decrease calorie-containing beverages as noted above. When participants ask for a recommendation regarding water intake, they will be advised that drinking plain water is the best way to satisfy thirst and instructed to drink when thirsty.</description>
