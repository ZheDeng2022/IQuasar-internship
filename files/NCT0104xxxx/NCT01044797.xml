      The purpose of the study is to learn about the feasibility of moving a pill-sized camera&#xD;
      (Givens Capsule) remotely in the esophagus and stomach using an external hand held magnet.&#xD;

      Magnetic remote manipulation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A simple and inexpensive method for manipulation of capsule endoscopes has been developed and&#xD;
      successfully tested in survival studies in pigs. This has involved modifications of capsules&#xD;
      which are in clinical use in patients as follows. One of the two imagers in esophageal&#xD;
      capsules have been removed and replaced with three small magnets which are fixed within the&#xD;
      capsule casing. This does not alter the dimensions of the capsule which can be reconstituted&#xD;
      in a conventional casing. The magnetic reed switch which turns the capsule on and off is&#xD;
      removed and is replaced with a thermal switch which will turn the capsule on if placed in hot&#xD;
      water above 60 degrees centigrade for 60 seconds. The capsule can be manipulated using an&#xD;
      external hand held paddle shaped magnet measuring approximately 20 x 20 x 5 centimeters which&#xD;
      is held and rotated close to the back of the subject when the modified capsule is in the&#xD;
      esophagus or the anterior abdominal wall when the capsule is in the stomach. The magnets used&#xD;
      are of neodymium iron boron (quaternary ion magnets). The capsules are modified from FDA&#xD;
      approved devices by Given Imaging (the company that makes these capsules). The outside of the&#xD;
      capsule is unchanged but internal modifications, the changing of the switch and the inclusion&#xD;
      of the magnet, are not FDA approved and are experimental.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned experiment in a human volunteer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is for one, currently identified healthy volunteer only. The volunteer for this&#xD;
      study is one of the inventors of the capsule endoscope technology (Paul Swain, MD) Dr. Swain&#xD;
      will be consented in the usual manner with the current IRB approved consent. Dr. Rothstein&#xD;
      will perform a physical exam to ensure that he is in general good health, has no esophageal&#xD;
      or bowel disease or conditions that would contraindicate participation in the present study.&#xD;
      He will then swallow a magnetically modified capsule as follows. He will be fasted overnight&#xD;
      for the experiment which will be conducted in the designated endoscopy unit following&#xD;
      standard endoscopic practise. A cannula will be placed for suitable intravenous access if&#xD;
      needed, and D5/half normal saline infused to keep the vein open. The experiment will be&#xD;
      performed with no sedation if possible or light sedation using benzodiazepines and/or&#xD;
      narcotics (standard medications for endoscopy) at the discretion of the principal&#xD;
      investigator and the volunteer. Topical anesthetics will be applied in the customary fashion&#xD;
      for upper endoscopy. The volunteer will lie in the left lateral position and will swallow the&#xD;
      capsule in a recumbent posture and may aid swallowing by sipping water from a glass through a&#xD;
      straw. A flexible endoscope will be passed into the esophagus by the endoscopist. Another&#xD;
      person who is not the endoscopist will manipulate the external paddle-shaped magnet. This&#xD;
      involves moving and rotating the polarities of this magnet adjacent to the back and abdomen&#xD;
      of the volunteer. A real-time viewer displaying images obtained from the capsule will be&#xD;
      placed in a position so both the endoscopist and the paddle-magnet manipulator can view and&#xD;
      react to the images. The images from the flexible endoscope, room images showing the&#xD;
      movements of the paddle magnet and the real-time images acquired from the capsule will be&#xD;
      recorded. The volunteer will be asked to indicate if he can feel the magnet moving the&#xD;
      capsule in the esophagus and stomach and whether it is at all painful (real-time and via&#xD;
      follow-up visual analog scale - pain 1 to10, 1 no pain and 10 worst pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The capsule will be manipulated in the esophagus and stomach with both flexible endoscopic&#xD;
      and real time capsule imaging. Once manipulations in the esophagus have been completed the&#xD;
      volunteer will be elevated (tilt table, sit or stand) to see if the magnet can hold the&#xD;
      capsule in the esophagus against gravity. The capsule will then be allowed to pass into the&#xD;
      stomach where it will be magnetically manipulated. Once the examination is completed the&#xD;
      capsule will be removed using a Roth snare, a standardly employed accessory with a net which&#xD;
      can be closed over objects for retrieval and is commonly used for polyp retrieval.&#xD;
