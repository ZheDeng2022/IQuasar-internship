  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Rimonabant, a CB1 receptor antagonist, blocks effects of cannabinoids and, in&#xD;
      dependent animals, elicits cannabinoid withdrawal. No studies have examined&#xD;
      rimonabantelicited cannabis withdrawal in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals: (1) Determine the lowest single dose of oral rimonabant that elicits measurable&#xD;
      cannabinoid withdrawal. (2) Characterize cognitive performance, subjective state,&#xD;
      physiological condition, and regional brain activation (measured by functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging [fMRI]) during acute and chronic administration of oral delta&#xD;
      9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and during cannabis withdrawal. (3) Characterize the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of oral THC and metabolites in body fluids and hair and of rimonabant in&#xD;
      plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Population: Up to 60 completing cannabis users aged 18-45 (up to 24 in Experiment I,&#xD;
      36 in Experiment II) and 18 completing non-drug-using controls (Experiment II). Enrollment&#xD;
      target is 82% Caucasian, 14% African American, 4% other; 9% Hispanic; 35% women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design and Methods: Experiment I: In this within-subject, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, dose-escalation study, six participants receive 7 days of THC (40-120 mg/day).&#xD;
      On Day 8, five participants receive 20 mg rimonabant; one receives placebo. If withdrawal&#xD;
      criteria (greater than or equal to 150% or 2.5-fold increase in selected visual-analog&#xD;
      scales) are not met in all five participants receiving rimonabant, separate groups of six are&#xD;
      similarly treated with 40, 60 or 80 mg rimonabant, if necessary. The PI and MRP will submit&#xD;
      all adverse events and relevant cardiovascular and scientific data to the IRB at the&#xD;
      completion of each rimonabant dose panel. When the extramural NIDA DSMB is in place, it will&#xD;
      review all data collected to date and develop and implement a monitoring plan, including&#xD;
      review on completion of each dose cohort. DSMB recommendations will be reviewed by the&#xD;
      Sponsor, Clinical Director and IRB before proceeding to the next dose cohort. In addition, if&#xD;
      any subject has an intolerable adverse event (ie, an adverse event leading to study&#xD;
      discontinuation) or serious adverse event in response to rimonabant on Day 8, the blind for&#xD;
      that subject will be broken, and a report sent to the Sponsor, the extramural NIDA DSMB when&#xD;
      in place and the IRB for discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experiment II: In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, 36 participants&#xD;
      receive 7 days of THC (40-120 mg/day). On Day 8, 18 participants receive rimonabant dose&#xD;
      determined in Experiment I to elicit cannabis withdrawal; 18 participants receive placebo&#xD;
      rimonabant to evaluate spontaneous cannabis withdrawal. Cognitive, psychological,&#xD;
      physiological and hormonal measures are monitored to determine onset, magnitude, and duration&#xD;
      of THC intoxication and withdrawal and to correlate with THC and rimonabant pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
      Changes in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal are determined with five fMRI scans&#xD;
      throughout the study. Eighteen non-drug-using controls undergo scanning and cognitive testing&#xD;
      at similar intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and Benefits: The proposed doses of THC and rimonabant have been well tolerated in&#xD;
      other studies. The most common side effects of oral THC are sedation, cognitive impairment,&#xD;
      euphoria, poor coordination, tachycardia, and hypotension. Spontaneous withdrawal from&#xD;
      cannabis is mild and medically benign. Experience with other drugs suggests that&#xD;
      antagonist-elicited cannabis withdrawal may have an earlier onset and greater intensity than&#xD;
      spontaneous cannabis withdrawal. There are no clinical benefits to participants. Scientific&#xD;
      benefits are greater understanding of cannabis intoxication, tolerance, and withdrawal and of&#xD;
      the role of rimonabant in eliciting cannabis withdrawal.&#xD;
