    <textblock>
      Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an experimental HIV-prevention strategy using&#xD;
      antiretroviral (ARV) agents to protect HIV negative individuals from HIV infection.TMC278 is&#xD;
      a new drug being developed for this type of HIV treatment. It is hoped that this drug may be&#xD;
      used to help prevent HIV transmission in future. A 'long acting' formulation of TMC278 has&#xD;
      been developed. Long acting means that the drug will be present in the blood for longer. It&#xD;
      is this formulation of the drug that will be investigated in this study. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive the drug by injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety of the drug and how well it is&#xD;
      tolerated by the body. The study will look at the levels of the study drug in the subjects&#xD;
      blood over the duration of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While for certain diseases, the use of medications by healthy people has been proven to&#xD;
      function as prophylaxis, i.e. malaria, it is still unknown whether PrEP can help prevent HIV&#xD;
      infection from exposure during sex or injection-drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address whether PrEP is safe and effective for use in humans, the traditional sequence of&#xD;
      drug development steps should be followed as closely as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMC278 (rilpivirine) is a new investigational non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor&#xD;
      (NNRTI) discovered and in development by Tibotec, a division of Johnson &amp; Johnson. Data from&#xD;
      clinical development (Phase IIB) suggest that TMC278 has a similar efficacy and better&#xD;
      side-effect profile as compared to other, older, NNRTIs, such as efavirenz. Like TMC125&#xD;
      (etravirine), TMC278 is a diarylpyrimidine (DAPY - a class of molecule that resembles the&#xD;
      pyrimidine nucleotides found in DNA, and which have shown potency in inhibiting the activity&#xD;
      of HIV reverse transcriptase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tibotec is currently investigating TMC278 in two formulations: an oral formulation for HIV&#xD;
      treatment and, in early phase, a long acting (LA) injectable formulation for HIV treatment.&#xD;
      The latter has also potential application for HIV transmission prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMC278LA is an innovative drug formulation and its long apparent half life may allow&#xD;
      administration of PrEP monthly rather than orally and daily, as for other ARV that are&#xD;
      currently studied as PrEP agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, a phase I/II, open-label, prospective, single arm, pharmacokinetic clinical trial&#xD;
      in 100 HIV negative subjects (50% of whom will have to be of self-identified African ancestry&#xD;
      and 50% females, approximately) is to be conducted. The study will examine whether a monthly&#xD;
      dose of TMC278LA not exceeding 600 mg i/m over a time period of approximately six months,&#xD;
      with a loading regimen of the first two i/m injections separated by two weeks, is safe and&#xD;
      well tolerated by HIV-negative subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigation of drug pharmacokinetics in plasma and genital secretions will be also carried&#xD;
      out in order to ensure optimal drug exposure during drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 evaluable subjects will be enrolled, with approximately 50 of African ancestry, and 50&#xD;
      females. This will provide 50-subject-years of safety data in order to support a later large&#xD;
      phase III global efficacy study.&#xD;
