      The goal of this study is to describe the clinical presentation, indications, and operative&#xD;
      treatment as well as assess the morbidity, mortality, and overall performance of revisional&#xD;
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) after either failed or functional antireflux surgery &quot;ARS&quot; in&#xD;
      obese patients. With such information, we hope to determine which features might assist us in&#xD;
      advancing our knowledge about Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Disease &quot;GERD&quot;, the best option for&#xD;
      primary ARS, and mechanisms of failure in the obese population as well as in identifying&#xD;
      predictors of outcome after revisional surgery in this population.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The epidemic of overweight and obesity in the United States of America along with its&#xD;
      comorbidities continues to expand. Bariatric surgery has demonstrated to be the most&#xD;
      effective and sustained method to control severe obesity and its comorbidities. For instance,&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus was completely resolved in 76.8 percent, systemic arterial&#xD;
      hypertension was resolved in 61.7 percent, dyslipidemia improved in 70 percent, and&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome was resolved in 85.7 percent. Furthermore,&#xD;
      bariatric surgery significantly increases life expectancy (89 percent) and decreases overall&#xD;
      mortality (30-40 percent), particularly deaths from diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.&#xD;
      Lastly, preliminary evidence about downstream savings associated with bariatric surgery&#xD;
      offset the initial costs in 2 to 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 1998, there has been a substantially progressive increase in bariatric surgery. In&#xD;
      2005, the American Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery &quot;ASMBS&quot; reported that 81&#xD;
      percent of bariatric procedures were approached laparoscopically. 205,000 people, in 2007,&#xD;
      had bariatric surgery in the United States from which approximately 80 percent of these were&#xD;
      Gastric Bypass. Moreover, there is a mismatch between eligibility and receipt of bariatric&#xD;
      surgery with just less than 1 percent of the eligible population being treated for morbid&#xD;
      obesity through bariatric surgery. Along with the increasing number of elective primary&#xD;
      weight loss procedures, up to 20 percent of post RYGB patients cannot sustain their weight&#xD;
      loss beyond 2 to 3 years after the primary bariatric procedure. Thus, revisional surgery for&#xD;
      poor weight loss and re-operations for technical or mechanical complications will rise in a&#xD;
      parallel manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three systematic reviews and meta-analysis have examined the association between obesity (BMI&#xD;
      &gt;30kg/m2) and several GERD-related disorders, including 1) GERD symptoms, 2) erosive&#xD;
      esophagitis &quot;EE&quot;, and 3) esophageal adenocarcinoma &quot;EA&quot;. Obesity is associated with a&#xD;
      1.5-to-2-fold increased risk of GERD symptoms and EE and a 2- to 2.5-fold increased risk of&#xD;
      EA. In two large case-control studies, abdominal diameter (waist-hip ratio), but not BMI, is&#xD;
      an independent risk factor for another GERD-related disorder, Barrett´s esophagus &quot;BE&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current pathophysiological mechanisms of GERD in the obese encompass the following. 1)&#xD;
      Mechanical: I) increased intra-gastric pressure: increased intra-peritoneal and abdominal&#xD;
      wall fat mass increases the intra-abdominal and peri-gastric pressures with subsequent&#xD;
      increased gastroesophageal pressure gradient &quot;GEPE&quot; with augmented esophageal acid exposure.&#xD;
      Each BMI unit increase corresponds to a 10 percent increase in intra-gastric pressure. II)&#xD;
      Hiatal Hernia: &quot;HH&quot; disrupts the integrity of the sphincter mechanisms and prolongs&#xD;
      esophageal acid clearance. Thin, normal, overweight, and obese subjects have a 1.0, 1.9, 2.5,&#xD;
      and 4.2 risk of having HH compared to thin subjects, respectively. 2) Motility: I) Increased&#xD;
      Transient LES Relaxation &quot;TLESR&quot; are associated with acid reflux during the postprandial&#xD;
      period, especially during inspiration. II) Low LES basal pressure: Increased prevalence of&#xD;
      abnormally low LES basal pressure in the overweight and obese in comparison to the&#xD;
      normoweight subject. III) Esophageal motility abnormality: Jaffin et al, with esophageal&#xD;
      manometry, reported 61 percent of patients with altered esophageal motility from which 59&#xD;
      percent had altered visceral pain perception (asymptomatic). IV) Delayed gastric emptying:&#xD;
      mostly associated with one of its major comorbidities, diabetes mellitus. 3) Esophageal&#xD;
      sensitivity: Mercer et al., with a Bernstein test, found a significant difference between&#xD;
      normoweight and obese subjects without clinical evidence of GERD (0 percent vs. 86 percent,&#xD;
      respectively) for esophageal hypersensitivity. 4) Hormonal: mostly mediated by estrogen and&#xD;
      adiponectin. 5) Environmental (Diet): high-fat, saturated fatty acids, high-cholesterol, and&#xD;
      high caloric density diets have been associated with the highest likelihood of perceiving an&#xD;
      acid reflux event; fat may confer its sensory effect by activating pain facilitatory pathways&#xD;
      or by deactivating pain inhibitory pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most recent data is not conclusive on whether increased BMI affects acid-suppressive&#xD;
      therapy for GERD. However, MacDougall et al. found that increased BMI was significantly&#xD;
      associated with long-term acid suppression therapy. This can be explained based on either a&#xD;
      higher prevalence of factors that predispose overweight and obese subjects to severe GERD,&#xD;
      such as HH, greater GEPG, increased number of TLESR, or standard doses of PPI´s are&#xD;
      suboptimal for patients with increased BMI and GERD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Broad indications for antireflux surgery include: 1) Reflux of food associated with HH, 2)&#xD;
      despite successful medical treatment or after poor or moderate symptom control on optimized&#xD;
      PPI therapy, patient opts for surgery, and 3) Complicated GERD without including severe&#xD;
      dysplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Available traditional ARS are either 1) fundoplication, which is the most commonly performed&#xD;
      procedure and can be partial -Toupet, Dor- or complete -Nissen-, or other procedures with&#xD;
      limited use such as 2) Hill operation, 3) pyloroplasty, 4) vagotomy with antrectomy, and 5)&#xD;
      duodenal switch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term control of typical symptoms after primary laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication &quot;LNF&quot;,&#xD;
      in properly selected patients and with an experienced surgical team, is attained in more than&#xD;
      90 percent of patients confirming that LNF is the gold standard for the treatment of severe&#xD;
      GERD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a cohort study of 166 patients followed for 11 years, Smith et al found preoperative&#xD;
      response to acid-reducing medication, typical symptoms, and BMI &lt; 35 Kg/m2 to predict&#xD;
      successful outcome. However, HH size, normal 24-hour pH score, age &gt; 50 years, female gender,&#xD;
      and prior abdominal surgery that previous studies found to be associated with poor outcomes&#xD;
      were not corroborated by this study. Other risk factors for failure are short esophagus, HH&#xD;
      greater than 3 cm, and diaphragmatic stressors such as retching, sports of weight lifting,&#xD;
      and high-speed motor vehicle accident among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another study found increased BMI to be a predictor of poor outcome. Perez et al, in a&#xD;
      retrospective cohort analysis of 224 patients undergoing LNF and transthoracic ARS, found a&#xD;
      significantly increased recurrence rate of GERD in obese and overweight compared to&#xD;
      normoweight patients, regardless of procedure type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, a cohort study of 257 consecutive patients undergoing LNF, D´Alessio et al&#xD;
      analyzed outcomes based on BMI (&lt; 25, 25-30, and &gt;30 kg/m2); No significant differences in&#xD;
      symptom scores and clinical success rates were found among the different subsets. However,&#xD;
      mean BMI for obese patients was 33 kg/m2 (obesity class I) and only three patients were &gt;35&#xD;
      kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of contradictory data about LNF efficacy in obesity, several studies have shown&#xD;
      the effectiveness of RYGB for GERD in morbidly obese patients by symptoms, endoscopic&#xD;
      findings, manometry and pH-metry results, and endoscopic biopsy-histopathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are four retrospective cohort studies assessing mostly early outcomes after converting&#xD;
      ARS to RYGB. First, Sarr et al analyzed 19 patients that underwent open conversion to RYGB.&#xD;
      Next, Ikramuddin et al described the anatomic findings for fundoplication failure after the&#xD;
      laparoscopic conversion to RYGB of 11 patients. Lastly, with seven patients each, Raftopoulos&#xD;
      et al and Donnelly et al reported feasibility with a high morbidity rate as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, there is little information about what is the best primary ARS and the best&#xD;
      revisional strategy to address intractable or severe reflux after failed fundoplication in&#xD;
      the obese population. Also, there is lack of data about the best revisional procedure to&#xD;
      address obesity in the patient status post functional or competent ARS. With this pilot&#xD;
      retrospective study, we will advance our knowledge and along with the existing literature, we&#xD;
      will draw preliminary clinical recommendations.&#xD;
