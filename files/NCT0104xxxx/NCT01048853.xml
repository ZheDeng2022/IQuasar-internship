  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this surgical research study is to learn if &quot;conservative surgery&quot; is a safe and&#xD;
      feasible option for women with low-risk cervical cancer (stage IA2 or IB1, Grade 1 or 2).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stage IA2 or IB1 cervical cancer is currently treated by a radical hysterectomy (removal of&#xD;
      the uterus, cervix, and the parametrium) or radical trachelectomy (removal of the cervix and&#xD;
      the parametrium). The parametrium is the tissue next to the uterus and cervix that holds&#xD;
      these organs in place. Pelvic lymph nodes and possibly para-aortic lymph nodes (near the&#xD;
      aorta in the abdomen) are also removed. This procedure is called a pelvic and para-aortic&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy. While these surgeries are very effective, significant side effects can&#xD;
      occur, such as bladder, bowel, and/or sexual dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conservative surgery involves the removal of the pelvic lymph nodes (pelvic lymphadenectomy)&#xD;
      and/or lymphatic mapping with sentinel lymph node biopsy. The cervix and parametrium are left&#xD;
      intact. During surgery, for women no longer wanting children, a simple hysterectomy (removal&#xD;
      of the uterus with or without removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries) can also be&#xD;
      performed. In this study, participants will have conservative surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signing this consent form does not mean that you will be able to take part in this study. You&#xD;
      will have &quot;screening tests&quot; to help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in&#xD;
      this study. The following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a cervical cone biopsy and endocervical curettage (ECC) performed. A cone&#xD;
      biopsy is surgery to remove a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix and cervical canal.&#xD;
      It is used to diagnose cervical cancer and also to learn how extensive the disease is. An ECC&#xD;
      is a procedure using a curette, a spoon-shaped instrument, that is used to scrape the mucus&#xD;
      membrane of the endocervical canal (passageway between cervix and uterus) in order to get a&#xD;
      tissue sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tissue taken from both of these procedures will be reviewed by a pathologist from&#xD;
      MDAnderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your tissue samples are negative for invasive cancer or adenocarcinoma-in-situ (AIS), you&#xD;
      will be eligible for conservative surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your tissue samples are positive for invasive cancer and/or AIS, you may have the cervical&#xD;
      cone biopsy and ECC repeated. If the tissue samples are negative after the second procedure,&#xD;
      you will be eligible for conservative surgery. If your tissue samples from the second&#xD;
      procedure are positive, you will be removed from study and other treatment options will be&#xD;
      offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conservative Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will have conservative&#xD;
      surgery. You will be taken to the operating room where you will be put to sleep using general&#xD;
      anesthesia. You will have your pelvic lymph nodes removed by pelvic lymph node dissection&#xD;
      and/or lymphatic mapping with sentinel lymph node biopsy, however, the parametrium is left&#xD;
      intact. If you no longer want to have children, you can have a simple hysterectomy. Removal&#xD;
      of the pelvic lymph nodes takes about 1-2 hours. If you also decide to have a simple&#xD;
      hysterectomy, this procedure will take about 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will sign a separate consent for this surgery/procedure, which will discuss the risks in&#xD;
      more detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, the following information will be collected from&#xD;
      your medical record and/or you will be asked for this information when you enroll in the&#xD;
      study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age at the time of the cancer diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Race&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height and weight to determine body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Menopausal status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of sexually transmitted diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Child bearing history&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will be collected from your medical record and/or you will be asked&#xD;
      for this information after surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How long the surgery took to complete&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What procedures were performed during the surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How long you were in the hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If there was any blood loss before or after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If blood transfusions were performed before or after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What complications, if any, happened that were related to the surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting 3 months after your first visit after surgery, you will have study visits every 3&#xD;
      months for 2 years. At these visits, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a pelvic exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a pap smear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be contacted by telephone or by mail every year for 3 years. You will be asked if&#xD;
      the cancer has returned, when you last saw your doctor, and any complications or problems you&#xD;
      may be having. If you are called, the call will take less than 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may remain on study for 5 years after surgery. You will be taken off study early if&#xD;
      either the lymph nodes or cervix (if a simple hysterectomy was performed) removed during&#xD;
      surgery contain cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 195 patients will take part in this multicenter&#xD;
      study. Up to 40 participants will be enrolled at MD Anderson and the Harris Health System.&#xD;
