      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to measure and delineate the symptom burden experienced by&#xD;
      patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary Aim is to develop and validate an M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) module&#xD;
      (the MDASI-CML), compliant with FDA standards for patient-reported outcomes (PROs), to&#xD;
      measure the severity of multiple symptoms and the impact of these symptoms on daily&#xD;
      functioning in patients with CML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Secondary Aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to develop a detailed description of the severity and interference with daily activities&#xD;
           of symptoms experienced by patients with CML;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to assess the impact of symptom severity in CML on standard functioning and quality of&#xD;
           life (QOL) measures including Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance&#xD;
           Status and single-item QOL scale;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to evaluate the MDASI-CML as an estimate of functional status and QOL in patients with&#xD;
           CML;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to identify common clusters of symptoms and symptom patterns occurring over multiple&#xD;
           measurement time points in patients with CML;&#xD;
&#xD;
      5, to define the qualitative symptom burden of patients with CML;&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. to explore the feasibility of the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system in measuring&#xD;
      symptom severity and interference with daily activities over time in patients with CML.&#xD;

      Part 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, while you are at the clinic for a visit, you will be&#xD;
      interviewed about what it is like to have CML. The interview should take about 30 minutes to&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the interview, you will be asked to answer a symptom questionnaire, a quality-of-life&#xD;
      questionnaire, and some demographic questions such as your age and marital status. It will&#xD;
      take about 10 minutes to complete all 3 questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you have completed the interview and questionnaires, your participation on this study&#xD;
      will be over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interview will be digitally recorded. The electronic record of the interview will not&#xD;
      have your name linked to it and it will be kept on a secure server at M. D. Anderson Cancer&#xD;
      Center that is password protected. All study materials will be destroyed after data analysis&#xD;
      is completed and study results reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about your symptoms collected in this study is collected for research purposes&#xD;
      only. If you are experiencing severe or troublesome symptoms, you should report them to your&#xD;
      doctor or nurse as well as rating them on the symptom assessment questionnaire. If the data&#xD;
      collector notices that you have rated a symptom as severe, the data collector will ask you if&#xD;
      your doctor or nurse is aware of the symptom or if you intend to report the symptom to your&#xD;
      doctor or nurse. If you have not or do not intend to report the symptom, the data collector&#xD;
      will let you know that he or she will report the symptom to your doctor or nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 218 participants will take part in this study. Up to 40 will be enrolled in Part 1 of&#xD;
      this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptom Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete a questionnaire about any symptoms&#xD;
      you are having every 2 weeks for 1 year. On the questionnaire, you will be asked to rate the&#xD;
      level of discomfort caused by the symptoms you are having and how the symptoms effect the&#xD;
      activities of your daily life. The symptom questionnaire should take about 5 minutes to&#xD;
      complete. You will complete the questionnaire during the first study visit and at your clinic&#xD;
      visits every 3 months. In between visits, you will be called every 2 weeks to complete the&#xD;
      questionnaire by an automated telephone system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will decide a convenient time and place for the automated phone system to call you. If&#xD;
      you are not available when the automated system calls, it will call you again at a later&#xD;
      time. You may also call the automated system if you miss a call. If you are not reached by&#xD;
      the automated phone system after several tries, the study staff will call you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given a secure user name and identification number to use with the automated&#xD;
      phone system. You will be shown how the automated phone system works by the study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two (2) days after the first visit, you will fill out the symptom questionnaire again. You&#xD;
      will take it home with you from the clinic with a pre-addressed, stamped envelope given to&#xD;
      you by the research staff so you can return it. The research staff will also ask for your&#xD;
      telephone number so that they may contact you and remind you to complete the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality-of-Life/Demographic Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit and the 3-month clinic visits, you will also rate your overall&#xD;
      quality-of-life. This should take about 1 minute to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, you will also be asked some demographic questions (such as your age and&#xD;
      marital status). Answering these questions should take about 1 minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opinion Questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are 1 of the first 30 patients enrolled in the study, at the first visit you will also&#xD;
      complete a questionnaire about your opinion of the symptom questionnaire. For example, you&#xD;
      will be asked if the symptom questionnaire was easy to understand and to complete and if&#xD;
      there were any other questions that should be included. The study staff will use your opinion&#xD;
      to decide if other important symptom questions are missing from the questionnaire. This&#xD;
      questionnaire should take about 5 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be on study for 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires will only use your study number and will not have your name linked to&#xD;
      them. All questionnaires and study data will be kept in a locked cabinet at all times. All&#xD;
      study materials will be destroyed after data analysis is completed and study results&#xD;
      reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about your symptoms collected in this study is collected for research purposes&#xD;
      only. If you are experiencing severe or troublesome symptoms, you should report them to your&#xD;
      doctor or nurse as well as rating them on the symptom assessment questionnaire. If the data&#xD;
      collector notices that you have rated a symptom as severe, the data collector will ask you if&#xD;
      your doctor or nurse is aware of the symptom or if you intend to report the symptom to your&#xD;
      doctor or nurse. If you have not or do not intend to report the symptom, the data collector&#xD;
      will let you know that he or she will report the symptom to your doctor or nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 218 participants will take part in this study. Up to 160 participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      in Part 3 of this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
