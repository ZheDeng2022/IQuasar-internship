      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID) is the most common gastrointestinal disease in&#xD;
      daily clinical practice. The disease is symptomatic but has no identifiable cause by standard&#xD;
      diagnostic tests such as endoscopy. It is characterized by its frequent relapses and thus the&#xD;
      disease causes a significant level of stress and anxiety to patients. Due to the complexity&#xD;
      and chronicity of the disease, it is believed that appropriate counseling on the nature and&#xD;
      management of the disease is necessary to decrease patient's anxiety level and improve&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have symptoms suggestive of FGID including non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux&#xD;
      disease (NERD), functional dyspepsia (FD) or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To validate the effectiveness of counseling in patients suffering from FGID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients recruited to the study will follow the usual management of patients attending the&#xD;
      Gastroenterology specialty clinic in Prince of Wales Hospital. Standard blood tests and&#xD;
      endoscopy will be performed. Standard medication will be given to the patients for 8 weeks&#xD;
      after endoscopy and the patients will come back to the specialty clinic for a final visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be given an &quot;on-demand follow up within 1 year&quot; option at final visit. The&#xD;
      patient will decide if he/she wants to come back to our specialty clinic to follow up his/her&#xD;
      problem within one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up after Final Visit Follow-up questionnaires will be mailed to patients 6 months, 1&#xD;
      and 2 years after Final visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will be randomized into two groups in First Visit: 1) Control group, and 2)&#xD;
      Counseling group. Both groups of patients will follow the above protocol, except that 2 extra&#xD;
      counseling sessions will be arranged for the Counseling group immediately after visiting the&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients recruited to the study will follow the usual management of patients attending the&#xD;
      Gastroenterology specialty clinic in Prince of Wales Hospital, along with the following&#xD;
      protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient signs written consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attending physician manages patient as usual&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests will be arranged for patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  FD &amp; NERD patients: CBC w/ differential count, LFT, TFT, random glucose&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  IBS patients: CBC w/ differential count, LFT, TFT, ESR, C-reactive protein&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient completes questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopy Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endoscopy examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  FD &amp; NERD patients: oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) with rapid urea test (RUT)&#xD;
                and biopsy of antrum sample for histology to check h. pylori status&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  IBS patients: colonoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If no organic causes are found to explain for FGI symptoms, the following standard&#xD;
           medication will be prescribed for 8 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      FD: Pantoprazole 40mg daily; GERD: Pantoprazole 40mg daily; IBS: Mebeverine 135mg tid PRN&#xD;
      before meal, Loperamide 4mg tid PRN (for diarrhea), Metamucil 2 teaspoon bid (for&#xD;
      constipation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final Visit (8 weeks after endoscopy visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attending physician manages patient as usual&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Printout of investigation (endoscopy, blood tests) reports given to patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient completes questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be given an &quot;on-demand follow up within 1 year&quot; option at this visit. The&#xD;
      patient will decide if he/she wants to come back to our specialty clinic to follow up his/her&#xD;
      problem within one year. If the patient does not come back during this period, his/her case&#xD;
      will be closed and a new referral will be required if he/she wants to be taken care by the&#xD;
      specialty again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up after Final Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up questionnaires will be mailed to patients 6 months, 1 and 2 years after Final&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will be randomized into two groups in First Visit: 1) Control group, and 2)&#xD;
      Counseling group. Both groups of patients will follow the above protocol, except that 2 extra&#xD;
      counseling sessions will be arranged for the Counseling group immediately after visiting the&#xD;
      physician:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Counseling at first visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Contents include: prevalence of FGID in Hong Kong, chronicity nature of the disease,&#xD;
      negative endoscopy result to be expected, time to answer patient's questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Counseling at final visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Contents include: prevalence of FGID in Hong Kong (reinforcement), chronicity nature of the&#xD;
      disease (reinforcement), explanation of the endoscopy result, management of disease via&#xD;
      lifestyle modification, use of medication, need for further or repeated investigation, time&#xD;
      to answer patient's questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research personnel who has been working with patients with FGID for at least one year will&#xD;
      be responsible for the counseling service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The random allocation sequence will be obtained from a computer-generated list of random&#xD;
      numbers in blocks of 10 supplied by a trial statistician. Concealed allocation is achieved by&#xD;
      an independent research staff who assigns intervention group according to consecutive numbers&#xD;
      in sealed envelopes. The patients will be invited to participate in the study to assess 1 of&#xD;
      2 potentially helpful interventions. They will be explained that the relative effectiveness&#xD;
      of both interventions are unproven and may or may not be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the patients, attending physicians and endoscopes will all be blinded to the&#xD;
      randomized arm that the patients are assigned to. The nature of the two arms will also be&#xD;
      blinded to them. This arrangement is essential in clinical trials comparing different&#xD;
      services or managing strategies and is clearly specified in the Patient Information Sheet.&#xD;
