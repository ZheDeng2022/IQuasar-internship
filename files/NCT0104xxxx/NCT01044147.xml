  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With over half of the US population currently overweight and 31% of adults now obese, the&#xD;
      primary care setting may represent an important source of weight-loss support, in the&#xD;
      interest of cardiovascular prevention. Yet, although the US Preventive Services task force&#xD;
      recommends that physicians screen all adult patients for obesity and offer intensive&#xD;
      counseling and behavioral interventions to promote sustained weight loss for obese adults,&#xD;
      the recommendation has not been widely implemented. The Internet may help overcome many of&#xD;
      the barriers that have prevented intensive obesity counseling in the clinical setting. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to examine whether Internet-based interventions for developing healthier&#xD;
      lifestyles can improve preventive health care in a cost-effective manner.&#xD;

      The study, Online counseling to enable lifestyle-focused obesity treatment in primary care,&#xD;
      aims to translate an evidence-based lifestyle intervention into the primary care setting,&#xD;
      using information technology to enable clinical lifestyle counseling. While the US Preventive&#xD;
      Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that clinicians screen all adult patients for obesity&#xD;
      and offer intensive counseling and behavioral interventions to promote sustained weight loss&#xD;
      for obese adults, multiple barriers to intensive lifestyle counseling exist and the&#xD;
      recommendation has not been widely implemented. By requiring physician referral, augmenting&#xD;
      the health care team's access to behavioral expertise, and encouraging physician feedback to&#xD;
      participating patients, we aim to integrate lifestyle issues into routine preventive&#xD;
      medicine. We will examine change in weight, waist circumference, physical activity, quality&#xD;
      of life, and will calculate intervention cost-effectiveness. We will ensure sustainability by&#xD;
      using recruitment and adherence strategies that can be replicated in routine practice, and&#xD;
      counseling staff who are representative of the educators employed in primary care practice.&#xD;
      If an online strategy is effective, the extensive network of the University of Pittsburgh&#xD;
      Medical Center Health System provides excellent infrastructure for supporting dissemination&#xD;
      in the region. As such, this study may facilitate wide-spread adoption of current&#xD;
      evidence-based preventive medicine guidelines recommending incorporation of intensive&#xD;
      lifestyle interventions into primary care practice.&#xD;
