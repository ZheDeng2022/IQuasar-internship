  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock is a frequent reason for admission on pediatric intensive care units.&#xD;
      Interventions which can change morbidity and mortality of septic shock patients are of great&#xD;
      interest. Steroid replacement in adults with severe sepsis and septic shock have been&#xD;
      extensively studied. It was recently demonstrated that low dose steroid (&lt; 300mg/ day) used&#xD;
      for more than 5 days was associated with decreased mortality and lower requirement of&#xD;
      vasoactive support in the adult population that had a low response to the ACTH test. However,&#xD;
      this was not confirmed in the latest results from the CORTICUS study. Use of low dose&#xD;
      hydrocortisone, or any other steroid has not been studied in critically ill children.&#xD;
      Mortality associated with sepsis in children has decreased in the last decade and currently&#xD;
      it is close to 10%, making it difficult to power a study able to show reduced mortality.&#xD;
      Taking into account the results from previous studies reporting the high incidence of adrenal&#xD;
      failure and its association to worse outcome, we have designed a clinical trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of low dose hydrocortisone in children with septic shock: Cortisol Replacement in&#xD;
      Children with Sepsis Study.&#xD;

      Hypothesis Pediatric patients with septic shock have a high incidence of failure to respond&#xD;
      to the ACTH test and would benefit of steroid replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Randomized double-blind placebo controlled clinical trail. Outcome Primary: number of&#xD;
      days free of vasoactive support after 7 days of septic shock diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children admitted to PICU will be possible enrolled. Inclusion criteria will be (I) age&#xD;
      between 1 month and 16 years; (II) septic shock according to the definitions of pediatric&#xD;
      septic shock 2005; (III) inotrope requirement, as in dopamine &gt; 5 mcg/kg/mim, dobutamine &gt; 5&#xD;
      mcg/kg/min or any dose of noradrenaline or adrenaline after adequate fluid resuscitation.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria will be patients with (I) baseline disease associated to HPA axis&#xD;
      dysfunction; (II) steroid use in the past 4 weeks; (III) previous use of etomidate; (IV)&#xD;
      formal indication for steroids use, and (V) formal contraindication to steroid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be stratified by age, gender, PRISM category, failure to respond to ACTH test,&#xD;
      surgical patients, chronic patient, baseline cardiac and oncological disease and presence of&#xD;
      ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydrocortisone 6 mg/kg/day, 8 hourly, during 7 days or during the vasoactive drug infusion.&#xD;
      The control group will receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be carried through numbered envelopes, randomized prior to the study&#xD;
      beginning, in blocks of 10, ratio 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identical vials with hydrocortisone or placebo will be prepared in an industrial pharmacy and&#xD;
      labeled using alphabetic letters (A, B, C, D) before the beginning of the study. Each vial of&#xD;
      hydrocortisone will have 100 mg of hydrocortisone ponder to be diluted in 10 ml of normal&#xD;
      saline 0.9% Each vial of placebo will content a innocuous ponder, also to be diluted in 10 ml&#xD;
      of normal saline 0.9%. The drug and its referent letter (A, B, C, D) will be controlled by&#xD;
      two lists, handed in by the pharmacist to the researchers inside closed envelopes before the&#xD;
      beginning of the study. After enrollment and randomization, children joining the study will&#xD;
      have baseline cortisol and ACTH measured. ACTH testes (1 mcg/ 1.75m2 and 250 mcg) will be&#xD;
      performed, 4 hours apart. After this, patients will receive the study drug (either&#xD;
      hydrocortisone or placebo), 0.2 ml/kg/ dose, 8 hourly. This will last the period the patient&#xD;
      requires vasoactive support, or a maximum of 7 days. Daily routine blood results will be&#xD;
      noted, as well as a further ACTH test on day 3 if the patient is still on vasoactive support.&#xD;
      Demographic data will be collected on enrollment.&#xD;
