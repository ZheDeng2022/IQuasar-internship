  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, single-arm, single-center, open-label study to evaluate the&#xD;
      preliminary safety and accuracy of the ActiSight™ Needle Guidance System in patients&#xD;
      undergoing CT-guided percutaneous aspiration and RF Ablations The procedure will be performed&#xD;
      by a trained physician. Subjects will be screened for inclusion in the study. Following&#xD;
      signing of informed consent, screening procedures will be performed including demographic and&#xD;
      medical history, vital signs, anthropometrics), chest radiography, if applicable and CT&#xD;
      scanning, blood samples for coagulation indices (PT, APTT), if applicable, and pregnancy test&#xD;
      in women of child-bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within an 18-day screening period, eligible subjects will be enrolled into the study and&#xD;
      undergo percutaneous aspiration or percutaneous biopsy or RF ablation utilizing the&#xD;
      ActiSight™ Needle Guidance system using CT to guide the needle. Subjects will be followed-up&#xD;
      for at least one hour at the clinic for safety and preliminary accuracy evaluations. An erect&#xD;
      chest radiograph will be performed within 90 minutes of observation after chest aspiration if&#xD;
      performed to detect the majority of post procedure pneumothoraces for biopsies in the chest.&#xD;
      Post procedural CT will be performed according to the physician's consideration. ** Note **&#xD;
      If any complications are observed while using the ActiSight System, the investigator will&#xD;
      revert to using standard procedure.&#xD;
