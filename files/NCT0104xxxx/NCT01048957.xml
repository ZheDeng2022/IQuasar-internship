      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - One kind of drug craving, known as cue-elicited craving, occurs when a drug user who sees a&#xD;
      drug-related cue (such as an image of someone using the drug) begins to feel a craving for&#xD;
      the drug. Researchers are interested in studying how cue-elicited craving affects brain&#xD;
      activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG)&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine which parts of the brain are associated with or involved in controlling&#xD;
      cue-related craving in smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 50 years of age who are current smokers (10 or more cigarettes&#xD;
      per day) and agree to try to abstain from smoking for 1 week during the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will visit a clinical center for up to four scanning sessions, and will be&#xD;
           asked to perform two or three outpatient tasks at home over the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scan 1: Training session with a mock fMRI scanner, followed by an actual fMRI scanning&#xD;
           session and EEG in which participants respond to pictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outpatient Task 1: Tolerance test with nicotine patch (worn for 8 hours, followed by 12&#xD;
           additional hours without cigarette use).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scans 2 and 3: Training session and fMRI scan and testing with either nicotine patch or&#xD;
           placebo. Tasks in fMRI involve looking at cues, reporting craving and suppressing&#xD;
           craving.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outpatient Task 2: Participants will keep an electronic diary for 10 to 14 days,&#xD;
           responding to questions as directed by the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scans 4 and 5: Training session, fMRI scan and EEG, and testing in which participants&#xD;
           will be instructed on methods to attempt to control cravings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outpatient Task 3: Participants will keep an electronic diary for 14 days. For the first&#xD;
           7 days, participants will be asked to attempt to abstain from nicotine; participants may&#xD;
           smoke normally on the second 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be contacted 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the end of the study for&#xD;
           follow-up questions on current smoking habits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective: Drug craving is a motivational state associated with a conscious desire to consume&#xD;
      a drug (Fredrickson et al., 1995; Drummond, 2001). When drug abusers see drug-related cues,&#xD;
      cue-elicited drug craving is induced (Drummond, 2001). The main goal of this investigation is&#xD;
      to ascertain the neural basis of cue-elicited drug (e.g. cigarette) craving and its control&#xD;
      in smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The experimental population for this investigation is nicotine-dependent&#xD;
      adults aged 18-50 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Participants will see the smoking-related cue or neutral cue and complete cognitive&#xD;
      tasks (e.g. to report or regulate their craving, etc). At same time, we will employ&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (rtfMRI), and electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: There is no direct benefit to the participant by joining this study. Data&#xD;
      from this study are expected to contribute to a better understanding of the neural processes&#xD;
      of cigarette craving. Thus, the results may benefit the health of society. MRI-related risks&#xD;
      (e.g., injury from metal implants, claustrophobia, and temporary hearing threshold&#xD;
      alterations due to the loud banging noises) and nicotine-patch-related risks (e.g.,&#xD;
      dizziness, headache, upset stomach, vomiting, diarrhea, redness or swelling at the patch&#xD;
      site) to participants are minimized by careful prescreening and standard protection.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants must:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Be between the ages of 18-50. Justification: Many cognitive processes change with age.&#xD;
             In addition, the risk of difficult-to-detect medical abnormalities such as silent&#xD;
             cerebral infarcts increases with age. Therefore, older individuals, defined as those&#xD;
             over 50, will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Be in good health. Justification: Many illnesses can alter fMRI signal, and cognition.&#xD;
             Assessment tool(s): Participants will provide a brief health history during phone&#xD;
             screening, and undergo a history and physical examination with a qualified IRP&#xD;
             clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Be right-handed. Justification: Many of the brain functions to be assessed in this&#xD;
             protocol have shown some evidence of being lateralized in the brain. In order to&#xD;
             reduce the variance in the data from this possibility, participants must be&#xD;
             right-handed. Assessment tool(s): Edinburgh Handedness Inventory&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Be free of dependence on other substances (except nicotine). Justification: Dependence&#xD;
             on other substances may result in unique CNS deficits that would increase the noise in&#xD;
             our data. Assessment tool(s): Substance Use Disorders module of the SCID with&#xD;
             confirmation by clinical interview and negative urine drug screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Must smoke greater than or equal to 10 cigarettes per day for at least two years, with&#xD;
             urine cotinine levels of at least 100ng/ml and score on the Fagerstrom Test for&#xD;
             Nicotine Dependence (FTND) must be greater than or equal to 2. Justification: The aim&#xD;
             is to study phenomena that are linked to nicotine dependence and that occur with&#xD;
             regular and frequent smoking. Assessment tool(s): Self-report, a urine cotinine test&#xD;
             (smokers will be defined as having cotinine levels greater than or equal to 100ng/mL),&#xD;
             and FTND test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. All participants should be able to abstain from alcohol for 24 hours and no more than&#xD;
             1/2 cup of caffeine for 12 hours before each experiment session. Justification:&#xD;
             Alcohol and caffeine may result in brain that influences our data. Assessment tool(s):&#xD;
             Self-report and breathalyzer test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants will be excluded if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Are not suitable to undergo an fMRI experiment due to pregnancy, implanted metallic&#xD;
             devices (cardiac pacemaker or neurostimulator, some artificial joints, metal pins,&#xD;
             surgical clips or other implanted metal parts), body morphology or claustrophobia.&#xD;
             Justification: MR scanning is one of the primary measurement tools used in the&#xD;
             protocol. Assessment tool(s): Prospective participants will fill out an MRI screening&#xD;
             questionnaire and undergo an interview with an MR technologist. Pregnancy tests will&#xD;
             be performed on all female participants of childbearing age before each experimental&#xD;
             session. Questions concerning suitability for scanning will be referred to the MR&#xD;
             Medical Safety Officer. Prospective participants will be questioned about symptoms of&#xD;
             claustrophobia and placed in the mock scanner during their first visit to assess for&#xD;
             possible difficulty tolerating the confinement of the scanner and for ability to fit&#xD;
             into the scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have coagulopathies, history of, current superficial, or deep vein thrombosis,&#xD;
             musculoskeletal abnormalities restricting an individual s ability to lie flat for&#xD;
             extended periods of time. Justification: MR scanning sessions require participants to&#xD;
             lie flat on their backs and remain perfectly still for approximately two hours.&#xD;
             Therefore, conditions that would make that difficult (e.g. chronic back pain,&#xD;
             significant scoliosis) or dangerous (e.g. familial hypercoagulability syndrome,&#xD;
             history of thrombosis) will be exclusionary. Assessment tool(s): History and physical&#xD;
             examination by a qualified IRP clinician, supplemented with a trial of lying in the&#xD;
             mock scanner to assess comfort issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have HIV or Syphilis. Justification: HIV and Syphilis can both have CNS sequelae, thus&#xD;
             introducing unnecessary variability into the data. Assessment tool(s): HIV blood test&#xD;
             and RPR+.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have any neurological illnesses to include, but not limited to, seizure disorders,&#xD;
             migraine (&gt;2/yr or on prophylaxis), multiple sclerosis, movement disorders, or history&#xD;
             of significant head trauma, CVA, CNS tumor. Justification: CNS diseases alter CNS&#xD;
             function and, possibly, the neuronal-vascular coupling that forms the basis of the&#xD;
             BOLD fMRI signal to be used in this study. Assessment tool(s): History and physical&#xD;
             examination by a qualified IRP clinician, urine drug screening for anticonvulsants not&#xD;
             disclosed by history. History of head trauma with loss of consciousness of more than 5&#xD;
             minutes or with post-concussive sequelae lasting more than two days, regardless of&#xD;
             loss of consciousness, will be exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have other major medical illnesses likely to interfere with study results or safety of&#xD;
             an individual during participation. Justification: Many illness not covered here may&#xD;
             increase risk or alter important outcome measures. Assessment tool(s): History and&#xD;
             physical examination by a qualified IRP clinician and CBC, urinalysis, NIDA chemistry&#xD;
             panel (liver function tests, electrolytes, kidney function). The following individual&#xD;
             laboratory results will independently disqualify individuals. The MRP will retain&#xD;
             discretion to exclude at less extreme values, depending on the clinical presentation,&#xD;
             and will make the final judgment on any questionable lab results&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  WBC &lt; 2400/microl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  LFTs &gt; 3 times normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  HCG positive&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum glucose &gt; 200 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Urine protein &gt; 2 plus&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum cholesterol level&gt; 250 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have any current major psychiatric disorders to include, but not limited to, mood,&#xD;
             anxiety, psychotic disorders, or substance-induced psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
             Justification: Psychiatric disorders involve the central neural system (CNS) and,&#xD;
             therefore, can be expected to alter the fMRI measures being used in this study.&#xD;
             Assessment tool(s): Computerized SCID-NP, ASRS (adult ADHD self-report scale) and&#xD;
             DSM-IV (DSM-IV, APA, 1994) confirmed by clinician interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Regularly use any prescription, over-the-counter or herbal medication that may alter&#xD;
             CNS function, cardiovascular function or neuronal-vascular coupling. Justification:&#xD;
             Compounds that alter BOLD signal will alter the primary measure used in the study.&#xD;
             Assessment tool(s): History and comprehensive urine drug screening to detect&#xD;
             antidepressants, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, barbiturates and&#xD;
             other common medications and drugs of abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Are cognitively impaired or learning disabled. Justification: Cognitive impairment and&#xD;
             learning disabilities are associated with alterations in brain regions used to&#xD;
             accomplish tasks, and, therefore, may introduce significant variably into the data. In&#xD;
             addition, cognitive impairment may affect ability to give informed consent. Assessment&#xD;
             tool(s): History of known learning disability or cognitive impairment. Vocabulary&#xD;
             subtest of the WASI will be given. IQ estimate must be over 85 (corresponding to a&#xD;
             vocabulary subtest score &gt; 48). In cases of suspected non-verbal learning disability&#xD;
             or mild verbal deficit, a full WASI may be given to obtain a more robust estimate of&#xD;
             IQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Significant cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases. Justification: Such conditions&#xD;
             can alter and distort BOLD and autonomic signals and increase the risks associated&#xD;
             with nicotine patch use. Assessment tool(s): History and physical exam, including&#xD;
             12-lead ECG.&#xD;
