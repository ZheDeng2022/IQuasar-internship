  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of 5-Fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine&#xD;
      (FdCyd) when given together with tetrahydrouridine (THU) in treating patients with acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). FdCyd may inhibit cancer cell&#xD;
      growth by increasing the production in cells of compounds that suppress growth or by&#xD;
      otherwise killing cells. Although FdCyd is stable as a drug solution, it is rapidly&#xD;
      inactivated by an enzyme present in people. THU is included in the treatment to inhibit the&#xD;
      enzyme, prolonging the time FdCyd remains in the body&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of FdCyd administered with a fixed&#xD;
      dose of THU in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome&#xD;
      (MDS), once daily on days 1-10 of a 21-day treatment cycle. II. To describe the toxicities of&#xD;
      FdCyd/THU in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome&#xD;
      (MDS). III. To document all clinical responses and hematologic improvement in patients&#xD;
      treated with FdCyd/THU. IV. To obtain preliminary information regarding the effect of&#xD;
      FdCyd/THU on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cells and bone marrow aspirates, including malignant myeloid cells; the ratio of gamma- to&#xD;
      beta-globin messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in blood cells; and serum cytokines. OUTLINE:&#xD;
      This is a dose-escalation study of FdCyd. Patients receive FdCyd intravenously (IV) over 3&#xD;
      hours and THU IV over 3 hours on days 1-10. Courses repeat every 21days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients&#xD;
      are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;
