      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the new micropulse 577 nm yellow laser is a&#xD;
      better treatment option compared to the conventional 532 nm green laser for diabetic macular&#xD;
      edema.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a serious debilitating and deadly disease causing significant&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity globally. Diabetic macular oedema is the most common cause of visual&#xD;
      loss in the working population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1985, the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) demonstrated that focal&#xD;
      (direct/grid) laser photocoagulation reduces moderate vision loss from diabetic macular&#xD;
      oedema (DMO) by 50% or more. However, further studies have shown that photocoagulation can&#xD;
      eventually result in complications leading to loss of central vision and decreased colour&#xD;
      vision. Thus, many newer laser machines that claim to reduce the rate of complications have&#xD;
      been developed over the years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, we plan to evaluate the usage of the micropulse 577 nm laser, which is a&#xD;
      yellow light laser, and compare it to the conventional 532 nm green laser that is widely&#xD;
      used. The 577 nm laser has a high affinity for oxyhemoglobin, a slightly lower affinity for&#xD;
      melanin and almost no affinity for macular xanthophylls, as shown in the graph&#xD;
      below.22,23,24,25 The yellow 577 nm light also scatters very little and does not cause&#xD;
      photochemical reactions in the tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The theoretical advantage of using the micropulse 577 nm yellow laser would be the reduced&#xD;
      energy requirement to obtain the same results as with green 532 nm. This leads to less&#xD;
      retinal toxicity and damage due to reduced absorption by the xanthophylls. Our aim in this&#xD;
      project is to observe whether the theoretical advantage translates to a more effective&#xD;
      treatment in reality.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diabetes mellitus (type 1 or 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diabetic macular edema in study eye associated to diabetic retinopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diffuse macular edema defined as macular thickening determined by biomicroscopy, OCT&#xD;
             and/or fluorescein angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Best corrected visual acuity between 34 (20/200) and 68 letters (20/50).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Macular thickness greater than 300 mcm on OCT.&#xD;

          -  Significant renal disease, defined as a history of chronic renal failure requiring&#xD;
             dialysis or kidney transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in&#xD;
             the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure, cardiovascular&#xD;
             disease, and glycemic control).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 (systolic above 180 OR diastolic above 110).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is expecting to move out of the area of the clinical center to an area not&#xD;
             covered by another clinical center during the next 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following exclusions apply to the study eye only (i.e., they may be present for the&#xD;
        nonstudy eye):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Macular edema is considered to be due to a cause other than diabetic macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of vitreomacular traction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent proliferative diabetic retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the investigator, visual&#xD;
             acuity loss would not improve from resolution of macular edema (e.g., foveal atrophy,&#xD;
             pigment abnormalities, dense subfoveal hard exudates, significant macular ischemia,&#xD;
             nonretinal condition).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An ocular condition is present (other than diabetes) that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity during the course of&#xD;
             the study (e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis epiretinal membrane, or other ocular&#xD;
             inflammatory disease, neovascular glaucoma, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to be&#xD;
             decreasing visual acuity by 3 lines or more (i.e., cataract would be reducing acuity&#xD;

             macular photocoagulation, intravitreal or peribulbar corticosteroids, anti-VEGF drugs,&#xD;
             or any other treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of panretinal (scatter) photocoagulation (PRP) prior to enrollment or&#xD;
             anticipated to be performed within next 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of major ocular surgery (including vitrectomy, cataract extraction, scleral&#xD;
             buckle, any intraocular surgery, etc.) within prior 12 months or anticipated within&#xD;
             the next 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of YAG capsulotomy performed within 2 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
