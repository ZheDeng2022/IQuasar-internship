      The study aims to help us understand if the HIV drugs darunavir (taken with ritonavir) and&#xD;
      raltegravir will affect each other when they are given at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (how a drug is absorbed,&#xD;
      distributed and eliminated from your body) of darunavir and ritonavir when these are taken&#xD;
      with and without raltegravir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the study will be up to 50 days plus a screening visit which will take place&#xD;
      up to 4 weeks prior to the start of the study, and a follow up visit which takes place 1-2&#xD;
      weeks after the last dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will continue to take 2 of their usual drugs (those called nucleoside reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase inhibitors -NRTI) throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first 21 days subjects will take their usual NRTI plus raltegravir 400mg twice daily.&#xD;
      After this, subjects will also receive either:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1) Darunavir/ritonavir 800mg/100mg once daily AND raltegravir 400mg twice daily or&#xD;
      Group 2) Darunavir/ritonavir 800mg/100mg once daily AND raltegravir 800mg once daily&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will take this regimen for 14 days. Subjects will be randomly allocated to either&#xD;
      Group 1 or 2. You will have an equal (50/50) chance of being allocated to Group 1 or 2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The integrase inhibitor raltegravir has shown to a potent new agent for the treatment of HIV&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When raltegravir and darunavir/ritonavir have been combined in the Benchmark studies, they&#xD;
      provided an excellent virological response in highly experienced patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Darunavir once daily use is increasing due to patients' preference for once daily regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Raltegravir has not shown any pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship and doses of 100&#xD;
      to 400 mg twice daily have shown similar virological responses. This may be due to&#xD;
      intracellular drug accumulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, data on the use of darunavir/r plus raltegravir once daily and on raltegravir&#xD;
      intracellular concentrations are not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether raltegravir is efficacious when administered once daily is unknown. However,&#xD;
      concentrations higher the IC95 of 33nM have been associated to a favourable virological&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we would like to investigate the plasma and intracellular pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      darunavir/ritonavir and raltegravir when co-administered once daily in order to provide&#xD;
      further data to support the use of these agents once daily, patients' preferred dosing&#xD;
      schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacogenetics holds promise in HIV treatment because of the complexity and potential&#xD;
      toxicity of multi antiretroviral drug therapies that are prescribed for long periods. Thus&#xD;
      far, few candidate genes have been examined for a limited number of allelic variants, but a&#xD;
      number of confirmed associations have already emerged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a public health perspective, as antiretroviral medications become increasingly available&#xD;
      to racially and ethnically diverse populations worldwide, understanding the genetic&#xD;
      structures of each population may allow us to anticipate the impact of adverse responses,&#xD;
      even in groups that were not represented in drug registration trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing literature on pharmacogenetic determinants of antiretroviral drug exposure, drug&#xD;
      toxicity, as well as genetic markers associated with the rate of disease progression&#xD;
      underline the recent advances which occurred in the past few years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it is expected that larger-scale comprehensive genome approaches will profoundly&#xD;
      change the landscape of knowledge in the future. Additional studies are needed to assess the&#xD;
      implications for long-term responses to antiretroviral agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason we plan to collect a single blood sample from each participant in our&#xD;
      intensive pharmacokinetic studies, such as this one, in order to be able to investigate the&#xD;
      association between genetic polymorphisms in drug disposition genes (such as those encoding&#xD;
      for cytochrome P450 isoenzymes or transmembrane transporters) and drug exposure. A candidate&#xD;
      gene approach will be utilised to examine loci of interest. This procedure will provide&#xD;
      potentially important information on genetic influences on plasma drug concentrations and&#xD;
      give insight into how to improve the management of HIV-infected patients by individualising&#xD;
      therapy. These studies will not be powered for genetic associations but will enable us to&#xD;
      build a data base of genotype-phenotype. Prospective genetic studies would need to be planned&#xD;
      based on these preliminary data.&#xD;
