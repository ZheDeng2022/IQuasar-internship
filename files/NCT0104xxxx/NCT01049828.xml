  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tinnitus is the occurrence of an auditory sensation without the presence of an acoustic&#xD;
      stimulus. Approximately, 50 million people in the United States experience chronic tinnitus&#xD;
      and 15 million of these people have bothersome tinnitus. Several studies have shown that&#xD;
      people who are bothered by their tinnitus have difficulty in concentration and focus. Through&#xD;
      imaging modalities we have deranged neural networks responsible for attention. Only 20&#xD;
      percent of patients diagnosed with tinnitus are severely bothered. We seek the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Match a group of non-bothered tinnitus patients on age and hearing status to an existing&#xD;
           cohort of bothered tinnitus patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the resting-state neural connectivity in patients with non-bothersome tinnitus.&#xD;
           Findings from the comparison of functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
           (fcMRI) from subjects with bothersome tinnitus in our current rTMS clinical trial to&#xD;
           normal age-matched controls without tinnitus demonstrates that subjects with bothersome&#xD;
           tinnitus have dramatic alterations in cortical attention and control networks. Our&#xD;
           hypothesis is that the fcMRI-defined changes in the attention and control networks&#xD;
           reflect the impact of excessive auditory stimulation in patients with bothersome&#xD;
           tinnitus and explains the difficulty with concentration, short-term memory, and other&#xD;
           common problems. To fully test this hypothesis we need to obtain fcMRI of the attention&#xD;
           network among subjects with tinnitus but without bother and compare the status of their&#xD;
           neural networks with those of tinnitus subjects with bother and with normal controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare the resting cortical networks in subjects with non-bothersome tinnitus to&#xD;
           subjects with bothersome tinnitus and subjects without tinnitus Our null hypothesis is&#xD;
           that there are no differences in the resting-state cortical networks, especially the&#xD;
           attention and control networks, between tinnitus patients who do not experience bother,&#xD;
           tinnitus patients who do experience bother, and subjects without tinnitus. Through&#xD;
           fcMRI, we will examine correlations in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals in&#xD;
           established auditory, attention, control, and other brain regions in the resting brain&#xD;
           and compare these findings to already collected fcMRI scans of bothered tinnitus&#xD;
           patients, and controls (patients without tinnitus).&#xD;

        20 adults between the ages of 45 and 60 years, age and hearing level-matched to the&#xD;
        bothered tinnitus cohort from the on-going research at Washington University. Subjects will&#xD;
        be recruited from an institutional tinnitus database, from Washington University&#xD;
        Otolaryngology Clinics, as well as the general public through poster advertisement on the&#xD;
        Washington University grounds.&#xD;
