      In order to investigate whether the pain in women with vulvodynia may represent bladder&#xD;
      origin pain, we will be performing a diagnostic test for interstitial cystitis (IC) in women&#xD;
      with generalized vulvodynia. Those women with a positive test for IC, we will be performing a&#xD;
      series of bladder treatments (instillations) for IC and checking symptoms throughout the&#xD;
      trial to see if significant relief of vulvar pain can be obtained through treatment for IC.&#xD;

      A TRIAL OF INTRAVESICAL THERAPY FOR INTERSTITIAL CYSTITIS IN PATIENTS WITH GENERALIZED&#xD;
      VULVODYNIA&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interstitial Cystitis (IC) is a urologic pain syndrome. The classic symptoms of IC are&#xD;
      frequency, urgency and pain (dysuria) in the absence of an infection or other obvious source.&#xD;
      IC has also been described as a visceral pain syndrome. In recent years, less common&#xD;
      presentations of IC have been reported in women with primary symptoms of gynecologic pain&#xD;
      such as endometriosis, dysparunia and vulvodynia1. This aim of this study is to further&#xD;
      characterize the relationship between vulvodynia and IC and to see if a brief course of&#xD;
      initial therapy for IC can relieve symptoms of generalized vulvodynia (GV)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic criteria for IC, agreed to in the mid 1980's at an NIDDK conference, was&#xD;
      developed for research purposes. These criteria require cystoscopy with hydrodistention in&#xD;
      the operating room under general anesthesia. There also are multiple exclusionary criteria&#xD;
      for diagnosis which limit its utility. The end result is that up to 60% of cases of IC can be&#xD;
      missed using NIDDK criteria for the diagnosis of IC2. Because of these limitations,&#xD;
      cystoscopy is now used less often for diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, the potassium sensitivity test (PST) and the &quot;anesthetic challenge&quot; have&#xD;
      been developed as alternative tests for the diagnosis of IC. These newer diagnostic&#xD;
      techniques are less invasive and less painful than cystoscopy with hydrodistention, and are&#xD;
      now fairly well accepted for diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      My colleagues &amp; I first reported on a group of patients with vulvodynia who were noted to&#xD;
      have IC as diagnosed by the PST1,3. This initial data collection was part of study of a&#xD;
      larger group of patients with pelvic pain who were screened for urinary symptoms and tested&#xD;
      for IC using the PST. Last month, we reported solely a series of patients presenting with GV&#xD;
      who were tested for IC using the PST3. In this most recent report, 102 / 122 (84%) of&#xD;
      patients with GV were found to have a positive PST. These data suggest that many patients&#xD;
      with vulvodynia may have pain of bladder origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2008, Welk and Teichman report on a group of patients with IC treated with an alkinalized&#xD;
      heparin-lidocaine solution instilled into the bladder (intravesical treatment) for the&#xD;
      treatment of dysparunia 4. They found that 15/23 (65%) patients reported improvements of&#xD;
      greater than 50% on the Patient Objective Rating of Improvement of Symptom scale. This report&#xD;
      demonstrates that a brief course of treatment for IC can result in significant symptom&#xD;
      relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravesical treatment of IC using a heparin-lidocaine-bicarbonate solution has become common&#xD;
      first line treatment for many patients diagnosed with IC. Its use has been reported as part&#xD;
      of an algorithm for the care of patients newly diagnosed with IC5. It is commonly used in&#xD;
      conjunction with multi-modal treatment for IC, but as Welk &amp; Teichman's paper demonstrates,&#xD;
      it can be used alone with impressive initial results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no reported head-to-head comparisons of different instillations therapies. Most&#xD;
      instillation therapies contain heparin. Heparin is a constituent of the normal&#xD;
      glycaso-aminoglycan (GAG) mucosal barrier in the bladder. In patients with IC, this mucosal&#xD;
      barrier is thought to be defective, specifically with regard to the presence of heparin. The&#xD;
      heparin is thought to &quot;rebuild&quot; the mucosal barrier in the bladder. Many bladder instillation&#xD;
      therapies also contain an anesthetic such as lidocaine. The anesthetic is thought to directly&#xD;
      treat nerves in and around the bladder through desensitization. Sodium bicarbonate acts to&#xD;
      alkinalize the solution which has also been theorized to help with absorption or direct&#xD;
      treatment. Lastly, we have found that some patients have had an initial burning sensation for&#xD;
      several minutes with the concentrated three ingredient formula and that a small amount of&#xD;
      sterile water helps to prevent this. Therefore we add the sterile water to all bladder&#xD;
      instillations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that, in many cases, patients with vulvodynia have pain that is referred from the&#xD;
      bladder. The next logical step in defining the relationship between vulovodynia and IC is to&#xD;
      offer a short course of intravesical treatment for IC to patients with GV after diagnosis and&#xD;
      observe for symptom relief. We plan to perform a potassium sensitivity test for diagnosis as&#xD;
      we believe there is not enough published data yet to support the use of the anesthetic&#xD;
      challenge for study purposes. We also believe that the PST can help patients with vulvodynia&#xD;
      understand better the connection between the bladder and the vulva. Further, we are confident&#xD;
      that the PST does not cause much discomfort as has been described in some reports. We plan to&#xD;
      proceed with this and report our findings as described in this application. If this pilot&#xD;
      study demonstrates significant symptom relief in this population, a placebo-control&#xD;
      randomized trial of treatment would then be indicated. Further, if our hypothesis holds true,&#xD;
      several treatment modalities currently used for IC could be explored for use in patients with&#xD;
      GV. We believe that this could literally open a new door to therapy for patients with GV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to report the incidence of IC in a pilot group of patients with GV as detected by the&#xD;
      PST. We also plan to report the degree of symptom relief obtained in patients with a positive&#xD;
      PST during and after a six week course of initial intravesical therapy for IC using several&#xD;
      validated measurement tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, Study sites and IRB We plan to enroll 30-60 patients into this study. We hope to&#xD;
      complete this study as a multi-site study with patients enrolled at two institutions. We plan&#xD;
      to obtain IRB approval at both institutions. The enrollment period will be approximately one&#xD;
      year from January thru December 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of Generalized Vulvodynia For the purposes of this report, we plan to use the&#xD;
      definition of vulvodynia agreed upon at the 2003 meeting of the ISSVD: GV is a pain syndrome&#xD;
      characterized by vulvar pain for at least 3-6 months duration with discomfort occurring in&#xD;
      the absence of relevant infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic findings and in the absence&#xD;
      of specific clinically identifiable disorder of any kind (i.e., idiopathic). Patients with&#xD;
      pain generally characterized as burning pain which is unprovoked, provoked or both and&#xD;
      involving most of the vulva (not localized) will be offered enrollment. The pain can be&#xD;
      constant or intermittent. Though intermittent symptoms are not part of the 2003 ISSVD&#xD;
      criteria, we do plan to enroll patients with intermittent symptoms as we believe that&#xD;
      intermittent symptoms may represent &quot;flares&quot; of IC. Further, patients with intermittent&#xD;
      symptoms may have vulvodynia that had previously gone unrecognized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria We plan to enroll women 18 years or older with GV and negative tests for&#xD;
      urine infection, negative cultures for Chlamydia and gonorrhea when indicated, and negative&#xD;
      screens or cultures for yeast infection or bacterial vaginosis when indicated. Patient&#xD;
      symptoms will need to include no or minimal vaginal discharge and patients will have a&#xD;
      minimum Visual Analog Score for vulvar pain of at least 3/10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria We will exclude patients from enrollment if they use chronic narcotic pain&#xD;
      medication or have localized vulvodynia. (We believe that localize vulvodynia is less likely&#xD;
      of bladder origin.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptom Evaluation Patients' surgical and medical histories will be reviewed and documented.&#xD;
      A questionnaire specifically regarding symptoms or diagnoses of other pain syndromes&#xD;
      including irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, endometriosis, chronic headaches,&#xD;
      migraines, hyper-allergic or autoimmune disorders will be completed. Several other&#xD;
      standardized questionnaires will also administered including: 1) Pain-Urgency-Frequency or&#xD;
      &quot;PUF&quot; questionnaire, 2) O'Leary-Sant Symptom Index, 3) Short - Urinary Quality of life&#xD;
      survey, 4) Visual analog pain scale and, 5) two days of bladder diary. A patient will be&#xD;
      considered positive for urinary symptoms if she voids nine or more times in 24 hours or has&#xD;
      either urgency or pain associated with the voiding process. Following the 3rd, 6th, 9th&#xD;
      treatments, as well as 3-4 weeks following the last treatment, questionnaires will be&#xD;
      re-administered. We plan to collect data points at multiple times during treatment as we&#xD;
      believe that symptom relief may occur quickly. This will be useful to know in planning for&#xD;
      subsequent studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potassium Testing The PST will be performed with the patient blinded to the identity of the&#xD;
      two solutions as previously reported.10-12. All patients and controls will receive the same&#xD;
      information in advance of the test procedure: that two separate, unidentified solutions will&#xD;
      be instilled in the bladder and that they will be asked to grade their reactions. In brief,&#xD;
      40 ml of water will be instilled into the patient's bladder for 5 minutes and any reactions&#xD;
      of urgency or pain will be graded on a scale of 0-5 (Figure 1A). Then water will then be&#xD;
      removed and 40 ml of a potassium solution (40 mEq KCl in 100 mL water) will be instilled and&#xD;
      reactions similarly graded. After both solutions are instilled and removed, the patient will&#xD;
      be asked whether one solution caused more urgency or more pain than the other. Any difference&#xD;
      between solutions will then be graded as mild, moderate, or severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will consider a PST to be positive if both of the following criteria are met: the&#xD;
      patient's urgency or pain grade for Solution 2 was at least two points above zero, and the&#xD;
      patient identified Solution 2 as the solution causing more symptoms. We will report results&#xD;
      in terms of the percentage of patients with positive tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If neither solution is associated with any symptoms of urgency or pain, the PST will be&#xD;
      considered negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient reports urgency or pain associated with both solutions, the test is&#xD;
      potentially indeterminate. Many patients with IC are both volume sensitive and solute&#xD;
      sensitive, and when they react to both solutions, this suggests pain of bladder origin. We&#xD;
      will rate such results as indeterminate unless Solution 2 (potassium) was more provocative of&#xD;
      symptoms; then we will rate the test positive. The number of patients with indeterminate&#xD;
      tests will be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bladder instillations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a positive PST will be eligible to continue in the treatment phase of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nine bladder instillations will be performed over approximately six weeks for these patients.&#xD;
      The solution used for bladder instillations will contain: heparin 40,000 units, lidocaine 4%&#xD;
      - 5 ml (200 mg total dose), sodium bicarbonate 8.4 % - 3 ml and sterile water - 5 ml. This is&#xD;
      our current standard bladder instillation therapy. For patients with a positive PST, the&#xD;
      first bladder instillation will be performed immediately following the PST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study costs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have included the diagnosis and treatment of IC in patients with vulvodynia as a standard&#xD;
      part of our care for patients for the past 5-7 years. Therefore, we plan to continue this as&#xD;
      routine care and bill patients' insurance for evaluation and management services as well as&#xD;
      bladder instillations and the PST. Our other potential study site(s) will proceed similarly.&#xD;
      We seek the support of the National Vulvodynia Association for solely direct costs of&#xD;
      research coordinator coverage and fellow stipend support for their work on this study. These&#xD;
      direct costs are: Research Coordinator -10 hrs /week for 50 weeks @ 37.60 per hour including&#xD;
      benefits = $18,800.00 plus fellow stipend support - 5 hours / week for 50 weeks @ 32.45 per&#xD;
      hour including benefits = $8,112.50. Our total request for funding is $26,912.50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normally, all funds acquired for research purposes at our institution are subject to an&#xD;
      overhead &quot;tax&quot; of 25-30%. Our Director of Clinical Research Development has confirmed that&#xD;
      any NVA funds received will be applied to direct research costs and not institutional costs.&#xD;
      Confirmation of this is available in writing under separate cover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future applications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this pilot study demonstrates significant symptom relief in patients with GV, a&#xD;
      placebo-control randomized trial of treatment would then be indicated. Hopefully this project&#xD;
      will lay the foundation for an application for a research grant from an institution such as&#xD;
      the NIDDK to explore this topic further.&#xD;
