  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this bioequivalence study in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the therapeutic equivalence of mesalamine delayed release tablet (MDRT) and&#xD;
           Asacol Delayed Release Tablets 2.4 g per day (800 mg three times daily) and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of MDRT 2.4 g per day (800 mg three times daily) compared to&#xD;
           placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a multi-center, randomized, parallel-groups comparison of two mesalamine products&#xD;
      for treatment of ulcerative colitis. Patients were randomly assigned in an optimized 2:2:1&#xD;
      ratio to MDRT 2.4 g/day, Asacol 2.4 g/day, or placebo. The study was partially blinded due to&#xD;
      the difficulties associated with creating placebo that matched both MDRT and Asacol; the&#xD;
      placebo matched the MDRT formulation. Placebo groups served as control in the parallel group&#xD;
      comparison between MDRT and Asacol. Patients were treated for 6 weeks after randomization and&#xD;
      followed through Day 56, which was considered of sufficient length to accommodate any safety&#xD;
      issues and to assess efficacy based upon prior clinical trials of mesalamine in patients with&#xD;
      mild to moderate active UC as described in the introduction&#xD;
