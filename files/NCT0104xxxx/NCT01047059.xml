  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patients will be treated with erlotinib and bevacizumab for a six-week period. Imaging&#xD;
      procedures will be performed at baseline, after one week of therapy and after the six weeks&#xD;
      of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab represents an effective therapeutic strategy in&#xD;
      NSCLC with the highest response rates ever reported for relapsed NSCLC having been observed&#xD;
      recently in a phase II trial. Early differentiation of patients profiting and of patients not&#xD;
      profiting from this therapy is of major relevance for further improving this targeted therapy&#xD;
      approach and to develop more effective, personalized treatment strategies. We aim at this&#xD;
      early identification by the combination of molecular and functional imaging tools (FDG-,&#xD;
      FLT-PET, DCE-MRI), molecular marker analyses in tissue and peripheral blood (EGFR- and KRAS&#xD;
      mutational status and high throughput mutational profiling in tumor tissue,&#xD;
      angiogenesis-associated biomarkers and expression profiling in peripheral blood) and&#xD;
      pharmokokinetic analyses. From the combined analyses of these tools we expect a better&#xD;
      understanding of the host-drug interaction as a precondition for further improvement of&#xD;
      erlotinib-bevacizumab combination therapy in NSCLC&#xD;
