  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C is the leading cause of chronic liver disease in industrialized countries, and is&#xD;
      the most common indication for liver transplantation. In the Western world, the absolute&#xD;
      majority of cases of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection are related to the use of injectable&#xD;
      narcotic drugs. Most injecting drug users contract HCV infection within the first years after&#xD;
      starting injecting drug use. The aim of this study is to study hepatitis C in a cohort of&#xD;
      patients registered in clinics providing maintenance therapy for opiate dependence in three&#xD;
      metropolitan areas of Sweden. The cohort is defined as all patients registered in these three&#xD;
      clinics at the date of study initiation. The study contains four parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I: the first part of the study aims to evaluate the prevalence of HCV exposure in the&#xD;
      cohort and the proportion of anti-HCV positive participants with chronic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II: Patients with chronic HCV infection will be offered further investigation of chronic&#xD;
      liver disease, including liver biopsy, for selection of candidates for antiviral therapy and&#xD;
      identification of risk factors for development of severe liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part III: Based on the results of these investigations, patients will be considered for&#xD;
      antiviral therapy. Indications for such therapy will mainly be clinical and/or histological&#xD;
      signs of chronic liver disease with fibrosis. All patients will receive weight-based doses of&#xD;
      pegylated interferon-alfa-2b and ribavirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part IV: Study of pharmacokinetic interactions between ribavirin and opiate substitution&#xD;
      molecule (methadone or buprenorphine) in patients receiving antiviral therapy according to&#xD;
      part III.&#xD;
