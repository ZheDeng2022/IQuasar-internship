    <textblock>
      Background: Severe dehydrating cholera due to V. cholerae O1 is an important public health&#xD;
      problem in Bangladesh and many other developing countries. V. cholerae O1 is a major&#xD;
      bacterial pathogen causing around 5 million cases and at least 200,000 deaths in adults and&#xD;
      children each year. It can be assumed that there are at least 300,000 severe cases and 1.2&#xD;
      million infections in people in Bangladesh alone. The rate of cholera varies from around 1 to&#xD;
      8 per 1000 population and the highest attack rate is in children 2- to 9-year years of age .&#xD;
      Cholera is now also being documented in very young children. Currently enteric vaccine&#xD;
      approaches are regarded as the most accessible short term and practical means to prevent and&#xD;
      control such illnesses to prevent disease and epidemics in resource poor settings with&#xD;
      limited public health and sanitary facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An effective inactivated whole cell bivalent cholera vaccine against Vibrio cholerae O1 and&#xD;
      O139 was produced and implemented for public health purposes in Vietnam since the 1990s. This&#xD;
      bivalent vaccine has been found to be safe and to confer significant protection against El&#xD;
      Tor cholera in both children and adults and has over the last decade being used in the&#xD;
      Vietnam to protect against cholera. This vaccine has further been reformulated by the IVI to&#xD;
      meet WHO requirements and is now being produced in WHO prequalified vaccine company in India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reformulated vaccine has been shown to be safe and immunogenic in Indian children as well&#xD;
      as adults. A large Phase III study of the vaccine, has recently been carried out in Kolkata,&#xD;
      India in over 120,000 participants aged from one year and above. Results of the study are&#xD;
      encouraging and the vaccine gives over 60% protection against cholera. The vibriocidal&#xD;
      antibody response rate was 80% in children and 53% in adults. Following this study, the&#xD;
      vaccine, designated as ShanChol has been licensed in India in April 2009. The vaccine is now&#xD;
      being marketed in India and is available at a cost affordable for developing country&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aim of the proposed study is to assess if the orally administered, killed,&#xD;
      bivalent whole-cell cholera vaccine, ShanChol will be safe and immunogenic in different age&#xD;
      groups in Bangladesh in children and adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This will be a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study on a total of&#xD;
      330 subjects, 165 vaccine and 165 placebo recipients. The specific aims will be to determine:&#xD;
      i) safety and determine adverse events if any (ii) determine immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: The study of ShanChol on Bangladeshi children and adults will be able to give&#xD;
      information regarding the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in Bangladeshi subjects.&#xD;
      This information will be important for proceeding with larger studies in Bangladesh and if&#xD;
      proven useful for introduction the cholera vaccine in the country in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adults as well as children, both males and females will be recruited in the study from the&#xD;
      urban suburbs around Dhaka city in Mirpur where we have been conducting other epidemiological&#xD;
      and vaccine related studies. The community will be informed by our field staffs and&#xD;
      interested persons might be enrolled in the study on the basis of inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I- Adults- 18-45 years of age (n=110):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this oral bivalent whole-cell cholera vaccine has not been tested in Bangladesh before,&#xD;
      the study will be carried out in 3 age groups, i.e. adults, followed by toddlers and younger&#xD;
      children. These study participants will be recruited from the field site in Mirpur. For this&#xD;
      purpose, 55 adults (18-45 year old) will be given 2 doses of the bivalent whole-cell cholera&#xD;
      vaccine and 55 adults will be given placebo. Safety will be clinically monitored for side&#xD;
      effects for 3 days after each dose of study agent by home visits. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either 2 doses of the vaccine or placebo, given 14 days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II- Children 2-5 years (n=110):&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the vaccine is found safe in the adult study, it will be tested in the toddlers in the&#xD;
      field consisting of 55 children in each group. The children will be clinically monitored for&#xD;
      side effects for 3 days after each dose of vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part III- Children 12-23 months (n=110):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children in the field site will be recruited for the study and study carried out as described&#xD;
      above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each phase of the study (Part I onwards) will be completed and based on the development, and&#xD;
      progress, the next phase will be initiated. If the vaccine is found to be without adverse&#xD;
      effects on the adults it will be tested in the children, 2-5 years of age and followed by the&#xD;
      younger age group 12-23 months of age. The results will be presented to the Data Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board after completing the safety surveillance part of each phase of the study and&#xD;
      before proceeding to the next study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveillance for side effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of the study agents will be monitored after the intervention has been initiated.&#xD;
      In the community, supervision will be carried out by the physician and the trained research&#xD;
      assistants and adverse reactions including diarrhea, vomiting, nausea and other local and&#xD;
      systemic reactions recorded. For the all three groups, 3 consecutive days after the each dose&#xD;
      of study agent, the participants or their guardians will be interviewed for recall of&#xD;
      symptoms by health workers. All side-effects will be recorded up to 28 days in reaction&#xD;
      surveillance forms for local and systemic reactions. If any adverse event or serious adverse&#xD;
      events notified within the study period field clinic will be available for reporting and&#xD;
      possible management of the event. Reported symptoms other than appetite loss will be graded&#xD;
      as mild (noticeable), moderate (affecting normal daily activities) or severe (suspending&#xD;
      normal daily activities). A clinical record form will be used to record all clinical signs&#xD;
      and symptoms. In case of serious adverse effects the data will be entered in a separate form&#xD;
      . If required the study subject will be hospitalized at the Mirpur Treatment Center or the&#xD;
      ICDDR,B Dhaka Hospital under supervision of the study physicians..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety endpoint and safety evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point for evaluating safety will be defined as the occurrence of any of the&#xD;
      following diarrhoea, vomiting or abdominal cramps of at least moderate grade. Diarrhea will&#xD;
      be defined as three or more loose or liquid stools in any 24-h period over the 3 day&#xD;
      surveillance period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY INTERVENTION Vaccine Each dose of the vaccine contains whole cell inactivated heat&#xD;
      killed and formalin killed bacteria consisting of 600 ELISA Units (EU) of lipopolysaccharide&#xD;
      (LPS). It consists of formalin-killed V. cholerae Inaba, El Tor biotype (strain Phil 6973).&#xD;
      It also contains 300 EU LPS of heat-killed V. cholerae Ogawa classical biotype (Cairo 50);&#xD;
      300 EU LPS of formalin killed V. cholerae Ogawa classical biotype (Cairo 50); 300 EU LPS of&#xD;
      heat-killed V. cholerae Inaba, classical biotype (Cairo 48); and 600 EU LPS of formalin&#xD;
      killed V. cholerae O139 (4260B) (9). The vaccine has no detectable cholera toxin. The study&#xD;
      agents (Vaccine or placebo) is packaged as liquid formulations in 1.5-ml doses. The vaccine&#xD;
      will be given in two doses separated by a two week interval and administered by oral syringe&#xD;
      without a needle after which each participant will be offered water. No buffer will be co&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo The placebo consists of heat-killed Escherichia coli K12 and is identical in&#xD;
      appearance to the vaccine. This strain has been used for placebo related studies in previous&#xD;
      oral vaccine clinical trials in Bangladesh and elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random Allocation Eligible participants will be assigned to receive the vaccine or placebo in&#xD;
      a 1:1 ratio according to the randomization schedule. Individual randomization lists for&#xD;
      adults, toddlers and infants will be generated by statistician in IVI who will not involved&#xD;
      in the study in any way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study agents will be labeled by different letter codes for three different phases at&#xD;
      Shantha Biotechnics according to the list provided by IVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The field staff will allocate the study agents to the participants according to the next&#xD;
      available number on entry into the trial which will be linked with the randomization list&#xD;
      provided by IVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization list will contain sequential numbers unique to each participant, and the&#xD;
      block randomization (fixed block length of 4) process will be employed to ensure an effective&#xD;
      balance between the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 4-5 member data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) will be formulated for this study by the&#xD;
      Ethical Review Committee (ERC) of ICDDR,B. This will be comprised of members of the ERC,&#xD;
      staff members of ICDDR,B and individuals from other institutions in Bangladesh. The team will&#xD;
      also comprise an International member. The members will not be involved in the study in any&#xD;
      way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding and Code Breaking Procedures Vials will be labeled by letter codes at Shanta&#xD;
      Biotechnics according to the list provided by IVI. All study personnel and participants will&#xD;
      be blinded to treatment assignment during the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identity of the study agent will not be known to the participant or their&#xD;
      parent/guardian, nor to personnel involved in the conduct or monitoring of the trial, such as&#xD;
      investigators, study nurses/personnel before the completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI will hold the sealed randomization list for use if necessary in case of adverse events&#xD;
      that may be seen in the study by the DSMB. Otherwise the list will not be unblinded until&#xD;
      completion of the study, and complete entry and editing of relevant data before initiation of&#xD;
      the analyses. The entire data set will be locked prior to unblinding. If the intervention&#xD;
      assignment is un-blinded due to any reason, the DSMB will be notified within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject withdrawal during the study Respective participants or parents of participating&#xD;
      children may discontinue his/her participation at any time after enrollment without providing&#xD;
      any reason. No replacement will occur for such withdrawals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following criteria should be checked at each visit subsequent to the intake of study&#xD;
      agent&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Use of any immunosuppressive or immune-modifying drugs during the study period (for&#xD;
           corticosteroids this would mean ≥0.5 mg/kg.day)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Administration of immunoglobulins or any blood product during the study period If any of&#xD;
           the above occurs that might compromise per protocol assessment (PP); however, they will&#xD;
           not be withdrawn from the study and their data will be used in an &quot;intention to treat&quot;&#xD;
           (ITT) analysis. The investigator(s) might also withdraw a participant if, in his/her&#xD;
           clinical opinion, that is in the best interest of the participant concerned or if it is&#xD;
           considered to be non-compliant with the protocol. A participant might also be withdrawn&#xD;
           due to protocol violation, death or early termination of the study by the sponsor.&#xD;
           Wherever possible, the tests and evaluations at termination visit, as specified in the&#xD;
           protocol, will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Duration of the study period for individual participants The participants will remain in&#xD;
           the study for up to 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Schedule and description of observations and visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following schedule will be used in the study and the case report forms will be&#xD;
           completed on each study day:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Day 0: After describing the study and initial verbal consent, medical history will be&#xD;
           obtained and a thorough physical examination will be performed by a physician that will&#xD;
           include measurement of the vitals signs. Once all eligibility criteria are met,the&#xD;
           participant and in case of children the parent will be asked to sign the informed&#xD;
           consent form. A blood and stool sample would be collected for determining the baseline&#xD;
           immunological assay for immune responses. Following this, the participant will be&#xD;
           allocated to the study intervention according to the randomization list (vaccine or&#xD;
           placebo). Voluntary and solicited reactogenicity will be assessed symptoms and immediate&#xD;
           adverse events recorded with 1 h of intake of the study agent. The participants will&#xD;
           then be allowed to go home&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Day 1: Participants return to the study center to be monitored for voluntary and&#xD;
           solicited symptoms and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Day 2: Participants will return to the study centre or will be visited at home (in&#xD;
           exceptional circumstances, when parents cannot bring the participant to the study&#xD;
           centre) to monitor for voluntary and solicited symptoms and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Day 7: (up to +3 days): Participants return to the study center. Blood sample will be&#xD;
           collected at clinic and stool sample will be collected from home or at clinic for&#xD;
           testing of vaccine specific immunologic responses in study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Day 14: (± 2 days): Participants return to the study center. The participant will be&#xD;
           allocated to the study intervention for second time according to the randomization list&#xD;
           (vaccine or placebo).by a blinded third party dispenser.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Day 14-16: Participants return to the study centre or will be visited at home (in&#xD;
           exceptional circumstances, when parents cannot bring the participant to the study&#xD;
           centre) to monitor for voluntary and solicited symptoms and adverse events. Voluntary&#xD;
           and solicited reactogenicity will be assessed symptoms and immediate adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Day 21: (± 3 days) Blood and stool will be sampled for testing of vaccine specific post&#xD;
           immunization response.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Day 28: (± 3 days) Clinical evaluation and Study Termination Sample Size Calculation and&#xD;
           Outcome (Primary and Secondary) Variable(s) Safety and Immunogenicity study of the&#xD;
           Shantha cholera vaccine: The ''non-inferiority'' approach using a 1 -sided 95%&#xD;
           confidence interval was used to calculate the sample size since this allowed us to rule&#xD;
           out clinically unacceptable high rates of diarrheal adverse event occurring during the 3&#xD;
           days after either dose as well as establish that the vaccine induced adequate&#xD;
           seroconversion to V. cholerae O1 among recipients. Assuming a 10% diarrheal rate among&#xD;
           placebo and vaccine recipients alike, to exclude a vaccine-placebo difference in the&#xD;
           rate of diarrhea of greater than 20% (upper boundary of the 1-tailed 95% confidence&#xD;
           interval) with a power of 0.9, the minimum number of subjects required for each group&#xD;
           was in each group for both adverse event was 46. The sample size is calculated with the&#xD;
           assumptions that it is important to evaluate whether the vaccine induces acceptable&#xD;
           serum vibriocidal responses in relation to the placebo group. Based on an immunogenicity&#xD;
           study of the whole-cell killed oral cholera vaccine in Bangladesh, we make the following&#xD;
           assumptions. For serum vibriocidal responses, defined as &gt;4-fold increases between&#xD;
           baseline and post-second dose in either Inaba or Ogawa antibodies, for each age group&#xD;
           (12-23 months, 2-5 years and 18-45 years), we assume 1) the background rate of responses&#xD;
           in the placebo group will be 5% after the second dose and 2) the true rate of&#xD;
           vibriocidal responses in the vaccine groups is 25%. At p &lt;0.05 (1-tailed), 0.8 power,&#xD;
           and a 1 to 1 allocation of vaccine and placebo, a total of 46 subjects per group would&#xD;
           be needed. Thus for safety and immunological responses the number is 46 per group. With&#xD;
           15% attrition rate, it is 53. We will select 55 in each group (110 per age group for&#xD;
           both vaccine and placebo recipient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will, therefore, select 55 subjects per arm in each age group, with a total of 330&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
