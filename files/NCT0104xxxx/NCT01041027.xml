  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well radiation therapy, paclitaxel, and carboplatin work in&#xD;
      treating patients with high-risk endometrial cancer. Radiation therapy uses high energy x&#xD;
      rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin,&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing or by stopping them from spreading. Giving radiation therapy with&#xD;
      chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate progression-free survival. II. To assess and document location of disease&#xD;
      recurrence (distant vs local vs both) using this treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the toxicity of radiation therapy &quot;sandwiched&quot; between cycles of&#xD;
      paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy in patients with high-risk endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the associations of cancer recurrence with tumor tissue expression levels of&#xD;
      insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), IGF-II, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1&#xD;
      (IGFBP-1) and -3, insulin receptor, IGF-I receptor, estrogen receptor, and progesterone&#xD;
      receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHEMOTHERAPY (weeks 1-9, 13-21): Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours&#xD;
      and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses&#xD;
      during weeks 1-9 and 3 courses during weeks 13-21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RADIATION THERAPY (weeks 8-13 or 8-15): Patients with stage I disease undergo high dose rate&#xD;
      (HDR) brachytherapy once weekly for a total of 5 fractions during weeks 8-13. All other&#xD;
      patients undergo external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) once daily (QD) 5 days a week for a&#xD;
      total of 25 fractions during weeks 8-12 and HDR brachytherapy once weekly for a total of 3&#xD;
      fractions during weeks 13-15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;
