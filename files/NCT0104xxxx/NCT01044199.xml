  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 16,000-39,000 persons come in contact with potentially rabid animals and&#xD;
      receive rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) each year in the US. To appropriately manage&#xD;
      potential human exposures to rabies, the risk for infection must be accurately assessed.&#xD;
      Administration of rabies PEP is a medical urgency, not a medical emergency, but decisions&#xD;
      must not be delayed. Prophylaxis is occasionally complicated by adverse reactions, but these&#xD;
      reactions are rarely severe. Current data on the safety and efficacy of active and passive&#xD;
      rabies vaccination were derived from both human and animal studies. Timely and appropriate&#xD;
      human pre-exposure prophylaxis (Pre-EP) and PEP will prevent human rabies. Currently in the&#xD;
      US, the approved dosage and administration for PEP in previously unvaccinated persons&#xD;
      consists of the administration of vaccine (HDCV or PCECV) and HRIG. Vaccine is administered&#xD;
      IM on days 0, 3, 7, 21, and 28 (deltoid area). The approved dosage and administration for&#xD;
      pre-exposure prophylaxis (Pre-EP) consists of three 1.0-mL injections of vaccine (HDCV or&#xD;
      PCECV) administered IM (deltoid area), one injection per day on days 0, 7, and 21 or 28).&#xD;
      Intradermal (ID) route of administration of rabies vaccination is used in certain countries&#xD;
      both for PEP and Pre-EP, and approved by WHO for modern potent cell culture vaccines. Recent&#xD;
      studies outside the USA found the use of PCEC rabies vaccine by ID administration immunogenic&#xD;
      and safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goals of this study are to obtain additional safety and immunogenicity data on ID&#xD;
      administration of 0.1 mL doses of the inactivated PCEC rabies virus vaccine in adults. Given&#xD;
      the need to provide alternative routes of administration to the current approved&#xD;
      intramuscular route in order to protect a larger number of people facing potential vaccine&#xD;
      shortages. The data yielded by this clinical trial will provide evidence to support&#xD;
      alternative route of administration and dose of PCECV in the US.&#xD;
