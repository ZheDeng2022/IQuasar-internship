  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to demonstrate to efficacy and safety of Apremilast 20mg oral&#xD;
      administration twice daily over 12 weeks in subjects with moderate to severe lichen planus.&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the subjects will achieve a significant clinical improvement in their&#xD;
      skin disease according to a specialized physician grading scale.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, single center, non-randomized, open label efficacy and safety study&#xD;
      designed to characterize the response of Apremilast 20 mg oral administered twice daily over&#xD;
      12 weeks in subjects with moderate to severe lichen planus. The hypothesis and ideal primary&#xD;
      end point will be that subjects achieve significant clinical response in cutaneous disease&#xD;
      defined as a 2 or more grade improvement of the physician global assessment (PGA) after 12&#xD;
      weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many various therapies have been used to treat LP including topical and oral corticosteroids,&#xD;
      retinoids, cyclosporine, griseofulvin, dapsone and phototherapy, but often with disappointing&#xD;
      response.4 It is an inflammatory condition whose pathogenesis involves damage to basal&#xD;
      keratinocytes by alloreactive T cells through the release proinflammatory cytokines, such as&#xD;
      TNF-α and IFN-γ.1 Significantly elevated levels of such inflammatory mediators are present in&#xD;
      tissue from LP lesions compared to normal controls.5 Based on these observations, the&#xD;
      investigation of Apremilast, due to its ability to inhibit multiple inflammatory cytokines,&#xD;
      for the treatment of moderate to severe LP is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of Apremilast in&#xD;
      subjects with moderate to severe lichen planus after 12 weeks of treatment. Other objectives&#xD;
      are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Apremilast, effects on quality of life, and&#xD;
      efficacy for mucosal disease if present.&#xD;
