  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is substantial research on the effects of physical exercise on cognitive functions.&#xD;
      However, less attention has been paid on the requirements of training intensity and length to&#xD;
      enhance cognitive abilities in the elderly. To the investigators knowledge no studies have&#xD;
      evaluated the effects of extensive endurance exercise training on cognitive functions by&#xD;
      studying elderly marathon runners and bicyclists. On the basis of the scientific literature&#xD;
      published so far it is not known whether the beneficial impact of endurance exercise training&#xD;
      depends on the intensity of training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore designed a cohort study with adequate power in order to evaluate&#xD;
      the effects of intensive endurance exercise training on cognition. This trial, an Austrian&#xD;
      prospective cohort study in cognitive function of elderly marathon-runners (APSOEM) is being&#xD;
      conducted and will compare neuropsychological performance outcomes of elderly marathon&#xD;
      runners or bicyclists with controls matched concerning age, education years, occupation, and&#xD;
      verbal intelligence.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Design of the trial The data reported in this study are derived from the cognitive testing&#xD;
      and determination of humoral growth factors at the time of the survey 1 (recruitment phase).&#xD;
      To determine whether extensive endurance training enhances cognitive abilities in the&#xD;
      elderly, we plan to compare longitudinally the outcomes of various neuropsychological tests&#xD;
      and humoral markers in elderly marathon runners or bicyclists with controls matched for age,&#xD;
      sex, and years of education at the time of the survey 2 (5-year follow-up) and at the time of&#xD;
      the survey 3 (10-year follow-up). Runners participating in the 2008 Wachau half marathon&#xD;
      (21,2 km) and the Vienna City marathon (42,5 km) as well as bicyclists participating at the&#xD;
      Corinthian marathon (180km) were recruited with the assistance of the organizers and via&#xD;
      personal contacts. Runners or bicyclists were eligible for inclusion in the study if (a) they&#xD;
      had participated in at least one of these 3 marathons in the preceding two years, (b) were&#xD;
      still in continuous training during the recruitment phase (at least 2 hours/week) and (c)&#xD;
      were over the age of 60. Exclusion criteria were (a) present or past exposure to neurotoxic&#xD;
      substances (b) if they did not speak German as their native language (verbal intelligence)&#xD;
      (c) diseases that markedly affect CNS functions: for example, cerebrovascular stroke, brain&#xD;
      tumor, depression, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease,&#xD;
      etc. (d) manifest cardiovascular disease, (e) chronic alcoholism (daily alcohol intake &gt; 60 g&#xD;
      or diagnosed history of alcoholism) and (f) unwillingness to give informed consent. Controls&#xD;
      were subsequently contacted via personal contact and three additional advertisements (two in&#xD;
      an Austrian newspaper (&quot;Krone&quot;) and one in an Austrian bicyclist journal (&quot;Bicyclist&#xD;
      Sports&quot;). The controls were matched according to age, sex and years of education. Detailed&#xD;
      information about education, smoking habits, family history, exercise training and medication&#xD;
      was obtained. All participants had an extensive medical evaluation carried out by an&#xD;
      experienced internal specialist including blood withdrawal when entering the study. Since it&#xD;
      has been shown that humoral growth factor levels can vary with the circadian rhythm , all&#xD;
      examinations were started between 10 am and 10.30 am. In cases where the examination revealed&#xD;
      neurological abnormalities, participants were additionally examined by a neurologist. Besides&#xD;
      the physical examination with blood withdrawal described above, the study protocol included&#xD;
      an ergometry, neuropsychological testing, the use of a set of questionnaires and magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging. All participants underwent the study protocol tests in the above-mentioned&#xD;
      same chronological order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by the ethics committee of the medical faculty of the University of&#xD;
      Vienna (number EK 401/2005). All subjects gave written informed consent before entering the&#xD;
      study. Procedures followed were in accordance with institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ergometry Individual working capacity was calculated as a percentage of the predicted (=100%&#xD;
      work load) Watt value (derived from the tabulation, standardized for sex, age, and body&#xD;
      surface [28]). Briefly, the workload was increased every two minutes in steps of 25 W,&#xD;
      beginning with 25 W and going on until the point of exhaustion (Ergoline, Ergometrics 900).&#xD;
      The individual physical working capacity (PWC) was expressed as the individual maximal power&#xD;
      (Watt)max in percent of a reference value (Wattref): PWCind = 100 x Wattmax/Wattref [28].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropsychological testing and questionnaires The Vienna Neuropsychological Test Battery&#xD;
      (VNTB)as well as the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) were&#xD;
      selected in order to assess cognitive functions, such as visuo-construction,&#xD;
      concentration/attention, language, memory and executive functioning domains. These cognitive&#xD;
      abilities are known to be commonly affected by Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. The&#xD;
      two batteries of tests have been found to be sensitive in the evaluation of mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each test run began with a screening of global cognitive functions via the Mini Mental State&#xD;
      Examination (MMSE) and the Clock Drawing Test. Thereafter participants were subjected to a&#xD;
      cognitive testing assessing visuo-constructional abilities, attention, language functions,&#xD;
      memory and executive functions. Details of cognitive testing are described in the Appendix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After finishing the test batteries, subjects were asked to fill out several self-rating&#xD;
      scales and forms to assess premorbid intelligence levels, subjective memory functions,&#xD;
      psychological and physiological well-being , depression, and activities of daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory procedures Blood counts, all clinical chemistry tests, vitamin B12 and folic acid,&#xD;
      thyroid hormones and HbA1c determinations were performed according to standard routine&#xD;
      laboratory testing procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As preanalytical factors crucially affect levels of growth factors, the collection and&#xD;
      processing of specimens was carried out under strictly standardized conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole blood for DNA extraction and serum samples for growth factor measurements were stored&#xD;
      at -80°C within the MedUni Vienna Biobank facility. Post-storage isolation of DNA was done on&#xD;
      a Corbett X-tractor Gene CAS 1820 semi-automated nucleic acid extraction system (Qiagen,&#xD;
      Hilden, Germany) using a Macherey Nagel Nucleospin 96 blood kit (Macherey Nagel, Dueren,&#xD;
      Germany). Quantification of genomic DNA by Warburg-Christian method (260/280 nm) on a&#xD;
      Nanodrop spectrophotometer (PEQLAB Biotechnologie GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) revealed an&#xD;
      average nucleic acid concentration of 25 ng/µL. ApoE genotyping of 1:10 (v/v in Buffer BE,&#xD;
      Macherey Nagel) diluted aliquots was performed on a ABI TaqMan® 7900HT Real Time(RT)-PCR&#xD;
      thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). For this, pre-designed TaqMan&#xD;
      SNP-Genotyping assays to distinguish the ApoE ε4 allele from ε2 and ε3 at amino acid position&#xD;
      112 (ApoE rs429358, Assay ID C_3084793_20, Applied Biosystems) and the ApoE ε2 allele from ε3&#xD;
      and ε4 at amino acid position 158 (rs7412, Assay ID C_904973_10, Applied Biosystems) were&#xD;
      purchased. RT-PCR was accomplished in a total reaction volume of 5µL using TaqMan® Genotyping&#xD;
      Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in a 384-well format according to the standard protocol&#xD;
      supplied by the manufacturer. Thermal conditions: enzyme activation for 10 minutes at 95°C,&#xD;
      followed by 45 cycles of alternating denaturation (15 seconds, 95°C) and primer&#xD;
      annealing/elongation (1 minute, 60°C). Allelic discrimination was achieved using SDS 2.3&#xD;
      software (Applied Biosystems).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin-like growth factor 1 was measured with the LIAISON® IGF-1 test on a fully automated&#xD;
      LIAISON chemiluminescence analyzer (both from Diasorin, Saluggia, Italy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of BDNF concentration was done manually using RayBio Human BDNF ELISA Kit (Ray&#xD;
      Biotech, Inc, Norcross, USA) according to the standard protocol supplied by the manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on a 1.5 T superconducting magnet (Siemens Symphony&#xD;
      1,5 T, Siemens Co., Erlangen) using a standard head coil, as previously described [40]. The&#xD;
      standardized imaging protocol included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. axial FLAIR (fluid attenuated inversion recovery): TR 696 msec, TE 24 msec, 5mm slice&#xD;
           thickness, distance factor 20%, FOV (field of view) 210 mm x 100 mm, number of slices&#xD;
           20.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. axial T2* flash 2d: TR 477, TE 12 msec, 5mm slice thickness, distance factor 20%, FOV&#xD;
           210 x 100, number of slices 20. (c) axial T1 TSE (turbo spin echo sequence) TR 477 msec,&#xD;
           TE 12 msec, 5mm slice thickness, distance factor 20%, FOV 210 x 100 mm, number of slices&#xD;
           20. (d) coronal T2 TSE: TR 4480 msec, TE 94 msec, high resolution (perpendicular to&#xD;
           hippocampus), 2mm slice thickness, distance factor 20%, FOV 220 x 100, number of slices&#xD;
           24. (e) coronal 3D MPRAGE: TR 1420 msec, TE 3,2 msec, slice thickness (partition) 3 mm,&#xD;
           FOV 240, number of slices 36. Quantitative, morphometric imaging data were not acquired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and statistical analyses A separate database was maintained by the biobank.&#xD;
      All results were sent to the trial office of the Occupational Medicine Unit, where they were&#xD;
      matched and appended to the participant´s records on an Access 2000 database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0. Depending on the scale properties of&#xD;
      the data, mean and standard deviation or frequencies and percentages are provided. Univariate&#xD;
      group differences were evaluated by means of t-tests/Mann &amp; Whitney U-Test or Fisher exact&#xD;
      tests, and MANOVA models were used to evaluate multivariate group differences with&#xD;
      Wilk's-being reported. Multiple correlations between the sets of psychological parameters and&#xD;
      the biomarkers BDNF and IGF were performed exploratively. All statistical analyses were&#xD;
      conducted at a significance level of 5%; due to the large number of comparisons and to reduce&#xD;
      the risk of an inflation of the error type I the significance level will be adjusted to 2.5‰&#xD;
      (Bonferroni-Holm adjustment of error type I) when discussing the results. For the follow-up&#xD;
      evaluation, sample sizes of n=41 patients per group are aimed at to achieve the detection of&#xD;
      group differences in the percentage of cognitive impairment; this will make it possible to&#xD;
      prove differences in percentages for median up to large effects (H&gt;.50) at a level of&#xD;
      significance of 5% and a power of 80%.&#xD;
