    <textblock>
      Project PEER utilizes a randomized controlled study design to investigate the combined&#xD;
      effects of an exercise and nutrition intervention that is based on self-efficacy principles&#xD;
      and delivered primarily by peer educators to reduce the risk for obesity in female college&#xD;
      freshman over one academic year (N = 300). The control group will receive minimal interaction&#xD;
      from the research team, paralleling the typical freshman experience on the UIUC campus.&#xD;
      Recruitment will take place in two waves (consecutive fall terms with n = 150).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the final year (Fall 2010) of the project, a General Education course will be offered&#xD;
      that targets weight management. Importantly, the discussion groups for this course will be&#xD;
      taught by peer educators trained using the peer resources further refined during the PEER&#xD;
      project. In addition to conventional measures of content knowledge assessed in the college&#xD;
      classroom when obtaining class credit, personal physical activity and nutrition behaviors&#xD;
      along with behavioral determinants (self-efficacy, self-regulatory skills and outcome&#xD;
      expectations) will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 1: To determine the effectiveness of a peer-delivered self efficacy-based&#xD;
      behavioral intervention to enhance nutrition and physical activity behaviors and subsequently&#xD;
      weight management success in female university freshman over one academic year. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that freshmen randomized to the intervention group will be more successful in&#xD;
      losing or maintaining weight than the control group through a combination of diet and&#xD;
      physical activity strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 2: To examine the role played by social cognitive factors in changing nutrition&#xD;
      and physical activity behaviors across one academic year. We hypothesize that self-efficacy&#xD;
      will have both a direct influence on behavior and an indirect effect through its influence on&#xD;
      self-regulatory skills and outcome expectations.&#xD;
