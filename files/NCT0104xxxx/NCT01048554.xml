    <textblock>
      This research is being done because melanoma in the brain is very difficult to treat because&#xD;
      it does not respond to radiation or to chemotherapy, such as temozolomide. One of the reasons&#xD;
      for this is that the melanoma can make chemicals that signal the brain to provide new blood&#xD;
      vessels for the tumor. The main signal is called VEGF. Bevacizumab is an antibody that blocks&#xD;
      VEGF. The investigators want to see if the combination of bevacizumab and temozolomide will&#xD;
      stop the melanoma from growing.&#xD;

      This study proposes the use of a combination of temozolomide and bevacizumab in a carefully&#xD;
      selected group of patients with metastatic melanoma to the brain. This combination has been&#xD;
      tested in primary brain tumors and in melanoma not involving the brain. The 6-week on, 2-week&#xD;
      off low-dose schedule proposed in this trial capitalizes on preclinical data demonstrating&#xD;
      that temozolomide inhibits angiogenesis at low, non-toxic doses that correspond to the plasma&#xD;
      concentrations achieved by an oral administration, a so-called 'metronomic' scheduling. The&#xD;
      precise mechanism of its antiangiogenic action remains to be elucidated. This potential&#xD;
      synergistic mechanism, together with the bulk of evidence for activity presented above&#xD;
      suggests that the combination will be well-tolerated, safe and possibly more effective.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant melanoma and&#xD;
             clinical evidence of metastatic disease to the brain. Mucosal and ocular melanomas are&#xD;
             included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Untreated asymptomatic brain metastases ≤ 2 cm in maximal diameter, with mild or&#xD;
             minimal edema, without associated hemorrhage or midline shift.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Progressing brain metastases of any size, not amenable to surgical resection and/or&#xD;
             progressing through radiation therapy but without evidence of active associated&#xD;
             hemorrhage. Treatment with bevacizumab may not be initiated until 4 weeks after&#xD;
             surgical resection or radiation therapy completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Hemorrhagic metastases that have resolved after previous resection or radiation&#xD;
             therapy do not exclude patients with new non-hemorrhagic metastases meeting the&#xD;
             criteria described above from participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have measurable metastases to the brain, defined as at least one lesion&#xD;
             that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be&#xD;
             recorded) as &gt;10 mm in the brain MRI with gadolinium. For disease outside the brain,&#xD;
             tumors must be &gt; 20 mm with conventional techniques or &gt; 10 mm with spiral CT scan.&#xD;
             Measurable disease outside the brain is NOT required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with any number of previous systemic therapies are eligible. Previous&#xD;
             temozolomide treatment given on a different schedule is allowed, as long as it had not&#xD;
             been given in combination with VEGF-targeting drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Age &gt; 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;
             use of bevacizumab in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Life expectancy of 8 weeks or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. ECOG performance status &lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt; 60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Leukocytes &gt; 3,000/µl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/µl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets &gt; 100,000/µl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total Bilirubin ** Within institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine* Within institutional upper limit of normal*&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  If creatinine &gt; upper limit of normal, a creatinine clearance &gt;/= 60 ml/m2&#xD;
                       is required&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Except for patients with known Gilbert's syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The effects of bevacizumab on the developing human fetus at the recommended&#xD;
             therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because the anti-angiogenic agent&#xD;
             used in this trial may be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control)&#xD;
             prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman&#xD;
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Concomitant use of steroids to treat cerebral edema is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease-Specific Exclusions Patients with metastatic disease to the brain not fitting&#xD;
             the inclusion criteria. Patients with leptomeningeal disease are not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  General Medical Exclusions&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria are ineligible for study entry:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Life expectancy of less than 8 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Current, recent (within 4 weeks of the first infusion of this study), or planned&#xD;
             participation in an experimental drug study other than this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to bevacizumab or temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must not exhibit any clinical evidence of coagulopathy. The INR must be &lt; 1.5&#xD;
             and the values for PTT must be within normal limits. Anticoagulation is not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, untreated&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because bevacizumab is an agent with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with bevacizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with bevacizumab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Otherwise well HIV-positive patients will be permitted to enroll on this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Bevacizumab-Specific Exclusions&#xD;

             diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg on antihypertensive medications)&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days&#xD;
             prior to study enrollment or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during&#xD;
             the course of the study&#xD;

                  must demonstrate ≤ 1g of protein in 24 hours to be eligible).&#xD;
