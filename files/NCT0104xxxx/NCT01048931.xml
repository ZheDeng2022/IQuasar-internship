  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimally invasive surgery has become the standard treatment for many gynecologic disease&#xD;
      processes. In the last decade, numerous studies have demonstrated that laparoscopic&#xD;
      approaches to various gynecologic oncology conditions-particularly for early-stage&#xD;
      endometrial and cervical cancers as well as select pelvic masses-is feasible and results in&#xD;
      shorter hospital stays, improved quality of life and comparable surgical and oncologic&#xD;
      outcomes to abdominal staging [1-5].For instance, the typical gynecologic robotic surgical&#xD;
      procedure will require Two to three 5-mm ports and one 12-mm laparoscopic ports. Recently, an&#xD;
      even less invasive alternative to conventional laparoscopy surgery has been developed:&#xD;
      laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS), also known as single-port surgery. Single port&#xD;
      laparoscopy is an attempt to further enhance the cosmetic benefits of minimally invasive&#xD;
      surgery while minimizing the potential morbidity associated with multiple incisions. However,&#xD;
      to our knowledge, there are no randomize control trial to evaluate of single port or multiple&#xD;
      ports laparoscopic surgery in gynecologic disorders. The purpose of this study was to assess&#xD;
      the feasibility of SPA-LAVH in the treatment of benign uterine disease.&#xD;

      Overall Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical controlled trial will be undertaken among patients who will receive&#xD;
      laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will receive laparoscopic surgery using CO2 gas as distension medium. At the&#xD;
      end of the surgery, in the control group, CO2 was removed by passive exsufflation through the&#xD;
      port site. The patients will be placed in the Trendelenburg position (30 degrees).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention group: 50 patients receive the single port-access laparoscopic-assisted&#xD;
      vaginal hysterectomy. Under general anesthesia, the patient was positioned in the supine&#xD;
      position with the legs extended, and prepped and draped in the routine sterile fashion. The&#xD;
      legs were protected with foam padding. At the start of surgery, a 2-cm intraumbilical&#xD;
      incision was made. Adhesiolysis was performed if adhesions between the viscera and peritoneum&#xD;
      existed from prior abdominal surgery or past abdominopelvic infection. The single-port system&#xD;
      was made based on a modification of Lee et al. procedure [8]. After insertion of the wound&#xD;
      protractor (Alexis X-small for 2-4 cm incisions, Applied Medical, CA, USA) into the abdominal&#xD;
      cavity, the extraabdominal portion of the wound protractor was rolled up with the wrist&#xD;
      portion of a surgical glove (TriflexLP, 7-0; Cardinal Health, OH, USA; Fig. 1). The finger&#xD;
      portion of the glove was resected and tied to prevent leakage of carbon dioxide. The first&#xD;
      trocar sleeve for laparoscopy was created after a small incision in the upper portion of the&#xD;
      glove was made in the midline. After insertion of a trocar sleeve, the surrounding glove was&#xD;
      lifted up with two mosquito forceps and tied to the trocar sleeve. Next, carbon dioxide was&#xD;
      insufflated to maintain intra-abdominal pressure at 12-14 mmHg, depending on age and&#xD;
      condition of the patient. Five- or 10-mm laparoscopes were used as needed. These laparoscopes&#xD;
      have an incorporated light source within the camera head that does not compete for the very&#xD;
      limited space in the port site. One or two additional 5-mm trocar sleeves were introduced&#xD;
      through the single port system to make an imaginary triangle with the previous port for the&#xD;
      camera to avoid clashing and to maximize surgical movement. A uterine manipulator was&#xD;
      inserted to optimize visualization and accessibility in the surgical field . Then the&#xD;
      laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy was perform as usual. Finally, the approach to the&#xD;
      fascia and peritoneum is easier via the umbilicus than an extra-umbilical area; the&#xD;
      peritoneum and fascia were approximated and closed layer by layer with 2-0 Vicryl suture and&#xD;
      the skin was selectively sutured .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group: 50 patients receive the multiple ports-access laparoscopic-assisted&#xD;
      vaginal hysterectomy (traditional LAVH, usually 3-4 ports) as previous described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of single port-access&#xD;
      laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy. The operative time, weight of the uterus, blood&#xD;
      loss and hospital stay will be record, respectively. The pain score is based on the visual&#xD;
      analogue scale in which patients record the intensity of their pain 12, 24, and 48 hours&#xD;
      after surgery. The rate of multiple ports laparoscopy convert to transabdominal hysterectomy&#xD;
      will be record. The rate of single ports laparoscopy convert to multiple ports laparoscopy or&#xD;
      transabdominal hysterectomy will be record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The morbidity (wound infection, hernia, fever...) associated with surgery will be noted, too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment allocation was performed in accordance with a computer-generated randomization&#xD;
      sequence using numbered, sealed envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Inclusion/ Exclusion Criteria Inclusion&#xD;

           I-II&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The procedure will be required to conversion to laparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Any cardio-vascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Malignant disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects: 100 Methods: In the intervention group : 50 patients receive the single&#xD;
      port-access laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group : 50 patients receive the multiple ports-access laparoscopic-assisted&#xD;
      vaginal hysterectomy (traditional LAVH, usually 3-4 ports).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Study Timelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (submission date to Health authority in 1st country, dates of start and end of subject&#xD;
      enrolment, end of study) Dates of start: Aug., 2009 End of study: Aug., 2011&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of efficacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In calculating the sample size required, the primary assessment was the post-operative time&#xD;
      and blood loss. We determined a required sample size of 50 patients per group for a&#xD;
      two-tailed X2 test with 80% power and a P level of .05. Thus a total of 100 analyzable&#xD;
      patients were obtained for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will follow the patients until one month after the surgery. The primary outcome measure of&#xD;
      this trial is the effect and safety of single port-access laparoscopic-assisted vaginal&#xD;
      hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normality was assessed by means of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Differences between the&#xD;
      groups were analyzed by using an unpaired two-tailed t test for continuous variables and the&#xD;
      X2 test for binomial outcomes (Stata 10 Edition for Windows, StataCorp LP, College Station,&#xD;
      TX). The pain scores over time and their interaction with the intervention were analyzed by&#xD;
      means of the analysis of variance for repeated measures (SPSS 15.0.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago,&#xD;
      IL). Effects were considered statistically significant for P&lt;.05&#xD;
