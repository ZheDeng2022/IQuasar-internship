      This will be a 36-week, single group, open label study assessing the effects of Tadalafil&#xD;
      plus Ambrisentan combination therapy in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension&#xD;
      associated with the scleroderma spectrum of disease (PAH-SSD). Standard outcome measures such&#xD;
      as six-minute walk distance (6MWD), New York heart Association (NYHA) classification, and&#xD;
      hemodynamic measurements will be assessed, as well as novel functional measures of RV-PV&#xD;
      function including the transthoracic echocardiogram parameter tricuspid annular plane&#xD;
      systolic ejection (TAPSE), contrast-enhanced cardiac MRI and heart rate variability assessed&#xD;
      by Holter monitoring. This design (excluding a placebo arm) was selected for ethical concerns&#xD;
      and to provide optimal efficiency and active therapy to all study subjects. It also allows&#xD;
      for comparisons between the two monotherapies and with combination therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) includes a heterogeneous group of clinical entities&#xD;
      sharing similar clinical and pathological features that have been subcategorized as&#xD;
      idiopathic PAH (IPAH, formerly known as &quot;primary pulmonary hypertension&quot; or PPH), familial&#xD;
      PAH, pulmonary hypertension related to connective tissue diseases (such as systemic&#xD;
      sclerosis), portopulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension related to HIV infection,&#xD;
      drugs and toxins (10). PAH is clinically defined by a resting mean pulmonary artery pressure&#xD;
      ≥ 25 mmHg and pulmonary artery wedge pressure ≤ 15 mmHg in the absence of left heart disease,&#xD;
      underlying parenchymal lung disease, thromboembolic disease or other causes of pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAH is characterized by increased pulmonary vascular resistance due to remodeling and&#xD;
      occlusion of the pulmonary arterioles. Left untreated, PAH leads irremediably to right&#xD;
      ventricular (RV) hypertrophy, pressure overload and dilation resulting in death within 2-3&#xD;
      years (11). For the past two decades, it has been appreciated that the integrity of the RV&#xD;
      function, rather than the degree of pulmonary vascular injury, is the major determinant of&#xD;
      symptoms and mortality in patients with PAH. RV dysfunction at time of presentation, as&#xD;
      reflected by an elevation in right atrial pressure (RAP), the presence of pericardial&#xD;
      effusion or depressed cardiac output (CO), is a powerful prognosticator of death (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current PAH therapies consist of prostacyclin analogues, endothelin receptor antagonists&#xD;
      (ETRA) and phosphodiesterase type V (PDE V) inhibitors (13). All have been shown to be&#xD;
      effective in improving exercise capacity as measured by the 6 MWD in short term (12 - 16&#xD;
      week) randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials. However, the clinical response is&#xD;
      highly variable and mortality remains high (14). Moreover, the majority of subjects enrolled&#xD;
      in these trials have had IPAH. Over the past 10 years, the Johns Hopkins Pulmonary&#xD;
      Hypertension Program and Scleroderma Center have worked closely to address the daunting&#xD;
      clinical challenge of PAH associated with scleroderma or systemic sclerosis (PAH-SSc).&#xD;
      Previous work from our group (15;16) and others (17-19) has clearly demonstrated a markedly&#xD;
      worse prognosis in PAH-SSc compared with IPAH despite similar treatments. An intriguing and&#xD;
      consistent finding when comparing these two groups is that whereas mPAP is, on average, lower&#xD;
      in PAH-SSc, markers of RV dysfunction (e.g. CO and RAP) are similar, raising the possibility&#xD;
      of maladaptive RV response to pressure overload and/or intrinsic myocardial disease. Current&#xD;
      PAH therapies target pathways that have been implicated in the remodeling of the pulmonary&#xD;
      vasculature (PV). However, there is no clear evidence that these therapies have altered PV&#xD;
      and/or RV remodeling or offered significant beneficial effects in patients with PAH-SSc in&#xD;
      whom mortality remains exceedingly high. In addition, their effects on RV dysfunction and&#xD;
      RV-PV interaction remain poorly characterized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that improvement in PAH-SSc will only be achieved with therapy directly&#xD;
      targeted at RV-PV dysfunction. Sildenafil and tadalafil inhibit phosphodiesterase type 5&#xD;
      (PDE5) which is abundant in the lung and is the main enzyme responsible for cyclic Guanosine&#xD;
      MonoPhosphate (cGMP) hydrolysis. The resulting increase in cGMP probably mediates the&#xD;
      relaxant and anti-hypertrophic actions of nitric oxide and natriuretic peptides in vascular&#xD;
      tissues, and exerts a direct anti-hypertrophic action on cardiac muscle as demonstrated in&#xD;
      compelling preliminary experiments by investigators of the NHLBI-funded Hopkins Scientific&#xD;
      Center of Clinically Oriented Research (SCCOR) in Pulmonary Vascular Disease. In these&#xD;
      experiments, sildenafil was capable of preventing and reversing RV hypertrophy and&#xD;
      dysfunction in a model of pulmonary artery banding, similar to its effects on the left&#xD;
      ventricle with aortic banding (20), indicating a direct beneficial action on RV remodeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both sildenafil (21) and tadalafil (22) have been demonstrated to be effective in PAH and are&#xD;
      FDA approved for this indication. The endothelin-receptor antagonists, bosentan (23) and&#xD;
      ambrisentan (24), are also FDA-labeled for this indication and represent alternative options&#xD;
      for oral therapy of PAH (25). A small randomized study comparing sildenafil with bosentan&#xD;
      suggested that sildenafil was superior in reducing RV mass and improving exercise capacity in&#xD;
      patients with PAH (26). Recently, the results of a large multi-center randomized, controlled&#xD;
      trial of tadalafil therapy for PAH have been presented. The data indicate, that similar to&#xD;
      sildenafil, tadalafil at doses of 20 and 40 mg per day, improved exercise capacity. In&#xD;
      addition, tadalafil 40 mg per day improved pulmonary hemodynamics, quality of life and&#xD;
      reduced the incidence of clinical worsening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to compare the effects of upfront combination therapy with tadalafil and&#xD;
      ambrisentan in PAH-SSc on PVR and RV mass. It will also assess novel markers of RV function&#xD;
      by cardiac MRI and echocardiography, as well as the conventional endpoints, including 6 MWD&#xD;
      and functional class. The trial is unique in that it will enroll only PAH-SSc patients, the&#xD;
      PAH subgroup with the poorest outcomes and will be considerably longer in duration (36 weeks)&#xD;
      than previous studies.&#xD;
