      A key factor in the determination of body composition over the lifecourse is fat accumulation&#xD;
      during childhood. Periods of life associated with the greatest changes in organ development&#xD;
      and growth, i.e. early childhood, have the most significant effect on body composition,&#xD;
      energy balance, and metabolism. Early childhood (age 3 to 7 years) represents a critical&#xD;
      transition for the basis of adaptability in body composition, due to the rapid growth and&#xD;
      development that occurs. Plausibly the phenotype underlying obesity and related health risk&#xD;
      may be determined by body composition during this critical period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our previous research in children has consistently indicated that HA children accumulate&#xD;
      greater amounts of fat, particularly in the intra-abdominal compartment, even at similar a&#xD;
      BMI, and lower bone mineral content relative to EA children. The reason for these differences&#xD;
      in body composition over the lifecourse is not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Racial/ethnic differences in risk factors for health, including 'thriftiness' in body fat&#xD;
      accumulation are often evident before the age of 7, suggesting that the racial/ethnic&#xD;
      differences in energy utilization and subsequent fat storage may be accounted for by genetic&#xD;
      make-up, the environment (e.g. diet), or an interaction of the two. The physiologic or&#xD;
      behavioral process(es) that cause(s) certain children to take a trajectory towards obesity&#xD;
      while others accrue less fat is not known. However, the economic decision of fuel utilization&#xD;
      is a physiologic trait enabling the body to choose between shuttling 'energy' towards accrual&#xD;
      of a particular tissue (e.g. bone vs. fat) and this trait likely has a genetic component.&#xD;
      This genetic component may be embedded in fat storage capacity evolved from gene by&#xD;
      environment interactions that promote thrift, particularly conserved in some populations.&#xD;
      Although genetic background plays a role, it not known whether there is a relationship&#xD;
      between genetic background, known candidate genes or candidate pathways and environmental&#xD;
      contributors (e.g. diet) that impact body composition trajectory. Of central importance to&#xD;
      our understanding of early fat mass accumulation in health disparities are the mechanisms&#xD;
      that lead to chronic disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is likely that variations within candidate genes may have a differential impact on&#xD;
      individuals based on their genetic background. It is also probable that body composition is&#xD;
      influenced by many genes, often within the same metabolic pathways, with small individual&#xD;
      effects. These genes may not be significantly associated individually, but when examined as a&#xD;
      unit (in a candidate pathway or gene-gene interaction framework) the association becomes&#xD;
      significant. Further, children's early environmental exposures (e.g. diet) may interact with&#xD;
      both genetic background and variations in candidate genes along resulting in alterations in&#xD;
      body composition that predispose HA to excess fat accumulation throughout the lifecourse. To&#xD;
      that end, the following specific aims will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To examine the associations between genetic admixture and body composition in children&#xD;
      aged 3-7 years after controlling for dietary intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hypothesis 1.1: There is a direct association between Amerindian admixture and fat mass&#xD;
           and in inverse association between Amerindian admixture and bone mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis 1.2: There is a direct association between energy intake and fat accumulation&#xD;
           and the relationship will be particularly evident in individuals with a greater&#xD;
           proportion of Amerindian admixture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To examine the associations between genetic admixture and bone marrow fat in children&#xD;
      aged 3-7 years after controlling for dietary intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hypothesis 2.1: There is a direct association between Amerindian admixture and bone&#xD;
           marrow fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis 2.2: There is a direct association between energy intake and fat accumulation&#xD;
           in bone marrow and the relationship will be particularly evident in individuals with a&#xD;
           greater proportion of Amerindian admixture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. To examine the relationship between variation in candidate genes and pathways and&#xD;
      Amerindian admixture controlling for dietary intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Hypothesis 3.1: Amerindian admixture will be associated with variations in candidate genes&#xD;
      and pathways known to be associated with fat accumulation.&#xD;
