    <textblock>
      Publications with different conclusions are available with regard to the correlations between&#xD;
      the cholecystolithiasis, cholecystectomy and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In this&#xD;
      study, the controversial relationship between cholecystolithiasis, cholecystectomy and GERD&#xD;
      is discussed through the impedance pH method which started to be used in recent years, a&#xD;
      method indicating the gas and liquid (acid and non-acid) gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and&#xD;
      esophageal clearance time.&#xD;

      Gallstones are observed among 6-20% of the people in the world and 2 folds in women than in&#xD;
      men. The symptomatic treatment of the cholecystolithiasis is the cholecystectomy and it is&#xD;
      known that every year in United States of America (USA) more than 750.000 cholecystectomy&#xD;
      operations are performed. Usually applied to laparoscopic surgery, in experienced hands with&#xD;
      great success, but the application is not without problems and can cause the condition called&#xD;
      postcholecystectomy syndrome. Postcholecystectomy syndrome is a heterogeneous condition and&#xD;
      may occur depending on many causes. One of the suggested reasons is the increasing&#xD;
      gastroesophageal reflux diseases (GER). Publications indicating the increase of GER after&#xD;
      cholecystectomy are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relationship between the gallbladder stone and the reflux; whether reflux increases after&#xD;
      cholecystectomy is a controversial subject. In current studies, the assessments of reflux are&#xD;
      performed by different techniques such as interview, endoscopy and 24-hour pH monitoring.&#xD;
      These evaluations are often useful in detecting acid reflux. Whereas it is known that after&#xD;
      cholecystectomy alkaline bile reflux may be determined in stomach. Therefore, the&#xD;
      determination of bile reflux in esophagus after cholecystectomy is also possible. This&#xD;
      situation may be important in terms of esophagus adenocarcinoma, because the esophagus&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma generally develops in the basis of Barrett's esophagus and alkaline reflux is&#xD;
      accepted to contribute to developing Barrett's esophagus (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bile reflux into the stomach is reported in a rate of 30-100% after stomach surgery and&#xD;
      80-90% after gallbladder surgery. Even though bile reflux is observed in such a high&#xD;
      percentage, not every kind bile reflux will damage the gastric and esophageal mucosa. Leaking&#xD;
      up into the stomach (reflux), the bile and pancreatic secretions presented in the duodenum&#xD;
      content mix up with the hydrochloric acid and pepsin presented in stomach, and thereby damage&#xD;
      occurs in the gastric and esophageal mucosa. The continuation of this interaction may develop&#xD;
      gastritis, esophagitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The increase of alkaline reflux and its importance are known in the development of Barrett's&#xD;
      esophagus, which is a component of GER spectrum and which can develop into adenocarcinoma. As&#xD;
      a result of research performed on people with cholecystectomy, the risk of developing&#xD;
      esophageal cancer has been shown to increase moderately. This is probably duo to the reflux&#xD;
      of the bile found in the duodenum content through the esophagus. Nowadays only acid reflux&#xD;
      can be determined by the widely used 24-hour pH-meter. The bile-sensitive Bilitec is a&#xD;
      difficult method to implement and it is not widely used. Impedance-pH is a recently developed&#xD;
      technique used to monitor all kinds of reflux (gas, liquid, acides and non-acides), reflux&#xD;
      level and the clearance period of the esophagus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study: To investigate the relationship between GER, cholecystolithiasis&#xD;
      and cholecystectomy by using the Impedance-pH method.&#xD;
