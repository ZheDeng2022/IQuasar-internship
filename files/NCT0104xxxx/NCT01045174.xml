  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Breath-Actuated Nebulizer is a newer type of nebulizer device that creates aerosol only&#xD;
      when a patient is inhaling, rather than creating aerosol continuously. It is thought that&#xD;
      breath-actuated nebulizer devices may deliver asthma rescue medications to patients' lungs&#xD;
      more effectively and therefore lead them to recover from asthma attacks faster than&#xD;
      conventional continuous-output nebulizer devices. This study compares outcomes including&#xD;
      hospital admission rates, number of nebulized treatments required, and patient/family&#xD;
      satisfaction when a breath-actuated nebulizer device versus a conventional continuous-output&#xD;
      nebulizer is used to deliver asthma medications to pediatric asthma patients in the emergency&#xD;
      department.&#xD;
