  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Normally breathing is controlled by a reflex that responds to the levels of carbon dioxide&#xD;
      (CO2) in the blood. In heart failure, where the heart muscle is damaged and therefore does&#xD;
      not pump as well, this reflex is exaggerated. The result is a vicious circle: blood CO2&#xD;
      levels fluctuate wildly and as a result breathing also fluctuates with patients&#xD;
      hyperventilating at times and briefly stopping breathing at others. During sleep this is&#xD;
      called central sleep apnoea (CSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CSA wake up throughout the night and whilst some patients are oblivious to&#xD;
      this, others are consciously breathless and many patients are tired during the day and feel&#xD;
      unable to perform their daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the body's stress response to the erratic pattern of breathing, both blood&#xD;
      pressure and heart rate may rise to a level that is harmful in a failing heart, exacerbating&#xD;
      the underlying heart failure. Indeed patients who demonstrate this CSA die sooner than those&#xD;
      who have heart failure and stable breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no proven specific therapies for CSA that stabilise breathing, improve sleep&#xD;
      quality, and prolong life. We have designed a system which delivers very small doses of CO2,&#xD;
      when the blood level of CO2 is predicted to be low. During short daytime recordings, using&#xD;
      this system, we have demonstrated that it is possible to stabilise the body's CO2 levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to test what happens when CO2 is given overnight whilst the patient is sleeping to see&#xD;
      whether we can stabilise their breathing over longer durations and whether sleep quality&#xD;
      could be improved so that patients are less tired during the day. In addition, we would like&#xD;
      to measure whether the stress response is lessened if the breathing is successfully&#xD;
      stabilised.&#xD;
