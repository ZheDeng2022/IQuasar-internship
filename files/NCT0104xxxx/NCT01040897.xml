    <textblock>
      In 2003, Surgeon General Richard Carmona suggested that low health literacy is &quot;one of the&#xD;
      largest contributors to our nation's epidemic of overweight and obesity.&quot; Over 26% of&#xD;
      preschool children are now overweight or obese, and children who are overweight by age 24&#xD;
      months are five times as likely as non-overweight children to become overweight adolescents.&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of a low-literacy/numeracy-oriented&#xD;
      intervention aimed at teaching pediatric resident physicians to promote healthy family&#xD;
      lifestyles and prevent overweight among young children (age 0-2) and their families in&#xD;
      under-resourced communities.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In 2003, Surgeon General Richard Carmona stated that low health literacy was &quot;one of the&#xD;
      largest contributors to our nation's epidemic of overweight and obesity.&quot; This assertion is&#xD;
      supported by recent studies which have found that low health literacy or numeracy is&#xD;
      associated with poorer caregiver breastfeeding knowledge, incorrect mixing of infant formula,&#xD;
      difficulty understanding food labels and portion sizes, and higher Body Mass Index (BMI) in&#xD;
      adults and children. Of particular concern is the impact of the obesity epidemic on our&#xD;
      youngest children. Over 26% of preschool children are now overweight (BMI≥85%) or obese&#xD;
      (BMI≥95%) (based on 2007 Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control Expert Panel&#xD;
      definitions). Rates of obesity in preschool children have doubled over the past decade, with&#xD;
      the highest increases among low income and minority children-- the same communities most&#xD;
      affected by low health literacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, clinical efforts to prevent or treat childhood obesity have had limited efficacy.&#xD;
      Efforts need to start early, because children who are overweight by age two are five times as&#xD;
      likely to become overweight adolescents, and subsequently at higher risk for obesity-related&#xD;
      complications including early-onset Type-2 Diabetes and cardiovascular disease. No published&#xD;
      clinical studies have rigorously addressed obesity prevention prior to age 2 with a specific&#xD;
      low-literacy and numeracy focus. Addressing caregiver health literacy in early childhood is&#xD;
      an innovative strategy to promote healthy nutrition and activity among these families and&#xD;
      prevent unhealthy weight gain across the child's life, which would have great public health&#xD;
      significance by preventing both child and adult chronic illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a multi-site randomized, controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a&#xD;
      low-literacy/numeracy-oriented intervention designed to promote healthy family lifestyles and&#xD;
      to prevent early childhood obesity. The intervention will be delivered through pediatric&#xD;
      resident physicians in primary care settings in under-resourced communities. Four academic&#xD;
      medical centers will be randomized: Vanderbilt University, the University of Miami, the&#xD;
      University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and New York University. Two centers will&#xD;
      receive the intervention, while the other two centers will receive an active control. At each&#xD;
      site, a cohort of 250 English- or Spanish-speaking caregiver-child dyads will be enrolled and&#xD;
      followed from the child's 2 month well-child visit through the 24-month well-child visit. The&#xD;
      intervention will include a low-literacy-oriented toolkit for pediatric residents to use with&#xD;
      families and clear health communication training for the pediatric residents. At control&#xD;
      sites, pediatric residents will provide &quot;usual care&quot; with respect to lifestyle counseling,&#xD;
      but they will also receive an injury-prevention education program to act as an attention&#xD;
      control. The primary hypotheses are that the intervention will improve family dietary and&#xD;
      physical activity behaviors and that it will reduce the rate of childhood overweight&#xD;
      (BMI≥85%) at age 24 months.&#xD;
