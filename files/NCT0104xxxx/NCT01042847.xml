  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence that our immune system can help fight cancer. This has stimulated&#xD;
      interest in the development and application of tumor vaccines for several human solid tumors,&#xD;
      including epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). A major obstacle to the development of these&#xD;
      vaccines is that there are specialty cells called regulatory T cells that prevent the immune&#xD;
      system from attacking all of our organs. These regulatory T cells also prevent our immune&#xD;
      system for attacking cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an enzyme that degrades an essential amino acid tryptophan&#xD;
      that is necessary for T cells to multiply, however regulatory T cells are less susceptible to&#xD;
      low levels of tryptophan, and can still multiply. This allows cancer growth and progression.&#xD;
      This may be explained by genetic polymorphisms (changes) in the IDO gene, which may alter its&#xD;
      function. Five of these changes in the IDO gene have been described. In this research&#xD;
      project, we are asking if you would donate a small piece of your tumor and ascites to see if&#xD;
      we can examine your IDO gene in the tumor cells and see if any of these gene changes are&#xD;
      present. We hope that this will help us understand how the immune system works in EOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that genetic polymorphisms within the IDO gene alter its enzymatic activity&#xD;
      and affect the outcome of ovarian cancer patients. These findings have the potential to&#xD;
      translate into a method for predicting successful immunotherapy.&#xD;
