    <textblock>
      Early childhood (~4-6 years of age) is an important window for determining body composition&#xD;
      trajectory and may be a critical period for the development of tissue partitioning patterns&#xD;
      that influence later disease risk, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. As adiposity&#xD;
      accelerates during this critical period, deposition/ preservation of fat stores may be&#xD;
      sustained at the 'expense' of other tissues; i.e. energy homeostasis may be inherently biased&#xD;
      toward fat gain. The type and amount of tissue mass accrued in early childhood has&#xD;
      implications for metabolic profile, glucose/insulin homeostasis, hormone profile and resting&#xD;
      energy expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interplay between fat and bone deposition represents a physiologic trait enabling the&#xD;
      body to choose between shuttling 'energy' towards accrual of a particular tissue. Plausibly&#xD;
      the phenotype underlying obesity and diabetes risk may be determined by the differentiation&#xD;
      of cell type (adipocyte, osteocyte, etc.) during this early stage of growth and development.&#xD;
      In vitro studies demonstrate transdifferentiation under the influence of specific external&#xD;
      stimuli, which can switch phenotypes toward other cell lineages. Further, rodent models have&#xD;
      demonstrated that exposure to stimuli (exercise) early in life may prevent excess fat mass&#xD;
      accrual in adulthood, even when the stimulus is later removed (animals are no longer&#xD;
      exercising). Children's early experiences (engagement in physical activity) may&#xD;
      'environmentally induce' alterations in body composition and predispose individuals to&#xD;
      diabetes throughout life (Figure 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses and Specific Aims: Early growth patterns and cell differentiation may induce long&#xD;
      term effects on body composition by impacting biological and hormonal axes that regulate&#xD;
      childhood body composition. Body composition comprises not only absolute mass, but also&#xD;
      aspects of size, shape and location. To that end, the following specific aims will be&#xD;
      evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quantify body composition, adipose tissue distribution, and relative tissue ratios using&#xD;
           magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Hypothesis: Early partitioning of 'resources' toward fat mass accrual will lead to&#xD;
                decreased gains in bone mass that may persist long-term.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Hypothesis: Partitioning of tissue toward fat at the expense of bone mass (and&#xD;
                indirectly, lean mass) will result in adverse effects on glucose/insulin&#xD;
                metabolism, total energy expenditure, resting metabolic rate and hormone signaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Hypothesis: Children with greater levels of physical activity (energy expenditure)&#xD;
                will have greater partitioning towards bone (and lean) mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quantify adipose tissue distribution and adipocyte cell size and number using MRI and&#xD;
           histological techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Hypothesis: A relatively greater amount of bone marrow adipose tissue will be&#xD;
                apparent in those children with low levels of physical activity, resulting in the&#xD;
                preferential differentiation of pluripotent stem cells towards adipocytes vs&#xD;
                osteocytes in the bone marrow cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. A relatively greater adipocyte cell number will be apparent in those children with&#xD;
                low levels of physical activity indicating greater differentiation of MSC towards&#xD;
                adipocytes vs osteocytes.&#xD;
