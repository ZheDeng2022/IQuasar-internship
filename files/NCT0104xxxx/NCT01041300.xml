  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our aim is to Test the influence of a new multichanel Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation&#xD;
      stimulator (Multiway) on motor excitation, in comparision to a wildly used Magstim Super&#xD;
      Rapid 2 single channel stimulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the 20 Healthy subjects that are inticipated to inrole to the study wiil undergo 6&#xD;
      simple procedures which are designed to compare the motor threshold obtained by diffrent&#xD;
      combination of TMs coils (figure 8, double cone coil,H coil array) and stimulators (Multiway,&#xD;
      Super Rapid 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire length of the procedures is about 4 hours and all subjects will be paid for their&#xD;
      participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main hypothesis is that the motor threshold obtained by the multichanel stimulator will&#xD;
      be significtly lower then the single chanel stimulator.&#xD;
