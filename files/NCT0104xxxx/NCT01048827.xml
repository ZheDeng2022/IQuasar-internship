  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Busulfan and etoposide have been used as preparative therapy for autoSCT (stem cell&#xD;
      transplant) in adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at UCSF for the past 10 years. Over&#xD;
      this period and together with collaborative transplant centers, over 200 patients have&#xD;
      received this treatment. By intent-to-treat analysis, and with median follow-up of 7.0 years,&#xD;
      the 5-year DFS is 55%. The current protocol will utilize the combination of IV Busulfan (BU)&#xD;
      and etoposide. The busulfan dose will be escalated amongst 3 targeted dose levels. All&#xD;
      targeted dose levels represent higher busulfan dosing than standard myeloablative dosing,&#xD;
      with the lowest dose being approximately 14% higher than standard. Busulfan levels will be&#xD;
      monitored after the first, fourth and twelfth doses. Dose adjustments will be made &quot;in real&#xD;
      time&quot; based on AUC levels determined from the first and fourth doses. This strategy of&#xD;
      busulfan monitoring and dose adjustment has improved the therapeutic widow of BU in previous&#xD;
      clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current protocol will utilize the combination of intravenous busulfan and etoposide. The&#xD;
      busulfan dose will be escalated amongst 3 targeted dose levels (area under the curve (AUC)&#xD;
      levels at time 6 hours of 1250 uMol*min, 1400 uMol*min and 1550 uMol*min). All targeted dose&#xD;
      levels represent higher busulfan dosing than standard myeloablative dosing with the lowest&#xD;
      dose (1250 uMol*min) being approximately 14% higher than standard. In the absence of&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity, cohorts of 4-6 patients will be treated at each dose level and 10&#xD;
      additional patients will be treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to confirm safety.&#xD;
      The busulfan dosing will begin at 1 mg/kg based on historical plasma levels obtained from&#xD;
      patients receiving BU at a starting dose of 0.8 mg/kg at UCSF Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The highest dose level proposed for this study will exceed the reported toxic level for&#xD;
      busulfan in the alloSCT setting. Patients will be followed closely for toxicity and strict&#xD;
      stopping rules have been included. Eligibility criteria will exclude patients with prior&#xD;
      history of hepatotoxicity or viral hepatitis. Potential hepatotoxic agents will not be&#xD;
      allowed just prior to and during the busulfan dosing period. In addition, patients who&#xD;
      experience hepatotoxicty during pre-transplant mobilization therapy may be excluded from&#xD;
      receiving dose-escalated busulfan therapy. Every attempt will be made to prevent or avoid&#xD;
      hepatotoxicity.&#xD;

      TREATMENT: STEP 1 - CONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Etoposide 10 mg/kg IV continuous infusion over 24 hrs for 4 days (total course dose 40&#xD;
           mg/kg). Dose should be based on corrected weight, calculated as follows: Ideal + 25% of&#xD;
           the difference between actual and ideal weight. If actual is less than ideal weight use&#xD;
           actual weight. Etoposide infusion should be mixed in normal saline at a concentration of&#xD;
           0.4-0.5 mg/ml. The infusion volume will be approximately 1.39 ml/kg/hour and should be&#xD;
           rounded to the nearest 500-1000 ml and infused through a central venous catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cytarabine (ara-C) 2,000 mg/m2 IV over 2 h q 12 h x 8 doses Days 1-4. Cytarabine dosage&#xD;
           should be based on corrected weight, calculated as follows: Ideal weight + 25% of the&#xD;
           difference between actual and ideal weight. If actual weight is less than ideal weight,&#xD;
           use actual weight.Begin concurrent with etoposide infusion. Cytarabine doses should be&#xD;
           mixed in 250 ml of D5W.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prevent neurotoxicity from high-dose cytarabine (HDAC), cytarabine doses will be adjusted&#xD;
      according to renal function. The dose of cytarabine will be reduced to 1000 mg/m2/dose if&#xD;
      creatinine is 1.5-1.9 mg/dL or if there is an increase from baseline creatinine at start of&#xD;
      cytarabine of 0.6-1.1 mg/dL (example: baseline creatinine 0.8 mg/dL increase to 1.4 mg/dL&#xD;
      (difference of 0.6 mg/dL)), decrease cytarabine to 1000 mg/m2/dose.The dose of cytarabine&#xD;
      will be reduced to 100 mg/m2/dose if creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL or if there is an increase from&#xD;
      baseline &gt; 1.2 mg/dL.Cytarabine will be discontinued immediately for any clinical evidence of&#xD;
      cerebellar neurotoxicity (dysarthria, dysmetria, gait disturbance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supportive Care Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  G-CSF 5 mcg/kg (actual body weight) SQ daily beginning day 14. The dose will be&#xD;
           increased to 10 mcg/kg when WBC &gt; 1000/uL is achieved. G-CSF 10 mcg/kg should then be&#xD;
           continued until the peripheral blood stem cell collection has been completed. All G-CSF&#xD;
           doses should be rounded up to a convenient dose based on vial sizes of 300 and 480mcg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluoromethalone 0.1% ophthalmic solution (or equivalent medication) 2 drops qid to each&#xD;
           eye Days 1-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Voriconazole 200 mg PO Q12 hours beginning the day after completion of chemotherapy (Day&#xD;
           +6). Equivalent anti-fungal prophylaxis with itraconazole, posaconazole or&#xD;
           Liposomal-based amphotericin (1mg/kg) may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients should be hospitalized in private rooms when possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Strict low bacteria diet should be used when ANC &lt; 500 cells/uL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recommended mouth care:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Salt and soda swish tid&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transfusions: Institution standards should be followed for blood product support. In&#xD;
           lieu of standards, packed RBCes should be given to maintain the hemoglobin &gt;8.5 gm/dl or&#xD;
           hematocrit &gt;25%. Platelet should be transfused to keep the platelet count &gt;10-20 x&#xD;
           109/l. Blood should be filtered and irradiated (3000 cGy). CMV seronegative patients&#xD;
           should receive CMV-seronegative blood products if available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL (PBSC) COLLECTION&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Begin collections when the total white blood count exceeds 10,000/Âµl or when appropriate&#xD;
           based on peripheral CD34 cell counts (institutional standard)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim for a total of 1-4 collections with a standard target CD34 cell dose of &gt; 5 x 10 x&#xD;
           106/kg and an optimal target CD34 cell dose of &gt; 10 x 106/kg. The minimum CD34 cell dose&#xD;
           is &gt; 3 x 106/kg. Collections should continue until 10 x 106/kg CD34 (+) cell dose is&#xD;
           achieved unless not clinically feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stem Cell Collection: Process 18-20 L of whole blood over 3-4 hours according to&#xD;
           institutional standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PBSC Processing: The buffy coat is concentrated by centrifugation on Beckman centrifuge.&#xD;
           Cells are suspended in Normasol media with 5% autologous plasma and 10% DMSO to a final&#xD;
           cell concentration of 2.5 x 108/ml. Seventy ml aliquots are placed in polyolefin bags&#xD;
           and frozen in a controlled rate freezer. Bags are labeled then stored in the liquid&#xD;
           phase of a liquid nitrogen freezer. Institutional standard for PBSC processing should be&#xD;
           followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Four 2 ml aliquots of PBSC will be frozen in liquid nitrogen for future analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT: STEP 2 - AUTOLOGOUS STEM CELL TRANSPLANT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mandatory Recovery Period: The patient may begin preparative therapy for stem cell&#xD;
           transplant following a minimum of four weeks &quot;out-of-hospital&quot; time since discharge from&#xD;
           consolidation/mobilization chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose-Adjusted Busulfan&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Busulfan dose should be calculated using the corrected weight which equals ideal&#xD;
                weight + 25% of the difference between actual and ideal weight. If the actual&#xD;
                weight is less than ideal weight use actual weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The initial dose of busulfan (Dose cohort #1 = 1 mg/kg, Dose cohort #2 = 1.2 mg/kg,&#xD;
                Dose cohort # 3 = 1.4) will be given as a single intravenous dose on Day -10 (in&#xD;
                the morning, at 9:00AM). The dose will be administered by intravenous injection&#xD;
                over 2 hours in the Outpatient Ambulatory Care/Infusion Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. The infusion tubing will be primed with busulfan diluted with saline to ensure&#xD;
                     complete administration over 2 hours as detailed in Appendix 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. The busulfan will be administered through a well functioning central venous&#xD;
                     catheter. The busulfan infusion tubing should be connected directly to the&#xD;
                     central venous catheter hub (i.e. directly to the catheter) to ensure busulfan&#xD;
                     administration over two hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Busulfan levels will de drawn at 2, 3, 4 and 6 hours from the start of&#xD;
                     Busulfan Dose #1. For Doses #4 and #12, levels will be drawn just prior to&#xD;
                     infusion and at 2, 3, 4 and 6 hours, from a well functioning peripheral IV.&#xD;
                     (SEE Appendix 9 for busulfan sampling)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the busulfan is administered on Day -10, and the serial serum samples have been&#xD;
           obtained, the patient will be discharged from the ACC infusion center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Busulfan dosing will resume starting on day -8 and will be given IV q6h for an&#xD;
           additional 15 doses (total 16 doses). Patients at UCSF will receive busulfan&#xD;
           chemotherapy on the 11 Long Adult Inpatient Unit. Dose #2 will be administered at&#xD;
           approximately 8 pm. This dose will be adjusted based on target dose level and PK data&#xD;
           results following dose #1. The second dose will not be given until the PK data is&#xD;
           available from dose #1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PK studies will also be performed following the 4th and 12th doses. The final busulfan&#xD;
           dose-adjustment will be made at approximately dose #10 as determined by PK data. In some&#xD;
           cases, the dose-adjustment may be delayed due to travel time or problems at the&#xD;
           reference lab. No dose-adjustment will be made from data obtained from samplings made&#xD;
           following the 12th dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose adjustments will be based on a standard formula as recommended by the reference&#xD;
           laboratory. Adjustments will be made to achieve the target AUC level from doses 2 until&#xD;
           16. Dose adjustments will be calculated and confirmed by two physicians (including one&#xD;
           of the co-PI's, if possible) at UCSF Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose adjustments and busulfan laboratory values will also be reviewed regularly by Jeanine&#xD;
      McCune Ph D., at the University of Washington, in Seattle, WA. Dr. McCune is a collaborator&#xD;
      on this trial and manages the Busulfan pharmacokinetics laboratory in Seattle. She is a&#xD;
      leader in the field of Busulfan metabolism, pharmacokinetics and administration.&#xD;
