  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with neuroblastoma or a neuroendocrine tumor who have not been&#xD;
      able to have standard therapy or have failed the first-line therapy. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the combination of retinoic acid and&#xD;
      Onalta (Y-90-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide) in treating neuroblastoma and neuroendocrine tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study builds on the promising results of the Phase I trial of 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide&#xD;
      in childhood solid tumors and the history of cis-Retinoic Acid (cis-RA) use in children with&#xD;
      neuroblastoma. This study will combine these two agents in a randomized Phase II trial. The&#xD;
      safety and feasibility of using individual dosimetry measurements to maximize the&#xD;
      90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide radiation dose to tumor while limiting the renal radiation dose to&#xD;
      23 Gy will be rigorously tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fixed dosing will allow each subject to receive three cycles of 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide at&#xD;
      50 mCi/m2. Dosimetry will be performed at each of these cycles; the combined dosimetry&#xD;
      measurements will be utilized to determine whether or not a fourth cycle will be administered&#xD;
      and, if so, what that dose will be. The administration of this additional cycle is&#xD;
      conditional upon a) a subject not experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity during any previous&#xD;
      cycle and b) meeting all criteria required at study initiation prior to the fourth dose.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Disease Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A pathologically confirmed (histology or cytology) malignant neoplasm that is&#xD;
                  determined to be neuroblastoma or neuroendocrine tumor. The subject's neoplastic&#xD;
                  disease must have been (positively) imaged by OctreoScan® or&#xD;
                  111In-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide within 4 weeks prior to ordering study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. b) Disease not amenable to standard treatment (disease present after surgery&#xD;
                  and/or Sandostatin treatment) or subject has failed existing first line therapy&#xD;
                  (surgery and chemotherapy/radiation therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. c) Upon baseline disease assessment, all subjects must have at least 1&#xD;
                  measurable, evaluable, site of disease that either has never been irradiated or&#xD;
                  has been previously irradiated and has since demonstrated progression based on&#xD;
                  COG response criteria. Children's Oncology Group response criteria include: 1)&#xD;
                  Complete response (CR) is defined as no measureable disease; 2) partial response&#xD;
                  (PR) as &gt;50% decrease in longest X widest perpendicular diameter of target&#xD;
                  lesions with no increase in any lesions and no new lesions; 3) minor response&#xD;
                  (MR) as &gt;25%&lt;50% decrease in target lesions with no increase in any lesion and no&#xD;
                  new lesions; 4) stable disease as &lt;25% increase or decrease in any target lesion&#xD;
                  and no new lesions; 5) Progressive disease (PD) as an increase &gt;25% in any&#xD;
                  measureable lesion or the presence of any new lesion was considered progressive&#xD;
                  disease (PD). Response will be assessed based on intent to treat for all subjects&#xD;
                  who receive at least one dose of 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Each subject must have at least one measurable somatostatin receptor positive&#xD;
                  lesion that has not had local irradiation via external beam, conformal or&#xD;
                  stereotactic radiation treatments within 4 weeks prior to study drug&#xD;
                  administration and no full craniospinal radiation within 3 months prior to study&#xD;
                  drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Bone marrow with &gt;/= 40% cellularity or with 1 million CD34+ stem cells/kg&#xD;
                  stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Life expectancy &gt; 2 months and &lt; 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Biopsy of at least one lesion or bone marrow that has been identified as&#xD;
                  progressive malignancy within four weeks prior to the first dose of Onalta® is&#xD;
                  encouraged but not required. If no biopsy can be performed for clinical reasons,&#xD;
                  available tissue from a previous biopsy will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age 6 months-30 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. COG performance status /= 60% or Lansky Play Scale &gt;/= 60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count &gt;1000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets &gt;100,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin &lt;1.5 x nl for age and weight&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT) &amp; ALT(SGPT) &lt;2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal for age&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine &lt;1.0 for children &lt;5 years of age; &lt;1.2 for children 5-10 years of&#xD;
                  age; &lt;1.7 for &gt;10 years AND&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  GFR &gt;80 mL/min/1.73 m2&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  urinalysis with no greater than 1+ hematuria or proteinuria&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Cardiac function must be adequate&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  shortening fraction of &gt; 28% by echo&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ejection fraction &gt; 50% by bi-plane method of echo&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The effects of 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide on the developing human fetus are unknown.&#xD;
             Retinoic acid is known to be harmful to the developing human fetus. For these reasons&#xD;
             and because Class C agents are known to be teratogenic, women and men of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of&#xD;
             birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.&#xD;
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this&#xD;
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Serum triglycerides &lt;300 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Concomitant Therapy - The subject may not receive any other approved or&#xD;
             investigational anti-neoplastic therapies for the treatment of the refractory&#xD;
             somatostatin-receptor positive tumor during the course of the study, excluding&#xD;
             somatostatin analogues and bisphosphonates. However, all subjects on somatostatin&#xD;
             analogue therapy will discontinue therapy from 12 hours prior to a) injection with&#xD;
             OctreoScan® or 111In-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide, and b) infusion with&#xD;
             90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide until 12 hours post administration. Subjects who have been on&#xD;
             hormonal therapy (other than somatostatin analogues) for &gt; 2 months with SD or PD may&#xD;
             continue to receive hormonal therapy during this study. Subjects who initiate another&#xD;
             tumor-specific therapy will be discontinued from further treatment with&#xD;
             90YDOTA-tyr3-Octreotide. Disease progression alone does not mandate discontinuation of&#xD;
             a subject from treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects who have received at least one dose of 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide must continue&#xD;
        into the Long-Term Follow-up Study Period at the point of treatment discontinuation. This&#xD;
        is necessary to determine any long-term effects of treatment with 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide.&#xD;
        Subjects may receive, at the discretion of the investigator, appropriate medical treatment&#xD;
        for medical problems that arise while on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria for enrollment and Cycle One study period:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age less than 6 months or greater than 30 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pregnancy or breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Surgery, radiation or chemotherapy within 4 weeks of study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Another investigational drug within 4 weeks of study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. More than one, concurrent, malignant disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of congestive heart failure, unless cardiac ejection fraction ≥ 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Another significant medical, psychiatric, or surgical condition which is currently&#xD;
             uncontrolled by treatment and which would likely affect the subject's ability to&#xD;
             complete this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any subject for whom, in the opinion of their physician, a 24-hour discontinuation of&#xD;
             somatostatin analogue therapy represents a health risk. Also subjects who have&#xD;
             received long-acting somatostatin analogue in the past 21 days are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Bone marrow cellularity &lt;40% without &gt;/= 1 million CD34+ stem cells/kg stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. External beam radiation to both kidneys (scatter doses of &lt; 500 cGy to a single kidney&#xD;
             or radiation to &lt; 50% of a single kidney is acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Antibodies to 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide or Octreotide.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) of study drug administration or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to 90YDOTA-tyr3-Octreotide.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide is a&#xD;
             Class C agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because&#xD;
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary&#xD;
             to treatment of the mother with 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections&#xD;
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients receiving&#xD;
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide. Appropriate studies will&#xD;
             be undertaken in patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy when&#xD;
             indicated.&#xD;
