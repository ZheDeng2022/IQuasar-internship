      RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to&#xD;
      the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well proton radiation therapy works in treating&#xD;
      patients with prostate cancer.&#xD;

      Detailed Description&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Feasibility of proton radiation therapy (RT) using standard fractionation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine freedom from failure (FFF) (vs. biochemical/clinical progression-free&#xD;
      survival) with standard fractionation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the incidence of grade 2 or greater GU and GI toxicity with this regimen at&#xD;
      6 months, 2 years and 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess quality of life issues following completion of radiation therapy at 6 months&#xD;
      and at 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess incidence of impotence after the use of proton therapy at 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine freedom from biochemical failure (BF) at 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine clinical failure: local and/or distant at 5 years. VII. To determine salvage&#xD;
      androgen deprivation (SAD) use at 5 years. VIII. To determine progression free survival:&#xD;
      using clinical, biochemical and SAD as events at 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To determine overall survival at 5 years. X. To determine disease-specific survival at 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XI. Estimate prostate and normal structures movement during RT with the use of scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XII. Correlate pathologic and radiologic findings with outcomes at 5 years. XIII. Correlate&#xD;
      PSA and free PSA levels with outcomes at 5 years. XIV. Correlate testosterone levels and&#xD;
      variation with proton therapy and outcomes at 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XV. Develop a quality assurance process for proton prostate therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo proton radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for approximately 9 weeks in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3 months, every 6 months for 5&#xD;
      years, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
