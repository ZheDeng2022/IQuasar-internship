  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is associated with declines in aerobic capacity, exercise tolerance, and functional&#xD;
      endurance that lead to physical disability and loss of independence. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      existing high prevalence of obesity in the elderly is greatly exacerbating these&#xD;
      aging-related declines in function. To date, regular exercise is the only known therapy to&#xD;
      consistently improve aerobic function, and perhaps delay the onset of disability. Although&#xD;
      aerobic exercise training does benefit both aerobic capacity and endurance even in obese&#xD;
      persons, some data show that the maximal efficacy of exercise for improving aerobic function&#xD;
      is blunted by obesity. In addition, our preliminary data show a potential dose-response&#xD;
      benefit of concomitant fat loss on exercise-induced improvements in aerobic function. Thus,&#xD;
      combining an exercise intervention with caloric restriction resulting in fat loss may be more&#xD;
      efficacious for improving aerobic function than exercise alone in obese elderly, a population&#xD;
      at high risk for disability. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the amount of&#xD;
      fat loss (achieved through controlled underfeeding) affects the magnitude of improvement in&#xD;
      aerobic function (maximal aerobic capacity and endurance) in response to a standardized&#xD;
      exercise training stimulus that follows current recommendations for older persons.&#xD;

      Design Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 involves recruitment and screening followed by baseline research testing (Phase 2).&#xD;
      Next, subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three 5-month treatments (Phase 3):&#xD;
      exercise and high-caloric restriction diet, exercise and low-caloric restriction diet, or&#xD;
      exercise only. Subjects will complete follow-up testing after their 5 month intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary interventions: All participants will be randomly assigned to an exercise intervention&#xD;
      with either no dietary intervention (EX Only), or 1 of 2 hypocaloric controlled diets: 1)&#xD;
      -250 kcal/day deficit for low fat loss (EX+LOW CR) or 2) -600 kcal/day deficit for high fat&#xD;
      loss (EX+HIGH CR) for 20 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All meals are prepared individually after participants choose from a hypocaloric menu&#xD;
      designed by the RD to provide a balanced, healthy diet. The calorie level assigned for each&#xD;
      person will provide him/her with an absolute daily caloric deficit consistent with their&#xD;
      group assignment (-600 or -250 kcals/day). Individual calorie levels will be prescribed to&#xD;
      provide calorie levels to the nearest 50 kcals (e.g., 1100 kcal, 1150 kcal, 1200 kcal, etc.).&#xD;
      They are educated by the GCRC RDs and provided menus to guide their food purchasing and&#xD;
      preparation of daily breakfast meals that are consistent with the prescribed calorie level.&#xD;
      They are asked to consume only the food that is given to them or that is approved from the&#xD;
      breakfast menu. All participants will pick up their food 3 times/wk during the intervention,&#xD;
      and are asked to keep a log of everything they eat or drink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise intervention: The exercise will take place in an exercise facility at the Geriatric&#xD;
      Research Center on the campus of the Wake Forest University/Baptist Medical Center. Two study&#xD;
      personnel, including at least one trained technician, will supervise all exercise sessions.&#xD;
      Emergency equipment will be kept on site during exercise sessions. Blood pressure and heart&#xD;
      rate (HR) will be measured before each exercise session and subjects will warm-up by walking&#xD;
      for 3-5 min at a slow pace and will then walk at an intensity of 65-70% of heart rate reserve&#xD;
      (HRR, assessed during the VO2max test). The duration of walking exercise will progress from&#xD;
      15-20 mins at 50% HRR the 1st week to 30 mins at 65-70% HRR by the end of the 6th week and&#xD;
      thereafter. Each walking session will end with a 3-5 min cool-down followed by 5 min of large&#xD;
      muscle flexibility exercise.&#xD;
