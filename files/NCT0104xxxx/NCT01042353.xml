  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Background: Ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP) is the most prevalent nosocomial&#xD;
           infection in intensive care units (ICUs). Early microbiological diagnosis and initial&#xD;
           administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy are associated with a better&#xD;
           outcome. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should therefore be administered initially. However,&#xD;
           inconsiderate antibiotic use can increase the prevalence of multi-resistant bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Purpose: A rapid antimicrobial susceptibility method is required to decrease the&#xD;
           unnecessary use of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
           compare the efficiency of a rapid antibiogram, provided by E-test strips directly&#xD;
           applied to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples and analysed at 24 h, to that obtained&#xD;
           with standard methods of culture which provide a later result.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study design: This will be an open-label, prospective cohort study of consecutive&#xD;
           patients with VAP, conducted in a medical ICU. In addition to standard culture methods,&#xD;
           an E-test will be performed directly on BAL samples and analysed at 24 h. Each standard&#xD;
           BAL culture will be used as a control for the E-test method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary outcome: The occurrence of major errors, defined as isolates determined to be&#xD;
           susceptible by the E-test but resistant by standard culture methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary outcomes: The occurrence of minor errors (defined as isolates determined to be&#xD;
           resistant by the E-test and susceptible by the standard method), and a comparison of two&#xD;
           methods of seeding BAL samples on Mueller Hinton agar plates (swabbing method, flooding&#xD;
           method).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligibility criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inclusion criteria: all patients with suspected VAP (defined by a Clinical&#xD;
                Pulmonary Infection Score ≥5) undergoing BAL will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Exclusion criteria: contraindications for BAL (PaO2/FIO2 &lt;100, risk of&#xD;
                bronchoscopy-related haemorrhagic complications), secondary exclusion of patients&#xD;
                with negative cultures, defined by a threshold of bacteria &lt;104 CFU/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      BAL samples will be cultured by standard methods and the minimal inhibitory concentration&#xD;
      (MIC) of bacteria to the usual antibiotics will be determined using standard procedures. At&#xD;
      the time of BAL collection, a rapid antibiogram will be performed by placing E-test&#xD;
      antibiotic strips (AB Biodisk) directly onto Mueller-Hinton agar plates seeded with the BAL&#xD;
      specimen (both by flooding and swabbing). E-test strips will be impregnated with cefoxitin,&#xD;
      piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, imipenem, ciprofloxacin and amikacin. At 24 h, the E-test&#xD;
      plates will be photographed and then examined separately by both a bacteriologist and a&#xD;
      medical ICU physician following a consensus method. The final E-test results will be compared&#xD;
      with the standard MIC cultures.&#xD;
