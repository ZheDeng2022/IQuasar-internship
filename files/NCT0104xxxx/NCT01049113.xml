  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation Phase 1 study of the investigational agent, ON 013105.&#xD;
      In laboratory animal studies, ON 013105 has demonstrated anti-cancer activity. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to determine the highest dose of ON 013105 that can be given safely in patients&#xD;
      with relapsed/refractory Lymphoma or B-cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (Philadelphia&#xD;
      chromosome negative). Patients will receive weekly 2-hour IV infusions of ON 013105 at higher&#xD;
      and higher doses until intolerable side effects are observed. It is important to know the&#xD;
      highest safe dose so additional studies can be done.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation Phase I study of ON 013105 in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory Lymphoma or B-cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (Philadelphia chromosome&#xD;
      negative) who have satisfied all inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients will receive weekly&#xD;
      2-hour IV infusions of ON 013105, until evidence of disease progression, intolerable adverse&#xD;
      events, or withdrawal of patient consent. Up to 12 additional patients will be treated at the&#xD;
      RPTD level. The starting dose will be 17 mg over a 2-hour weekly infusion. Each cycle will&#xD;
      comprise three weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 43 patients may be enrolled, of which approximately 7 to 37 patients will be enrolled&#xD;
      in the dose escalation portion of the study to determine the RPTD. After the maximally&#xD;
      administered dose is attained and at least six patients have received a tentative RPTD, up to&#xD;
      6 additional patients may be enrolled in the dose confirmation phase to confirm the RPTD&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be administered in the Clinical Research center for the first dose for all&#xD;
      patients at each given dose level. If there is no toxicity, then subsequent doses at that&#xD;
      level for that patient may be administered on an outpatient basis, unless hospitalization is&#xD;
      required for another reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Simon accelerated titration design, one-patient cohorts and 100% dose&#xD;
      increments will be implemented until non-hematological grade 2 toxicity is observed during&#xD;
      the first 3-week cycle. The design will then convert to standard 3/6 patient cohorts starting&#xD;
      at the dose level where grade 2 toxicity was observed and following 40% dose increments for&#xD;
      the subsequent cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If none of the first three patients experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the&#xD;
      first cycle (3 weeks), the next 3 patients will receive the next dose level. If there is a&#xD;
      DLT in one of the first three patients, this dose level will be expanded to 6 patients. If 1&#xD;
      patient out of 6 experiences DLT, the next patients will receive the next dose level. If ≥ 2&#xD;
      patients experience DLT at any dose level, this dose level will be declared the Maximally&#xD;
      Administered Dose. The Maximally Tolerated Dose (MTD) and RPTD will be the highest dose level&#xD;
      below the Maximally Administered Dose with 0 out of 3 patients or one out of 6 patients with&#xD;
      DLT. Dosing will be reduced to the immediate lower dose for any patient who experiences a DLT&#xD;
      at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If Grade 1 non-hematological toxicity occurs, treatment will be continued at the original&#xD;
      dose without dose reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with stable disease or response can continue treatment up to eight 3-week cycles.&#xD;
      Further continuation will be determined by the clinical judgment of the Investigator.&#xD;
      Patients who drop out for any reason may not re-enter the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected during Day 1 of the first cycle for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      assessment. Responses will be assessed according to Cheson, B.D., et al., Revised Response&#xD;
      Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma, J Clin Oncol 2007. 25: p. 579-86.&#xD;
