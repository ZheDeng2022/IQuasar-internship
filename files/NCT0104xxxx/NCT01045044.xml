  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate tumor changes in women with&#xD;
      breast cancer who are receiving anthracycline-based systemic chemotherapy. We will also use&#xD;
      MRI and cognitive tests to study the possible effects of chemotherapy on the brains of these&#xD;
      women. The results will be compared to a control group of normal healthy women. We will try&#xD;
      to determine if MRI can be used to predict tumor response and cognitive changes related to&#xD;
      the chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      In this work we will utilize conventional magnetic resonance imaging as well as a set of&#xD;
      advanced magnetic resonance imaging tools to investigate changes in tumor physiology and the&#xD;
      human brain resulting from anthracycline-based systemic chemotherapy. We will recruit up to&#xD;
      15 subjects diagnosed with breast cancer and preparing for an anthracycline-based systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen. Each subject will undergo the set of MR imaging tools before therapy,&#xD;
      after one therapy session, after four therapy sessions, and at the conclusion of therapy.&#xD;
      Conventional MRI methods will be used to quantify tumor-response to chemotherapy for each&#xD;
      subject. A control group of up to 15 normal subjects will also be recruited and will undergo&#xD;
      MR brain imaging twice with a gap of 6 months between scans. All subjects will also undergo a&#xD;
      battery of neuropsychological tests at each imaging session. The results of the&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests will be used to quantify cognitive changes for each subject. A final&#xD;
      analysis will determine if the advanced MR modalities can be used to predict the response of&#xD;
      tumors or human cognition to chemotherapy.&#xD;
