  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis&#xD;
      (DVT), is a common complication and leading cause of death in cancer patients. Large,&#xD;
      population-based studies have shown that patients with cancer have four- to seven-fold&#xD;
      increased risk of developing VTE compared with patients without cancer. VTE would be frequent&#xD;
      in patients with advanced gastric cancer, especially associated chemotherapy. However,&#xD;
      relatively few studies have been conducted regarding the incidence of VTE in Asian cancer&#xD;
      patients. According to previous review, Asian patients significantly lower risk of developing&#xD;
      VTE. The rate of VTE with advanced gastric cancer, and associated chemotherapy is not known&#xD;
      in Asian patients. In addition, the impact of VTE on overall survival has not been documented&#xD;
      in these patients.&#xD;
