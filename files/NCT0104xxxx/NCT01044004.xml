      Aims will be analyzed separately as stratified by treatment arm (chemotherapy treatment arm&#xD;
      vs. post-treatment remission arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether armodafinil is more effective than placebo in reducing fatigue as&#xD;
           measured by the change in scores from the FACT-Fatigue reported at study entry, week 7&#xD;
           of study treatment, and study completion (week 13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether armodafinil is more effective than placebo in reducing fatigue as&#xD;
           measured by standard actigraphy summary statistics including total sleep time (TST),&#xD;
           wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep latency, number of awakenings, daytime sleep time,&#xD;
           mean daytime activity, peak activity, acrophase, and circadian mesor at week 1 of&#xD;
           screening, week 7 of study treatment, and study completion (week 13).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether armodafinil is more effective than placebo in improving work&#xD;
           quality as measured by the change in scores from the WLQ© reported at study entry (week&#xD;
           1) and study completion (week 13).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether armodafinil is more effective than placebo in reducing fatigue as&#xD;
           measured by the change in activity patterns with actigraphy using applied functional&#xD;
           data analysis during week 1 of screening, week 7 of study treatment, and study&#xD;
           completion (week 13).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether measured cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and TGF-α) are&#xD;
           elevated at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether measured cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and TGF-α) change from&#xD;
           the time of study entry to study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess whether cytokine levels (IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and TGF-α) correlate with&#xD;
           circadian patterns in wrist actigraphy and self-described reports of fatigue as measured&#xD;
           by the FACT-Fatigue at baseline and study completion.&#xD;
