        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1 prior platin containing chemotherapy in the palliativ setting or progressive disease&#xD;
             under adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy within 6 months of treatment start date.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological evidence of advanced or metastatic gastric cancer or cancer of the&#xD;
             esophageal junction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At baseline CT or MRI scan must demonstrate measurable disease by RECIST criteria,&#xD;
             i.e., the presence of at least one measurable lesion. Measurable disease lesions must&#xD;
             be accurately measured in at least one dimension with longest diameter &gt; 20 mm using&#xD;
             conventional techniques or &gt; 10 mm with spiral CT scan (with minimum lesion size no&#xD;
             less than double the slice thickness).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one measurable lesion outside of the field of any prior radiation therapy&#xD;
             (according to RECIST criteria). Prior radiotherapy to a single index lesion is not&#xD;
             allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult male or female patients (â‰¥18 years of age).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have disease not amenable to surgery, radiation, or combined modality&#xD;
             therapy with curative intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectance &gt;4 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate bone marrow function, renal function, liver function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women using an acceptable form of contraception prior to receiving RAD001 or women who&#xD;
             meet the protocol definition of post-menopausal: 12 months of natural (spontaneous)&#xD;
             amenorrhea or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt;40 mIU/m or 6&#xD;
             weeks post surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fully recovered from any previous surgery, prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy (at&#xD;
             least 4 weeks since major surgery or prior myelosuppressive chemotherapy). With the&#xD;
             exception of alopecia, patients must have resolution of all acute toxic effects of any&#xD;
             prior surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy to NCI CTC (Version 2.0) grade &lt;=1.&#xD;

             be treated &lt;4 weeks since last chemotherapy, if they fully recovered from all side&#xD;
             effects.&#xD;

             chemotherapy, if they fully recovered from all side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy with RAD001 (everolimus) or other rapamycins (sirolimus, temsirolimus).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients treated with Mitomycin C&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No neurotoxicity &gt;= grade 2 CTC&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No gastric or intestinal obstruction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking drugs known to inhibit or induce isoenzyme CYP3A&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any concurrent major medical condition liable to compromise the&#xD;
             patient's participation in the study (e.g known HIV infection, uncontrolled diabetes,&#xD;
             serious cardiac dysrhythmia or condition, New York Heart Association classification of&#xD;
             III or IV, congestive cardiac failure, myocardial infarction within 6 months, unstable&#xD;
             angina, chronic or acute renal or liver disease, uncontrolled serious infections&#xD;
             including abscess or fistulae, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of another malignancy prior to study entry, except curatively&#xD;
             treated non-melanotic skin cancer or carcinoma in-situ cervical cancer unless in&#xD;
             complete remission or no evidence of disease and off all therapy for that disease for&#xD;
             a minimum of 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No symptomatic brain metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment, or within 30 days or 5&#xD;
             half-lives of enrollment, whichever is longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients who are pregnant or breast feeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or to drugs with similar&#xD;
