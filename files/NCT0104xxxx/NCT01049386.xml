      Rationale: Intestinal permeability of subjects can vary depending on their health status. It&#xD;
      is therefore important to be able to measure and quantify intestinal permeability in a&#xD;
      standardized way. Subjects with intestinal complaints (like irritable bowel disorder) or&#xD;
      obese subjects have been found to have increased intestinal permeability. Different&#xD;
      physiological conditions might affect intestinal permeability (IP) further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the clinic, sugar absorption tests and different blood and urine markers have been used to&#xD;
      quantify IP. The sugars sucrose, mannitol, sucralose and lactulose are absorbed differently&#xD;
      in the small or large intestines, resulting in different sugar levels in urine. This&#xD;
      indicates the level of intestinal permeability and the location of increased permeability&#xD;
      which is more or less permeable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A high-fat meal could be used as a challenge test to increase IP in subjects even further.&#xD;
      After a high fat meal, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) could be co-transported with chylomicrons.&#xD;
      Small amounts of LPS co-transit with dietary fat from the gut after a high-fat meal, which&#xD;
      thereby increases plasma LPS concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the above mentioned reasons, it could be relevant to determine intestinal&#xD;
      permeability and plasma LPS concentration after consumption of a high-fat diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different methods will be used to determine the intestinal permeability in lean and obese&#xD;
      men, under different conditions. New parameters, like intestinal (I) fatty acid binding&#xD;
      protein (I-FABP), liver (L)-FABP, LPS and inflammatory markers will be measured and related&#xD;
      to outcomes of tests, to examine the relation with intestinal permeability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association of IP with whole body electrical resistance will be examined, to determine&#xD;
      usefulness of a candidate non-invasive method for IP investigation.&#xD;

      Study design: The study is designed as a randomized, cross-over and open study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 16 healthy, lean (BMI 20-25 kg.m-2) and obese (BMI 30-35 kg.m-2) male&#xD;
      subjects will participate in the study, aged between 18-45 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: On two different test days eight lean and eight obese men will be supplied with&#xD;
      a sugar drink to examine intestinal permeability under normal conditions and in combination&#xD;
      with an oral fat load to examine intestinal permeability under stressed conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Intestinal permeability will be examined with an absorption&#xD;
      test using four different sugars (sucrose, mannitol, sucralose and lactulose). New markers of&#xD;
      intestinal permeability, like I-FABP, L-FABP, LPS and inflammatory markers will be measured&#xD;
      as well.&#xD;
