  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two purposes: 1) to understand the effect of a decline of dopamine in the&#xD;
      brain during normal aging and in patients with Parkinson's disease, and 2) to investigate how&#xD;
      medicines used to treat Parkinson's disease improve movement performance in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Parkinson's disease have difficulty performing precise finger movements, mainly&#xD;
      because of a dramatic decrease of a substance called dopamine in parts of the brain.&#xD;
      Medicines such as levodopa, which help restore dopamine levels, can greatly improve function;&#xD;
      however, little is known about how these drugs work. In normal aging, dopamine decreases&#xD;
      slightly in certain parts of the brain, but the importance of this decline is poorly&#xD;
      understood. This study may provide new information about Parkinson's disease and normal aging&#xD;
      that might lead to better treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease and healthy volunteers 21 years of age and&#xD;
      older may be eligible for this study. All participants must be right-handed. All candidates&#xD;
      will be screened with a medical history and physical and neurological examinations, including&#xD;
      memory tests and mood examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain function will be studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study and&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET). Participants may be asked to stop using medications that&#xD;
      can affect the central nervous system, such as sleeping pills or drugs for depression or&#xD;
      anxiety, for 1 week before each study visit. Patients with Parkinson's disease may also be&#xD;
      asked to stop using antiparkinsonian medications at least 12 hours before each visit. In&#xD;
      addition, all participants will be asked to abstain from alcoholic beverages at least 24&#xD;
      hours before the fMRI and PET scans, and from nicotine and caffeine for at least 12 hours&#xD;
      before the scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have fMRI, which uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create&#xD;
      images of the brain. The subject lies on a table in a tunnel-like cylinder (the scanner) for&#xD;
      1 to 2 hours, lying still for 5 to 15 minutes at a time. He or she can communicate with the&#xD;
      technician or researcher at all times during the test through an intercom system. Scans will&#xD;
      be done while the subject is at rest and while he or she is performing finger movements. The&#xD;
      movements involve pushing five buttons on a box-each button every 3 seconds on average in a&#xD;
      specific order. Patients with Parkinson's disease will be studied off- and then on-&#xD;
      medications that restore the levels of levodopa in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants may be asked to undergo a PET scan on a separate visit. A PET scanner is a&#xD;
      doughnut-shaped machine similar in appearance to a CT (computed tomography) scanner. PET&#xD;
      scans detect radioactivity used to provide information on brain activity. Before the test&#xD;
      begins, subjects are given a dose of carbidopa-a medicine that increases the amount of&#xD;
      levodopa in the brain. A catheter (thin, plastic tube) is then inserted into an arm or wrist&#xD;
      vein, and a radioactive form of levodopa called 18Fluorodopa is injected through the&#xD;
      catheter. A moldable plastic mask with large openings for eyes, nose, and mouth is placed on&#xD;
      the face to help keep the head still during scanning. The total scan time is 2 hours or less.&#xD;

      Objective: In the central nervous system, short-term plasticity can be defined as a change in&#xD;
      connection strength that is induced by receiving presynaptic inputs. Dopamine (DA), a&#xD;
      neuromodulatory neurotransmitter, is believed to play a role in short-term plasticity.&#xD;
      [18F]dopa positron emission tomography (PET) studies have shown progressive impairment of&#xD;
      presynaptic dopaminergic (DAergic) function in both healthy elderly subjects (HES) and&#xD;
      patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Both PD and HES are characterized by a progressive&#xD;
      decline in performance on some motor tasks and changes in activity in brain areas involved in&#xD;
      motor control (including motor control by cognitive functions) as shown by functional imaging&#xD;
      studies. However, little is known about the exact neurobiological mechanisms linking DAergic&#xD;
      function, brain activity and motor (and cognitive) performances in PD and HES. In the present&#xD;
      study, we hypothesize that impaired performance on some motor tasks in those subject groups&#xD;
      is related to a dysfunction of task-specific functional connections between areas&#xD;
      participating in motor control. In addition, the brain activation with fMRI across sessions&#xD;
      and across subjects in the healthy group will be examined to investigate the reliability of&#xD;
      the fMRI techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: We will study two groups of participants: one group of patients with&#xD;
      mild-to-moderate PD and one group of healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: We will measure cerebral activity in baseline condition and during the execution of&#xD;
      sequential finger movements using perfusion functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in&#xD;
      the three subject groups. The reliability of fMRI data across sessions and across subjects in&#xD;
      the healthy young group and brain activity in patients with PD will be studied &quot;off&quot; and then&#xD;
      &quot;on&quot; medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Imaging data will be compared in terms of both regional activity and&#xD;
      effective connectivity using the statistical parametric mapping (SPM) software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These experiments should lead to better understanding the pathophysiology of the&#xD;
      mesencephalic DAergic system in human motor control and may lead to better treatment&#xD;
      strategies in PD.&#xD;
