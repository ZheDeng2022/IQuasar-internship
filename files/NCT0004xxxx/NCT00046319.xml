  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if treating patients suffering from moderate to&#xD;
      severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with BSF 208075 will improve the patients' ability to&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind study evaluating the effectiveness of BSF 208075 in&#xD;
      treating patients with moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension. A four-week Screening&#xD;
      Period will be followed by 12 weeks of Treatment. After a subject qualifies for the study,&#xD;
      the subject will be randomized to one of four doses of BSF 208075 (1.0, 2.5, 5.0 or 10.0 mg&#xD;
      po qd). Subjects randomized to the 1.0 or 2.5 mg dose groups will receive their respective&#xD;
      doses of BSF 208075 each day throughout the 12-week Treatment Period. Subjects in the two&#xD;
      other dose groups will begin treatment at 2.5 mg per day for two weeks and then their dose&#xD;
      will be increased to 5.0 mg for an additional two weeks. After two weeks of treatment at 5.0&#xD;
      mg, subjects randomized to the 10.0 mg dose group will undergo a final up-titration. After&#xD;
      reaching the randomized dose level, subjects will receive their assigned dose throughout the&#xD;
      Treatment Period. Subjects will remain on the randomized treatment through Week 12. In the&#xD;
      event that a subject is not tolerating study drug, dose adjustment is permitted during the&#xD;
      Treatment Period. Upon completion of the 12-week Treatment Period subjects will either&#xD;
      complete a four-week Down-titration Period or enter an optional 12-week Open-label Extension.&#xD;
      All subjects that choose to participate in the Open-label Extension will be unblinded and&#xD;
      have their dose of BSF 208075 optimized based on the subjects response during the Treatment&#xD;
      Period.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Mean pulmonary arterial pressure of &gt;/= 25 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pulmonary vascular resistance &gt;3 mmHg/L/min&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure or left ventricle end diastolic pressure of&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a diagnosis of HIV must have stable disease status at the time of&#xD;
             screening. The subject may be enrolled if they meet the definition of a stable HIV&#xD;
             status defined as:&#xD;
