  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well carboplatin and etoposide with or without oblimersen&#xD;
      sodium works in treating patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Biological&#xD;
      therapies, such as oblimersen sodium, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and&#xD;
      stop cancer cells from growing. Giving carboplatin and etoposide together with oblimersen&#xD;
      sodium may kill not tumor cells&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the percentage of patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer treated&#xD;
      with G3139 (oblimersen sodium), carboplatin, and etoposide who live longer than 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the response rate of patients treated with G3139, carboplatin, and etoposide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the toxicity of the combination of G3139, carboplatin, and etoposide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare the toxicity observed to that seen in a cohort of patients treated with&#xD;
      carboplatin and etoposide alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive oblimersen sodium intravenously (IV) continuously on days 1-8,&#xD;
      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 6, and etoposide IV over 60 minutes on days 6-8.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and etoposide IV over 60&#xD;
      minutes on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, and&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 2 years.&#xD;
