      This study will determine whether magnesium replacement during apheresis can decrease side&#xD;
      effects that donors commonly experience. Apheresis is a method of collecting large numbers of&#xD;
      certain blood cells, such as white cells, stem cells, or platelets. In this procedure, whole&#xD;
      blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein, similar to donating blood. The blood is&#xD;
      separated into its components by centrifugation (spinning), the required cells are extracted,&#xD;
      and the rest of the blood is returned to the body, either through the same needle or through&#xD;
      another needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When healthy people donate cells by apheresis, a blood thinner called citrate is added to&#xD;
      prevent the blood from clotting in the apheresis machine. Citrate works by reducing calcium&#xD;
      in the blood. When the blood is returned to the donor, citrate from the machine is also&#xD;
      returned, lowering the donor's calcium levels. As a result, donors often feel tingling around&#xD;
      the mouth, hands, and feet. Some of these symptoms can be prevented by giving calcium&#xD;
      intravenously (through a vein) during the procedure. Even with the added calcium, however,&#xD;
      some donors still have symptoms. Magnesium levels are also lowered by citrate, but it is not&#xD;
      known if this causes symptoms. This study will examine whether the decrease in magnesium&#xD;
      levels also contributes to the side effects of apheresis and whether magnesium replacement&#xD;
      can reduce these symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy apheresis donors 18 years of age or older who are enrolled in NIH protocols may&#xD;
      participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors will undergo the apheresis procedures required by the NIH protocol they are enrolled&#xD;
      in. Throughout the procedure, they will receive an intravenous infusion of a salt solution&#xD;
      that may or may not contain magnesium. Blood samples of 5 milliliters (1 teaspoon) each will&#xD;
      be taken from the apheresis machine at the beginning and end of the procedure and at 30- to&#xD;
      60-minute intervals during the procedure. No more than 50 ml (3 tablespoons) will be taken&#xD;
      during any single apheresis. The last sample will be drawn 60 minutes after completion of the&#xD;
      apheresis. In addition, donors will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide a urine sample at the beginning and end of each apheresis procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Donate an additional urine sample and an additional 5 ml blood sample the morning after&#xD;
           apheresis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe any symptoms experienced during apheresis to the apheresis nurse&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Large volume leukapheresis (LVL) is increasingly used to collect peripheral blood stem cells&#xD;
      (PBSCs) and other mononuclear cells (MNC) for hematopoietic and immune reconstitution, with&#xD;
      recent emphasis on increased processing volumes. Decreases in divalent cation levels caused&#xD;
      by administration of citrate anticoagulant during LVL can be associated with severe donor&#xD;
      reactions, and may limit the rate at which blood can be processed. Several donors at NIH&#xD;
      experienced citrate-related hypocalcemic tetany during LVL, in response to which we developed&#xD;
      standard operating procedures for the routine administration of prophylactic intravenous&#xD;
      calcium solutions during longer apheresis procedures. Other centers have utilized heparin to&#xD;
      reduce the amount of citrate returned to the donor, however, this exposes the donor to&#xD;
      systemic anticoagulation and may be associated with hematomas or clumping of the apheresis&#xD;
      product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We previously determined that citrate administration during apheresis results in significant&#xD;
      excretion of calcium and magnesium in the urine during the procedure, and that performance of&#xD;
      prolonged or repeated LVL causes significant depletion of blood calcium and magnesium levels.&#xD;
      Decreases in calcium levels were ameliorated during procedures performed with prophylactic&#xD;
      calcium administration. Our preliminary studies also demonstrated that ionized magnesium&#xD;
      levels were markedly reduced during LVL as well as plateletpheresis procedures. The clinical&#xD;
      impact of severe, acute decreases in ionized magnesium levels in healthy apheresis donors is&#xD;
      not clear, however. Since most of the adverse effects related to citrate administration can&#xD;
      be prevented by prophylactic calcium administration, it is unknown what aspect of the&#xD;
      remaining discomfort may be attributable to hypomagnesemia. This protocol will focus on&#xD;
      determining the contribution of acute hypomagnesemia to citrate-related symptoms during&#xD;
      large-volume apheresis, and establishing the role of and indications for prophylactic&#xD;
      intravenous magnesium replacement in this setting. The study plan will consist of a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Healthy allogeneic donors&#xD;
      will be assigned to one of two treatment groups. One group will receive intravenous magnesium&#xD;
      infusions throughout scheduled LVL procedures; the other group will receive equivalent volume&#xD;
      infusions of normal saline. Symptoms and blood samples will be obtained by apheresis nurses&#xD;
      and laboratory assays will be performed by associate laboratory investigators, all in a&#xD;
      blinded fashion.&#xD;
