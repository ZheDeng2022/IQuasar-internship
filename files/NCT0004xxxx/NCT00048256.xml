  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at how people cope with an upcoming bone marrow transplant and how&#xD;
      personality characteristics influence coping styles in stressful medical situations.&#xD;
      Personality traits, such as extraversion, optimism and self-esteem have been related to&#xD;
      active, problem-focused coping styles, whereas neuroticism has been related to increased&#xD;
      psychological distress and denial as a way of coping. Coping styles, in turn, have been&#xD;
      related to disease outcome. For example, a fighting spirit and avoidance have been correlated&#xD;
      with longer survival, whereas fatalism, anxious preoccupation and feelings of helplessness&#xD;
      and hopelessness were related to a poor disease outcome. A better understanding of the&#xD;
      relationship between coping styles and personality may help improve supportive care for&#xD;
      people undergoing bone marrow transplants. This study will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the relationship between personality traits, coping styles and psychological&#xD;
           stress in patients awaiting bone marrow transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify what coping styles people use to prepare for bone marrow transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify what personality traits are related to particular coping styles in patients&#xD;
           awaiting bone marrow transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the relationship between personality factors and level of psychological&#xD;
           distress in patients awaiting bone marrow transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer patients 18 years of age and older who are scheduled for bone marrow transplant are&#xD;
      eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will fill out pencil-and-paper questionnaires providing demographic information&#xD;
      (such as age, gender, marital status, ethnicity, and so forth) and answering questions about&#xD;
      their opinions and preferences. The information will be used to assess the participants'&#xD;
      personality characteristics, coping styles, and psychological distress. The questionnaires&#xD;
      take about 45 to 50 minutes to complete.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Over the last decade, more and more focus has been placed upon the psychological adjustment&#xD;
      of patients who have undergone bone marrow transplants (BMT). There have been studies that&#xD;
      focused on the coping styles and levels of psychological distress in patients immediately&#xD;
      after transplantation. Studies have been done based on a specific point during the process or&#xD;
      at multiple points throughout the course of the procedure and still other studies have&#xD;
      focused on assessment points several months post transplant. However, very little attention&#xD;
      has been focused on patients' psychological functioning prior to transplantation. The purpose&#xD;
      of the present study is to examine the relationship between personality traits and coping&#xD;
      styles among patients awaiting BMT.&#xD;
