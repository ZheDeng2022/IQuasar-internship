  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gaucher disease is an inherited functional deficiency of glucocerebrosidase. This enzyme&#xD;
      breaks down a fatty substance (lipid) called glucocerebroside, which is present in all cells&#xD;
      of the body. When cells renew themselves, the lipids must be broken down and discarded.&#xD;
      Because the enzyme does not function well, the lipid builds up in certain tissues, such as&#xD;
      the liver and spleen. The nervous system is involved as well; memory is impaired and it is&#xD;
      difficult to move the eyes from side to side. It has been shown that repeated infusions of&#xD;
      glucocerebrosidase help break down the stored lipid. However, this treatment does not improve&#xD;
      any neurological symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A medicine called OGT 918 has been shown to slow the production of the lipid that builds up&#xD;
      in Gaucher disease. It also has been shown to enter the brain. It is hoped that taking OGT&#xD;
      918 will reduce the storage of glycolipids in cells and improve the neurological symptoms of&#xD;
      the disease. This clinical trial seeks to evaluate OGT 918 as a treatment for neuronopathic&#xD;
      Gaucher disease by assessing changes in eye movement velocity. A secondary goal is to assess&#xD;
      the clinical safety and tolerability of OGT 918 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 patients from the National Institutes of Health and the Institute of Child Health&#xD;
      (London) will be randomly assigned to OGT 918 or no treatment for 12 months. Study&#xD;
      participants must be clinically diagnosed with neuronopathic Gaucher disease, 12 years of age&#xD;
      or older, and able to swallow capsules. They must have been stable on ERT for at least 6&#xD;
      months before the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving OGT 918 will receive a dose of 200 mg OGT 918 three times daily. Data&#xD;
      analysis will be done after 12 months. The study will be extended up to 12 months to collect&#xD;
      safety and efficacy data. All patients who complete the main study and enter the extension&#xD;
      study will receive OGT 918.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a 4-week screening period, eye movement velocity will be measured. These assessments&#xD;
      will be repeated at months 12 and 24. Also at screening and months 12 and 24, the following&#xD;
      tests will be done: MRI/CT, to measure spleen and liver volume; pulmonary imaging (by X-ray)&#xD;
      and function tests; nerve conduction velocity studies and neuropsychological assessments;&#xD;
      evoked response studies (to measure how the brain conducts electrical messages); and tremor&#xD;
      measurements. Additional assessments for tremor will be conducted at months 6 and 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma samples will be obtained every 3 months to measure disease markers and safety&#xD;
      profiles. Proteasome samples will be taken at screening and month 6 to identify proteins that&#xD;
      may be associated with Gaucher disease. Blood will be obtained at month 1 from the first 6&#xD;
      consenting patients who have been randomly assigned to take OGT 918. These patients will also&#xD;
      have a cerebrospinal fluid sample taken by lumbar puncture at month 1. These samples will be&#xD;
      measured for how much OGT 918 is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients receiving OGT 918 will have an initial assessment 1 week after beginning&#xD;
      treatment to evaluate tolerance of the therapy. Clinic visits will be every 3 months. All&#xD;
      patients will be asked to keep a simple diary of adverse events and dietary information. Dose&#xD;
      levels may be reduced if a patient experiences severe gastrointestinal problems.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gaucher disease is an inherited functional deficiency of glucocerebrosidase&#xD;
      (beta-glucosidase) which leads to glycolipid accumulation in various tissues. OGT 918 is a&#xD;
      reversible inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of&#xD;
      glycolipids, and has shown beneficial effects in a clinical study in type 1 Gaucher disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate OGT 918 as a treatment for&#xD;
      neuronopathic Gaucher disease by assessing changes in saccadic eye movement velocity. Other&#xD;
      markers of the disease will also be assessed, including neurological and pulmonary&#xD;
      involvement. Secondary objectives are to assess the clinical safety and tolerability of OGT&#xD;
      918 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 patients, recruited from the National Institutes Health, Bethesda, USA and the&#xD;
      Institute of Child Health, London, U.K. will be randomized to OGT 918 or no treatment in a&#xD;
      2:1 ratio for the 12 month study period. Patients will be clinically diagnosed with&#xD;
      neuronopathic Gaucher disease, 12 years of age or older, on a stable dose of enzyme&#xD;
      replacement therapy (ERT) for at least 6 months and be able to swallow capsules.&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified based on whether or not the patient has undergone a&#xD;
      splenectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will follow an identical visit schedule. Patients aged 12 years or over&#xD;
      randomized to receive OGT 918 will commence treatment at a dose of 200 mg (2 x 100 mg&#xD;
      capsules) OGT 918 three times daily. As some patients may experience initial gastrointestinal&#xD;
      intolerance this dose may be modified, however the aim will be to maintain patients at the&#xD;
      highest tolerable dose in order to achieve the most clinical benefit. Data analysis is&#xD;
      planned, comparing OGT 918 to the no treatment group, when all patients have completed 12&#xD;
      months of the study. The study will be extended, up to a total of 12 additional months, to&#xD;
      collect safety and efficacy data. The length of the extension study will be dependent on the&#xD;
      results of the final analysis. All patients completing the main study, including those&#xD;
      initially randomized to the no treatment group, will be able to participate in the extension&#xD;
      study unless there are safety issues to prohibit this. All patients in the extension study&#xD;
      will receive OGT 918.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease activity assessments will be conducted as indicated in the study flow charts. For a&#xD;
      complete description of all study assessments, please refer to Section 7 of the main&#xD;
      protocol. Where possible, study assessments will be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of OGT 918 on the electro-oculographic characteristics of saccadic activity,&#xD;
      specifically the amplitude/velocity characteristics (main sequence), will be the primary&#xD;
      outcome variable. Saccadic velocity-amplitude relationship is decreased in neuronopathic&#xD;
      Gaucher patients. This study will assess whether OGT 918 therapy is capable of improving or&#xD;
      stopping any further deterioration of this ocular function.&#xD;
