      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are few comprehensive databases that allow for a longitudinal examination of how&#xD;
      neighborhood-level factors may interact with individual characteristics to predict incident&#xD;
      cases of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality. This cross-institutional&#xD;
      project joins investigators from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and Stanford University,&#xD;
      known for their expertise in immigrant health and social inequalities in CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study examines how neighborhood social characteristics (e.g., neighborhood socioeconomic&#xD;
      status (SES), social disintegration, socioeconomic and ethnic segregation, social capital),&#xD;
      physical environments (e.g., geocoded assets including goods and services contributing to&#xD;
      health such as educational and recreational resources; barriers to health including&#xD;
      pollution, industries, waste dumps, criminal activity, alcohol and fast food outlets) and&#xD;
      individual factors (e.g., SES, cardiovascular disease {CVD} risk factors, country of birth&#xD;
      and social networks) may interrelate to predict CVD [morbidity and mortality] and all-cause&#xD;
      mortality. Data will be used from a newly created, comprehensive set of Swedish databases,&#xD;
      MigMed and MigSALLS. MigMed (1990-2002) includes data for the entire Swedish population of 6&#xD;
      million women and men aged 25 and older, of whom 600,000 are first generation immigrants.&#xD;
      Their addresses have been geocoded, yielding 9,677 neighborhoods, which will be reduced to a&#xD;
      smaller number of defined units by cluster analyses. MigMed includes an annual assessment of&#xD;
      individual-level sociodemographic and health indicators. Data will also be analyzed from&#xD;
      MigSALLS (1988-2002), which includes more in-depth data from face-to-face interviews with a&#xD;
      representative sample of approximately 18,000 women and men aged 25-74, of whom 2,000 are&#xD;
      first generation immigrants. MigSALLS contains similar individual- and neighborhood-level&#xD;
      factors as MigMed, as well as extensive information on factors that may mediate relationships&#xD;
      between neighborhoods and CVD outcomes (e.g., CVD risk factors such as smoking, weight,&#xD;
      physical activity, and blood pressure). Information from these two datasets will be matched&#xD;
      to hospital and death records (300,000 deaths and 140,000 incidence cases of CVD expected&#xD;
      between 1988-2002), thus creating one of the largest databases in the world involving men and&#xD;
      women from diverse SES levels and countries of origin.&#xD;
