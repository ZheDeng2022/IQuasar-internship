  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are seeking male and female patients to voluntarily take part in a clinical research&#xD;
      study. Patients must be aged 18 or older and diagnosed with symptomatic orthostatic&#xD;
      hypotension (low blood pressure while in the upright position) due to Parkinson's disease,&#xD;
      multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure or autonomic neuropathies (i.e. neurogenic&#xD;
      orthostatic hypotension). Symptoms of low blood pressure include dizziness, lightheadedness,&#xD;
      changes in vision and generalized weakness upon standing. The main effect of the drug being&#xD;
      studied is to increase blood pressure in the upright position so symptoms will decrease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this clinical study is to further assess the clinical effect of high dose&#xD;
      midodrine hydrochloride (ProAmatine速), an approved treatment for orthostatic hypotension.&#xD;
      During the course of the study, participants will receive either ProAmatine速 or a placebo.&#xD;
      Assessments will be made using questionnaires that measure symptom and activity levels. Blood&#xD;
      pressure in the lying down, sitting and standing positions will be measured. Patients will&#xD;
      also complete standing time assessments. They will be asked to remain standing without moving&#xD;
      until they feel sufficiently lightheaded, or dizzy, or feel faint so that they would feel&#xD;
      more comfortable sitting down.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The male or female subjects must be 18 years of age or older and ambulatory. (Subjects&#xD;
             must not require assistance with a walker or wheelchair to perform regular daily&#xD;
             activities at all times.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum beta HCG pregnancy test at&#xD;
             screening and baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has been diagnosed with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension due to&#xD;
             Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure or autonomic&#xD;
             neuropathy (i.e. neurogenic orthostatic hypotension).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject manifests one of the following symptoms while standing or has a history of&#xD;
             one of the following when not treated for orthostatic hypotension: dizziness,&#xD;
             lightheadedness, feeling faint or feeling like they may black out.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is willing and able to undergo the procedures required by this protocol&#xD;
             including morning office visits, assessment completion, protocol compliance and&#xD;
             participation in the wash-out period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has signed an Institutional-Review-Board approved written informed consent&#xD;
             form prior to any study procedures taking place.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is a pregnant or lactating female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has pre-existing sustained supine hypertension greater than 180 mm Hg&#xD;
             systolic and 110 mm Hg diastolic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is taking medications such as vasodilators, pressors, diuretics, ACE&#xD;
             inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, combined alpha and&#xD;
             beta-blockers, MAOI's, herbals or specific mixed effect medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The Principal Investigator deems any laboratory test abnormality clinical significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject has a diagnosis of any of the following disorders at the time of&#xD;
             screening: pheochromocytoma; cardiac conditions including: congestive heart failure&#xD;
             within the previous 6 months, myocardial infarction within the previous 6 months,&#xD;
             symptomatic coronary artery disease, history of ventricular tachycardia, or&#xD;
             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias; thyrotoxicosis; uncontrolled diabetes mellitus&#xD;
             (uncontrolled defined as a HgbA1c greater than or equal to 10%); history of&#xD;
             cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack (TIA) or symptomatic carotid&#xD;
             artery stenosis within the previous 6 months; history of coagulopathies; pulmonary&#xD;
