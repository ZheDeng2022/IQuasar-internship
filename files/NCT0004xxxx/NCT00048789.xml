  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP)&#xD;
      for treating chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). GvHD is a common complication of stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation using donated stem cells. It occurs when the donor's T-lymphocytes (a&#xD;
      type of immune cell) see the patient's cells as foreign and mount an immune response to&#xD;
      reject them. The attack can cause skin rash, mouth sores, liver or lung inflammation, lack of&#xD;
      appetite, and muscle stiffness. Chronic GvHD can cause serious illness, and even death, from&#xD;
      the long-term effects of immune dysfunction and from toxic effects of medications (such as&#xD;
      cyclosporine and prednisone) used to treat it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECP is an experimental treatment designed to stop the lymphocytes from attacking the body. It&#xD;
      involves collecting some of the cells that cause GvHD, treating them with a combination of&#xD;
      drug and light therapy and returning them to the body. Sixty to 80 percent of patients with&#xD;
      chronic GvHD improve with ECP treatment, and some patients can stop treatment with prednisone&#xD;
      or cyclosporine, or reduce the drug dosages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with chronic GvHD whose condition has not improved after a minimum 14-day course of&#xD;
      cyclosporine and prednisone may be eligible for this study. Patients must be able to travel&#xD;
      to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, twice a week during the 3-month study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon entering the study, participants will have a baseline evaluation to measure the extent&#xD;
      of GvHD. This assessment includes blood tests, eye and dental examinations, skin biopsy for&#xD;
      patients with skin involvement, and CT scans and lung function tests to look for possible&#xD;
      lung involvement. Biopsies of the lung, liver, mouth, or eye may be requested if needed to&#xD;
      confirm GvHD in these tissues. The skin will be photographed before starting ECP treatment&#xD;
      and once a month during the treatment period. Following baseline tests, participants will&#xD;
      undergo treatment and evaluations as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECP Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have blood drawn to collect lymphocytes causing GvHD. This may be done with a&#xD;
      special needle or catheter (tube inserted into a vein) or for patients who need or prefer it&#xD;
      with a temporary central venous catheter similar to that used for the stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation. Patients will have three 2- to 3-hour treatments a week for the first week&#xD;
      and two treatments a week after that for a total of 25 treatments over 3 months. Patients who&#xD;
      do not tolerate the treatment...&#xD;

      This is a phase 2 study of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) for treatment of chronic graft&#xD;
      versus host disease following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
      Extracorporeal exposure of human mononuclear cells to ultraviolet A radiation following&#xD;
      photosensitization with 8-methoxypsoralen has proven to be an effective treatment for&#xD;
      cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Small, single institution studies have suggested efficacy in other&#xD;
      T-cell mediated diseases such as solid organ rejection and graft versus host disease. This a&#xD;
      phase 2 study of ECP for treatment of chronic graft versus host disease. Eligible patients&#xD;
      must have objective evidence of chronic graft versus host disease that is refractory to&#xD;
      conventional therapy or must have steroid-dependent disease that does not permit steroid dose&#xD;
      reduction. The primary objective of this study is to better define the safety, efficacy and&#xD;
      mechanism of action of ECP for treatment of patients with chronic graft versus host disease.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Objective evidence of chronic graft versus host disease involving the skin,&#xD;
                  lungs, gastrointestinal tract, liver, or eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Progressive or stable GvHD despite a minimum of 30 days treatment with a&#xD;
                  calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) at therapeutic plasma levels,&#xD;
                  plus at least one other another agent with a different mechanism of action used&#xD;
                  concurrently for at least 30 days at doses known to be therapeutic for cGvHD. In&#xD;
                  most cases this second agent will be a corticosteroid administered either as high&#xD;
                  level pulse dosing (greater than or equal to mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent&#xD;
                  in pulses of 3 days or longer for at least two occasions during the qualifying 30&#xD;
                  days) and/or daily dosing (greater than or equal to 0.25mg/kg) or alternate day&#xD;
                  dosing (greater than or equal to 0.50 mg/kg) prednisone or equivalent. In other&#xD;
                  cases where use of steroids is medically undesirable or contraindicated, the&#xD;
                  second agent may be mycophenolate mofetil, sirolimus, hydroxychloroquine,&#xD;
                  clofazimine, thalidomide, azathioprine, pentostatin, etanercept, Infliximab,&#xD;
                  Rituximab or Daclizumab used at doses and schedule known to provide benefit to&#xD;
                  patients with cGvHD. Patients in whom calcineurin inhibitors are medically&#xD;
                  contraindicated may also be eligible for enrollment if there has been at least a&#xD;
                  30 day trial of prednisone (or equivalent) at the doses/schedules noted above&#xD;
                  plus one of the second agents listed above. Patients in whom both calcineurin&#xD;
                  inhibitors and steroids are medically contraindicated or in whom these agents can&#xD;
                  be used at only limiting doses may also be eligible if at least two of the&#xD;
                  alternate agents noted above have been tried for 30 days without further&#xD;
                  improvement in symptoms of cGvHD. Patients who have stabilization of disease on&#xD;
                  calcineurin inhibitors plus steroids (or the other combinations noted above), but&#xD;
                  in whom these medications cannot be tapered without disease flare are also&#xD;
                  eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Adequate (as determined by PI) renal, hepatic, and cardiac reserve to enable the&#xD;

                  lymphocyte infusions or immunomodulatory cytokines) due to severity of GvHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. WBC greater than or equal to 1000 and platelets greater than or equal to 25,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Weight greater than or equal to 30kg.&#xD;
