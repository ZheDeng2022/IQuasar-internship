  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nitric oxide gas is important in regulating blood vessel dilation, and consequently, blood&#xD;
      flow. This gas is continuously produced by endothelial cells, which line the blood vessels.&#xD;
      This study will examine whether nitrite, a molecule that normally circulates in the blood&#xD;
      stream, can also dilate blood vessels. The results of this study may be valuable in&#xD;
      developing treatments for people with conditions associated with impaired endothelial&#xD;
      production of nitric oxide, including high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, diabetes,&#xD;
      estrogen deficiency, and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy, non-smoking normal volunteers 21 years of age or older may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. People who lack the enzyme G6PD or cytochrome B5 in their red blood cells may not&#xD;
      participate. Absence of these enzymes can lead to episodes of sudden shortness of breath and&#xD;
      cyanosis (blueness of the skin due to lack of sufficient oxygen). Participants will undergo&#xD;
      the procedures described in study Parts A and B, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part A - After numbing the skin, small tubes are placed in the artery and vein at the&#xD;
           inside of the elbow of the dominant arm (right- or left-handed) and a small tube is&#xD;
           placed in a vein of the other arm. The tubes are used for infusing saline (salt water)&#xD;
           and for drawing blood samples. A pressure cuff is placed around the upper part of the&#xD;
           dominant arm, and a rubber band device called a strain gauge is also placed around the&#xD;
           arm to measure blood flow. When the cuff is inflated, blood flows into the arm,&#xD;
           stretching the strain gauge at a rate proportional to the flow. Grip-strength of the&#xD;
           dominant arm is measured with a dynamometer to determine maximum grip-strength. Then,&#xD;
           several measurements of blood flow, nitrite, hemoglobin, and handgrip are made before&#xD;
           and after administration of L-NMMA, a drug that blocks endothelial production of nitric&#xD;
           oxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part B - Part A testing is repeated, except that sodium nitrite dissolved in a saline&#xD;
           solution is infused into the artery of the forearm for a few minutes before and during&#xD;
           the hand-grip exercises. In addition, blood samples are drawn before and after each&#xD;
           handgrip exercise to measure methemoglobin, a substance that, at excessive levels, can&#xD;
           cause adverse side effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nitric oxide (NO) is a soluble gas continuously synthesized by the endothelium and&#xD;
      contributes importantly to vasodilator tone of the coronary and systemic circulations by&#xD;
      activating guanylyl cyclase in vascular smooth muscle, causing relaxation. Although regional&#xD;
      synthesis of NO by the endothelium contributes to local vasodilator tone, we have shown&#xD;
      previously that NO may be transported in blood, and have biological effects at a distance&#xD;
      from the site of entry into the circulation. Thus, we found that NO may be transported bound&#xD;
      to heme iron in red blood cells and released at vascular sites of deficient NO synthesis,&#xD;
      restoring vasodilator tone. Another potential source of bioactive NO is via nitrite, formed&#xD;
      by the auto-oxidation of NO. This study is designed to determine the contribution of nitrite&#xD;
      transported in blood to forearm microvascular dilator tone in healthy subjects at rest and&#xD;
      during regional hypoxia associated with forearm exercise stress, with measurements made&#xD;
      before and after regional blockade of endothelial NO synthesis. Findings in this study may be&#xD;
      relevant to understanding the physiological contribution and therapeutic potential of nitrite&#xD;
      in the regulation of vasodilator tone in diseases and conditions associated with regional&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction and reduced endothelial NO bioactivity (e.g., hypertension, diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking, estrogen deficiency).&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        All volunteer subjects must be at least 21 years of age in good health and have provided&#xD;
        informed, written consent for participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with a history or evidence of present or past hypertension (blood pressure greater&#xD;
        than 145/95 mmHg), hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol greater than 130 mg/dL), diabetes&#xD;
        mellitus (fasting blood glucose greater than 130 mg/dL), smoking within two years,&#xD;
        cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, coagulopathy, or any other disease&#xD;
