  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine 1) differences among mothers behaviors and how these behaviors&#xD;
      influence their infants reactions, and 2) how mother-child interactions relate to children s&#xD;
      temperament, and cognitive (thought processing) abilities, and other areas of development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depressed and non-depressed English-speaking mothers between 20 and 45 years of age, with an&#xD;
      infant 4 months or younger, may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with&#xD;
      a mailed survey regarding their moods and feelings. Participants will undergo the following&#xD;
      procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychiatric Interview: Subjects will participate in a 30-90 minute interview consisting&#xD;
           of a series of standardized questions about the their behaviors and feelings.&#xD;
           Participants whose interviews suggest a condition that may impact their mental health&#xD;
           will be referred to the study clinician for follow-up to confirm or clarify the&#xD;
           preliminary findings. Continued participation in the study will be determined following&#xD;
           this.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Home Visit: A study investigator will visit the home for 1 hour to film the mother and&#xD;
           baby during the mother s typical daily activities. This visit will take place when the&#xD;
           baby is about 5 months old. At the end of the visit, the mother will be given a variety&#xD;
           of surveys to fill out at home and return at the next visit (see Lab Visit below). The&#xD;
           survey questions deal with the mother s relationship with her partner, support from&#xD;
           people in her life, typical behaviors of her infant, and how often she feels certain&#xD;
           emotions. A packet of surveys will also be left for the participant s partner to&#xD;
           complete and mail back to the investigator. The partner may or may not be the child s&#xD;
           biological father and may or may not choose to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lab Visit: Within 1 week of the home visit, the mother and child will come to the NICHD&#xD;
           clinic for about 2 hours. During this time, the mother will return the previous surveys&#xD;
           and fill out another one regarding her current mood. She will then interact with her&#xD;
           child, who will be seated in front of her. The 20-minute session will be videotaped.&#xD;
           (There will be breaks during the session.) The mother will be instructed about how she&#xD;
           should act (happy or sad). She and her baby will then participate in a variety of filmed&#xD;
           situations that will induce certain emotions in the baby, such as happiness, fear,&#xD;
           activity, frustration, and interest, in order to learn how different children react to&#xD;
           different situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted to continue the study when their babies are 12 months old and&#xD;
      again when the children are 24 months old. The above procedures will be repeated and some new&#xD;
      measures will be added for toddlers that involve activities investigating aspects of early&#xD;
      language and social reasoning..&#xD;

      Maternal depression is a concurrent and longitudinal risk factor for children s development.&#xD;
      Maternal depression exerts direct effects and indirect effects through proximal processes of&#xD;
      mother-child dyadic interactions. Both depressed mothers and their infants are inattentive,&#xD;
      unresponsive, affectively flat, and disengaged during naturalistic interactions, and their&#xD;
      dyadic interactions have been described as less synchronous. Our primary objective is to&#xD;
      investigate differences between depressed and non-depressed dyads in maternal behaviors,&#xD;
      child behaviors, and dyadic behaviors in terms of latency, synchrony, and contingency. In the&#xD;
      present study, we propose to examine the determinants and effects of dyadic interactions of&#xD;
      depressed and nondepressed mothers with their infants across several domains of child&#xD;
      development. We plan to replicate and extend previous work by observing the dyads in&#xD;
      naturalistic as well as experimental face-to-face settings at 5, 12, and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups of depressed and nondepressed mothers will be selected on the basis of self-reports of&#xD;
      depressive symptoms and by clinical diagnostic interviews. These assessments will be repeated&#xD;
      at 12 and 24 months to assess the course of maternal depression. The study consists of a home&#xD;
      visit, a lab visit, and administration of questionnaires to mothers and their spouses or&#xD;
      partners at three time points. All maternal and child behaviors during dyadic interactions&#xD;
      will be coded as continuous streams of data for analysis of reciprocal influences within the&#xD;
      dyad. By coding a range of behaviors such as facial affect, vocalization, physical activity,&#xD;
      and visual attention of the mother and infant, we hope to capture variations in mother-child&#xD;
      interactions, both between and within depressed and nondepressed dyads. Differences in styles&#xD;
      of dyadic interactions have been shown to have important consequences on subsequent child&#xD;
      development in several domains. In addition, experimental simulations will consist of&#xD;
      instructed 'depressed' and 'happy' simulations of mothers with their infants. Specific&#xD;
      simulations allow observation of changes in infant behaviors from the spontaneous episodes&#xD;
      and comparison between depressed and nondepressed dyads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the context of child development, both normative and atypical, is important as&#xD;
      means of elucidating the processes by which maternal depression operates as a risk factor for&#xD;
      children s cognitive and socioemotional development. Several socio-demographic and&#xD;
      psychosocial factors will be assessed by maternal and paternal self-reports to examine which&#xD;
      factors exacerbate or buffer the effects of maternal depression. In addition to modifying the&#xD;
      observations of maternal and child behaviors to be age-appropriate, new measures will be&#xD;
      introduced at 12 and 24 months to capture child s functioning in multiple areas.&#xD;
