    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and imaging ability of 111In-DAC when&#xD;
      used with planar and SPECT imaging for the detection of lung cancer and brain cancer&#xD;
      consistent with metastatic lung cancer.&#xD;

             to use an appropriate and effective method of birth control during the study and for 2&#xD;
             weeks after study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an ECOG performance status of Zero or One&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are being evaluated for known or suspected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), or&#xD;
             known brain lesions consistent with metastatic lung cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (For NSCLC patients)Have been previously scheduled for biopsy or surgical excision of&#xD;
             the suspected NSCLC, or have a pathological diagnosis of lung cancer within 2 months&#xD;
             of enrollment but have received no previous treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (For brain cancer patients) Have clinical signs and symptoms consistent with a primary&#xD;
             NSCLC with histological or cytopathological confirmation. Patients cannot have&#xD;
             received previous treatment with radiation to the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have signed an informed consent form&#xD;

             the 111In-DAC components&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a clinically unstable medical condition or opportunistic infection, a&#xD;
             life-threatening disease state, impaired renal or hepatic function or are&#xD;
             immunosuppressed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are taking or have taken part in any investigational study within 30 days of start of&#xD;
             study&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have abnormal laboratory test results: hemoglobin&lt;9.5 gms/dl, serum&#xD;
             creatinine&gt;1.5mg/100ml, alkaline phosphatase 2X the upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have undergone an excisional and/or needle localization biopsy within 4 days prior to&#xD;
             study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have undergone a PET scan within 7 days prior to study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any active or previously treated second malignancy except carcinoma in situ of&#xD;
