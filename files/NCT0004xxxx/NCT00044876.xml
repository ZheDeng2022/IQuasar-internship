  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uterine leiomyomata (fibroids) are a common benign tumor of the uterine muscle in&#xD;
      premenopausal women. These tumors may cause bleeding, pelvic pain and pressure. Because&#xD;
      fibroids grow in the presence of estrogen, medical therapies that decrease estrogen levels&#xD;
      (like GnRH analog) cause fibroids to shrink and so may relieve symptoms. However, such&#xD;
      medication can only be given short-term and has inconvenient side effects such as&#xD;
      hot-flushes. Thus, many women with symptomatic fibroids choose to have them removed&#xD;
      surgically, either individually or by removing the uterus via hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study evaluates a new medical treatment for fibroids using the progesterone receptor&#xD;
      modulator CDB-2914. A similar compound, mifepristone (Registered Trademark), reduced fibroid&#xD;
      size when given for twelve weeks. This study will compare fibroid size, hormone levels and&#xD;
      symptoms before and during daily administration of CDB-2914 (10 or 25 mg) or placebo for 10 -&#xD;
      14 weeks. To do this, women will undergo MRI and a saline hysterosonogram (ultrasound with&#xD;
      fluid) of the uterus before and at the end of the treatment; they will have blood drawn every&#xD;
      7 - 14 days, and will fill out a symptom calendar at home. Hysterectomy will be performed at&#xD;
      the end of the treatment to evaluate the effects of the medication on the uterine and fibroid&#xD;
      tissues, and to provide treatment for the study participant. Women will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to the treatment groups; during the treatment period neither the participants nor the&#xD;
      investigators will know the type of treatment that a woman receives.&#xD;
