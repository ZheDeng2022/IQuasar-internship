    <textblock>
      This study will investigate how genetic and environmental factors contribute to the&#xD;
      development of melanoma, a type of skin cancer, and related conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals of any age with a personal or family history of melanoma may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fill out one or two questionnaires about their personal and family medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide written consent for researchers to review their medical records and pathology&#xD;
           materials related to their care and those of deceased relatives with melanomas, tumors,&#xD;
           cancer, or other related illnesses for whom they are the next-of-kin or legally&#xD;
           authorized representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Donate a blood or cheek cell sample to be used for genetic studies. (The blood sample is&#xD;
           collected through a needle in an arm vein. The cheek cell sample is obtained either by&#xD;
           gently brushing the inside of the mouth with a soft brush or by swishing a tablespoon of&#xD;
           mouthwash and then spitting it into a container.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Undergo a skin biopsy (removal of a small piece of skin tissue) for genetic study. For&#xD;
           this procedure, the area of skin to be removed is numbed with a local anesthetic and a&#xD;
           1/4-inch piece of skin is excised with a cookie cutter-like instrument. The wound is&#xD;
           then covered with a band-aid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be asked to travel to the NIH Clinical Center for evaluation, including a&#xD;
      medical history, physical examination, and some of the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Full body skin examination to evaluate the type and number of moles and document any&#xD;
           evidence of sun damage to the skin. The examination involves all the skin from the scalp&#xD;
           to the bottoms of the feet. After the examination, a medical photographer will&#xD;
           photograph the skin, with close-ups of skin lesions marked by the examiner. If there are&#xD;
           parts of the skin the participant does not want examined or photographed, he or she can&#xD;
           tell the examiner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw of about 120 milliliters (4 ounces) or less&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cheek cell sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  X-rays, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies to detect tumors or&#xD;
           changes in tumors or other types of changes in specific tissues. MRI is a diagnostic&#xD;
           test that uses strong magnetic fields and radiowaves to examine body tissues. The&#xD;
           subject lies on a table that is moved into a large tunnel-like machine (the scanner) for&#xD;
           about 45 minutes to 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the tests are finished, a doctor will discuss the results with the participant and the&#xD;
      need, if any, for clinical follow-up.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Persons may be prone to develop melanoma for a variety of reasons including: family&#xD;
           history; environmental exposures; other malignant or premalignant conditions which may&#xD;
           or may not be heritable; immune deficiency; or, preneoplastic conditions such as&#xD;
           dysplastic nevi.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigations of individuals and families at high risk of melanoma have led to&#xD;
           etiologic clues that are important in the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification of melanoma susceptibility genes, the estimation of their effects, and&#xD;
           gene-covariate and gene-gene interactions could improve prevention, screening and&#xD;
           treatment of this cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate and define the clinical spectrum and natural history of disease in syndromes&#xD;
           predisposing to melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate potential precursor states of disease in families at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To quantify risks of melanoma, pancreatic cancer, and other cancers in family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To map, clone, and determine function of tumor susceptibility genes in melanoma-prone&#xD;
           families, including modifier genes such as pigmentation or dysplastic nevi genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify genetic determinants and gene-environmental interactions conferring melanoma&#xD;
           (and other cancer) risk in individuals and families.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in melanoma (and other cancer)&#xD;
           formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To educate and counsel study participants about their melanoma risk and methods for&#xD;
           primary and secondary prevention of melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop educational materials for medical professionals and high-risk family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persons of any age will be considered if,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is a family or personal medical history of melanoma of an unusual type, pattern,&#xD;
           or number; or,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are known or suspected factor(s) predisposing to melanoma, either genetic or&#xD;
           congenital factors, or unusual demographic features.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For familial melanoma, three or more living affected cases with invasive melanoma among&#xD;
           family members are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a prospective study. Families are studied long-term using a cohort approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two melanoma susceptibility genes have been identified, but it is likely others are yet&#xD;
           to be found. We are also exploring potential modifier genes in participating families.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The affection status of each participant, information on their skin examination, sun&#xD;
           exposure history, medical photographs (both overview and close-up) and blood draw for&#xD;
           localizing genetic loci, identifying genes and evaluating phenotype/genotype&#xD;
           correlations, constitute the workup for newly recruited families.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study volunteers are reevaluated every few years to document changes in their skin exam&#xD;
           over time. This is essential for establishing the natural history of dysplastic nevi and&#xD;
           melanoma.&#xD;
