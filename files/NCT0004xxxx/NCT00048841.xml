      The purpose of this two year study is to examine the safety and effectiveness of alendronate&#xD;
      (Fosamax) for the prevention of bone loss in men with prostate cancer who are on therapy to&#xD;
      lower their testosterone levels. All men will receive appropriate calcium and vitamin D&#xD;
      supplements and one to two years of alendronate therapy. Bone density tests will be done&#xD;
      every six months.&#xD;

      Prostate cancer is the most common visceral malignancy and second leading cause of cancer&#xD;
      death in men. While androgen ablation therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for more&#xD;
      advanced stage disease, recent studies suggest the advantage of introducing androgen&#xD;
      deprivation much earlier. Because androgens are essential in maintaining skeletal integrity&#xD;
      in men, androgen deprivation therapy constitutes a major risk factor for male osteoporosis.&#xD;
      We have previously demonstrated that men on chronic androgen deprivation therapy have up to&#xD;
      20% loss of bone. Our hypotheses are that: 1) chronically increased bone resorption induced&#xD;
      by long term androgen deprivation therapy in men with prostate cancer can be reversed with&#xD;
      once weekly bisphosphonate; 2) the improvement in bone mass with bisphosphonate therapy will&#xD;
      be reflected by changes in biochemical markers of bone turnover and will allow us to predict&#xD;
      who will respond to therapy; and 3) following termination of bisphosphonate therapy, bone&#xD;
      mass will be maintained despite the absence of antiresorptive therapy. To address these&#xD;
      hypotheses, we will enroll 84 men with stage D0 prostate cancer who have been on chronic&#xD;
      androgen deprivation therapy in a two year, double blind, placebo controlled, randomized,&#xD;
      modified crossover clinical design. During the first year, subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      bisphosphonate therapy or placebo. During the second year, all subjects who were on placebo&#xD;
      will receive active treatment and all subjects who were on active treatment will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to continue therapy or change to placebo. To evaluate the effect of bisphosphonate&#xD;
      on preventing bone loss, we will assess bone mass of the spine, total hip, total body, and&#xD;
      forearm by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. For hypothesis 2, we will assess markers of bone&#xD;
      resorption and formation to determine if early changes in markers are associated with long&#xD;
      term changes in bone mass. For hypothesis 3, we will continue to follow bone mass and&#xD;
      biochemical markers of bone turnover between months 12 and 24 to examine rates of change when&#xD;
      antiresorptive therapy is terminated. Few data are available on the prevention of bone loss&#xD;
      in men on androgen deprivation therapy. This study will examine a preventive strategy, the&#xD;
      potential mechanism of bone loss, the ability of biochemical markers to predict bone mass,&#xD;
      and skeletal outcomes when antiresorptive therapy is withdrawn.&#xD;
