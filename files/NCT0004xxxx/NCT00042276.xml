      This study will use microdialysis to investigate myofascial pain. This pain is characterized&#xD;
      by &quot;trigger points&quot; (exquisitely tender spots) in a group of tense muscle fibers that extend&#xD;
      from the trigger point to the muscle attachments. Trigger points in the trapezius, a large&#xD;
      muscle lying between the neck and shoulder, are typically caused by emotional stress,&#xD;
      postures such as hunching shoulders, certain activities like using a telephone receiver&#xD;
      without elbow support, or by wearing certain articles such as a heavy coat or heavy purse.&#xD;
      Microdialysis uses a very thin needle probe (about the size and shape of an acupuncture&#xD;
      needle) to collect and measure chemicals directly from soft tissue. Analysis of these&#xD;
      chemicals will show whether changes in the tissue around a muscle with trigger points are&#xD;
      confined to that muscle, or if these changes also occur in more distant muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will examine two types of trigger points. An &quot;active&quot; trigger point causes pain or&#xD;
      other abnormal symptoms and often causes problems with movement. A &quot;latent&quot; trigger point&#xD;
      often causes movement problems without causing pain. Many healthy adults have latent trigger&#xD;
      points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People between 21 and 65 years of age with the following characteristics may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study: 1) no neck pain or trigger points in either upper trapezius muscle; 2) no neck&#xD;
      pain but a latent trigger point in at least one upper trapezius muscle; or 3) neck pain of&#xD;
      less than 3 months' duration and an active trigger point in at least one upper trapezius&#xD;
      muscle. Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination of the muscles of the neck and shoulder area, testing strength and&#xD;
           range of motion, and response to palpation to find trigger points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain inventory. Subjects complete a questionnaire for measuring pain and its intensity,&#xD;
           location, quality, causes, relievers, and associated symptoms. The questionnaire is&#xD;
           filled in before and after each microdialysis procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Microdialysis in upper trapezius muscle. An electrode patch is placed on either side of&#xD;
           the site for insertion of the microdialysis probe and another electrode is placed on the&#xD;
           outer edge of the shoulder. The electrodes are used to measure any electrical activity&#xD;
           that occurs with insertion or movement of the probe. The subject lies face down and the&#xD;
           probe is inserted in the upper trapezius muscle. It remains in place for 5 minutes while&#xD;
           chemical substances are collected from the muscle. It is then advanced about 1.5 cm&#xD;
           deeper into the muscle until a twitch response is obtained and remains in place for 10&#xD;
           more minutes while substances are collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Microdialysis in the gastrocnemius muscle (large muscle of the calf). The same procedure&#xD;
           for the upper trapezius muscle is done in the calf muscle.&#xD;

      Preliminary data suggest that patients with active myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) have a&#xD;
      significantly different biochemical profile within the local milieu of the MTrPs compared to&#xD;
      those without MTrPs or those with a latent (non-symptomatic) MTrP. An important question to&#xD;
      answer is whether anatomical loci, remote from active or latent MTrPs have similar&#xD;
      biochemical profiles to the MTrP itself. These remote sites should be evaluated to help&#xD;
      distinguish whether MTrPs have local biochemical profiles or are associated with a more&#xD;
      widespread phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will select three groups of subjects based on the following characteristics [1, 2, 3&#xD;
      below]. We will sample GB-21 in the upper trapezius muscle and LV-7 (posterior and inferior&#xD;
      to the medial condyle of the tibia in the upper portion of the medial gastrocnemius)&#xD;
      standardized sites for pH, muscle metabolites, inflammatory mediators, arachidonic acid&#xD;
      derivatives, neuropeptides, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to determine whether the local biochemical milieu of an active MTrP&#xD;
      is the same as the biochemical milieu at anatomical sites remote from the MTrP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acupuncture points GB-21 and LV-7 are selected specifically to standardize the locations&#xD;
      of a sampling point in three carefully selected groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. healthy subjects without neck pain and who have no MTrPs identified by palpation&#xD;
           bilaterally in GB-21, and who have no MTrPs identified by palpation bilaterally in LV-7,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. healthy subjects without neck pain in whom latent MTrPs are identified by palpation in&#xD;
           GB-21 in one of the upper trapezius muscles, and who have no MTrPs indentified by&#xD;
           palpation bilaterally in LV-7,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. healthy subjects complaining of neck pain of less than 3 months duration with active&#xD;
           MTrPs identified by palpation in GB-21 in one of the upper trapezius muscles, and who&#xD;
           have no MTrPs identified by palpation bilaterally in LV-7.&#xD;
