      Title: Progesterone Treatment of Blunt Traumatic Brain Injury Principal Investigator(s):&#xD;
      Arthur Kellermann, M.D., M.P.H. Institution: Emory University Biostatistician: Vicki&#xD;
      Hertzberg, Ph.D. Institution: Emory University Project phase or primary methodology: Phase II&#xD;
      pilot, double blind, 4:1 randomized controlled, clinical trial Target disease: Blunt&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury Intervention: Intravenous progesterone infused over three days Number&#xD;
      of patients to be enrolled: 100 Number of clinical centers: One (Grady Memorial Hospital)&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: Dose: Intravenous infusion of progesterone at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/hr&#xD;
      produces a steady state of 450 +/- 100 nmol/L in male and female subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: Compared to study subjects who receive placebo, subjects who receive IV progesterone&#xD;
      do not have an increased risk of mortality or an increased incidence of adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy: Administering IV progesterone shortly following TBI produces any or all of the&#xD;
      following effects, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction of the intracranial pressure therapeutic intensity level (ICP-TIL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decreased duration of coma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decreased inpatient mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improved neurological outcome one month post-injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses: Benefit: The benefits of IV progesterone for TBI are evident across a&#xD;
      range of clinically relevant treatment subgroups, regardless of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time from injury to drug administration: (i.e., &lt;2 hrs. vs. 2-4 hrs. vs. 4-6 hrs.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Victim gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence or absence of severe extracranial trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence or absence of premorbid confounders of outcome (e.g., alcohol intoxication,&#xD;
           alcoholism, stroke, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence or lack of confounding neurological insults (e.g., hypoxemia, hypotension).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severity of the traumatic brain injury - moderate (index GCS 9-12) versus severe (index&#xD;
           GCS 4-8).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severity of non-brain injuries (AIS, ISS scores).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of methodology and design: Double blind randomized controlled, clinical trial.&#xD;
      Block randomization will be used to insure that moderate and severely injured patients of&#xD;
      both genders and races (black and nonblack) have an equal chance of allocation to either&#xD;
      treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection criteria: Age &gt; 18; blunt traumatic brain injury; moderate to severe brain&#xD;
      injury (iGCS 4-12); arrival &lt; 11 hours after Injury&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of pre-randomization procedures or process: Potential study subjects will be&#xD;
      identified by Emergency Medical Service (EMS) personnel and Emergency Medicine attending&#xD;
      physicians and residents in the ECC of GMH. EMS (ambulance) personnel will notify ECC&#xD;
      personnel that they are bringing a blunt trauma patient with a Glasgow Coma Score (iGCS) of&#xD;
      12 or less. On arrival, the attending emergency physician on duty will conduct a primary and&#xD;
      secondary trauma survey and note the patient's post initial resuscitation or i GCS. If the&#xD;
      patient has a iGCS of 4 - 12 and meets criteria for presumptive eligibility, the ECC&#xD;
      attending will page the investigator on-call (IOC) and ask Hospital Social Services to&#xD;
      initiate aggressive efforts to contact the patient's family. To insure prompt administration&#xD;
      of progesterone/placebo, a &quot;door to needle time&quot; of ≤ 2 hours has been established as our&#xD;
      performance goal. To meet this deadline, a member of the research team will immediately&#xD;
      respond to the ECC and determine if the patient meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Time from injury will be established as clearly as possible from the EMS report, police&#xD;
      report or witness interview. Block randomization will be used to insure that moderate and&#xD;
      severely injured patients of both genders and races (black and nonblack) have an equal chance&#xD;
      of allocation to either treatment group. To accomplish this goal, the GMH pharmacy will be&#xD;
      given block sets of randomly ordered packets with sequential study numbers for subjects with&#xD;
      moderate TBI (presenting GCS 9-12) and severe TBI (presenting GCS 4-8). Inside each packet&#xD;
      will be instructions to prepare an infusion of progesterone or a comparable volume of&#xD;
      placebo. When the pharmacist receives a copy of the randomization request, he/she will open&#xD;
      the next packet in sequence based on the patient's severity of brain injury (moderate versus&#xD;
      severe), gender, and race. Following treatment group assignment, the pharmacist will record&#xD;
      the patient's name, medical record number, dose, and time the medication was prepared in a&#xD;
      confidential log for use by the Safety Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precise treatment dose description for protocol: Our goal is to initiate treatment within 2&#xD;
      hours of injury as documented from an EMS report, police report or witness interview. We will&#xD;
      accept patients up to 11 hours post-injury. We will attempt to achieve serum levels of&#xD;
      progesterone in human subjects that are similar to those normally observed in the third&#xD;
      trimester of pregnancy (i.e., 450 +/- 100 nmol/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the infusion rate needed to achieve a SSSPC of progesterone of 450 +/-&#xD;
      100nmol/L, we will conduct a dose-escalation study. The first 12 subjects randomized to&#xD;
      progesterone will receive a loading dose of 0.714 mg/kg over 60 minutes followed by a&#xD;
      continuous infusion of 0.50 mg/kg/hr for three days. Because study personnel will be blinded&#xD;
      to group assignment, an unblinded pharmacologist will analyze the SSSPC data from these 12&#xD;
      patients. If the target concentration of 450 +/- 100nmol/L is not achieved in 90% of these&#xD;
      subjects, the infusion rate will be modified and applied to the next ten subjects randomized&#xD;
      to progesterone therapy. This will be performed a third time if necessary. If pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      variability precludes the achievement of the target concentration in 90% of subjects using a&#xD;
      fixed infusion, we will adopt an individualized dosing strategy based on real-time serum&#xD;
      concentration data. If this is required, adjustments will be made to the placebo infusions as&#xD;
      well to maintain blinding of the study investigators. The total dose given to any patient&#xD;
      over the three day dosing period should not exceed 7.5 grams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GOS, DRS, and GOAT will be assessed at one month post-injury. At the time of hospital&#xD;
      discharge, each patient's disposition will be noted (morgue, nursing home, rehabilitation&#xD;
      facility, another acute care hospital, patient's home, relative's home), so plans can be made&#xD;
      for a follow-up exam one month post-injury. Subjects who are still hospitalized at GMH, an&#xD;
      inpatient rehabilitation facility, a skilled nursing home, or an acute care hospital other&#xD;
      than GMH one month post-injury will be tested on site. We will visit patients who are&#xD;
      homebound at the time of follow-up. All other subjects will be asked to come to a study&#xD;
      clinic at GMH for testing. Patients who are too severely impaired to test at one month&#xD;
      post-injury will be classified as &quot;not testable&quot;. This category will be considered a&#xD;
      surrogate marker for a poor outcome. We will utilize reliability codes to record all possible&#xD;
      reasons for the non-administration of a particular measure, such as physical impairment&#xD;
      (e.g., hemiparesis) cognitive impairment (e.g., did not understand instructions), or&#xD;
      intoxication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the follow-up visit, the study subject (or a proxy respondent) will be asked questions&#xD;
      about their physical and mental health, any medical complications (e.g., seizure disorder,&#xD;
      and headaches), their functional status, their occupational status, their level of sexual&#xD;
      function, and their current living situation. Information on other variables that influence&#xD;
      outcome, such as access to rehabilitation services, will be collected as well. To encourage&#xD;
      participation, subjects will be reimbursed $25 for the follow-up visit, plus additional money&#xD;
      for travel-related expenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extent and type of blinding/masking: Hospital pharmacy personnel will know each patient's&#xD;
      group assignment, but this information will be withheld from the patient, the study team, and&#xD;
      the clinical team responsible for the patient's care. Both study drug and placebo will be&#xD;
      suspended in a lipid base, and will be indistinguishable by color or injection&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints and outcomes: Four measures will be used to monitor each patient's clinical&#xD;
      response to treatment. The first three will be tracked daily by our study nurses. The fourth&#xD;
      will be assessed one month post-injury. These four measures are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reduction in ICP, reflected by a decline in the patient's therapeutic intensity level&#xD;
           (ICP-TIL) a measure of the intensity of treatment needed to reduce increased&#xD;
           intracranial pressure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Duration of coma (i.e., total hours from injury to awakening);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Death prior to hospital discharge;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Neurological outcome at one month post -injury, as measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale&#xD;
           (GOS), the Disability Rating Scale (DRS), and the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test&#xD;
           (GOAT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical design and sample size calculations: Our data analysis strategy is designed to&#xD;
      accomplish our three primary and one secondary goals: 1) achieve and maintain a predetermined&#xD;
      steady state concentration of progesterone in 90% of our study patients, 2) confirm the&#xD;
      safety of the study drug, 3) test the hypothesis that administration of progesterone within 6&#xD;
      hours of TBI improves clinical and neurological outcomes, and the secondary; determine if the&#xD;
      benefit of IV progesterone is equally evident across a range of clinically relevant treatment&#xD;
      subgroups. In the process of achieving these goals, we will quantify our ability to identify&#xD;
      and enroll TBI patients, administer the study drug within strict time restraints, and adhere&#xD;
      to the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the efficacy of progesterone for treatment of TBI, we will employ a systematic&#xD;
      statistical analysis strategy. Our first analytic step will be to compile descriptive&#xD;
      statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation, range, proportion) of patient&#xD;
      demographics. This activity, while not directly addressing any of the study hypotheses, will&#xD;
      serve to describe the central tendencies and variability of the outcome variables and&#xD;
      covariables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second step will be to compare treatment groups with respect to suspected important&#xD;
      covariates, specifically patient age, gender, cause and type of brain injury, presence or&#xD;
      absence of intracranial mass lesions, presence/absence of extracranial trauma,&#xD;
      presence/absence of premorbid confounders (e.g., alcohol intoxication, alcoholism, stroke,&#xD;
      etc.), presence/absence of confounding neurological insults (e.g., hypoxemia, hypotension),&#xD;
      severity of TBI, and time to initial drug administration. This will assess the balance&#xD;
      achieved through randomization. The third step will be to analyze the data according to our&#xD;
      specific aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the sample size needed to establish efficacy, we needed to specify the effect&#xD;
      size to be detected by our outcome measures. We do not have any human data to definitively&#xD;
      establish the effect size expected as a result of treatment. Based on animal models, we&#xD;
      conservatively posit that progesterone will improve neurological outcome (i.e., dichotimized&#xD;
      GOS, DRS, GOAT at one month post-injury) by 25%. We expect to enroll 100 subjects at a 4:1&#xD;
      randomization (80 treated and 20 controls) into our pilot study. With respect to duration of&#xD;
      coma, the number of patients that would allow us to achieve 80% power to detect a difference&#xD;
      of at least 0.6 standard deviation between treatment groups at the two-sided 0.05&#xD;
      significance level was 50 treated and 50 controls. For this outcome, a difference of 0.6&#xD;
      standard deviation units translates into a difference of + 1.1 days, or 29%, based on the&#xD;
      findings of Stambrook, et al.6 However, since we have changed our protocol to a 4:1&#xD;
      randomization, we no longer have the power to detect this difference. Similarly, in the&#xD;
      subgroup of patients monitored for differences in the ICP-TIL, in the original 1:1&#xD;
      randomization scheme we would have been able to achieve 80% power to detect a difference of&#xD;
      at least 1.0 standard deviation between treatment groups at the two-sided 0.05 significance&#xD;
      level, but with the 4:1 scheme no longer have the power to detect a difference. With respect&#xD;
      to mortality, our pilot will have insufficient power (&lt;50%) to definitively detect an effect&#xD;
      size equal to 25% reduction in the rate of death. Similarly there is insufficient power to&#xD;
      detect a &quot;good&quot; neurological outcome at hospital discharge or at one month post-injury using&#xD;
      a dichotomized GOS (good or moderate recovery versus severe disability), with the expectation&#xD;
      of 50% with good outcome in the placebo group, based on the findings of Levin, et al.&#xD;
      However, this study should allow us to perceive trends in the data as well as determine the&#xD;
      range and prevalence of outcomes that we might anticipate for a multi-center study of this&#xD;
      therapy. This will allow us to refine our future power calculations appropriately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, there will be a dose escalation component within the progesterone group, but the&#xD;
      differences in the level of circulating progesterone between the subgroups will be minimal&#xD;
      compared to the control group. Hence, all progesterone treated patients are assumed to&#xD;
      respond similarly to the treatment. (2) At the completion of the pilot phase at least 100&#xD;
      patients will be randomized into this study. GMH's trauma registry indicates that at least&#xD;
      145 potentially eligible TBI patients (age ≥ 18, GCS 4-12, blunt mechanism, and &lt;11 hours&#xD;
      from injury) will come to GMH during the study interval. Every effort will be made to obtain&#xD;
      informed consent from a proxy in order to administer the study drug within the specified time&#xD;
      limit (2 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed safety and efficacy monitoring boundaries:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB): In accordance with standard procedures for NIH&#xD;
      sponsored clinical trials, the DSMB chair and members have been selected by the NIH-NINDS.&#xD;
      This committee will be informed of each subject's group assignment (A versus B), but will be&#xD;
      blinded with respect to which group received the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This committee will have three responsibilities: 1) monitor identification, enrollment, and&#xD;
      randomization procedures to detect any evidence of bias; 2) monitor adverse events to&#xD;
      determine if they occur disproportionately in one group, and 3) monitor key clinical outcomes&#xD;
      to determine if one group does significantly better than the other. To assist the DSMB in its&#xD;
      work, our statistician, Vicki Hertzberg, will monitor the progress of the study on a monthly&#xD;
      basis. The DSMB will have no role in the day-to-day conduct of the trial. The study&#xD;
      statistician will report to the DSMB at quarterly meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring: A study nurse and/or the research program coordinator will round on&#xD;
      subjects daily to track their clinical progress and the occurrence of any serious adverse&#xD;
      events (SAE) or adverse events (AE). All SAEs will be reported to the IRB, DSMB, and FDA&#xD;
      within 24 hours. All other adverse events will be reported to the PI, IRB, and FDA on a&#xD;
      weekly basis. Specific events potentially related to the study drug, based on prior knowledge&#xD;
      of the pharmacology of progesterone, combination agents that include progesterone, and the&#xD;
      Intralipid carrier, will be closely monitored by the study team. These events include: a)&#xD;
      phlebitis at the injection site; b) sedation unexplained by administration of other CNS&#xD;
      medications; c) an increase in liver enzymes; d) unexplained hyperglycemia; e) hypotension or&#xD;
      hypertension not known to be associated with increased intracranial pressure; f) unexplained&#xD;
      fever; g) thromboembolic disease; and h) sepsis. Baseline metabolic parameters will be&#xD;
      determined from the initial blood draw prior to study drug administration. Blood sampling&#xD;
      will be performed at least once per day during drug administration for monitoring. In&#xD;
      addition, hourly vital sign measurements and other parameters will be obtained from ICU&#xD;
      charting forms. Patients will be examined daily by team members for any signs of adverse&#xD;
      reactions. Team members will also review charting, laboratory reports and treating physician&#xD;
      notes daily. In addition, all trauma deaths are reviewed by an interdisciplinary Trauma&#xD;
      Outcome Review Committee (TORC) to determine if the death was non-preventable, potentially&#xD;
      preventable, or preventable. A member of our study team will attend all of these meetings.&#xD;
      If/when TORC reviews a death involving a participant in the study, their findings will be&#xD;
      shared with the DSMB as well as the P.I. and co-P.I. The DSMB will closely monitor the&#xD;
      incidence of death and other serious adverse events such as sepsis or thromboembolic disease.&#xD;
      If they have concerns about the incidence of any of these events as linked to the study drug,&#xD;
      they will immediately report these concerns to the National Institute for Neurological&#xD;
      Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), as well as to the Emory IRB. Furthermore, all occurrences of&#xD;
      death (regardless of cause) and unexpected serious adverse events will be reported to the&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy: To assess the efficacy of the drug on an interim basis, there will be a comparison&#xD;
      of the study groups with respect to the endpoints (mortality, duration of coma, ICP-TIL, and&#xD;
      neurological status indicators at one month) at the time when 12, 24, and 48 patients have&#xD;
      been entered into the trial. Comparisons at these interim points which exceed a z-score of&#xD;
      2.782 (associated p-value of 0.0054) will be considered significant, using the&#xD;
      O'Brien-Fleming procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if one treatment group does better than the other, the team's study nurses will&#xD;
      obtain the following outcome measures: 1) ICP-TIL, 2) duration of coma, 3) in-hospital&#xD;
      mortality, 4) Glasgow Outcome Score, 5) Disability Rating Scale, and 6) Galveston Orientation&#xD;
      and Amnesia Test. The DSMB will monitor these outcomes by treatment group (A versus B) in&#xD;
      order to promptly identify any between-group differences. If significant differences are&#xD;
      noted, the code will be broken and our findings will be immediately reported to the Emory&#xD;
      IRB, the FDA, the NINDS and DSMB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient accrual plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will enroll the first 100 eligible patients over a two year enrollment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical and consent considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since our study involves treatment of patients with acute neurological impairment, they are&#xD;
      not competent to give informed consent. We will therefore seek proxy consent from the&#xD;
      patient's family or next-of-kin or legally authorized representative (LAR). If an LAR is&#xD;
      subsequently located that objects to the study, the process will be halted and the patient's&#xD;
      participation will be terminated. Only the IOCs, or the study coordinator, will be permitted&#xD;
      to approach family members to request consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A written form that complies with the polices and procedures of Emory University's IRB has&#xD;
      been developed and approved. This form includes the following elements: title of the&#xD;
      protocol, the name of the PI, study objectives and purpose, a detailed description of the&#xD;
      procedure and interventions, explanation of the responsibilities of the subject and of the&#xD;
      family member(s) who act as proxy respondents during follow-up interviews, any and all&#xD;
      foreseeable risks, anticipated benefits, available alternatives, an explicit statement of&#xD;
      confidentiality, non-compensation for participation, the right to withdraw at any time, a&#xD;
      signature section, and a number to contact the PI or a member of the study team with any&#xD;
      questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the sudden, unanticipated nature of traumatic brain injury, and the potential time&#xD;
      delays involved in getting a family member to the hospital, we have been authorized by the&#xD;
      IRB to obtain proxy consent for participation over the telephone. When this is necessary, the&#xD;
      on-call investigator will contact the family member, provide a brief explanation of the&#xD;
      situation, read the consent form verbatim, and request verbal consent over the telephone. A&#xD;
      third party will listen in to confirm that the family member understands and has provided&#xD;
      proxy consent. On the signature line of the form, the witness will print the name of the&#xD;
      consenting proxy, write their own name immediately below this name, note the time and date of&#xD;
      the telephone call, and check a box labeled &quot;telephone consent&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before recruiting the first patient in this study, we will undertake a comprehensive process&#xD;
      to notify and consult the target communities that use GMH as their trauma center. The Emory&#xD;
      University News and Information office has pledged its support. On the advice of Emory&#xD;
      Healthcare marketing, we have allocated $40,000 to support marketing and community outreach&#xD;
      activity during the first 6 months of the study. Lesser amounts have been allocated to keep&#xD;
      the community informed in years 2 and 3. An independent interdisciplinary Safety Committee&#xD;
      has been created to provide additional monitoring for study safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to designating a Safety Committee, we will convene an independent citizen&#xD;
      advisory committee. Two influential Atlantans have agreed to co-chair this group. One is Rev.&#xD;
      Gerald Durley, Pastor of Providence Missionary Baptist Church, one of Atlanta's largest&#xD;
      African-American congregations. Rev. Durley is also a key member of Concerned Black Clergy, a&#xD;
      local activist group. The other co-chair is Sandy Teepen, a TBI survivor, safety advocate,&#xD;
      and wife of a national newspaper columnist and former editorial page editor for the Atlanta&#xD;
      Constitution, the largest circulation newspaper in the Southeastern United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progesterone has been used for many years to treat a variety of medical conditions. Side&#xD;
      effects ascribed to its use alone are minimal. Minor adverse reactions include temperature&#xD;
      elevations of 1 degree Fahrenheit, mood changes (depression following drug withdrawal),&#xD;
      vaginal, cervical and uterine lining changes, irregular vaginal bleeding or amenorrhea,&#xD;
      hyperventilation, mild fluid retention, a transient increase in low density lipoprotein&#xD;
      (LDL), a transient decrease in high density lipoprotein (HDL), interference with lactation&#xD;
      during breast feeding, nausea, abdominal cramping, dizziness, headaches, breast pain, and a&#xD;
      delay in fertility. Most of these effects are associated with prolonged administration of&#xD;
      progesterone (i.e., weeks to months). They are unlikely to be experienced during short-course&#xD;
      administration (i.e., 3 days).&#xD;

      Throughout the pilot trial, subjects will be monitored for potential side effects of drug&#xD;
      therapy (i.e. hyperglycemia, hypertension unexplained by increases in ICP, unexplained fever,&#xD;
      local phlebitis, thromboembolic disease, abnormal vaginal bleeding). The Safety Committee&#xD;
      will meet quarterly to review group-specific clinical outcomes and side effects. If they are&#xD;
      concerned that one group is doing significantly better (or worse) than the other, they have&#xD;
      the authority to break the code and order premature termination of the trial.&#xD;

      Participating pharmaceutical or device manufacturing company: None&#xD;

      Proposed sponsor or funding agencies: NINDS NIH&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of the Research and Impact on Medical Care: If the therapeutic benefits observed&#xD;
      in animals are replicated in humans, administration of intravenous progesterone should&#xD;
      produce several benefits, including: a) reduction of intracerebral pressure; b) decreased&#xD;
      duration of coma; c) decreased mortality; and d) improved neurological function at one month&#xD;
      post-injury. If these findings are verified, it will represent a major advance in the&#xD;
      treatment of traumatic brain injury.&#xD;
