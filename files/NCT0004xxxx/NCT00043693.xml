  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a family intervention program for individuals with bipolar disorder,&#xD;
      schizophrenia, or schizoaffective disorder and co-occurring substance use disorders.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Substance use disorder (SUD) in persons with severe mental illness may worsen the course of&#xD;
      psychiatric illness. The loss of family support for individuals with mental illness is a&#xD;
      major contributing factor to housing instability, homelessness, and other problems. Despite&#xD;
      progress toward integrating mental health and substance abuse services, interventions that&#xD;
      improve the course of mental illness while helping the families of the mentally ill are not&#xD;
      currently available. Enhancing skills for coping with mental illness may be an effective&#xD;
      strategy for treating SUD, decreasing caregiver burden, and improving the long-term outcomes&#xD;
      for people with mental illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and their families are randomly assigned to either the Family Intervention for Dual&#xD;
      Diagnosis (FIDD) program or family psychoeducation. The FIDD program lasts for up to 3 years&#xD;
      and includes both single and multiple-family group formats. The family psychoeducation&#xD;
      program consists of 6 weekly sessions. Routine assessments are conducted on all patients, and&#xD;
      relatives are evaluated on a wide range of outcomes, including substance abuse,&#xD;
      hospitalizations, psychiatric symptoms, legal problems, aggression, housing and homelessness,&#xD;
      family burden, social support, and quality of life. To determine the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      FIDD program, knowledge of mental illness and problem-solving skills are assessed in the&#xD;
      families following treatment.&#xD;
