    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  with the diagnosis of allergic asthma &gt;1 year duration who, in addition to the&#xD;
             standards of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  with a positive prick skin test (diameter of wheal &gt; 3 mm) to at least one perennial&#xD;
             allergen (e.g. dust mite, animal dander, cockroaches), within the past 5 years or at&#xD;
             Visit 1, to which the patient will be exposed on a regular basis (most days) for the&#xD;
             duration of the study. A RAST test may be performed for patients with a borderline&#xD;
             skin prick test result.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  with total serum IgE level 30 to 700 IU/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  demonstrating 12% increase in FEV1 over baseline value within 30 minutes of taking up&#xD;
             to 4 puffs salbutamol (albuterol) or nebulized salbutamol up to 5mg (or equivalent of&#xD;
             alternative B-2 agonist) documented within the past year, at screening, during the&#xD;
             run-in period or at baseline prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  with FEV1 40-80% of predicted normal value for the patient (demonstrable at least 6&#xD;
             hours after short acting B-2 agonist use or 12 hours after long acting B-2 agonist&#xD;
             use) at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  who have either experienced at least two independent asthma exacerbations requiring&#xD;
             unscheduled clinical intervention with a systemic corticosteroid in the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        or:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  been admitted to hospital (including intensive care unit) or received emergency room&#xD;
             (including urgent care centers) treatment in the past 12 months for an asthma&#xD;
             exacerbation, which in accordance with the GINA guidelines met all of the following&#xD;
             criteria for a severe exacerbation:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. PEF or FEV1&lt; 60% of predicted/personal best, or patient is too breathless to&#xD;
                  provide PEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. No improvement after initial treatment and therefore requiring repeated treatment&#xD;
                  with inhaled B-2 agonist (high dose, spacer or nebulized).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  receiving high dose inhaled corticosteroid (at least 1000ug beclomethasone&#xD;
             dipropionate or equivalent) and a regular inhaled long acting B-2 agonist for at least&#xD;
             3 months prior to screening and prior to at least two independent asthma exacerbations&#xD;
             requiring unscheduled clinical intervention with a systemic corticosteroid in the past&#xD;
             year or the severe asthma exacerbation requiring the hospitalization/ER visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  who are receiving an ICS dosage &gt; 1000ug beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent and&#xD;
             a regular inhaled long acting B-2 agonist for the last 4 weeks of the run-in period&#xD;
             and at randomization (to be maintained throughout the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  whose asthma medication remains unchanged in the final 4 weeks of the run-in period&#xD;
             (to be maintained throughout the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  with evidence of poor asthma symptom control at screening (based on patient history)&#xD;
             and during the 4 weeks immediately prior to baseline.&#xD;
