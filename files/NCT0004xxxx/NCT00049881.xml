      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past 10 years, extensive studies have been conducted in Turkey to determine the risk&#xD;
      factors for heart disease. Studies involving approximately 10,000 Turkish men and women from&#xD;
      six different regions of Turkey have established that this population is unique in several&#xD;
      ways. The Turks have the lowest plasma levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)&#xD;
      of almost any population in the world (75 percent of the men and 50 percent of the women have&#xD;
      HDL-C levels &lt;40 mg/dl). The mean HDL-C levels are 10-15 mg/dl lower than those in Western&#xD;
      European or American populations. In addition, Turks, especially Turkish women, have a&#xD;
      tendency toward obesity [38.8 percent of the women have body mass index (BMI) &gt;30 kg/M2], and&#xD;
      both men and women have a tendency toward hypertriglyceridemia. The low HDL-C, however, is&#xD;
      independent of obesity or hypertriglyceridemia. Samples from this well-characterized&#xD;
      population provide a unique opportunity to explore the genetic determinants associated with&#xD;
      the high prevalence of low HDL-C, hypertriglyceridemia, and obesity (characteristics of the&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was in response to a Request for Applications entitled &quot;NHLBI Innovative Research&#xD;
      Grant Program&quot; released in July, 2001. The purpose of the initiative was to support new&#xD;
      approaches to heart, lung, and blood diseases and sleep disorders that used existing data&#xD;
      sets or existing biological specimen collections whether obtained through National Heart,&#xD;
      Lung, and Blood Institute support or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study analyzed DNA from frozen blood samples to investigate new candidate gene targets&#xD;
      that provided insights into the abnormalities characterizing this population of Turks. The&#xD;
      samples and extensive biodata were available on all 10,000 participants. In Specific Aim 1,&#xD;
      the investigators identified polymorphisms in acyl CoA:diacylglycerol acyltranferase (DGAT)-&#xD;
      I and -2 and in ATP-binding cassette A I (ABCA I) genes that were associated with differences&#xD;
      in BMI, HDL-C, and triglyceride concentration, and other parameters such as blood pressure.&#xD;
      These studies focussed significantly on promoter and coding sequence polymorphisms in DGAT-I&#xD;
      and -2 and ABCAL In Specific Aim 2, the investigators determined whether the polymorphisms&#xD;
      had functional significance by using a luciferase reporter system to determine expression of&#xD;
      polymorphic forms of DGAT and ABCAI, a cholesterol efflux measurement to determine the&#xD;
      functional significance of ABCAI coding sequence polymorphic sites, and a triglyceride&#xD;
      synthesis assay to determine the functional significance of DGAT-I and -2 polymorphic sites.&#xD;
      The polymorphic site association studies were performed on DNA samples from three subgroups&#xD;
      of Turks: (a) individuals likely to have the metabolic syndrome, (b) individuals with&#xD;
      isolated low HDL-C (normal triglycerides), and (c) normolipidemic unaffected controls.&#xD;
