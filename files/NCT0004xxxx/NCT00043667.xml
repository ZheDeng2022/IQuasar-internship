    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of a monoclonal antibody called&#xD;
      daclizumab in treating uveitis, an eye inflammation. Monoclonal antibodies are genetically&#xD;
      engineered proteins made in large quantities and directed against a specific target in the&#xD;
      body. Daclizumab is designed to prevent a specific chemical interaction needed for immune&#xD;
      cells called lymphocytes to produce inflammation. In an ongoing NIH study of 10 adults with&#xD;
      uveitis, 8 patients were able to decrease corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive&#xD;
      medicines they were taking while receiving daclizumab for months or even years. The study&#xD;
      will be conducted at three different sites, including the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 6 years of age and older with non-infectious uveitis of at least 3 months' duration&#xD;
      who require treatment with immune suppressing medicines, such as prednisone,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate, or others, may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination,&#xD;
      blood tests, complete eye examination, and a questionnaire about the patient's vision and&#xD;
      daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will come to the study center every 2 weeks for treatment and evaluation.&#xD;
      Daclizumab treatments are given by injection under the skin, usually in the arm. Patients&#xD;
      will receive a maximum of 28 treatments over a 1-year period. Treatment may be extended for a&#xD;
      few months while other participants reach their 1-year mark. The first two induction&#xD;
      treatments are at a higher dose (2 mg/kg of body weight) than the maintenance dose of 1&#xD;
      mg/kg. After the first daclizumab treatment, other uveitis medications will be tapered, one&#xD;
      at a time. If the disease remains quiet, these drugs may eventually be stopped completely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first 6 months, all patients will receive daclizumab injections and evaluations every&#xD;
      2 weeks. After that, if other medications have been reduced and vision has remained stable,&#xD;
      treatments and evaluations may be spread out to every 3 or 4 weeks. Over time, fewer tests&#xD;
      may be required during the biweekly examinations if the patient is doing well, but nearly all&#xD;
      the examinations done at screening will be repeated at 3-month intervals. If inflammation or&#xD;
      vision loss occurs during drug tapering, appropriate treatment will be administered. If the&#xD;
      vision loss is too great, the patient will be treated with steroids or other medicines and&#xD;
      taken off the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional, special tests done at selected study centers include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluorescein angiography: This test is done to check for abnormalities of eye blood&#xD;
           vessels. A yellow dye is injected into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in&#xD;
           the eyes. Pictures of the retina are taken with a special camera that flashes a blue&#xD;
           light into the eye. The pictures show if any dye has leaked from the vessels into the&#xD;
           retina, indicating possible abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pelvic ultrasound and urine test: These tests are done at enrollment and after 1 year to&#xD;
           check the kidneys, lymph nodes, and pelvic area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests: Additional blood tests are done at enrollment and every 3 to 6 months for&#xD;
           laboratory and immunology study.&#xD;

      Uveitis refers to intraocular inflammatory diseases that are an important cause of visual&#xD;
      loss. Standard systemic immunosuppressive medications for uveitis can cause significant&#xD;
      adverse effects. Consequently, an effective treatment with a safer side effect profile is&#xD;
      highly desirable. Daclizumab is a humanized anti-Tac monoclonal antibody directed against the&#xD;
      high affinity IL-2 receptor CD25 or Tac subunit. The IL-2 receptor system plays a central&#xD;
      role in the induction of immune responses via activated T and B-lymphocytes, observed both in&#xD;
      uveitis animal models and on the surface of human cells in patients with uveitis. Blocking&#xD;
      this system impedes immune responses and can inhibit the development of local inflammatory&#xD;
      responses. Previous studies using intravenous daclizumab treatments suggest that continuing&#xD;
      daclizumab treatments at 1 mg/kg every 2-4 weeks may effectively control uveitis even after&#xD;
      the complete withdrawal of standard immunosuppressive medications. Subcutaneous (SC)&#xD;
      daclizumab injections at 1 and 2 mg/kg in healthy volunteers are well tolerated and have been&#xD;
      shown to produce serum daclizumab trough levels comparable to intravenous treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, multi-center Phase II trial of SC daclizumab designed to provide&#xD;
      information on current trial design feasibility as well as preliminary safety and efficacy&#xD;
      data on 15 participants at 3 sites who are 6 years of age or older and who require standard&#xD;
      systemic immunosuppression to control their non-infectious posterior or intermediate uveitis.&#xD;
      The SC daclizumab treatments are given every 2 weeks for up to 6 months unless a safety&#xD;
      endpoint requires study exit. A re-induction of SC daclizumab therapy may be permitted after&#xD;
      an initial efficacy failure. Therapy begins with two induction treatments at 2 mg/kg (limit&#xD;
      of 200 mg), followed by maintenance therapy at 1 mg/kg (limit of 100 mg). Beginning with the&#xD;
      first SC daclizumab treatment, the initial immunosuppressive medication load will be tapered&#xD;
      in a staggered fashion to a target level of 50% or less of the original dose within an 8 to&#xD;
      12-week period, if tolerated. After a preliminary efficacy evaluation at 12 weeks, further&#xD;
      tapering and continued SC daclizumab therapy may continue as clinically indicated through the&#xD;
      duration of the trial. The primary efficacy outcome is the maintenance of visual acuity with&#xD;
      the simultaneous reduction of original immunosuppressive medication load. Primary safety&#xD;
      measures are visual acuity and the occurrence of adverse events. Secondary outcome measures&#xD;
      include anterior chamber and vitreous cells, vitreous haze, and questionnaire results.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participant is 6 or more years of age (there is no upper age limit).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participant has a diagnosis of non-infectious intermediate or posterior uveitis of at least&#xD;
        three months duration prior to enrollment, requiring treatment during that period to&#xD;
        control their intraocular inflammatory disease and avoid sight-threatening complications&#xD;
        due to inflammation, with a prescribed dose averaging at least 20 mg/day (or greater then&#xD;
        or equal to 0.25 mg/kg/day) of systemic prednisone (or equivalent) or any combination of&#xD;
        two or more anti-inflammatory treatments for uveitis, or a regimen that includes one of the&#xD;
        following or related compounds: cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, azathioprine, mycophenolate&#xD;
        mofetil, or methotrexate. Participants are anticipated to have, but are not restricted to&#xD;
        the following conditions known to cause intermediate or posterior uveitis: intermediate&#xD;
        uveitis of the pars planitis subtype, sarcoidosis, the Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome,&#xD;
        birdshot retinochoroidopathy, retinal vasculitis and sympathetic ophthalmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participant's uveitis is considered stable on current medications at the time of&#xD;
        enrollment. The prescribed dosage(s) for the current medications at enrollment must not&#xD;
        have been increased in the 6 weeks prior to enrollment, and there are no symptoms or&#xD;
        history of 'attacks' or exacerbation of intraocular inflammation during that 6 week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participant has uveitis with no worse than a grade of 1+ for anterior chamber cells or&#xD;
        vitreous haze at enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participant has best-corrected distance visual acuity in at least one eye of 20/400 or&#xD;
        better (ETDRS logMAR less than 1.34).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participant agrees not to undergo elective ocular surgery (e.g., cataract extraction) for&#xD;
        the first 26 weeks of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participant is not currently pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participant with reproductive potential and who is sexually active agrees to use acceptable&#xD;
        birth control methods throughout the course of the study and for 6 months after completion&#xD;
        of the protocol treatment period. (Acceptable methods must be discussed by the participant&#xD;
        with the Investigator, and may include use of condoms, diaphragms, IUDs, progesterone&#xD;
        implants or injections, or double barrier methods.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participant, or their parent or guardian if younger than 18 years at enrollment, is able to&#xD;
        understand and sign an approved consent form before entering into the study; any minor&#xD;
        participant must also sign an assent if required by the local Institutional Review Board or&#xD;
        Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants under the age of 6 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants who have received previous treatment with an IL-2 directed monoclonal&#xD;
        antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants who are currently enrolled in another clinical trial or who are using a&#xD;
        therapy for a non-uveitis condition that would likely affect immune responses or interfere&#xD;
        with trial logistics, or who have received any investigational therapy within the 30 days&#xD;
        prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants with a history or diagnosis of Behcet's disease (since tapering or withdrawal&#xD;
        of concomitant immunosuppressive medications is not a standard of care for Behcet's&#xD;
        patients) or a primary diagnosis of anterior uveitis (e.g., juvenile rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
        (JRA) or HLA-B27 associated uveitis, ocular conditions usually treated with local and not&#xD;
        systemic medications).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants with a significant, systemic infection requiring medical treatment at the time&#xD;
        of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants with a history of cancer (other than a non-melanoma skin cancer or in situ&#xD;
        cervical cancer) diagnosed within the past 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants with non-ocular, medically significant co-morbid conditions that impair normal&#xD;
        activities, require immunosuppression, or who have a condition with a prognosis that&#xD;
        indicates a significant risk of disability or death if the condition were to continue or be&#xD;
        exacerbated during the study period, or a medical condition that would likely have an&#xD;
        impact on the participant's ability to comply with the visit schedule. Such conditions may&#xD;
        include, for example, recent heart attack, significant COPD, brittle diabetes, kidney&#xD;
        disease, severe emphysema, organ transplant (requiring corticosteroids or other&#xD;
        immunosuppressive medications), hepatitis or other liver disease, or uncontrolled&#xD;
        psychiatric illnesses.&#xD;
