      BMS-275291 may stop the growth of prostate cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by&#xD;
      blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. Randomized phase II trial to study the&#xD;
      effectiveness of BMS-275291 in treating patients who have prostate cancer that has not&#xD;
      responded to hormone therapy&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the time to disease progression in patients with hormone-refractory prostate&#xD;
      cancer treated with two different doses of BMS-275291.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the overall survival of patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer treated&#xD;
      with two different doses of BMS-275291.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the rate of response to BMS-275291, using both PSA and measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this agent in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To investigate the correlation of tumor response with changes in the levels of serum&#xD;
      osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, procollagen I carboxy-terminal propeptide (PICP),&#xD;
      procollagen I amino-terminal propeptide (PINP), and N-telopeptide; and the correlation of&#xD;
      tumor response with changes in the levels of urine pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to&#xD;
      Gleason score (2-4 vs 5-7 vs 8-10), PSA level (less than 10 ng/mL vs 10-50 ng/mL vs 51-100&#xD;
      ng/mL vs more than 100 ng/mL), and concurrent bisphosphonate therapy (yes vs no). Patients&#xD;
      are randomized to one of two treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive oral BMS-275291 once daily on days 1-28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive oral BMS-275291 twice daily on days 1-28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 2 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR)&#xD;
      receive 2 additional courses beyond CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-68 patients (12-34 per treatment arm) will be accrued for&#xD;
      this study within 5-14 months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have a histologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate stage&#xD;
             D2 that is unresponsive or refractory to hormone therapy; patients must have&#xD;
             metastatic prostate cancer deemed to be hormone refractory by one or more of the&#xD;
             following (despite androgen deprivation and anti-androgen withdrawal when applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Progression or unidimensionally measurable disease assessed within 28 days prior&#xD;
                  to initial administration of drug&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Progression of evaluable but not measurable disease assessed within 28 days prior&#xD;
                  to initial administration of drug for PSA evaluation and within 42 days for&#xD;
                  imaging studies (e.g. bone scans)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Rising PSA, defined as at least two consecutive rises in PSA to be documented&#xD;
                  over a reference value; the first rising PSA should be taken at least 7 days&#xD;
                  after the reference value; a third confirmatory PSA measure should be greater&#xD;
                  than the second measure, and it must be obtained at least 7 days after the 2nd&#xD;
                  measure; if this is not the case, a fourth PSA is required to be taken and be&#xD;
                  greater than the second measure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have pre-study PSA within 28 days prior to initial administration of&#xD;
             drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have measurable disease must have mad x-rays, scans or physical&#xD;
             examinations used for tumor measurement completed within 28 days prior to initial&#xD;
             administration of drug; patients must have non-measurable disease within 28 days (for&#xD;
             PSA level) or 42 days (for imaging studies) prior to initial administration of drug;&#xD;
             soft tissue disease that has been radiated within the two months prior to registration&#xD;
             is not assessable as measurable disease; soft tissue disease that has been radiated&#xD;
             two or more months prior to registration is assessable as measurable disease provided&#xD;
             that the lesion has progressed following radiation; as the biology of previously&#xD;
             irradiated tumor may be different from non-irradiated tumors, patients must have at&#xD;
             least one measurable lesion outside the previously irradiated region in order to be&#xD;
             considered to have measurable disease&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  All patients must have had a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis within 28 days prior to&#xD;
             initial administration of drug; bone scans must be performed within 42 days of initial&#xD;
             drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have been surgically or medically castrated; if the method of castration&#xD;
             was LHRH agonists (leuprolide or goserelin), then the patient must be willing to&#xD;
             continue the use of LHRH agonists&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the patient has been treated with non-steroidal anti-androgens (flutamide,&#xD;
             bicalutamide or nilutamide) or other hormonal treatment (such as ketoconazole), these&#xD;
             agents must have been stopped at least 28 days prior to enrollment for flutamide or&#xD;
             ketoconazole, and at least 42 days prior to enrollment for bicalutamide or nilutamide;&#xD;
             and the patients must have demonstrated progression of disease since the agents were&#xD;
             suspended&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation therapy is allowed; at least 21 days must have elapsed since the&#xD;
             completion of radiation therapy, and the patient must have recovered from the side&#xD;

             have recovered from side effects of therapy, and the AGC and platelets must meet the&#xD;
             parameters specified&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No more than one prior chemotherapy regimen is allowed; at least 3 weeks must have&#xD;
             elapsed since the completion of the chemotherapy, and the patient must have recovered&#xD;
             from the side effects of the therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of 60-100%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count of &gt;= 100,000/uL&#xD;

             protocol treatment except under the circumstances outlined; no unconventional therapy&#xD;
             (e.g. St. John's Wort, PC-SPES, or any other herbal remedies taken for the purpose of&#xD;
             treating prostate cancer) may be given during protocol treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be planning to begin bisphosphonates; patients already receiving&#xD;
             bisphosphonates may continue and are eligible provided that they have progressive&#xD;
             disease documented while on bisphosphonate therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of brain metastases, or who currently have treated or&#xD;
             untreated brain metastases, are not eligible&#xD;
