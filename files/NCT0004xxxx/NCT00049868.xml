      To develop genetic maps for the genome-wide screening markers used by multiple investigators&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meiotic linkage maps are the foundation of both linkage and linkage disequilibrium studies&#xD;
      for mapping disease genes. Despite the importance of precise maps, existing genome-wide&#xD;
      linkage maps were built using only a small collection of pedigrees, and so have wide&#xD;
      confidence intervals surrounding estimates of map distance. Incorrect marker order and map&#xD;
      distances can have a profound effect on linkage analyses. Using a sex-averaged map instead of&#xD;
      a sex-specific map biases the lod scores upward, markedly increasing the false positive rate.&#xD;
      Since it is very costly to follow-up many false-positive results, there is a clear need for&#xD;
      more precise and accurate sex-specific genetic maps. Accurate estimates of meiotic map&#xD;
      distance cannot be obtained by any means other than by linkage analysis using genotype data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is in response to a Request for Applications entitled &quot;NHLBI Innovative Research&#xD;
      Grant Program&quot; released in July, 2001. The purpose of the initiative is to support new&#xD;
      approaches to heart, lung, and blood diseases and sleep disorders that use existing data sets&#xD;
      or existing biological specimen collections whether obtained through National Heart, Lung,&#xD;
      and Blood Institute support or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The genetic epidemiology study will build improved highly-precise sex-specific linkage maps&#xD;
      utilizing thousands of individuals who have previously been genotyped. After filtering out&#xD;
      obvious relationship and genotype errors, the study will incorporate methods that properly&#xD;
      model for genotyping errors. In addition to creating precise maps for the scientific&#xD;
      community, the study will also use these genotype data to study how recombination may vary&#xD;
      between ethnic groups. The genotypes generated by the NHLBI Mammalian Genotyping Service are&#xD;
      precisely the type of data required to produce more accurate maps. These data collections&#xD;
      contain over 3,400 pedigrees with more than a 100-fold increase in information compared to&#xD;
      that contained in the 8 CEPH families that have been used to construct current genome-wide&#xD;
      linkage maps. The new maps will be made publicly available and the genotype data from the&#xD;
      study will be accessible by the MAP-0-MAT linkage mapping server. In the future, the study&#xD;
      will be broadened to incorporate genotype data from additional genotyping centers such as the&#xD;
      Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR).&#xD;
