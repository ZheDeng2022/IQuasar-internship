      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There was an urgent need to design more effective stroke prevention strategies. Previous&#xD;
      prevention strategies including blood pressure control and anti-platelet therapy resulted in&#xD;
      only a 43% reduction in stroke risk in a multi-center study, PROGRESS. Other proposed&#xD;
      potentially modifiable mechanisms that mediated endothelial cell injury and activation&#xD;
      leading to accelerated atherosclerosis including dyslipidemia, oxidative stress, endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction, inflammation, and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activation were candidate&#xD;
      strategies. Plasma markers of these various proposed mechanisms were studied to see if they&#xD;
      predicted recurrent stroke. Since strokes kill 5 million people each year, at least one third&#xD;
      of the 15 million others who sustain a non-fatal stroke suffer permanent disability, and&#xD;
      those who have a transient ischemic attack (TIA) are also likely to have a recurrent event,&#xD;
      identifying potentially modifiable risk factors would significantly reduce morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality due to strokes worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was based on plasma samples taken on enrollment from a subset of the 6,105 subjects&#xD;
      in the Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS). The PROGRESS was an&#xD;
      international, randomized, double-blind controlled study of a perindopril-based blood&#xD;
      pressure lowering regimen among individuals with stroke or transient ischemic attack within&#xD;
      the previous five years. Coordination and monitoring for PROGRESS were maintained through two&#xD;
      international coordinating centers, one in Sydney, Australia and the other in Auckland and&#xD;
      through seven regional coordinating centers in Beijing, Glasgow, Melbourne, Milan, Osaka,&#xD;
      Paris and Uppsala. There were 172 local clinical centers distributed through 10 countries:&#xD;
      Australia, Belgium, China, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden and the United&#xD;
      Kingdom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was in response to a Request for Applications entitled &quot;NHLBI Innovative Research&#xD;
      Grant Program&quot; released in July, 2001. The purpose of the initiative was to support new&#xD;
      approaches to heart, lung, and blood diseases and sleep disorders that used existing data&#xD;
      sets or existing biological specimen collections whether obtained through National Heart,&#xD;
      Lung, and Blood Institute support or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a nested case-control study. Plasma samples were obtained from 6,105 subjects&#xD;
      enrolled in the PROGRESS study, The nested case-control study included 1773 patients: 591&#xD;
      were cases (83 hemorrhagic strokes, 472 ischemic strokes, and 36 of unknown type), and 1182&#xD;
      were controls who did not subsequently become cases. Controls satisfying all matching&#xD;
      criteria were found for 572 of these cases; 19 were incompletely matched. After the addition&#xD;
      of cases who acted as matched controls for other cases and taking account of controls who&#xD;
      acted for &gt;1 case, there were 33 cases with 1, 213 with 2, and 345 with 3 matched controls.&#xD;
      Altogether, 89 cases served as controls for 1 other case. The data were related to clinical&#xD;
      markers of cardiovascular risk on enrollment. The study was designed to determine which of&#xD;
      these plasma markers provided an independent measure of risk of recurrent stroke. In&#xD;
      addition, the study determined those plasma markers that provided an independent measure of&#xD;
      reduction in risk of recurrent stroke by perindopril-based antihypertensive therapy, thereby&#xD;
      providing a means to identify those subjects most likely to benefit from such therapy, and&#xD;
      conversely, those subjects in whom alternative preventative strategies were required. In&#xD;
      addition, plasma markers that predicted risk of recurrent stroke may have indicated novel&#xD;
      therapies to prevent this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims included identifying whether nuclear magnetic resonance-determined lipoprotein&#xD;
      profiles, and plasma levels of homocysteine, protein carbonyls, chlorotyrosine, soluble&#xD;
      vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM-1), C-reactive peptide (CRP), active renin, and the&#xD;
      amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) predicted recurrent stroke in&#xD;
      PROGRESS study participants and whether these measures predicted benefit from&#xD;
      perindopril-based antihypertensive therapy.&#xD;
