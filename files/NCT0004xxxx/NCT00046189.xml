  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine if family members of patients with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) have&#xD;
      various abnormalities, including: skin abnormalities; nervous system abnormalities, such as&#xD;
      hearing problems; skin, eye, or internal cancers, or other changes. XP is a rare inherited&#xD;
      disease that involves an inability to repair damage to cell DNA (genetic material). It can&#xD;
      affect several organ systems, including the skin, eye, nervous system, and bones. Patients&#xD;
      have a more than thousand-fold increase in frequency in all major skin cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents of patients with XP are carriers of the abnormal XP gene. Other family members may&#xD;
      also be carriers of the abnormal XP gene. Carriers do not develop the disease themselves;&#xD;
      symptoms develop only in children who have inherited the faulty gene from both parents. This&#xD;
      study will try to clarify the genetic basis for XP and to understand the increased frequency&#xD;
      of cancer in the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XP patients who have been evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center and their relatives are&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Newly diagnosed XP patients are also eligible. Spouses of relatives&#xD;
      will also be included as control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and their family members will undergo some or all of the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parental permission to review the child s relevant medical records and pathology&#xD;
           material from treatments or surgery for cancer or other related illnesses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical examination, with particular attention to the skin and&#xD;
           possible eye, hearing or neurological examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photographs to document skin and other physical findings&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nuclear medicine scans to evaluate the brain and nervous system&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  X-rays of the skull or other parts of the body&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nervous system testing with an electroencephalogram (EEG), electroretinogram (ERG),&#xD;
           electromyogram (EMG) or nerve conduction velocity measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of blood and skin samples for gene studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establishment of cell lines from collected blood or tissues to study DNA repair, skin&#xD;
           cancer, cancers related to XP, immune defects, and related studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsy (surgical removal of a small piece of tissue) of suspicious skin lesions for&#xD;
           examination under a microscope&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of a cheek cell sample, obtained by twirling a soft brush against the inside&#xD;
           of the cheek&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of a hair sample for microscopic examination and composition analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgery to treat skin cancers or other lesions&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP) is a rare, recessive disorder with a more than 1000-fold increase&#xD;
      in the frequency of all major skin cancers in association with defective DNA repair. The risk&#xD;
      of skin and other cancers among normal appearing XP heterozygote individuals has not been&#xD;
      fully studied. We plan to study the family members from XP families with known DNA repair&#xD;
      gene mutations to determine if heterozygote carriers of XP disease mutations are at an&#xD;
      increased risk of developing cancer. For controls we will compare XP heterozygotes to their&#xD;
      non-carrier blood relatives and spouses and to the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results&#xD;
      (SEER) rates. For this purpose, blood, skin or buccal cells will be obtained from all&#xD;
      available relatives for DNA or RNA mutation analysis. Cancer confirmation will be&#xD;
      accomplished through review of pathology reports, medical records and death certificates. In&#xD;
      addition, willing family members will be clinically examined to determine current cancer&#xD;
      status. Individuals who are determined to be heterozygous carriers of XP DNA repair gene&#xD;
      disease mutations in these families by mutation analysis or by pedigree will be compared to&#xD;
      non-carrier relatives and spouses with respect to history of any type of cancer. We will also&#xD;
      focus on skin cancer and cancer of the nervous system since the risks of these cancers are&#xD;
      elevated among the XP homozygotes.&#xD;
