  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of E7389 in treating patients who have advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing&#xD;
      so they stop growing or die&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of E7389 administered as an IV bolus over&#xD;
      1-2 minutes weekly for 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the toxicities of E7389. III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of E7389. IV.&#xD;
      To determine the in vivo anti-mitotic activity of E7389 by cell cycle analysis and&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry in pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive E7389 IV over 1-2 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 4&#xD;
      weeks for at least 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of E7389 until the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients&#xD;
      experiences dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Advanced, histologically-confirmed solid tumors refractory to standard therapy or for&#xD;
             which no standard therapy exists&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status of at least 60% and estimated survival of at least two&#xD;
             months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 mg/dl or creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 ml/min&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ANC &gt;= 1,500/ul&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/ul&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SGOT and SGPT =&lt; 2.5 times the upper limits of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior to entry on study, a patient must be at least four weeks from prior chemotherapy&#xD;
             (six weeks from nitrosoureas, 8 weeks from UCN-01) and have recovered from all side&#xD;
             effects of prior therapy; there is no limit on the number of prior chemotherapy&#xD;
             regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written, voluntary, informed consent of the patient must be obtained in compliance&#xD;
             with institutional, state and federal guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with brain metastases are INELIGIBLE for this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Due to concerns regarding possible drug interactions, patients with HIV taking&#xD;
             anti-retroviral medications are INELIGIBLE&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant patients and patients who are breast feeding are INELIGIBLE; all patients of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential, both male and female, must be advised to practice adequate&#xD;
             contraception; premenopausal women must have a negative pregnancy test prior to entry&#xD;
             on this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any non-malignant intercurrent illness (e.g. cardiovascular, pulmonary,&#xD;
             or central nervous system disease) which is either poorly controlled with currently&#xD;
             available treatment, or which is of such severity that the investigators deem it&#xD;
             inappropriate to treat the patient on this protocol are INELIGIBLE&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients currently being treated for a severe infection or who are recovering from&#xD;
             major surgery are INELIGIBLE until recovery is deemed complete by the investigators&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have evaluable disease; the presence of measurable disease is NOT&#xD;
             required for this phase I study; if unidimensionally measurable disease is present,&#xD;
             baseline measurements of up to 3 indicator lesions should be made no earlier than four&#xD;
             weeks prior to the first cycle of chemotherapy; pleural effusions, ascites and bone&#xD;
             metastases are not considered measurable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CBC, differential count, platelet count, and blood chemistries should be done no&#xD;
             earlier than 72 hours prior to each cycle of chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Except for 4 weeks for tumor measurements and 72 hours for specified blood work,&#xD;
             pretreatment tests should be done no earlier than two weeks prior to the first cycle&#xD;
             of chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Once the MTD has been established, an additional10 patients will be accrued to obtain&#xD;
             pre- and post-treatment biopsy material in order to validate the molecular targets of&#xD;
             E7389 in man; therefore, to maximize likelihood of obtaining tissue from patients&#xD;
             treated in the expanded MTD cohort, only patients with tumors appropriate for repeated&#xD;
             biopsy are eligible during this stage of the study&#xD;
