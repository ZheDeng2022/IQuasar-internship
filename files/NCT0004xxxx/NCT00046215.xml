  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to examine the relationship&#xD;
      between cognitive processing and motor control by determining whether a part of the brain&#xD;
      called the premotor cortex is essential to imagining movement. TMS, described below, is a&#xD;
      method of brain stimulation that can temporarily inhibit brain functions of the area&#xD;
      underlying the stimulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy right-handed normal volunteers may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be&#xD;
      screened with a medical history, neurological examination, and test of finger dexterity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will perform a sequential finger tapping movement in response to a series of&#xD;
      numbers (stimuli) displayed on a computer monitor. After 10 stimuli, they will be asked which&#xD;
      finger they tapped last. They will then imagine the same finger tapping movement and will be&#xD;
      asked which finger they tapped last in their imagination. During these exercises,&#xD;
      participants will undergo transcranial magnetic stimulation. For this procedure, the subject&#xD;
      is seated comfortably in a chair. A wire coil is placed on the scalp and a brief electrical&#xD;
      current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that passes into the brain.&#xD;
      This generates a very small electrical current in the brain, which briefly disrupts the&#xD;
      function of the brain cells in the stimulated area. The stimulation may cause twitching in&#xD;
      arm or leg muscles. During the stimulation, the electrical activity of muscles is recorded&#xD;
      with a computer or other recording device, using electrodes attached to the skin with tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete eight experimental blocks of testing. One block consists of 20&#xD;
      experimental trials, with each trial lasting about 10 seconds. Five pairs of TMS stimuli are&#xD;
      given per trial, with pulses delivered in short bursts of one second each. After each block,&#xD;
      subjects draw a mark on a line on paper, showing how much attention they are paying, how much&#xD;
      fatigue they are experiencing, and how well they think they are executing the tasks. Each TMS&#xD;
      session takes up to 3.5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the TMS session, participants will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for use in&#xD;
      determining proper placement of the TMS coil. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio&#xD;
      waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues. For this procedure, the subject lies still&#xD;
      in a narrow metal cylinder (the scanner) for about 30 minutes during the scan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A high-level of motor control often requires complex processing of sensory information, which&#xD;
      likely corresponds to the neural correlates for mental imagery of movement. Such cognitive&#xD;
      aspects of motor control may underlie other cognitive functions, such as mental calculation.&#xD;
      The present transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) study is aimed to characterize the&#xD;
      relation between cognitive processing and motor control. Based on our previous results from&#xD;
      neuroimaging experiments, we hypothesize that the ability to process information for motor&#xD;
      imagery would primarily be associated with the dorsal lateral premotor context (PMd) as well&#xD;
      as the posterior parietal cortex. TMS will be used to disrupt neural processes in the limited&#xD;
      brain structures under the coil for a short period of time (virtual lesion study). For this&#xD;
      proposal, 15 healthy subjects will perform number-guided motor execution/imagery tasks. Both&#xD;
      tasks will be guided by 10 visual number stimuli presented at a rate of 1.0 Hz. For the test&#xD;
      TMS stimuli, a paired TMS stimulation will be delivered to either M1 or PMd100 (to) 150&#xD;
      milliseconds after 5 of the visual number stimuli. The frequency of TMS stimulation will be&#xD;
      1.0 Hz on average for a short period of time (10 seconds). Measurement will be accuracy of&#xD;
      the task performance under the TMS stimulation as compared with a sham condition. We expect&#xD;
      that the TMS stimulation to PMd will interfere with the performance of motor imagery more&#xD;
      than the performance of motor execution. The present study will clarify the neural correlates&#xD;
      underlying the ability of imagining movement, which is now drawing growing attention in the&#xD;
      neuroscience community.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will only recruit right-handed subjects as assessed by Edinburgh handedness inventory&#xD;
        (Oldfield, 1971). We will also administer a simple version of the tapping task and assess&#xD;
        their dexterity to select subjects consistent with the digit skills required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Contraindications for TMS: pacemakers, implanted medical pumps, metal plate in skull, metal&#xD;
        objects inside the eye or skull, history of seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Contraindications for MRI: pacemakers, brain stimulators, dental implants or metallic&#xD;
        braces, aneurysm clips (metal clips on the wall of a large artery), metallic prostheses&#xD;
        (including metal pins and rods, heart valves, and cochlear implants), permanent eyeliner,&#xD;
        insulin pump, or shrapnel fragments. Welders and metal workers are also at risk for injury&#xD;
        because of possible small metal fragments in the eye of which they may be unaware. Subjects&#xD;
        will be screened for these contraindications prior to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with previous or current neuropsychiatric disorders will be excluded. Patients&#xD;
        with MRI findings consistent with organic brain lesions such as brain tumors, stroke, or&#xD;
        trauma will be excluded. Patients with a history of significant medical disorders such as&#xD;
        cancers will be excluded. Subjects not capable of giving informed consent will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will not scan pregnant women with MRI because safety of high magnetic field to fetus is&#xD;
        not established. Therefore, we will administer a urine pregnancy test for any female&#xD;
        subject of childbearing potential prior to MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Brain functions at a development stage are out of scope of this particular experiment, and,&#xD;
        therefore, subjects under age 21 will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who show evidence of unusually increased cortical excitability that may lead to&#xD;
        seizure activity detected by surface EMG recording will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
        Subjects who always reveal muscle activity during the motor imagery task will also be&#xD;
        excluded from the study.&#xD;
