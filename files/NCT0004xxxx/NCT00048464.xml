      Patients will have immune cells collected and then expanded outside of the body. Patients&#xD;
      will undergo standard treatment with high dose chemotherapy followed by peripheral blood stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation. Three days following the transplant, patients will receive an infusion&#xD;
      of a large number of expanded immune cells. The goal of the study will be to determine the&#xD;
      safety as well as potential efficacy of this treatment.&#xD;

      This Phase I/II clinical study is designed to examine the safety of Xcellerated T Cells, an&#xD;
      activated, autologous T cell product, in study subjects undergoing an autologous peripheral&#xD;
      blood stem cell transplant for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Thirty-five patients will&#xD;
      be treated. Patients must have undergone induction therapy prior to study registration, and&#xD;
      may not have progressed following induction therapy or any other prior therapy for myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a steady state leukapheresis (Xcellerate Leukapheresis) to obtain&#xD;
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells that will be used to produce Xcellerated T Cells. During&#xD;
      the Xcellerate Process, T cells will be activated and expanded ex vivo by co-stimulation with&#xD;
      anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies covalently attached to super-paramagnetic&#xD;
      microbeads. While the Xcellerated T Cells are being produced at Xcyte Therapies, patients&#xD;
      will be treated with a standard mobilization regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
      filgrastim (Neupogen; G-CSF), followed by a second leukapheresis for collection of peripheral&#xD;
      blood stem cells. Patients will be treated with a standard high-dose chemotherapy regimen for&#xD;
      multiple myeloma consisting of single agent melphalan (200mg/m2). Patients will then receive&#xD;
      their peripheral blood stem cells followed by post-transplant filgrastim for neutrophil&#xD;
      recovery. Three days (Day 3) following stem cell infusion, patients will receive a single&#xD;
      dose Xcellerated T Cells.&#xD;

             induction therapy.&#xD;
