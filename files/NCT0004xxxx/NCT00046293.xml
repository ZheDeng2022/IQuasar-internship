    <textblock>
      This study will determine the dose of Retavase that can safely be combined with ReoPro in&#xD;
      treating acute ischemic stroke (stroke resulting from a blood clot in the brain). ReoPro and&#xD;
      Retavase are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat heart problems&#xD;
      caused by blockage of heart arteries. The only therapy approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration to treat ischemic stroke is the clot buster drug rt-PA. This treatment is&#xD;
      effective only if begun within 3 hours of onset of the stroke, however, and most patients do&#xD;
      not get to the hospital early enough to benefit from it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 18 and 80 years of age who have had a mild or moderate acute stroke between&#xD;
      3 and 24 hours before starting study drugs may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be&#xD;
      screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood tests, rating of neurological&#xD;
      deficits such as cognition deficits or problems walking that resulted from the stroke, and a&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) scan of the head. CT involves the use of specialized X-rays to&#xD;
      obtain images of the brain. The patient lies on a table that is moved into a cylindrical&#xD;
      machine (the scanner) for the imaging study, which usually takes about 5 to 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive 0.25 mg/kg of ReoPro (maximum dose of 30 mg). The drug is&#xD;
      infused into the vein over 12 hours. Some patients will also receive one of four doses of&#xD;
      Retavase, which may boost the effectiveness of ReoPro in opening the blocked blood vessel.&#xD;
      Retavase is given through a needle in the vein over 2 minutes. Patients will be monitored&#xD;
      daily until discharge from the hospital, or until day 5, whichever is earlier. Assessments&#xD;
      will include physical examinations, blood tests to examine factors involved in blood&#xD;
      clotting, and CT scans to evaluate both the response to treatment and drug side effects. They&#xD;
      will return for a follow-up examination and CT scan 30 days after treatment.&#xD;

      Objectives: This is the companion protocol to the ROSIE protocol. This clinical trial will&#xD;
      determine an acceptable dose of reteplase in combination with a fixed dose of abciximab for&#xD;
      ischemic stroke 3-24 hours from onset in patients screened with brain CT rather than MRI (as&#xD;
      required by the ROSIE protocol). The importance of this study relative to ROSIE will be its&#xD;
      relevance to the large proportion of acute stroke patients who cannot have a screening MRI,&#xD;
      because of contraindications or unavailability of emergency MRI at their hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Patients will be selected by criteria to minimize likelihood of toxicity&#xD;
      and maximize likelihood of response. These criteria include age 18-80 years old, patients who&#xD;
      cannot get acute MRI because of contraindication to or unavailability of MRI, acute ischemic&#xD;
      stroke of moderate severity (NIH Stroke Scale less than or equal to 16 and ischemic changes&#xD;
      on CT scan less than approximately one third of the volume of the middle cerebral artery&#xD;
      territory), no evidence of hemorrhage on CT, and no other clinical, radiological or&#xD;
      laboratory features associated with increased risk of hemorrhage with thrombolytic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The study is open-label, dose escalation, safety and proof of principle study of the&#xD;
      combination of intravenous abciximab and reteplase. A fixed dose of abciximab will be used in&#xD;
      all patients: 0.25 mg/kg bolus (to a maximum of 30 mg) followed by a 0.125&#xD;
      microgram/kg/minute infusion (to a maximum of 10.0 microgram/minute) for 12 hours. The five&#xD;
      dosing groups for the reteplase dose are 0U, 2.5 U, 5.0 U, 7.5 U, and 10.0 U. A maximum of 72&#xD;
      patients will be treated using an adaptive statistical design. Non-investigation patient&#xD;
      management will be standardized across all patients according to the NIH Stroke Center&#xD;
      Clinical Care Pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary efficacy endpoint for response will be clinical improvement&#xD;
      (complete recovery or improvement of 4 points or more on the NIH Stroke Scale) at 24 hours&#xD;
      after start of therapy. The primary safety endpoint for determination of toxicity will be any&#xD;
      one of the following: symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), major systemic hemorrhage,&#xD;
      or other serious adverse event related to study drug administration, including death, within&#xD;
      48 hours from start of therapy. The maximum acceptable rate of toxicity will be 10% of&#xD;
      patients treated at any dose level and the minimum acceptable rate of response will be 50% of&#xD;
      patients at any dose level. The outcomes will be monitored by a Data and Safety Monitoring&#xD;
      Committee, which will have the authority to stop or recommend modifications of the trial for&#xD;
      safety concerns. Other clinical outcome variables and imaging variables will be recorded and&#xD;
      analyzed in secondary and exploratory analyses. If an acceptable dose is identified, then&#xD;
      that will be investigated in a subsequent randomized placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may be enrolled in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke with onset between 3 and 24 hours prior to planned start&#xD;
        of study drugs. Acute ischemic stroke is defined as a measurable neurological deficit of&#xD;
        sudden onset, presumed secondary to focal cerebral ischemia, and not otherwise attributable&#xD;
        to ICH or another disease process. Stroke onset will be defined as the time the patient was&#xD;
        last known to be without the new clinical deficit. Patients whose deficits have worsened in&#xD;
        the last 24 hours are not eligible if their first symptoms started more than 24 hours&#xD;
        before. If the stroke started during sleep, stroke onset will be recorded as the time the&#xD;
        patient was last known to be intact. A careful history is important to determine when the&#xD;
        patient was last without the presenting deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Disabling neurological deficit attributable to the acute stroke at the start of study&#xD;
        drugs.&#xD;
