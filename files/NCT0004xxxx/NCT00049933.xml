      To examine in postmenopausal women the potential interactions of hormone replacement therapy&#xD;
      with other blood clotting factors on the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack&#xD;
      or stroke.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estrogens are prothrombotic. Recently, the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study&#xD;
      (HERS), renewed interest in the adverse effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). In&#xD;
      HERS, HRT was no better than placebo at preventing coronary events. In post hoc analyses,&#xD;
      treatment was associated with early harm and late benefit. In an American Heart Association&#xD;
      funded case-control study, a potential interaction was observed between HRT and the&#xD;
      prothrombin G20210A variant on the risk of first myocardial infarction (MI) in&#xD;
      post-menopausal women with hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a case-control design. The Group Health Cooperative (GHC) computerized files&#xD;
      will be used to identify postmenopausal women, aged 30 to 79 yrs, with incident myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (MI) or stroke during 1/2000-12/2004. Population-based controls, sampled from the&#xD;
      GHC enrollment files, will be frequency matched to cases by age, calendar year, and treated&#xD;
      hypertension. Data collection will include medical-record review, telephone interview of&#xD;
      consenting subjects, and venous-blood collection. Standard methods will be used to assay&#xD;
      variant alleles. The GHC computerized pharmacy records will serve as the primary source of&#xD;
      information about the use of HRT. Data analysis will involve restriction, stratification, and&#xD;
      logistic regression. Case-control and case-only analyses are planned. There will be a total&#xD;
      of 600 MI cases, 420 stroke cases and 1800 controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose is to examine the potential interactions of hormone replacement therapy&#xD;
      with other procoagulant variants on the risk of cardiovascular events. The main variants of&#xD;
      interest are: (la) factor XIIIA Val34Leu; (ib) platelet glycoprotein (PGP) Jib Ile843Ser;&#xD;
      (ic) PGP IIIa Leu33Pro; and (id) PGP Ia C807T. The secondary aims include the assessment of&#xD;
      other drug-gene, risk-factor-gene or gene-gene interactions on risk: (2a) the interaction&#xD;
      between PGP IIb Ser843, PGP lila Leu33Pro and PGP Ia C807T and traditional cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk factors such as smoking and obesity on the risk of MI and stroke; (2b) the interaction&#xD;
      between three coagulation factor XIII polymorphisms and PAl-1 4G/5G on the risk of stroke in&#xD;
      women; and (2c) the interaction between aspirin use and glycoprotein IIIa Leu33Pro on the&#xD;
      risk of MI and stroke.&#xD;
