      Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop&#xD;
      growing or die. Biological therapies such as gefitinib may interfere with the growth of the&#xD;
      tumor cells and slow the growth of the tumor. Combining chemotherapy with gefitinib may kill&#xD;
      more tumor cells. Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining chemotherapy with&#xD;
      gefitinib in treating patients who have metastatic transitional cell cancer of the urothelium&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the overall response proportion in patients with advanced carcinoma of the&#xD;
      urothelial tract treated with cisplatin, gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) and ZD1839&#xD;
      (gefitinib), given on a 21 day schedule, followed by maintenance ZD1839.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the time to progression, progression-free survival, and overall survival in&#xD;
      patients with advanced carcinoma of the urothelial tract treated with cisplatin, gemcitabine&#xD;
      and ZD1839, given on a 21 day schedule, followed by maintenance ZD1839.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the effect of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression level on&#xD;
      overall response rate and progression-free survival in patients with advanced carcinoma of&#xD;
      the urothelial tract treated with cisplatin, gemcitabine and ZD1839, given on a 21 day&#xD;
      schedule, followed by maintenance ZD1839.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the toxicity of the combination of cisplatin, gemcitabine and ZD1839 given on&#xD;
      a 21 day schedule, followed by maintenance ZD1839 in patients with advanced carcinoma of the&#xD;
      urothelial tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive gemcitabine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin&#xD;
      IV over 1 hour on day 1. Patients also receive gefitinib orally (PO) once daily (QD)&#xD;
      beginning on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete remission,&#xD;
      partial remission, or maintain stable disease continue gefitinib PO QD for 5 years or until&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed at least every 3 months for 1 year and then at least every 6 months&#xD;
      until disease progression or relapse.&#xD;
