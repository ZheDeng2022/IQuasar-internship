  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the effects of the drug alprazolam (Xanax ) on&#xD;
      anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To understand the effect of anxiety-relieving drugs on fear and anxiety, researchers often&#xD;
      have participants anticipate unpleasant stimuli. Anticipating unpleasant stimuli increases or&#xD;
      potentiates a simple reflex called the startle reflex. The so-called fear-potentiated startle&#xD;
      reflex (FPS) effect may be blocked or reduced by anxiety-relieving drugs. Evidence suggests&#xD;
      that the FPS can be mediated by two mechanisms that regulate the phasic- and sustained&#xD;
      enhancement of startle. This study will elicit phasic and sustained FPS in participants by&#xD;
      having them anticipate moderately painful stimuli that are administered predictably and&#xD;
      unpredictably. The main goal of this study is to assess the affect of alprazolam on the&#xD;
      phasic and sustained enhancement of startle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study comprises two pilot experiments and a main study. Participants in the study will&#xD;
      be screened with a psychiatric history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (EKG), and&#xD;
      blood and urine tests. Participants will four testing sessions separated by 5 to 10 days. At&#xD;
      each session, participants will be given one of two doses of alprazolam, diphenhydramine, or&#xD;
      placebo (an inactive pill). Questionnaires and other tests will be performed.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent breakthroughs in biomedical research have not improved the ability to identify&#xD;
      successful pharmacological treatments derived from novel candidate compounds. This is partly&#xD;
      due to the inability of the existing scientific approach to translate candidate anxiolytics&#xD;
      identified through the drug discovery process into efficient psychopharmacological treatment&#xD;
      of patients. A new drug development approach urgently needs to be implemented to improve&#xD;
      predictability and efficiency in translating the basic science explosion into validated drug&#xD;
      targets. A key approach to improve the selection of candidate anxiolytics for clinical trials&#xD;
      is to fill the gap between animal models and clinical studies in patients by implementing&#xD;
      tests in healthy humans with a predictive validity of subsequent clinical efficacy. As a step&#xD;
      towards this goal, we developed integrative experimental models of fear and anxiety in&#xD;
      non-clinical subjects. We now use these models to identify the anxiolytic and anxiogenic&#xD;
      properties of various compounds. The current specific objectives are to 1) further test the&#xD;
      psychopharmacological validity of the model using recognized anxiolytics (the SSRI&#xD;
      citalopram), 2) test the properties of compounds that are hypothesized to be anxiolytic or&#xD;
      anxiogenic (e.g., oxytocin, arginine vasopressin, hydrocortisone) and 3) examine the time&#xD;
      course of the anxiolytic effect of the benzodiazepine alprazolam on FPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medically and psychiatrically healthy males and females ages 18 to 45.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study examines fear and anxiety elicited by unpleasant electric shock delivered&#xD;
      predictably and unpredictably, respectively. The following drugs will be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Citalopram, 2) oxytocin and arginine vasopressin, 3) hydrocortisone, 4) alprazolam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the startle reflex. Secondary measures include the skin&#xD;
      conductance response, the heart rate, and subjective measures of anxiety.&#xD;
