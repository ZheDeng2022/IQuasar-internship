  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if adjusting the dose of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) has&#xD;
      a better effect on lowering HIV viral load (the amount of HIV in the blood) compared to&#xD;
      taking the standard FDA-approved LPV/r dose. This study will also compare the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of these two types of dosing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antiretroviral drugs may fail to suppress HIV unless there are adequate amounts of those&#xD;
      drugs in the blood. By monitoring the amounts of drugs in the blood and adjusting doses to&#xD;
      achieve optimal drug concentrations, response to antiretroviral drugs may improve, especially&#xD;
      in patients who have failed previous regimens. This study is designed to evaluate drug&#xD;
      monitoring and dose adjustment of protease inhibitors (PIs) in heavily treatment-experienced&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to receive either a standard dose of LPV/r (Arm A) or a&#xD;
      concentration-adjusted dose of LPV/r (Arm B). Concentration-adjusted dosing means that the&#xD;
      dose of ritonavir or lopinavir may be increased based on the amount of lopinavir measured in&#xD;
      the blood and the results of a drug resistance test. All patients start the study taking&#xD;
      LPV/r, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), 0 to 2 additional nucleoside reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and saquinavir (SQV) or amprenavir (APV). Only LPV/r, TDF,&#xD;
      and SQV will be provided by the study. Other medications taken as part of the antiretroviral&#xD;
      regimen must be obtained outside the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Arm A will take the usual approved dose of LPV/r for the first 24 weeks. At Week&#xD;
      24, patients with high viral loads will come to the clinic for a 12-hour LPV blood level&#xD;
      measurement to see if the level of LPV needs to be increased. If it does, an additional&#xD;
      capsule of ritonavir will be added to the regimen to boost the level of LPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in Arm B will have a series of blood draws over a 12-hour period in the clinic,&#xD;
      around 14 days after starting the study, to find out if their LPV level needs to be&#xD;
      increased. If the LPV level needs to be raised, an additional capsule of ritonavir will be&#xD;
      added to the regimen to boost the level of LPV. Patients who had their ritonavir dose&#xD;
      adjusted will return to have another 12-hour blood draw around Week 5. If the LPV level still&#xD;
      needs to be changed, an additional capsule of LPV/r will be added to the regimen. A third&#xD;
      12-hour blood draw will be performed around Week 8 if a second dose adjustment was necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, patients will visit the clinic weekly through Week 6, again at Week 8, then&#xD;
      every 4 weeks thereafter through Week 32. Patients will have blood drawn at certain visits to&#xD;
      test for LPV level, viral load, CD4 count, fasting lipids and glucose, and drug resistance.&#xD;
