  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of an experimental drug called JP-1730 on Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease symptoms and on dyskinesias (involuntary movements) that develop as a result of&#xD;
      long-term treatment with levodopa. JP-1730 affects chemical messengers believed to affect&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 30 and 80 years of age with relatively advanced Parkinson's disease may be&#xD;
      eligible for this 3-phase study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1 - Baseline evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be evaluated with a medical history, physical examination, detailed&#xD;
      neurologic evaluation, routine blood tests, urinalysis and an electrocardiogram. They will&#xD;
      also have a 24-hour holter monitor (heart monitoring) and cardiology consultation. A chest&#xD;
      X-ray and MRI or CT scan of the brain will be done if needed. Patients will, if possible,&#xD;
      stop taking all antiparkinsonian medications except levodopa (Sinemet) for one month before&#xD;
      the study begins and throughout its duration. (If necessary, patients may use short-acting&#xD;
      dopamine agonists, such as Mirapex and Requip.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2 - Dose Finding Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 2 to 3 days, patients will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for a levodopa (a&#xD;
      dopamine agonist) dose-finding procedure. For this procedure, patients stop taking Sinemet&#xD;
      and instead have levodopa, and subsequently apomorphine, infused through a vein. During the&#xD;
      infusions, the drug dose is increased slowly until either 1) parkinsonian symptoms improve,&#xD;
      2) unacceptable side effects occur, or 3) the maximum study dose is reached. Symptoms are&#xD;
      monitored frequently to find the optimal dose. (Patients who have had dosing infusions in the&#xD;
      last 3 months will not have to undergo this phase of the study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 3 - Active Study Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 3 months of the dose-finding phase, treatment will begin. Patients will receive seven&#xD;
      doses of JD-1730 or placebo (an inactive substance) via puffs from an oral spray together&#xD;
      with levodopa infusions over a 3-week period. The doses are given on days 1, 2, and 3 of the&#xD;
      first week and then approximately twice a week for the next 2 weeks. For these doses,&#xD;
      patients are hospitalized 4 days the first week and 2 days each for the next 2 weeks. All&#xD;
      participants will receive placebo at some time during the study, and a few patients, selected&#xD;
      at random, will receive only placebo the entire 3 weeks. The procedure for the infusions is&#xD;
      the same as that for the dose-finding phase, with frequent evaluation of symptoms. Also,&#xD;
      small blood samples are drawn up to three times each study day. At the end of the third week,&#xD;
      patients will be discharged from the hospital. Their anti-parkinsonian medications may be&#xD;
      readjusted, as needed. Patients will be contacted 2 weeks after the end of the study for a&#xD;
      check on side effects and, if necessary, will be scheduled for a follow-up evaluation at the&#xD;
      clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the above procedures, patients will be asked to have an optional lumbar a&#xD;
      puncture (spinal tap) on the first and last days of the study to measure various brain&#xD;
      chemicals and drug levels that cannot be measured in blood and urine. For this procedure, a&#xD;
      local anesthetic is given and a needle is inserted in the space between the bones (vertebrae)&#xD;
      in the lower back. About 2 tablespoons of fluid is collected through the needle.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of selective alpha-2 adrenergic&#xD;
      receptor antagonism on the severity of parkinsonian signs and dopaminomimetic drug-associated&#xD;
      motor response complications in patients with mild to moderately advanced Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease. In a controlled proof-of-principle clinical study, the acute efficacy of JP-1730&#xD;
      will be assessed through the use of validated motor function scales. Safety will be monitored&#xD;
      by means of frequent clinical evaluations and laboratory tests.&#xD;
