      A study for patients who have failed standard therapy. If there is no dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicities the patients will receive further cycles of therapy if there is no evidence of&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;

      This is a non-randomized, open-label, Phase I study. A modified Fibonacci dose escalation&#xD;
      will be used to determine the MTD for subsequent Phase II trials. Study duration is expected&#xD;
      to be 12 to 18 months. Patients with a histological or cytological diagnosis of a solid tumor&#xD;
      who have failed standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists are enrolled. If&#xD;
      there is no dose limiting toxicities and if patients meet the inclusion criteria and have&#xD;
      none of the exclusion criteria of the protocol, they will receive further cycles of therapy&#xD;
      if there is no evidence of disease progression.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult patients at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have an advanced solid tumor that has failed standard therapy or for&#xD;
             which no standard therapy exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological or cytological diagnosis of a malignant solid tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable or non-measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or major surgery at least 4 weeks prior to study entry&#xD;
             (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C). Patients must have recovered from the toxic&#xD;
             effects of any prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status index greater than or equal to 80.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have adequate organ and immune system function according to the study design,&#xD;
             obtained less than or equal to 7-days prior to treatment with NM-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 7 days of study enrollment. Men and women with reproductive potential must use&#xD;
             an effective contraceptive method while enrolled in this study and for 3 months after&#xD;
             the patient has completed study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be able to swallow.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known sensitivity to study drug or its analogs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any investigational therapy within the preceding 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with active gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration, unhealed wounds or&#xD;
             active thrombosis.&#xD;

          -  Patients with a total accumulated doxorubicin or equivalent dose over 450 mg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with more than 1 risk factor, where a risk factor is defined as any one of&#xD;
             the following (1-7):1. prior anthracyclines larger than 300 mg/m2 doxorubicin&#xD;
             equivalent.2.mediastinum/left breast irradiation. 3.history of arterial hypertension&#xD;
             (systolic blood pressure greater than 140 or diastolic blood pressure greater than 90,&#xD;
             or receiving anti-hypertensive treatment).4. obesity (body mass index (BMI)[30]).5.&#xD;
