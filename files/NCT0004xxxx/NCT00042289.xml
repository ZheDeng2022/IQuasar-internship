  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of antiretroviral (ARV)&#xD;
      and tuberculosis (TB) medications in pregnant women and their infants. (Pharmacokinetics are&#xD;
      the various interactions between a drug and the body.) This study will also evaluate the PKs&#xD;
      of certain ARVs in postpartum women before and after starting hormonal contraceptives. The&#xD;
      PKs of these drugs will be evaluated by measuring the amount of medicine present in blood&#xD;
      and/or vaginal secretions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women experience unique physiological changes that may result in clinically&#xD;
      significant alterations in drug PKs. Unfortunately, there have been few clinical trials to&#xD;
      study the PKs of ARV, TB, and hormonal contraceptive drugs in pregnant women. The development&#xD;
      of appropriate dosing regimens for the HIV-infected pregnant woman is critical to the health&#xD;
      of both mother and fetus. Overdosing may lead to maternal adverse events and increased risk&#xD;
      of fetal toxicity, while underdosing may lead to inadequate virologic control, increased risk&#xD;
      of developing drug resistance mutations, and a higher rate of perinatal HIV transmission.&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the PKs of ARVs used during pregnancy; evaluate TB drugs used during&#xD;
      pregnancy, both in women who are HIV-positive and also taking ARVs and in women who are&#xD;
      HIV-negative and not taking ARVs; and evaluate the PKs of hormonal contraceptive medications&#xD;
      taken along with ARVs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be five main groups of study arms: HIV-infected pregnant women taking ARVs without&#xD;
      TB treatment, HIV-infected pregnant women taking ARVs with first-line TB treatment,&#xD;
      HIV-uninfected pregnant women taking no ARVs with first-line TB treatment, HIV-infected and&#xD;
      HIV-uninfected pregnant women with or without ARVs with second-line TB treatment for&#xD;
      drug-resistant TB, and HIV-infected postpartum women taking ARVs and hormonal contraceptives.&#xD;
      Participants will not receive medications through this study-they will continue on ARV, TB,&#xD;
      and/or contraceptive medications prescribed by their health care providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who are 20 0/7 weeks to 37 6/7 weeks pregnant will be enrolled in this study and will&#xD;
      remain in the study for up to 12 weeks after delivery. Postpartum women will be enrolled at 2&#xD;
      to 12 weeks after delivery and followed until 6 to 7 weeks after starting contraceptives.&#xD;
      Infants will be followed for 16 to 24 weeks of life. At all study visits, participants will&#xD;
      undergo a medical history, a physical exam, and blood collection. At some visits, women in&#xD;
      some arms will undergo a vaginal swab. Blood collection from the mother and the detached&#xD;
      umbilical cord will occur during delivery. Intensive PK sampling will be performed at study&#xD;
      visits during the second and third trimester of pregnancy and/or postpartum, depending on the&#xD;
      study arm. Additional study visits may occur depending on the ARV drug regimen prescribed.&#xD;
