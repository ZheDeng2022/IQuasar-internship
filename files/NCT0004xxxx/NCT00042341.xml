  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clofarabine (injection) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the&#xD;
      treatment of pediatric patients 1 to 21 years old with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia&#xD;
      (ALL) who have had at least 2 prior treatment regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Clofarabine is safe and effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL.)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open label, Phase II study of Clofarabine in pediatric patients&#xD;
      with refractory or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Eligible patients must be in&#xD;
      second or subsequent relapse or be refractory. Forty eligible patients will be enrolled in a&#xD;
      Fleming 2-stage sequential study design in order to better assess the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      clofarabine in this patient population.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a diagnosis of ALL according to FAB classification with greater than or equal to&#xD;
             25% blasts in the bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be less than or equal to 21 years old at time of initial diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Not be eligible for therapy of higher curative potential, and must be in second or&#xD;
             subsequent relapse and/or refractory. Where an alternative therapy has been shown to&#xD;
             prolong survival in an analogous population, this should be offered to the patient&#xD;
             prior to discussing this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of &gt;70.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Provide signed, written informed consent from parent or guardian and assent from&#xD;
             patients greater than or equal to 7 years old according to local IRB and institutional&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be able to comply with study procedures and follow-up examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have adequate organ function as indicated by the following laboratory values, obtained&#xD;
             within 2 weeks prior to registration: Serum bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN;&#xD;
             AST and ALT less than or equal to 5 x ULN; Serum Creatinine less than 2 x ULN for age.&#xD;
             ULN= Institutional Upper Limit of Normal&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received previous treatment with Clofarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had a recent (&lt;30 days) history of fungal or serious bacterial infection or who&#xD;
             are receiving therapeutic antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are pregnant or lactating. Male and female patients who are fertile must agree to use&#xD;
             an effective means of birth control (i.e., latex condom, diaphragm, cervical cap, etc)&#xD;
             to avoid pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have psychiatric disorders that would interfere with consent, study participation, or&#xD;
             follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are receiving any other chemotherapy. Patients must have been off previous therapy for&#xD;
             at least 2 weeks (with the exception of intrathecal therapy, which is allowed up to&#xD;
             24hrs prior to 1st of study drug) and must have recovered from acute toxicity of all&#xD;
             previous therapy prior to enrollment. Treatment may start earlier, following&#xD;
             consultation with the ILEX Medical Monitor, if there is evidence of disease relapse&#xD;
             prior to that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any other severe concurrent disease, or have a history of serious organ&#xD;
             dysfunction or disease involving the heart, kidney, liver or pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have symptomatic CNS involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Febrile neutropenia at time of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received a hematologic stem cell transplant (HSCT) within the previous 3 months&#xD;
             or have active GVHD (greater than or equal to Grade 2).&#xD;
