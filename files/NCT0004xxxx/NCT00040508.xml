    <textblock>
      This study will determine the safety and effectiveness of sirolimus (RapamuneÂ® (Registered&#xD;
      Trademark)) in treating focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a disease involving kidney&#xD;
      scarring and increased protein in the urine. About one-half of patients with FSGS go on to&#xD;
      develop end-stage kidney disease within 6 years, requiring dialysis or kidney transplant.&#xD;
      Therapies to reduce urine protein are likely to stop the progression of renal scarring and&#xD;
      reduce the chance of developing kidney failure. However, current treatments for FSGS, such as&#xD;
      prednisone, cyclophosphamide, and cyclosporine, are not effective in many patients and can&#xD;
      cause serious side effects. This study will see if sirolimus, a drug with both anti-scarring&#xD;
      and immune suppressing properties, can lower the amount of protein in the urine and slow or&#xD;
      stop the kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 13 years of age and older with FSGS who have had at least one standard treatment for&#xD;
      FSGS may be eligible for this 24-month study. Pregnant and nursing women may not participate.&#xD;
      Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, review of&#xD;
      medical records and kidney biopsy, 24-hour urine collection, and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take sirolimus tablets once a day for 1 year. Three 24-hour urine&#xD;
      collections will be done before starting treatment. Blood will be drawn to measure drug&#xD;
      levels every week for the first month after starting treatment, then every other week for 1&#xD;
      month, and then every 2 months until treatment stops. Patients who do not have a complete&#xD;
      response to the drug at low levels will have their dose increased. Patients will be seen at&#xD;
      the NIH clinic in Bethesda, Md., for the screening visit and then at 1, 4, 8, 12, and 15&#xD;
      months for blood and urine tests. Additional urine collections and blood tests will be done&#xD;
      periodically throughout the 24-month study period by the patient's local physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients whose urine protein decreases on therapy will be asked to wait 3 months before&#xD;
      starting another treatment and will monitored during that time to determine if the response&#xD;
      is sustained. Patients whose urine protein levels do not decrease with sirolimus will not be&#xD;
      asked to wait 3 months before starting another therapy. Follow-up with the local physician&#xD;
      will continue at 18 and 24 months after starting the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients whose urine protein levels increase with sirolimus treatment will be taken off the&#xD;
      study and may seek other treatment at any time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Sirolimus is an immunosuppressive agent that was recently approved for use in organ&#xD;
      transplantation. We propose to carry out a pilot study whose objectives are to determine the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy profile of sirolimus in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).&#xD;
      Current therapy for FSGS has limited efficacy. Sirolimus was selected for the following&#xD;
      reasons: 1) sirolimus reduces proliferation of mesangial cells and endothelial cells, 2)&#xD;
      sirolimus reduces fibrosis in experimental models of liver and kidney disease, 3) sirolimus&#xD;
      is a potent immunosuppressive, and other immunosuppressives including glucocorticoids and&#xD;
      cyclosporine have shown some efficacy in FSGS, and 4) sirolimus may have a direct&#xD;
      anti-proteinuric effect, as suggested by in vitro studies. We will recruit up to 30 patients,&#xD;
      including adults and children greater than or equal to 13.0 years of age. The study design is&#xD;
      open label, with therapy for one year using doses adjusted to achieve trough levels of 5-15&#xD;
      ng/mL during the first 4 months and if a complete remission is not achieved and sustained,&#xD;
      10-20 ng/mL during the remainder of the study. The primary outcome will be reduction in&#xD;
      proteinuria, categorized as complete remission and partial remission, comparing baseline&#xD;
      values and 12 month values. The study will recruit patients in two groups: 1) a drug washout&#xD;
      group, for patients who can tolerate receiving no immunosuppressive therapy for 4 weeks prior&#xD;
      to initiating sirolimus therapy, and 2) a drug overlap group, for patients who cannot&#xD;
      tolerate cessation of immunosuppressive therapy due to severe edema or other complications of&#xD;
      nephrotic syndrome; these patients will receive prednisone for up to 6 months while taking&#xD;
      sirolimus (with a target of prednisone less than 20 mg QOD by month 3) or will receive&#xD;
      cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or mycophenolate mofetil for up to 4 weeks while initiating&#xD;
      sirolimus therapy.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Renal biopsy showing FSGS, including all variants with the exception of HIV-associated&#xD;
        FSGS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Nephrotic range proteinuria, defined as 24 hour urine protein excretion greater than or&#xD;
        equal to 3.5 g/d in adults and children weighing greater than or equal to 70 kg and greater&#xD;
        than or equal to 50 mg/kg in adults or children weighing less than 70 kg. Proteinuria will&#xD;
        be assessed with at least three 24 hour urine collections obtained during the baseline&#xD;
        period (for these collections, there is no minimum period, the maximum period is 3 months&#xD;
        prior to study entry, and the most recent must be within 1 month of entry). These&#xD;
        measurements will be obtained while on angiotensin antagonist therapy (if tolerant of this&#xD;
        medication) and will exclude urine collections judged inadequate based on creatinine&#xD;
        appearance. For patients in the drug overlap group, baseline proteinuria will be determined&#xD;
        from patient's records demonstrating on at least one urine collection, proteinuria greater&#xD;
        than 3.5 g/d while off immunosuppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ability and willingness to provide informed consent (adults greater than or equal to 18.0&#xD;
        years) or assent (children greater than or equal to 13.0 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Completion of a therapeutic trial of at least one of the following, without sustained CR:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Steroid therapy for greater than or equal to 8 weeks, either daily or alternate day or&#xD;
        intermittent (oral or parenteral)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cyclosporine or tacrolimus or mycophenolate mofetil for greater than or equal to 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cyclophosphamide (either oral or intravenous) or chlorambucil for greater than or equal to&#xD;
        three months&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Intolerance to sirolimus or prior use of sirolimus for FSGS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Estimated GFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73m(2). The rational is that 1) sirolimus therapy is&#xD;
        most likely to be beneficial during the early phase of FSGS, before progressive fibrosis in&#xD;
        the glomeruli and interstitium has become the dominant abnormality and may be irreversible,&#xD;
        and 2) we wish to enroll patients who are unlikely to progress to ESRD within the one year&#xD;
        treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients following renal transplant. We wish to rest sirolimus with a minimum of other&#xD;
        immunosuppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children less than 13.0 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Uncontrolled hypertension, defined as BP greater than 140/90 on greater than 25% of&#xD;
        measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy, lactation, or unwillingness or inability to practice effective contraception.&#xD;
        The rationale is that the safety of sirolimus in pregnancy has not been determined and&#xD;
        excretion via breast milk may alter pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Chronic active infections requiring treatment, including untreated reactive PPD, or any&#xD;
        infection sufficiently severe require parenteral antibiotics during the preceding 30 days.&#xD;
        The rationale is that immunosuppression may exacerbate infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIV-1 infection or hepatitis B infection or hepatitis C infection (defined as detectable&#xD;
        RNA off anti-viral therapy). The rationale is that immunosuppression may exacerbate&#xD;
        infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Chronic liver disease sufficiently severe to impair sirolimus metabolism; this would&#xD;
        include prolonged pro-thrombin time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Basal thrombocytopenia less than 100,000 cells/microliter or absolute neutrophil count less&#xD;
        than 2000 cells/microliter or hematocrit less than 30. The rationale is that sirolimus may&#xD;
        further lower cell counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cancer diagnosis or cancer recurrence within the preceding 5 years, excluding basal cell&#xD;
        carcinoma of the skin. The rationale is that cancer progression may be accelerated by&#xD;
        immunosuppression.&#xD;
