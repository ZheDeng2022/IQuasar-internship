        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have given their signed informed consent.&#xD;

             sterile, post-menopausal, or using an accepted method of birth control (i.e., oral&#xD;
             contraceptives, intrauterine device, Norplant® system, Depo Provera®, or a spermicide&#xD;
             and condom). Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test and be advised not to become pregnant during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 1 year history of NIDDM and performing home blood glucose monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have BMI of &gt; 26 to &lt; 42 kg/m2 at baseline (week 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have HbA1C &gt; 7.5% but &lt; 9.5% at screen (week -4).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have evidence of insulin secretory capacity (fasting C-peptide&#xD;
             concentration &gt; or equal to 0.27 nmol/l during the stabilization period).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have FPG &gt; 130 mg/dl but &lt; 235 mg/dl prior to (within 48-72 hours)&#xD;
             randomization at Visit 1 Week 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be receiving as their current diabetic therapy stable doses of metformin&#xD;
             (at dose of 1.0-2.5gm/day), or metformin extended release at a maximum dose of 2&#xD;
             gm/day and a half maximum to a maximum dose of thiazolidinedione for at least 3&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to understand and willing to adhere to and be compliant with the&#xD;
             study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who require insulin therapy or are currently on other sulfonylureas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to sulfonylureas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with past history of severe hypoglycemia reaction on their current&#xD;
             antidiabetic therapy requiring medical attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of acute metabolic complications such as hyperosmolar coma or&#xD;
             ketonuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically significant abnormal baseline laboratory values (hematology,&#xD;
             blood chemistry or urinalysis) which define a disease or condition, which in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator may either put the patient at risk because of&#xD;
             participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study, or the&#xD;
             patient's ability to participate and complete the study. Should there be a laboratory&#xD;
             value which, upon initial screening, is substantially outside the normal range, the&#xD;
             test should be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who had an increase in their thiazolidinedione medication within 2 months of&#xD;
             entering the study (Visit 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who had an increase in the metformin medication within 1 month of entering&#xD;
             the study (Visit 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose body weight has changed more than 2% for patients &lt; 250 pounds or 3%&#xD;
             for patients &gt;= 250 pounds, during the 4 week stabilization period when compared to&#xD;
             the weight at the screening visit 0 (week - 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with acute infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received any drug (i.e. a chemotherapy agent) with a well-defined&#xD;
             potential for toxicity to a major organ system during the three months prior to the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically significant renal or hepatic disease (i.e. ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper&#xD;
             limit of normal) or gastrointestinal disorders that may interfere with absorption of&#xD;
             the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are allergic to sulfonamides and excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any history of alcohol or drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating females will be excluded.&#xD;

             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have participated in any investigational study within 30 days prior to&#xD;
             Visit 0.&#xD;
