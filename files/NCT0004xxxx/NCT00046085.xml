      This study evaluated the benefits of providing relatives of patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      schizophrenia the opportunity to interact with each other using the Internet. It was&#xD;
      hypothesized that patients whose relatives had access to the internet intervention would have&#xD;
      reduced symptoms and greater community tenure, compared to their counterparts who did not&#xD;
      have relative access to the internet education and support program. We also collected&#xD;
      information on how frequently the relatives used the website and how well they liked its&#xD;
      features.&#xD;

      Although psychoeducational programs for schizophrenia can reduce patient relapse rates and&#xD;
      reduce family distress, participation rates are often low. This study evaluated an online&#xD;
      model to provide the families of schizophrenia patients with knowledge of illness management&#xD;
      to reduce family burden and increase perceived social support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relatives of patients with schizophrenia who received 12 months of customary care with access&#xD;
      to the educational website for the first year were compared to matched group of relatives of&#xD;
      individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia who were receiving customary care and who consented&#xD;
      to participate in a family education program. In the education condition, relatives were&#xD;
      provided with private, secure access to the website, which features family-to-family chat&#xD;
      capabilities, video lectures on the management of schizophrenia, written materials on&#xD;
      important issues in schizophrenia management, professionally facilitated online discussions&#xD;
      of the material, and additional resource links.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relatives were assessed using 90-minute interviews at the beginning of the project and every&#xD;
      6 months for 12 months. The interviews were used to assess the family member's perception of&#xD;
      the patient's symptoms, his or her knowledge of the illness, the illness's impact on the&#xD;
      family member, and his or her perception of the website intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were also asked to complete&#xD;
      interviews and assessments at the beginning of the project and every 6 months for 12 months.&#xD;
      The assessments include questions about symptoms, medication compliance and side effects,&#xD;
      hospitalizations, and social functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major hypotheses were that relative participation in the online program would be&#xD;
      associated with lower symptoms rates and hospitalizations in the patients.&#xD;
