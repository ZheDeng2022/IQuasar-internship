    <textblock>
      Anxiety in children of parents with major depressive disorder (MDD) poses a particularly high&#xD;
      risk for later-life MDD. In adults, MDD involves dysfunction in prefrontal brain regions that&#xD;
      regulate attention to emotional stimuli. These abnormalities: i) have been found primarily in&#xD;
      adults with specific familial forms of MDD; ii) persist after recovery from MDD, and iii)&#xD;
      relate to anxiety. These findings raise the possibility that risk for MDD is tied to&#xD;
      dysfunction in prefrontal regions involved in regulation of emotion, which possibly manifests&#xD;
      as early-life anxiety. If this possibility were confirmed in never-depressed adolescents at&#xD;
      high risk for MDD, the findings would provide key insights into the developmental&#xD;
      neurobiology of MDD. The goal of this protocol is to study the neural substrate of risk for&#xD;
      MDD in young people. This protocol tests the hypothesis that adolescents at high risk for MDD&#xD;
      by virtue of childhood anxiety and parental history of MDD exhibit dysfunction in prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex and amygdala, regions involved in emotion regulation. This goal will be accomplished&#xD;
      through fMRI studies of emotion regulation in high and low-risk adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this research, at-risk adolescents will be recruited from participants in an NIMH-funded&#xD;
      extramural study at New York University (NYU) examining the biology of risk for anxiety and&#xD;
      depressive disorders. Over a three-year period, 45 high-risk probands and 60 low-risk&#xD;
      comparisons will be studied, including 20 comparisons from the NYU sample and 40 from the&#xD;
      Washington DC metropolitan area. In the present protocol, to be conducted at NIH, subjects&#xD;
      will undergo volumetric MRI scans to assess structural abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      and medial temporal lobe. They will complete a series of four out-of-scanner cognitive tasks&#xD;
      and two fMRI-based cognitive tasks that measure modulation of attention to emotional stimuli.&#xD;
      The fMRI tasks are hypothesized to differentially engage the prefrontal cortex and amygdala&#xD;
      in low vs. high risk subjects. These tasks will be used to test the hypothesis that at-risk&#xD;
      individuals exhibit enhanced amygdala and reduced prefrontal activation on the fMRI&#xD;
      emotion/attention tasks.&#xD;

      Parental history of major depressive disorder poses a particularly high risk for later-life&#xD;
      MDD. In adults, MDD involves dysfunction in subcortical brain regions related to emotional&#xD;
      responsiveness, such as the amygdala, and in cortical brain regions that interface cognitive&#xD;
      and emotional processes. These abnormalities: i) have been found primarily in adults with&#xD;
      specific familial forms of MDD; ii) persist after recovery from MDD, and iii) relate to&#xD;
      anxiety. These findings raise the possibility that risk for MDD is tied to dysfunction in&#xD;
      emotional circuits themselves or in prefrontal regions involved in regulation of emotion. If&#xD;
      this possibility were confirmed in never-depressed adolescents at high risk for MDD, the&#xD;
      findings would provide key insights into the developmental neurobiology of MDD. The goal of&#xD;
      this protocol is to study the neural substrate of risk for MDD in young people. This protocol&#xD;
      tests the hypothesis that adolescents at high risk for MDD by virtue of parental history of&#xD;
      MDD exhibit dysfunction in prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and other subcortical regions&#xD;
      involved in emotion and emotion regulation. This goal will be accomplished through fMRI&#xD;
      studies of edmotion provocation in high and low-risk adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this research, at-risk adolescents will be recruited from participants in NIMH-funded&#xD;
      extramural studies at New York University, Brown University, and Columbia University&#xD;
      examining the biology of risk for anxiety and depressive disorders. Over a three-year period,&#xD;
      data on each measure of interest will be obtained in 100 high-risk probands and 100 low-risk&#xD;
      comparisons. In addition, a sub-set of parents of these adolescents (n=100) also will be&#xD;
      studied using identical procedures. In the present protocol, to be conducted at NIH, subjects&#xD;
      will undergo volumetric MRI scans to assess structural abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      and medial temporal lobe. They will complete a series of out-of-scanner cognitive tasks and&#xD;
      fMRI-based cognitive tasks. Two of these tasks measure modulation of attention to emotional&#xD;
      stimuli; the third task measures engagement of temporal and prefrontal regions during social&#xD;
      interactions. For these types of tasks, prior studies in adolescents with ongoing mood and&#xD;
      anxiety disorders demonstrate hypothesized abnormalities in brain engagement. The current&#xD;
      study is designed to examine the degree to which comparable findings emerge in unaffected&#xD;
      adolescents at risk for mood and anxiety disorders.&#xD;
