  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis is a disease that may be caused by the immune system reacting against the&#xD;
      nervous system. It is possible, that by changing the immune system we can modify the&#xD;
      progression of this disease. In this study, we will try to learn whether treatment with a&#xD;
      bone marrow transplant (BMT) can help patients with multiple sclerosis. We will also try to&#xD;
      learn what the side effects are of this treatment in patients with multiple sclerosis.&#xD;

      To participate in this study, patients will need to have a central line (a thin plastic&#xD;
      catheter or tube that is placed during surgery into one of the large veins in the neck or&#xD;
      chest). Central lines are used to give intravenous medications or to draw blood. Before the&#xD;
      transplant we will test the patients blood for viruses which can cause problems after the&#xD;
      transplant. These viruses include Hepatitis B, which causes liver damage, cytomegalovirus,&#xD;
      which causes lung disease and HIV which causes AIDS. If a patient is positive for the AIDS&#xD;
      virus, they will not be able to undertake the transplant. In addition to these blood tests&#xD;
      patients will also have an MRI (where pictures are created using magnetic rather than x-ray&#xD;
      energy) of the brain and other evaluations that are standard for any patient before having a&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the transplant patients will receive daily G-CSF (Neupogen). This medicine will help&#xD;
      to stimulate the production of white blood cells (WBC) that will be used for the bone marrow&#xD;
      transplant. In addition, 6 tablespoons of blood will be collected to look at how the immune&#xD;
      system is functioning before and after transplant. After the white blood cells have reached a&#xD;
      certain level, patients will undergo leukapheresis. Leukapheresis is a procedure where blood&#xD;
      is removed from a patients arm, pumped into a machine where the white blood cells are&#xD;
      separated from most of the other cells, then returned to the patient through the same needle&#xD;
      or through a needle in the other arm. After collection of the white blood cells, we will use&#xD;
      a device in the lab to select out certain types of white blood cells (CD34+).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After leukapheresis, patients will receive an antibody from horses called Atgam (ATG) to help&#xD;
      destroy the immune system and also a drug called cyclophosphamide. After this, radiation&#xD;
      treatment will be given to the entire body. This will be done 2 times a day for 3 days. This&#xD;
      treatment will kill most of the blood-forming cells in the bone marrow. We will then give the&#xD;
      CD34+ white blood cells that were collected during leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be collected for immune reconstitution studies monthly for 3 months and at 6, 9,&#xD;
      and 12 months after transplant to look at how the immune system is functioning. The amount of&#xD;
      blood taken will be no more than 90ml (6 tablespoons). After the first year of treatment&#xD;
      patients will continue to have 90ml (6 tablespoons) of blood taken for immune reconstitution&#xD;
      studies every 6 months for 2 more years.&#xD;

        Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The diagnosis of primary or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis or&#xD;
             relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Patients with relapsing/remitting MS should&#xD;
             demonstrate sustained accumulated disability based upon accepted standard.&#xD;
             Relapsing/remitting MS is characterized by unpredictable recurrent attacks of&#xD;
             neurologic dysfunction followed by complete, partial or no recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  By the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) the measure of disability equals or&#xD;
             exceeds 5.0 but does not exceed 7.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For primary or secondary progressive MS, the progression of disease using EDSS&#xD;
             criteria during the proceeding 12 months equals or exceeds 1.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptoms and manifestations of MS activity have not responded to conventional&#xD;
             treatment, e.g. high dose prednisone, beta interferon, conventional dose cytoxan,&#xD;
             glatiramer acetate etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
