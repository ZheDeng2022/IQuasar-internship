    <textblock>
      Liposome Encapsulated SN38 (LE-SN38) is an oncology drug product consisting of the active&#xD;
      metabolite of irinotecan (CPT-11), a known anticancer drug, encapsulated in a liposome.&#xD;
      Formulation of a relatively insoluble compound (SN38) and improvement in drug delivery&#xD;
      (pharmacodynamic profile) may be obtained with liposomal formulations. An improved safety and&#xD;
      efficacy profile, compared with the pro-drug CPT-11, may be possible. This rationale is&#xD;
      supported by the results from animal toxicity studies in both the mouse and dog.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LE-SN38 will be infused intravenously every 3 weeks to assess safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      study drug until there is disease progression or toxicity requiring early treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation. Disease status will be assessed after every second cycle of treatment. In&#xD;
      the event of disease progression, study treatment will be discontinued, all end-of-treatment&#xD;
      study evaluations will be performed and further treatment options will be reviewed.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of LE-SN38.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of SN38 following IV administration of LE-SN38.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Observe any anti-tumor effects of LE-SN38.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label study in patients with advanced solid tumors who have failed&#xD;
      conventional therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LE-SN38 will be administered IV over 90 minutes. At least three patients will be studied at&#xD;
      each dose level and at least three patients will complete one 21-day course before any&#xD;
      patient is enrolled at the next dose level. Study drug administration will continue on an&#xD;
      every 21-day schedule in the absence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. A&#xD;
      subsequent course of treatment may be administered at least 21 days after receiving a prior&#xD;
      dose of LE-SN38 when study criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3 patients per dose level will be studied. This will be expanded to 6 if a DLT&#xD;
      occurs, followed by a total of 6 patients at a possible MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease status will be assessed after every second cycle. In the event of disease&#xD;
      progression, study treatment will be discontinued and all end of treatment study evaluations&#xD;
      will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 40 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
