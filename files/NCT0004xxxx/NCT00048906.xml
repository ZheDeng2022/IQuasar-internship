      This study will determine the safety of the drug Replagal or treating patients with Fabry&#xD;
      disease, an inherited metabolic disorder. In this disease, an enzyme called&#xD;
      Alpha-galactosidase A, which normally breaks down a fatty substance called&#xD;
      globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), is missing or does not function properly. The resulting&#xD;
      accumulation of Gb3 causes problems with the kidneys, heart, nerves, and blood vessels.&#xD;
      Replagal is a genetically engineered form of Alpha-galactosidase A. Previous studies have&#xD;
      shown that patients with Fabry disease who had not progressed to end-stage kidney failure&#xD;
      tolerated Replagal replacement therapy well. This study will examine the effects of the drug&#xD;
      in patients with kidney problems associated with Fabry disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Fabry disease who are on kidney dialysis, or have had a kidney transplant, may&#xD;
      be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this 6 to 12-month study, participants will receive a 40-minute intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      infusion of Replagal every other week, with close monitoring during and after the infusions.&#xD;
      Before the first infusion, patients will be evaluated with a medical history, physical and&#xD;
      neurological examinations, electrocardiogram (ECG), routine blood and urine tests, kidney&#xD;
      test, and measurements of height, weight, and vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, breathing&#xD;
      rate, temperature). In addition, they will have pharmacokinetic studies immediately before&#xD;
      and following the first infusion of Replagal. For these studies, blood samples of less than a&#xD;
      teaspoon each will be drawn to measure the level of Replagal enzyme activity. The samples&#xD;
      will be collected at the following time points: immediately before the infusion; 20 minutes&#xD;
      into the infusion; at the end of the infusion; after the infusion at 50, 60, and 90 minutes,&#xD;
      and 2, 3, 4, and 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluations will be done once a week for the first month and then once a month for the&#xD;
      rest of the study period. These evaluations include a physical examination, measurement of&#xD;
      vital signs, electrocardiogram, routine blood and urine tests, and kidney testing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this clinical trial are to study the effects of a range of renal function&#xD;
      on the safety and pharmacokinetics of Replagal enzyme replacement therapy in patients with&#xD;
      Fabry Disease. Patients with clinical and genetic or biochemical evidence of Fabry Disease&#xD;
      will be selected for this clinical trial. Sixty (60) patients will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      clinical trial. Enrollment will be stratified based on baseline renal function as per FDA&#xD;
      guidelines. This is an open label clinical study. Baseline evaluations will be conducted over&#xD;
      an approximately 3 day period. Patients will receive intravenous (IV) infusions of Replagal&#xD;
      at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/dose every 2 weeks. Pharmacokinetic studies will be performed with the&#xD;
      first administered dose. The safety evaluations for patients in this study will include vital&#xD;
      signs, physical examinations, adverse event (AE) assessments, electrocardiograms (ECG), and a&#xD;
      battery of laboratory tests including measurement of anti-Replagal antibodies. An overview of&#xD;
      the study appears in Appendix A.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA - Patient has Fabry Disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient is a male hemizygote, age 18 or above, with evidence of Fabry Disease, defined as&#xD;
        Alpha-galactosidase A enzyme deficiency. Alpha-galactosidase A deficiency is defined as a&#xD;
        plasma or serum enzyme level less than 1.2 nmoles/hr/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        or&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient is a heterozygous carrier female, aged 18 or above, with evidence of Fabry Disease&#xD;
        defined as a mutation in the Alpha-galactosidase A gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient has clinical evidence of Fabry Disease. For patients with compromised renal&#xD;
        function or a history of renal transplant as a result of Fabry Disease, the renal disease&#xD;
        must be consistent with Fabry Disease. For other patients, clinical evidence is defined as&#xD;
        at least one (1) of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        neurologic disease (neuropathic pain)&#xD;
&#xD;
        cardiac disease (cadiomyopathy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        cerebrovascular disease (history of stroke)&#xD;
&#xD;
        dermatologic disease (angiokeratomas)&#xD;
&#xD;
        gastrointestinal disease (malabsorption and weight loss).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient is not eligible for an ongoing TKT sponsored placebo-controlled clinical trial that&#xD;
        is accruing patients. The selection criteria for ongoing Study TKT010 appear in Appendix D.&#xD;
        If another TKT sponsored placebo-controlled clinical trial is initiated during this study,&#xD;
        the selection criteria for that study will be appended to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient has a disease other than Fabry that is the cause of the patient's renal dysfunction&#xD;
        (for example, diabetes or hypertension).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient has received another investigational therapeutic agent for Fabry Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient has received a renal transplant as a result of renal dysfunction caused by a&#xD;
        disease other than Fabry Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient is unable to comply with the protocol, eg, is uncooperative with protocol schedule,&#xD;
        refuses to agree to all of the study procedures, is unable to return for safety&#xD;
        evaluations, or is otherwise unlikely to complete the study as determined by the&#xD;
        investigator or the medical monitor.&#xD;
