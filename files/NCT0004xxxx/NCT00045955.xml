    <textblock>
      The incidence of respiratory allergy in the US has increased gradually over the past several&#xD;
      years, and current estimates suggest that allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma affect&#xD;
      approximately 20% and 5% of the population, respectively. Rhinitis and asthma frequently&#xD;
      coexist, and large-scale population surveys indicate that up to 38% of subjects with rhinitis&#xD;
      have asthma, and up to 78% of subjects with asthma have chronic nasal symptoms. Safety&#xD;
      concerns with the increased use of inhaled corticosteroids, the heterogeneity of the disease,&#xD;
      and poor compliance with asthma medication regimens, point to the need for the development of&#xD;
      safe and convenient oral therapies for asthma. Oral leukotriene receptor antagonists (eg&#xD;
      montelukast) are the latest class of inflammation-modulating asthma drugs and appear to cause&#xD;
      fewer long-term side effects than systemic corticosteroids and reduce the need for&#xD;
      shorter-acting bronchodilator reliever medicines. However variability in response between&#xD;
      patients has been observed and clinical experience with these agents is still limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histamine is an important chemical mediator of inflammation in asthma. The benefits of&#xD;
      antihistamine treatment in patients with mild to moderate asthma have been well documented,&#xD;
      however their clinical use has been previously limited due to the high doses required for&#xD;
      efficacy and their associated side effects including sedation and cognitive impairment.&#xD;
      Recent evidence indicates that in addition to H1-receptor antagonism, some of the newer&#xD;
      nonsedating, non-impairing antihistamines appear to possess various anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties at concentrations achieved at therapeutic dosages suggesting an additional benefit&#xD;
      of these drugs in the management of allergic diseases and asthma. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to assess the long-term safety performance of fexofenadine compared to montelukast in&#xD;
      subjects with asthma.&#xD;
