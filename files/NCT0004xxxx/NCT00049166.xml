  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining erlotinib with radiation therapy with&#xD;
      or without cisplatin in treating patients who have advanced mouth or throat cancer. Erlotinib&#xD;
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth.&#xD;
      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy&#xD;
      use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining&#xD;
      erlotinib with radiation therapy with or without cisplatin may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determination of the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of daily oral&#xD;
      OSI-774 and standard fractionation external beam radiation therapy in patients with oral&#xD;
      cavity (OC) or oropharyngeal (OP) squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), stage II and III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determination of the MTD of daily oral OSI-774, low dose daily cisplatin at 6 mg/m^2/day&#xD;
      and standard fractionation external beam radiation therapy in patients with oral cavity or&#xD;
      oropharyngeal SCC stage III and IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determination of the safety of chronic oral dosing of OSI-774 after radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determination of biological markers of activity of OSI-774 in tumor biopsy specimens from&#xD;
      patients with SCC of OC and OP pre and post therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determination of the ability of (18F)-FDG-PET scan to demonstrate biological activity of&#xD;
      OSI-774 in previously untreated patients with SCC of the OC and OP and to predict for&#xD;
      clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of erlotinib. Patients are assigned to&#xD;
      1 of 2 regimens according to disease stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen A (patients with stage II [T2, N0] or III [T1-2, N1] disease): Patients receive oral&#xD;
      erlotinib once daily. Beginning on day 15, patients also undergo intensity-modulated&#xD;
      radiotherapy (IMRT) once daily 5 days a week for 7 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen B (patients with stage III [T3, N0-1] or IV [T1-4, N2-3, M0 or T4, N0-1, M0]&#xD;
      disease): Patients receive oral erlotinib and undergo IMRT as in regimen A. Patients also&#xD;
      receive cisplatin IV over 20 minutes on each day of radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both regimens continue to receive erlotinib until the last day of IMRT (patients&#xD;
      already in the maintenance phase of this study as of 5/11/04 continue to receive erlotinib&#xD;
      once daily for up to 2 years) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both regimens, cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib until the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at&#xD;
      which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed at 30 days and then every 3 months for up to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-48 patients (12-24 per regimen) will be accrued for this&#xD;
      study within 6-24 months.&#xD;

          -  No known malabsorption syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  G-tube dependent patients are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of OSI-774 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic&#xD;
             dose are unknown; for this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree&#xD;
             to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain involvement should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to OSI-774 or other agents used in study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery or significant traumatic injury occurring within 28 days prior to&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormalities of the cornea based on history (e.g., dry eye syndrome, Sjögren's&#xD;
             syndrome), congenital abnormality (e.g., Fuch's dystrophy), abnormal slit-lamp&#xD;
             examination using a vital dye (e.g., fluorescein, Bengal Rose), and/or an abnormal&#xD;
             corneal sensitivity test (Schirmer test or similar tear production test)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral or enteral&#xD;
             medication or a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting&#xD;
             absorption, or active peptic ulcer disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, untreated&#xD;
             or new cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because OSI-774 is an epidermal growth&#xD;
             factor inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects based on&#xD;
             the data suggesting that EGFR expression is important for normal organ development;&#xD;
             because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with OSI-774, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
             discontinued if the mother is treated with OSI-774&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections&#xD;
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients receiving&#xD;
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with OSI-774; appropriate studies will be undertaken in&#xD;
             patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy when indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on Coumadin are excluded from the study because of reports of interactions&#xD;
             between the study drug and Coumadin&#xD;
