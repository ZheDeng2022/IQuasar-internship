      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma is a common disease caused by a complex interaction between genetic and environmental&#xD;
      factors. Asthma afflicts 17 million Americans. In 1999, more than 5000 persons died from&#xD;
      asthma. Given the significant mortality and morbidity associated with asthma, it is important&#xD;
      to continue to develop new strategies for intervention. Leukotriene antagonists are thought&#xD;
      to be the most innovative approach to asthma therapy in 20 years. Despite their demonstrated&#xD;
      efficacy, safety and popularity, the leukotriene antagonists are associated with a&#xD;
      significant degree of inter-patient variability in response, which can limit their safety,&#xD;
      efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Several polymorphisms in leukotriene pathway genes can&#xD;
      contribute to variability in response. The project will determine if polymorphisms in genes&#xD;
      encoding 5-lipoxygenase, leukotriene A4hydrolase, LTC4 synthase, multi-drug resistance&#xD;
      protein 1 (MRP1) and LT1 receptor proteins are determinants of response to montelukast&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is in response to an Request for Applications entitled Ancillary Studies in Heart,&#xD;
      Lung, and Blood Disease Trials which was released by the NHLBI in June 2000 to conduct&#xD;
      mechanistic studies in clinical trials related to heart, lung and blood diseases.&#xD;
      Specifically, this initiative focuses on the utilization of patients and patient materials&#xD;
      from such trials to study the mechanisms underlying the interventions, the mechanisms of&#xD;
      disease pathogenesis, surrogate markers or biomarkers of disease activity and therapeutic&#xD;
      effect and the mechanisms of human cardiopulmonary and hematologic function. Studies aimed at&#xD;
      accelerating the development of new technologies within the context of the mechanistic&#xD;
      investigations are also encouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA will be collected from patients participating in a parent clinical trial entitled:&#xD;
      Effectiveness of Low Dose Theophylline as Add-On Therapy in the Treatment of Asthma (LoDo&#xD;
      Trial). 627 patients from 19 Asthma Clinical Research Centers will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive placebo, or low dose theophylline (300 mg/day) or montelukast, 10 mg daily, for 6&#xD;
      months. Stepwise Linear and Poisson regressions will be performed on outcomes including&#xD;
      treatment and genetic covariates, and interaction terms between treatment arm and genetic&#xD;
      makeup. Polymorphisms that are highly associated with response can lead to the development of&#xD;
      genetic tests that will identify patients most likely to benefit from montelukast treatment.&#xD;
      This information may lead to individualization of asthma medications based on the genetic&#xD;
      make-up of the patient.&#xD;
