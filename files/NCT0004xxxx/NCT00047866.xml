    <textblock>
      This study seeks more information about the biology of substance dependency by exploring the&#xD;
      brain areas involved in feeling positive and negative emotions. Specifically, it will&#xD;
      determine whether a brain chemical called dopamine affects activity in certain brain regions&#xD;
      during performance of a game that involves winning and losing money. Brain activity will be&#xD;
      examined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a test that uses a magnetic field and radio&#xD;
      waves to produce images of brain structure and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Young to middle-aged healthy adults may participate in this study. Candidates will be&#xD;
      screened with a medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (EKG), psychiatric&#xD;
      interview, and blood and urine tests. Participants will be assigned to one of the two study&#xD;
      procedures, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tyrosine/Phenylalanine&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study requires two overnight stays at the NIH Clinical Center. For each stay, subjects&#xD;
      are admitted to the hospital the afternoon before the MRI scan. From the time of admission&#xD;
      until after the scan, their diets are restricted to food relatively low in amino acids,&#xD;
      prepared by NIH dietitians. The next day, participants undergo MRI scanning. For this&#xD;
      procedure, the subject lies on a table that is moved into the scanner, a metal cylindrical&#xD;
      machine. Earplugs are worn to muffle loud noises that occur with electrical switching of the&#xD;
      radio frequency circuits. Imaging of brain structure takes about 10 to 15 minutes. Additional&#xD;
      scans are then taken to measure brain activity while the subject plays simple computer games&#xD;
      for money. These scans take about another 20 to 45 minutes. Five hours before the MRI, the&#xD;
      subject drinks one of two beverages containing amino acids. A different beverage is given for&#xD;
      each of the two visits: one drink lacks the essential amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine,&#xD;
      from which the body makes dopamine; the other contains balanced amounts of these two amino&#xD;
      acids. Finally, subjects fill out mood-rating questionnaires before and after drinking each&#xD;
      of the beverages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dextroamphetamine&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study requires two outpatient visits to the NIH Clinical Center. For one visit,&#xD;
      participants are given an injection of 0.2 mg/kg body weight of the drug dextroamphetamine;&#xD;
      for the other, they are given an injection of saline (salt water). After each injection, they&#xD;
      undergo MRI scanning while playing computer games for money, as described above. They will&#xD;
      fill out mood-rating questionnaires before and after each brain scan.&#xD;

      The purpose of this protocol is to advance the understanding of the behavioral neurobiology&#xD;
      underlying substance dependency by exploring regional brain activity in response to&#xD;
      appetitive and aversive stimuli in human subjects. In this protocol, brain activation is the&#xD;
      dependent measure, as measured by blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal acquired&#xD;
      during functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) imaging. Previous work in this laboratory has&#xD;
      found that cues of anticipated monetary reward versus threat of negative reinforcement causes&#xD;
      increased BOLD signal in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and other parts of the ventral&#xD;
      striatum. This protocol is intended to extend these findings by exploring whether the&#xD;
      recently reported BOLD activation (a hemodynamic response) in certain brain regions in&#xD;
      response to motivational cues can be perturbed by dopaminergic pharmacological manipulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a series of two, repeated-measures, within-subject experiments, we propose to temporarily&#xD;
      alter subjects' brain monoamine neurotransmitter systems with pharmacological interventions&#xD;
      prior to presenting the subjects with appetitive and aversive visual stimuli as well as cues&#xD;
      signaling potential punishment and reward. In the first experiment, brain catecholamine&#xD;
      systems will be deactivated by dietary restrictions of amino acid precursors Tyrosine (Tyr)&#xD;
      and Phenylalanine (Phe), respectively. In the second experiment, the brain dopamine (DA)&#xD;
      release will be transiently increased with administration of dextroamphetamine (Amph). Based&#xD;
      on a wealth of existent findings, we predict that acutely enhancing synaptic DA by Amph will&#xD;
      augment reward-elicited activation in the ventral striatum. Conversely, acute dietary&#xD;
      restriction of the DA precursor Tyr, (along with Tyr precursor Phe) will blunt this&#xD;
      activation. Since substance use disorders (SUD) such as alcoholism may result from disordered&#xD;
      neural systems regulating approach and avoidance behavior (with respect to the substance),&#xD;
      this experiment can yield useful knowledge relevant to SUD.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects are physically healthy as determined by medical evaluation at the NIAAA outpatient&#xD;
        clinic. In particular, subjects must demonstrate no cardiovascular or blood pressure&#xD;
        abnormalities, such as a resting blood pressure of 140/90 or greater. All values of&#xD;
        laboratory test must be within the NIH defined normal range and all radiological and&#xD;
        cardiac evaluations must be considered normal by the NIH radiologist or cardiologist&#xD;
        reading the scan or record. As is usual clinical practice, in the case of minor&#xD;
        abnormalities a lab test may be repeated to ensure the validity of the initial report.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Are between 18-65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have 20/20 vision or wear corrective contact lenses. Plastic glasses with pop-in lenses of&#xD;
        different strengths are available in the NMR center for use with nearsighted subjects who&#xD;
        do not wear contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have no ferromagnetic objects in their bodies which might be adversely affected by MRI&#xD;
        (e.g. surgical clips; metal fragments in or near brain; eye or blood vessels; cardiac or&#xD;
        neurological pacemaker; cochlear or eye implant - any doubt about absence of these objects&#xD;
        will result in exclusion from this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Test HIV negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have no indication of any organic brain syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Do not meet criteria for any present or past Axis I psychiatric disorder, including&#xD;
        nicotine dependence. Smokers will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have no active homicidal or suicidal ideation, or active symptoms of post-traumatic stress&#xD;
        disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Are not currently receiving psychotropic medication or medication likely to affect brain&#xD;
        neurotransmitter systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have no indication of recent drug use as evidenced by urine drug screen and self-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Are not pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
