    <description>The planned doses for investigation are as follows: 5, 10, and 25 mg/day. Lenalidomide will be administered as a single daily dose for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week rest period. Dosing will be in the morning at approximately the same time each day, at least 1 hour before the morning meal. Patients will be assigned to dose level in the order of study entry. No dose adjustments or suspensions are allowed during the first cycle, except discontinuation for DLT</description>
