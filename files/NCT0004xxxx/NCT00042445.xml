  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the association of exposure to air contaminants (PAH &amp;&#xD;
      VOC) emitted from the petrochemical industries, specific genetic polymorphisms (P4501A1 (MspI&#xD;
      &amp; exon 7) and GSTM1 &amp; T1) of study subjects and their parents, and the risks of brain tumors&#xD;
      and leukemia among children and youths in metropolitan Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain tumors and leukemia are the most common malignancies among children and adolescents in&#xD;
      the U.S. Adequate information on the role of inherited genetic susceptibility and&#xD;
      environmental exposures in the development of neoplasms in children and adolescents is&#xD;
      lacking. In Taiwan, four large petrochemical industries are located in the Kaohsiung&#xD;
      metropolitan area. These facilities are proximal to residential areas because of the high&#xD;
      population density in the region. Data have shown that the concentrations of ambient&#xD;
      polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) around the&#xD;
      petrochemical industries are at least 10 and 2 times, respectively, higher than those in U.S.&#xD;
      industrialized communities. Our preliminary case-control study in metropolitan Kaohsiung&#xD;
      showed that young residents (under age 30) living within 3 kilometers of the vicinity of&#xD;
      petrochemical industries have a 6.0 fold increase in brain neoplasms and a 2.9 fold increase&#xD;
      in leukemia. The purpose of this proposal is to examine the association of exposure to air&#xD;
      contaminants (PAH and VOC) emitted from the petrochemical industries, specific genetic&#xD;
      polymorphisms (P4501A1 (MspI &amp; exon 7) and GSTM1 &amp;T1) from study subjects and their parents,&#xD;
      and the risks of brain tumors and leukemia among children and youths in metropolitan&#xD;
      Kaohsiung. Our hypothesis is that there is an increased risk of brain tumors and leukemia in&#xD;
      patients with high cumulative exposure to these hazards, and that heritable polymorphisms in&#xD;
      several genes modify this association. In addition to an independent association of&#xD;
      environmental and genetic factors with brain neoplasms and leukemia, we hypothesize that&#xD;
      there is greater risk associated with the presence of combined environmental exposure and the&#xD;
      high risk genotype. Also, we will assess the role of parental genetic polymorphisms in the&#xD;
      development of cancer in their siblings. This proposed study uses an environmental molecular&#xD;
      epidemiologic approach, utilizing prospective enrollment of a cohort of brain tumor and&#xD;
      leukemia subjects in a population-based case-control design. This proposal is responsive to&#xD;
      the recommendation of the National Research Council that risk assessment and public health&#xD;
      policy pay special attention to the protection of children.&#xD;
