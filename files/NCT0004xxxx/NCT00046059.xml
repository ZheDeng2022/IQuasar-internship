  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most common behavioral disorder in&#xD;
      childhood, affecting 3-5% of children between the ages of 7 and 17. Family studies suggest&#xD;
      that there is a genetic component to ADHD. Scientists believe that it is a complex disorder&#xD;
      in which two or more genes may be involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potentially eligible families will be asked to give written consent to participate and will&#xD;
      be asked to complete questionnaires for each member in the family. In addition, an interview&#xD;
      will be administered to the parent of minors enrolled in the study to determine their&#xD;
      eligibility for being in the study. This screening tool is computerized and will take&#xD;
      approximately 45 minutes to administer per child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once screenings are completed, a blood collection kit will be sent to the family to take to&#xD;
      their local medical care provider, have blood samples drawn and sent to NIH. There is no cost&#xD;
      to the family to participate. We would like to enroll entire families, with both parents and&#xD;
      all children.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common childhood&#xD;
&#xD;
      disorders and the most common childhood neurodevelopmental behavioral disorder. Symptoms&#xD;
      include difficulty staying focused (inattention), difficulty controlling behavior&#xD;
      (impulsivity), and hyperactivity. Symptoms typically develop between six and 12 years of age,&#xD;
      and frequently persist into adulthood, with serious life-long health and social consequences.&#xD;
      Affected children are at increased risk for poor educational achievement, low income,&#xD;
      underemployment, legal difficulties, and impaired social relationships. The general belief is&#xD;
      that ADHD is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to conduct genetic and behavioral studies that will&#xD;
      closely&#xD;
&#xD;
      characterize the genetic influences in diagnosis, prognosis, severity, and pharmacological&#xD;
&#xD;
      response in ADHD patients. Since the start of the study in 2000, research has contributed to&#xD;
      the understanding of the innate susceptibility of ADHD and associated comorbidities; the&#xD;
      interaction of genetic, demographic, and environmental factors underpinning the risk of&#xD;
      developing ADHD; the extent to which these factors shape the response of ADHD patients to&#xD;
      pharmacological interventions (pharmacogenetics); the over-representation of functional and&#xD;
      ontological genebased networks implicated in determining synapse structure; and the use of&#xD;
      advanced geneticepidemiological models with potential for use in clinical practice&#xD;
      (translational genomics). The most significant research finding occurred in 2010, when the&#xD;
      study team identified LPHN3, a key gene involved in the etiology of ADHD and comorbid&#xD;
      conditions in one of the previously identified regions of strong genetic signal in chromosome&#xD;
      4q13.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to provide power for the study s statistical analyses, the upper enrollment goal is&#xD;
      4,000 participants. Although the study has several small and genetically distinct cohorts,&#xD;
      the majority of subjects come from the United States of America population through outreach&#xD;
      recruitment efforts. Recruitment has been very successful and the large cohort numbers&#xD;
      provide support for identification of genetic components related to the diagnosis of ADHD.&#xD;
      Recent efforts have focused on identifying new areas of the genome associated with ADHD, and&#xD;
      identifying genetic (coding and non-coding) variations implicated in the etiology and&#xD;
      clinical manifestations of ADHD. A primary aim of the study is to correlate genetic and&#xD;
      biological markers for diagnosis and prognosis of ADHD identified through the use of state of&#xD;
      the art genomics, which includes enome-wide association studies, linkage analysis, whole&#xD;
      genome and exome sequencing, and targeted gene capture in cosmopolitan and isolated&#xD;
      populations. As the current diagnosis of ADHD is based on subjective observations, one of the&#xD;
      main goals of the study is to develop a more definitive system to diagnose ADHD and to assess&#xD;
      and predict prognosis.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        This study will enroll families with the following characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Families with children, seven through 17 years of age, diagnosed with ADHD (defined as&#xD;
             the proband for the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The probands siblings, either affected with ADHD (concordant) or unaffected&#xD;
             (discordant), seven years of age and above, including adult siblings.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The parents, both mothers and fathers, of enrolled probands.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The study will enroll both male and female probands of any ethnic background and race.&#xD;
             The prevalence of ADHD is higher in males than in females, so we would expect to have&#xD;
             a higher number of male probands than female probands. Both male and female siblings&#xD;
             and male and female parents of probands will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Adults who are or may be unable to provide informed consent will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Probands with one parent affected with ADHD or with neither parent affected with ADHD&#xD;
             are eligible. Probands from bilineal families, families with both parents affected&#xD;
             with ADHD, will be excluded for statistical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional inclusion criteria for the study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ability to read and understand spoken English, since the questionnaires, scales, and&#xD;
        interviews that we have license to use in this study are in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Some conditions can confound the diagnosis of ADHD. Probands with the following conditions&#xD;
        will be excluded from enrollment or will be withdrawn from the study if the condition is&#xD;
        discovered subsequent to enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prematurity&#xD;

          -  Severe Sensory Impairment (visual and hearing)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Probands with the following conditions may be included, but the conditions will be noted&#xD;
        during statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Oppositional Defiant Disorder&#xD;
