  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use brain imaging technology to investigate brain changes in&#xD;
      people exposed to predictable versus unpredictable unpleasant stimuli. Unpleasant events that&#xD;
      can be predicted evoke a response of fear, whereas unpredictable, unpleasant stimuli cause&#xD;
      chronic anxiety not associated with a specific event. Information gained from this study may&#xD;
      help in the development of more effective treatments for anxiety disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When confronted with fearful events, people eventually develop fear of specific cues that&#xD;
      were associated with these events as well as to the environmental context in which the&#xD;
      fearful event occurred. Evidence suggests that cued fear and contextual fear model different&#xD;
      aspects of anxiety. However, studies that examine the way the brain affects expression of&#xD;
      contextual fear have not been conducted. This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      or Magneto-encephalography (MEG) to compare the brain activity underlying fear brought on by&#xD;
      predictable and unpredictable aversive stimuli.&#xD;

      This protocol examines the neurobiology of fear and anxiety using various approaches. During&#xD;
      fear conditioning in which a phasic explicit cue (e.g., a light) is repeatedly associated&#xD;
      with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (e.g., a shock), the organism develops fear to the&#xD;
      explicit cue as well as to the environmental context in which the experiment took place.&#xD;
      Experimental evidence suggests that cued fear and contextual fear model different aspects of&#xD;
      anxiety. Studies in patients indicated that contextual fear may model an aspect that is&#xD;
      especially relevant to anxiety disorders. However, the neural basis for the expression of&#xD;
      contextual fear has not previously been elucidated in human imaging studies. One important&#xD;
      determinant of contextual fear is predictability: contextual fear increases when a threat&#xD;
      (e.g., electric shock) is unpredictable, as opposed to when the threat is predictable. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to compare the neural substrates underlying fear evoked by predictable&#xD;
      versus unpredictable shocks. Animal studies have indicated that conditioned responses to&#xD;
      predictably cued threat and to less explicit threat are separate processes mediated by&#xD;
      distinct brain structures. Psychophysiological data suggest that the proposed procedure can&#xD;
      differentiate between these two responses. Hence, we anticipate that this procedure will&#xD;
      allow us to compare brain correlates of these responses in humans. Another objective is to&#xD;
      study effects of threat of shock on processing and learning of threat cues in the amygdala,&#xD;
      the visual and auditory systems, and motivation/reward systems. This will be investigated by&#xD;
      means of event-related magneto-encephalography (MEG) and fMRI measurements using various&#xD;
      paradigms. Finally, a last project will examine how pharmacologic manipulation of&#xD;
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels with the benzodiazepine alprazolam affects the&#xD;
      relationship between GABA concentration (quantified with magnetic resonance spectroscopy,&#xD;
      MRS), visual- and auditory-induced gamma oscillations (measured with MEG), and fMRI BOLD&#xD;
      response.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All screening procedures described in this section are conducted under screening protocol&#xD;
        01-M-0254. Subjects must meet the following inclusion criteria in order to participate in&#xD;
        the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female volunteers ages 18-50 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Judged to be in good physical health on the basis of medical history, a clinical MRI&#xD;
             scan, and physical examination. Physical exams will be conducted by a NIMH&#xD;
             credentialed physician or nurse. Clinical laboratory tests will be ordered based on&#xD;
             his/her discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Healthy subjects judged to be in good psychiatric health on the basis of the&#xD;
             Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR. The SCID will be administered by a&#xD;
             credentialed NIMH clinician.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Subjects will not be asked to completely stop smoking or drinking coffee during this&#xD;
             study because they may experience withdrawal symptoms, which could affect our study&#xD;
             results. However, they will be asked to abstain from drinking caffeinated beverage&#xD;
             including coffee, tea and caffeinated soft drinks and from smoking for at least 1 hour&#xD;
             prior to testing. They will also be instructed not to drink alcohol on the night prior&#xD;
             to testing and on the day of testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Speaks English or Spanish fluently (subjects with Major Depressive Disorder, healthy&#xD;
             volunteers)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Speaks English fluently (subjects with Anxiety Disorder)&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded from the study if they meet the following exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Clinically significant organic disease, e.g., cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinically significant abnormalities in physical examination.&#xD;

             the study, including, but not limited to, history of organic mental disorders,&#xD;
             seizure, or mental retardation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have a current diagnosis of alcohol or substance abuse ACCORDING TO DSM IV CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have a lifetime diagnosis of alcohol or substance dependence ACCORDING TO DSM IV&#xD;
             CRITERIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Unless subject is enrolled as a patient, subjects should not have current Axis I&#xD;
             psychiatric disorders as identified with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV,&#xD;
             non-patient edition (SCID/NP).&#xD;

             may interfere with the interpretation of study results. Specific exclusionary drug&#xD;
             classes include but are not limited to: (opioid analgesics, DA receptor agonists,&#xD;
             anticholinergics, MAO inhibitors, COMT inhibitors, as well as any illicit substances).&#xD;
