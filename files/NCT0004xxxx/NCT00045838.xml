  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety of an experimental vaccine against HIV and examine whether it&#xD;
      induces an immune response to HIV. A vaccine is a substance given to try to create resistance&#xD;
      or immunity to a disease or infection. The vaccine in this study is made from DNA (genetic&#xD;
      material) of four HIV proteins called gag, pol, Nef, and Env. Injected into a human, the&#xD;
      viral DNA instructs the body to make small amounts of some HIV proteins. This study will see&#xD;
      if the body then creates an immune response to these proteins. Study participants cannot&#xD;
      catch HIV or AIDS from the DNA vaccine or any proteins made from it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates will provide a medical history, including information on sexual behaviors and drug&#xD;
      use. They will have a physical examination and blood and urine tests. Women will also have a&#xD;
      pregnancy test. Women enrolled in the study must either be infertile (e.g., due to menopause&#xD;
      or hysterectomy) or must agree either to abstain from heterosexual sex or to practice birth&#xD;
      control for at least 21 days before beginning the study and throughout its duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the experimental vaccine or a&#xD;
      placebo (a control substance made up of an inactive salt solution) and will be divided into&#xD;
      three groups, based on their entry into the study. Of the first seven people enrolled (Group&#xD;
      1), five will receive a 2-mg dose of vaccine and two will receive placebo. If the vaccine is&#xD;
      safe at this dose, then in Group 2, five people will receive a 4-mg dose of vaccine and two&#xD;
      will receive placebo. If this dose is safe, then in Group 3, thirty people will receive an&#xD;
      8-mg dose of vaccine and six will receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive three injections in an upper arm muscle-one injection a month&#xD;
      for three months-with a needle-less device called a Biojector 2000Â® (Registered Trademark).&#xD;
      At the time of each injection, participants will be observed for at least 1 hour after&#xD;
      immunization. At home, they will record their temperature and any symptoms they may&#xD;
      experience, including any effects at the injection site, for at least 2 days, or as long as&#xD;
      the symptoms remain. If symptoms occur, participants will report them immediately to the&#xD;
      clinic staff and, if necessary, come to the clinic for an examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have about 10 clinic visits during the study. Most visits will last about 2&#xD;
      hours; those on vaccination days will last about 4 hours. At each visit, participants will be&#xD;
      checked for health changes or problems and will be asked about medications they are taking.&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn for immune system testing. Additional laboratory tests may be requested&#xD;
      between visits. Participants will be tested several times for HIV, will be questioned about&#xD;
      their sexual behavior and drug use, and about social effects they may have experienced from&#xD;
      their participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the blood drawn for this study will be used to test for HLA type-a genetic test of&#xD;
      immune system markers. For research, HLA testing is sometimes used to try to identify factors&#xD;
      associated with the progression of HIV disease or related conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, randomized, controlled, double-blinded, dose-escalation study to examine&#xD;
      tolerability, dose, and immune response of an HIV DNA plasmid vaccine. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      this vaccine will be safe for human administration and elicit immune responses to HIV. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability in humans of VCR-HIVDNA006-00-VP&#xD;
      and secondary objectives are to evaluate the immuogenicity of the vaccine and social impact&#xD;
      of participating in an HIV-1 vaccine trial. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will&#xD;
      review protocol results twice prior to dose escalation to the 8 mg dose level.&#xD;
