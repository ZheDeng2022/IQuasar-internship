  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of risperidone to&#xD;
      augment SSRI therapy in patients with treatment-resistant depression and to demonstrate the&#xD;
      long-term maintenance effect of risperidone as augmentation therapy compared with placebo&#xD;
      augmentation in these patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment strategies for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) involve either switching to&#xD;
      another antidepressant, augmenting the first-line treatment with various pharmacologic&#xD;
      agents, or switching to a different medication in combination with another agent. This study&#xD;
      includes 2 phases: an open-label treatment phase and a double-blind maintenance phase, during&#xD;
      which neither the patient nor the physician knows whether risperidone or placebo is&#xD;
      administered. The open-label phase has an initial period of 6 weeks during which patients&#xD;
      with TRD receive only citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).&#xD;
      Risperidone is then added to the treatment regimen for 4 weeks to evaluate its short-term&#xD;
      effect in augmenting the therapy. The double-blind phase last for 6 months and evaluates the&#xD;
      relapse prevention of continued risperidone augmentation therapy compared with placebo&#xD;
      augmentation of the SSRI. Targeted daily doses of citalopram and risperidone are adjusted for&#xD;
      younger adults (18 to 54 years of age) and older adults (55 to 85 years of age). Assessments&#xD;
      of effectiveness include the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS); Hamilton&#xD;
      Rating Scale of Depression (HAM-D); Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S); response&#xD;
      rate, determined by the proportion of patients showing &gt;=50% improvement on MADRS total&#xD;
      score; and relapse, evaluated by changes in CGI or HAM-D scores. Safety evaluations include&#xD;
      the incidence of adverse events throughout the study, vital signs (pulse and blood pressure)&#xD;
      and weight, and clinical laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis) at specified&#xD;
      intervals. The study hypothesis is that risperidone augmentation of SSRI therapy will show&#xD;
      significant improvement in symptoms of depression compared with SSRI monotherapy and that&#xD;
      risperidone augmentation will show better time-to-relapse than placebo augmentation in&#xD;
      patients with TRD. Once daily, oral tablets of risperidone (0.25 milligram[mg], 0.5mg, 1.0mg,&#xD;
      and 2.0mg), citalopram (20mg and 40mg) or placebo. Risperidone for 30 weeks; 0.25-2.0mg for&#xD;
      younger adults, 0.25-1.0mg for older adults. Citalopram for 36 weeks; 20-60 mg for younger&#xD;
      adults; 20-40 mg for older adults.&#xD;
