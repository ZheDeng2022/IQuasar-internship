    <textblock>
      This phase I study will evaluate the experimental drug Romidepsinin patients with advanced&#xD;
      cancer. The study will: 1) determine how well patients tolerate Romidepsin; 2) measure blood&#xD;
      levels of Romidepsin during treatment; 3) analyze the cellular and molecular effects of the&#xD;
      drug; and 4) determine if Romidepsin can shrink tumors. Romidepsin has been shown to kill&#xD;
      cancer cells growing in the laboratory and to shrink tumors in animals with various tumor&#xD;
      types. In preliminary studies, several patients with a type of lymphoma and one patient with&#xD;
      kidney cancer responded to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with advanced cancer (excluding acute leukemia) may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical&#xD;
      examination, x-rays and CT scans, and blood and urine tests. Patients with thyroid cancer may&#xD;
      also have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test uses a magnetic field instead of x-rays&#xD;
      to obtain images or body organs and tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive three infusions of Romidepsin administered through an intravenous line&#xD;
      over 4 hours on days 1, 3 and 5 of a 21-day treatment cycle. The intravenous line is a&#xD;
      catheter (plastic tube) placed in a vein and may be a peripheral line, inserted in a vein in&#xD;
      the arm, or a central line, in which the tube is placed under the skin of the chest or neck&#xD;
      into a major vein. Patients are hospitalized for the first 6 days of the first cycle to&#xD;
      monitor heart rate. Those who tolerate the treatment well may continue as an outpatient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to drug therapy, participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests: Small amounts of blood are drawn frequently during the first five days of&#xD;
           treatment to measure Romidepsin levels and to see how the body uses and excretes the&#xD;
           drug. A heparin lock (an indwelling device to keep the vein open) may be put in the vein&#xD;
           to prevent the need for repeated needle sticks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsies (removal of a small sample of tumor tissue): Tumors that are accessible may be&#xD;
           biopsied at the start of the study and at different times during treatment. Biopsies are&#xD;
           done no more than three times per cycle, and no more than nine biopsies are done within&#xD;
           a year. The samples are examined for the effects of Romidepsin on proteins that control&#xD;
           the way cells divide and stay alive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apheresis: This procedure is done to collect white blood cells and cancer cells for&#xD;
           research. Blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein and directed into a machine&#xD;
           that separates it into its components by centrifugation (spinning). The white cells are&#xD;
           removed and the red cells are returned to the patient through the same needle or through&#xD;
           another needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scans and x-rays: Imaging studies are usually done before starting treatment. Some of&#xD;
           them are repeated at every 2 cycles (6 weeks), and some at the end of the patient's&#xD;
           participation in the study. The tests may include chest x-rays, plain x-rays of affected&#xD;
           bones, CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, bone scans, and a MUGA scan (special&#xD;
           X-ray of the heart) or echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to test heart function&#xD;
           before and during the study. MRI or positron emission tomography (PET) scans may also be&#xD;
           done to detect tumors. PET scans use a small amount of a radioactive substance injected&#xD;
           into a vein. The radioactivity is detected by a special camera during scanning to detect&#xD;
           cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other tests include an electrocardiogram (recording of the electrical activity of the&#xD;
           heart) before and after each dose of depsipeptide. Eye exams are done if there are&#xD;
           vision changes or if the doctor recommends an eye test.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Romidepsin (NSC 630176, FR901228, FK228, formerly referred to as depsipeptide) is a histone&#xD;
      deacetylase inhibitor with potent cytotoxic activity against human tumor cell lines and in&#xD;
      vivo efficacy against both human tumor xenografts and murine tumors (1-3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory studies suggest that longer exposure to non-toxic doses of romidepsin can enhance&#xD;
      its molecular effects to a greater degree than short toxic doses that rapidly cause cell&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIS is responsible for enabling uptake of RAI in thyroid cancer, with decreased levels in&#xD;
      tumors resistant or refractory to RAI therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our group has demonstrated that NIS expression is upregulated by romidepsin, resulting in&#xD;
      increased sensitivity to RAI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the MTD of romidepsin when administered on days 1, 3 and 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the effect of a multi-day regimen of romidepsin on surrogate markers and the&#xD;
      expression of molecular targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether thyroid cancers that do not have detectable uptake of RAI will have&#xD;
      detectable uptake after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age 18 and over&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Left ventricular ejection fraction within normal limits. Additional cardiac criteria are&#xD;
           noted in protocol&#xD;
