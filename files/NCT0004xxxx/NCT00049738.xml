      The purpose of this study is to screen and evaluate children with psychotic disorders to&#xD;
      establish or confirm their diagnosis and to collect data about their condition. This study&#xD;
      will also recruit individuals for various treatment studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Childhood psychotic disorders are debilitating conditions in which children have auditory or&#xD;
      visual hallucinations and disorganized thoughts. This study will examine psychotic disorders&#xD;
      in children in an inpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for up to 9 weeks&#xD;
      under one or more of the following conditions: current medication, no medication, or tapered&#xD;
      medication. Participants will undergo blood, urine, metabolic, and intellectual functioning&#xD;
      tests. An electrocardiogram (EKG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) will be performed. A&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain will be taken and infrared oculography&#xD;
      will be used to measure eye movements. Participants and their family members may also be&#xD;
      asked to participate in a study of genetics in children with psychotic illnesses. Children&#xD;
      meeting criteria for childhood onset schizophrenia may be offered participation in a&#xD;
      medication comparison protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 250 children and adolescents ages 5 to 18, meeting DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia,&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder, and psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, are currently under&#xD;
      study in our group. The purpose of this protocol is to allow systematic outpatient, and&#xD;
      subsequent inpatient, screening evaluation to establish an accurate diagnosis for research,&#xD;
      obtain clinical and neurobiological research measurements, evaluate the patient s response to&#xD;
      open treatment with antipsychotic(s), and allow longitudinal follow-up. Subjects and&#xD;
      first-degree relatives may then be enrolled in Protocol 89-M-0006, Brain Imaging of Childhood&#xD;
      Onset Psychiatric Disorders, Endocrine Disorders and Healthy Controls, and Protocol&#xD;
      84-M-0050, Biochemical, Physiological, and Psychological Measures in Normal Controls and&#xD;
      Relatives of Psychiatric Patients. If additional research protocols are available, this&#xD;
      screening protocol will represent an entry point for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation process will include a one-day outpatient psychiatric screening interview with&#xD;
      proband and family. If it is thought that the child is likely to meet criteria for childhood&#xD;
      onset psychoses, an inpatient evaluation will then be offered for clarifying the diagnosis.&#xD;
      This may involve: 1) Up to 3 weeks of inpatient observation on the child s current medication&#xD;
      regimen. 2) Tapering of psychotropic medications (1-4 weeks, depending upon type and dosage).&#xD;
      3) Observation for up to 3 weeks drug free, in order to confirm the diagnosis, and 4) Once&#xD;
      the diagnosis is confirmed, two to ten weeks of treatment with antipsychotic(s); 5) Discharge&#xD;
      to the care of his/her community psychiatrist. Treatment will be guided by what is considered&#xD;
      the subject s best clinical interest. During the inpatient stay, or occasionally as part of&#xD;
      the outpatient screening, we will obtain neurocognitive testing, research blood draws&#xD;
      including blood for genetic testing of the proband, and a research brain MRI scan. A skin&#xD;
      biopsy may be obtained either during the inpatient stay or a follow up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol also includes a study 100 non-schizophrenic children ages 6-13 with psychotic&#xD;
      symptoms (e.g. hallucinations or delusions) to extend our studies of early&#xD;
      neuro-developmental biomarkers and of the factors that either promote or stop the progression&#xD;
      to full schizophrenia (resilience or conversion factors). These children will be recruited&#xD;
      from the local community, evaluated as outpatients and followed prospectively for five years.&#xD;
      Measures will include diagnostic interviews, clinical ratings, neurocognitive testing,&#xD;
      anatomic and functional imaging, and blood for routine and genetic testing.&#xD;
