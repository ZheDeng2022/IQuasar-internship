    <textblock>
      This study will examine the process of prenatal genetic counseling to determine how various&#xD;
      client and counselor factors affect the communication process in a counseling session. The&#xD;
      specific aims of the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide information on prenatal genetic counselors' interactions with clients for the&#xD;
           basis of a future larger study of the genetic counseling process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the average length and the range of length of prenatal genetic counselors'&#xD;
           interactions with clients when family history information has already been provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Document on videotape the communication content and interaction dynamics of prenatal&#xD;
           genetic counselors interacting with clients in order to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize different models of prenatal genetic counseling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the nature of discussions concerning cystic fibrosis carrier testing within&#xD;
           the context of prenatal genetic counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the impact of prenatal genetic counselors' characteristics (years of experience,&#xD;
           training and background, age, clinical setting, anxiety) on the communication content&#xD;
           and interaction dynamics of sessions with clients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the impact of the presence of a spouse on the communication content and&#xD;
           interaction dynamics of prenatal genetic counseling sessions with clients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the impact of client verbal emotional cues on the communication content and&#xD;
           interaction dynamics of prenatal genetic counseling sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Counselors will be recruited for this study from among practicing prenatal genetic counselors&#xD;
      at regional meetings and a national meeting of the National Society of Genetic Counselors.&#xD;
      They will perform prenatal genetic counseling sessions with actors in the roles of client and&#xD;
      client's spouse. The sessions will be videotaped, and the counselor and actors will fill out&#xD;
      questionnaires regarding the characteristics of the counselor and the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Counselors may be contacted later to request permission to use segments of their videotaped&#xD;
      sessions for creating a video teaching tool for counseling professionals that illustrates&#xD;
      different ways to practice the genetic counseling.&#xD;

      The main objective of this pilot study is to provide insight into the process of prenatal&#xD;
      genetic counseling that can both inform the practice of prenatal genetic counseling and serve&#xD;
      as the springboard to a later, more comprehensive study. The research participants will all&#xD;
      be practicing prenatal genetic counselors recruited from regional meetings and a national&#xD;
      meeting of the National Society of Genetic Counselors. Participating genetic counselors will&#xD;
      be asked to perform a prenatal genetic counseling session with a simulated client (an actor)&#xD;
      or simulated clients (actor and actor posing as spouse) presenting with the indication of&#xD;
      advanced maternal age. The participating genetic counselors will also be asked to address&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis carrier testing within the course of this session. This session will be&#xD;
      videotaped. In addition, both the genetic counselor and simulated client will be asked to&#xD;
      fill out questionnaires related to characteristics of the counselor and the session itself.&#xD;
      The process and content of the genetic counseling communication will be analyzed&#xD;
      qualitatively and quantitatively (using Roter Interaction Analysis System). Through these&#xD;
      analyses, we hope to both describe the nature of prenatal genetic counseling communication in&#xD;
      a relatively large sample and to determine the ways in which a variety of client and&#xD;
      counselor factors affect the communication process itself (determined through changes in the&#xD;
      RIAS communication codes). In addition, we hope to provide information on the logistics of&#xD;
      data collection in order to inform a similar larger study planned to look at the impact of&#xD;
      communication on client outcomes.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any master's trained genetic counselors attending the 2002 regional meetings and/or a&#xD;
        national meeting of the National Society of Genetic Counselors who currently provide&#xD;
        prenatal genetic counseling services as part of their professional practices will be&#xD;
        included in the study. In addition, any prenatal genetic counselors referred by these&#xD;
        individuals, but who did not attend these meetings, will also be eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Genetic counselors who do not practice prenatal counseling training programs will be&#xD;
        excluded In addition, master's level students currently in genetic counseling training&#xD;
        programs will be excluded from the study because differences in their stages of training&#xD;
        and practice development would introduce additional variability into the data set.&#xD;
