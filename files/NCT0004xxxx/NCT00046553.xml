      The purpose of this study is to examine the function of cortisol receptors in post-traumatic&#xD;
      stress disorder (PTSD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with PTSD have neurobiological dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal&#xD;
      (HPA) axis function. High corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) levels and decreased&#xD;
      hippocampal volume are major features of the disorder. The mechanisms responsible for these&#xD;
      alterations are not known. This study will evaluate the function of cortisol receptors to&#xD;
      determine their roles in maintaining PTSD HPA axis dysregulation. Three groups of subjects&#xD;
      will take part in the study: Patients with PTSD, healthy control subjects who were exposed to&#xD;
      trauma in the past and remained healthy and healthy control subjects who were never&#xD;
      traumatized&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study entry, the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of all participants will be sampled and&#xD;
      evaluated. Participants will also undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the&#xD;
      brain as well as eye blink trace conditioning and neuropsychological tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the Clinical Center for two nights on three different&#xD;
      occasions. At each overnight visits, blood levels of stress hormones will be measured every&#xD;
      hour for 26 hours after medication or placebo are given. This will be the end of the study&#xD;
      for both groups of healthy control subjects, with the exception that they may be asked to&#xD;
      repeat neuropsychologic and eye blink tests after 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with PTSD will receive paroxetine for 10 weeks. After 10 weeks these&#xD;
      participants will be reevaluated in exactly the same way as before treatment (except they&#xD;
      will not repeat the MRI scan).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to investigate the underlying mechanisms that account for neurobiological&#xD;
      dysregulation of HPA axis function in PTSD. Paradoxically, low or normal plasma and urinary&#xD;
      cortisol despite high corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) levels are a major feature of&#xD;
      this disorder. Some investigators report decreased hippocampal volume in patients with PTSD.&#xD;
      The mechanisms responsible for these alterations are not known. One possibility is that&#xD;
      patients with PTSD have an increased number of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and/or increased&#xD;
      GR sensitivity, causing hyper-suppression of HPA axis. Another possibility is that high CRH&#xD;
      levels lead to increased mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) levels and this up-regulation of MR&#xD;
      is responsible for the low cortisol secretion seen in PTSD. Elevated CRH levels could also&#xD;
      result in reduced hippocampal volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate MR and GR function, we will examine the effect of RU486 (Mifepristone; a&#xD;
      GR antagonist), spironolactone (Aldactone; an MR antagonist), and placebo, on cortisol and&#xD;
      ACTH plasma levels in patients with PTSD, trauma exposed, and non-trauma exposed healthy&#xD;
      controls. The extent of increase in cortisol and/or ACTH after administration of antagonists&#xD;
      will reflect the inhibition ordinarily imposed by GR and MR. We will also examine subjects'&#xD;
      cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), CRH levels, and hippocampal volume. Following this evaluation,&#xD;
      patients with PTSD will be treated with paroxetine for 8 weeks. The assessments performed&#xD;
      before treatment will then be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim of the present study is to elucidate the pathophysiology of PTSD through the&#xD;
      examination of the roles of GR and MR in maintaining PTSD HPA axis dysregulation. The second&#xD;
      aim is to compare CSF CRH levels across groups in an effort to extend previous findings and&#xD;
      determine whether CRH levels in PTSD are higher than levels in trauma exposed healthy&#xD;
      subjects. The present investigation will also evaluate the relationship between CRH levels in&#xD;
      PTSD, MR/GR function, hippocampal volume and hippocampally-mediated cognitive tasks. Finally,&#xD;
      we will examine the effects of long-term paroxetine treatment in PTSD on HPA axis function,&#xD;
      hippocampal volume, and hippocampally-mediated cognitive tasks.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        18 to 65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male and female.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Score greater than or equal to 50 on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-2) as a&#xD;
        baseline measure of PTSD symptom severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Capable of providing informed consent, obtained prior to any study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Free of all psychotropic medication for at least 2 weeks, excluding short-term hypnotics.&#xD;
        Patients who were treated with fluoxetine will only be included after a medication free&#xD;
        period of at least 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Good physical health, confirmed by a complete physical exam (including normal vital signs),&#xD;
        electrocardiogram, neurologic exam, and routine laboratory tests of blood and urine.&#xD;
        However, if patients have participated in other research studies or have had blood work&#xD;
        through their primary MD within the last 6 months, these results will be used instead of&#xD;
        repeating blood draws for inclusion into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who meet DSM-IV criteria for substance abuse (alcohol or drugs) or substance&#xD;
        dependence within 6 months prior to screening. The effect of abuse/dependence on&#xD;
        phenomenology and biology could mask and exceed PTSD effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients at current risk for homicide or suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All additional DSM IV Axis I comorbidity, excluding secondary diagnoses of major depressive&#xD;
        disorder (MDD) or anxiety disorder (AD). Given the high comorbidity of these disorders in&#xD;
        PTSD, and since excluding such patients would not provide the full spectrum of the&#xD;
        disorder, only patients in whom axis I diagnoses of MDD and AD preceded onset of PTSD will&#xD;
        be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women (all stages) and women of childbearing potential who are not practicing a&#xD;
        clinically accepted method of contraception or who have a positive pregnancy test or who&#xD;
        are lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Blood donation (1 Red Cross Unit) within the 8 weeks preceding the study. This is the&#xD;
        minimal safe period between consecutive donations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who are doing well on medication. Although we will only recruit non-medicated&#xD;
        patients, the decision to stop medication will be taken purely on clinical grounds. No&#xD;
        subject will be taken off medication solely to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Unable to comply with study procedures or assessments as regards the screening evaluation&#xD;
        (i.e. PTSD diagnosis, health requirements, etc.) and the 3 hospitalization for evaluation&#xD;
        of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptor function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who are allergic to mifepristone, paroxetine or spironolactone, and subjects with&#xD;
        any contraindication to treatment with these agents (as described in their current&#xD;
        labeling), will be excluded from participation in the study.&#xD;
