  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to see if imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, STI571) can&#xD;
      improve CML in chronic phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To increase the proportion of patients achieving a complete cytogenetic response in patients&#xD;
      with Ph-positive early chronic phase CML using initial Gleevec therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the duration of cytogenetic response, duration of hematologic response and&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before treatment starts, patients will have a physical exam including medical history and&#xD;
      documentation of disease, blood tests, and a bone marrow study. The bone marrow will be&#xD;
      removed with a large needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients on this study will take 400 mg of imatinib daily (morning or evening). If you have&#xD;
      side effects, the dose may be lowered. If the response is not good, the dose of imatinib&#xD;
      mesylate will be increased to 800 mg daily (400 mg in the morning and 400 mg in the evening)&#xD;
      or may be decreased to 300 mg daily based on how the drug is tolerated. Imatinib mesylate&#xD;
      should be taken with a large glass of water. Bottles containing the tablets will be given to&#xD;
      the patient every 6 months. Unused supplies must be returned at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing 3 to 12 months of therapy, response to imatinib mesylate will be evaluated.&#xD;
      If the response is good, treatment with imatinib mesylate alone will be continued. Treatment&#xD;
      may be continued for up to 20 years, or as long as it is judged best to control the leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Update: June 2010:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests are recommended 2 times per year. Your doctor will discuss with you how often you&#xD;
      should have blood tests. Bone marrow will be done if your doctor thinks it is necessary to&#xD;
      check your disease. You must return to MD Anderson at least once every year. You may not need&#xD;
      a bone marrow test every visit, but you will have blood drawn to measure the amount of&#xD;
      disease you have. If the leukemia cannot be found for 2 years or longer on the blood test&#xD;
      called PCR which is done to measure the amount of disease you have, your doctor may talk to&#xD;
      you about stopping treatment with imatinib. If you and your doctor decide to stop your&#xD;
      therapy, you will have a blood test for PCR done every 3 to 6 months. You do not need to&#xD;
      return to MD Anderson to have this blood test done. You may have the blood taken by your&#xD;
      local doctor and mailed to MD Anderson. If the leukemia is found again by the PCR blood test,&#xD;
      your doctor may recommend that you restart treatment with imatinib. You may decide to stay on&#xD;
      treatment with imatinib even if your PCR blood test does not show any sign of leukemia for 2&#xD;
      years or longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Imatinib mesylate has been approved in CML. A total of 50&#xD;
      patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
