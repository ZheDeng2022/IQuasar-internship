  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety of an experimental vaccine against HIV and examine whether it&#xD;
      induces an immune response to HIV. A vaccine is a substance given to try to create resistance&#xD;
      or immunity to a disease or infection. The vaccine in this study is made from DNA (genetic&#xD;
      material) of four HIV proteins called 'gag', 'pol', 'Nef', and 'Env'. Injected into a human,&#xD;
      the viral DNA instructs the body to make small amounts of some HIV proteins. This study will&#xD;
      see if the body then creates an immune response to these proteins. Study participants cannot&#xD;
      catch HIV or AIDS from the DNA vaccine or any proteins made from it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 40 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical examination and blood and urine&#xD;
      tests. Women will also have a pregnancy test. Women enrolled in the study must either be&#xD;
      infertile (e.g., due to menopause or hysterectomy) or must agree either to abstain from&#xD;
      heterosexual sex or to practice birth control for at least 21 days before beginning the study&#xD;
      and throughout its duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the experimental vaccine or a&#xD;
      placebo (a salt solution that does not contain any active substance) and will be divided into&#xD;
      three groups, based on their entry into the study. Of the first seven people enrolled (Group&#xD;
      1), five will receive a 2-mg dose of vaccine and two will receive placebo. If the vaccine is&#xD;
      safe at this dose, then in Group 2, five people will receive a 4-mg dose of vaccine and two&#xD;
      will receive placebo. If this dose is safe, then in Group 3, thirty people will receive an&#xD;
      8-mg dose of vaccine and six will receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive three injections in an upper arm muscle-one injection a month&#xD;
      for three months-with a needle-less device called a Biojector 2000Â® (Registered Trademark).&#xD;
      At the time of each injection, participants will be observed for at least 1 hour after&#xD;
      immunization. At home, they will record their temperature and any symptoms they may&#xD;
      experience, including any effects at the injection site, for at least 7 days, or as long as&#xD;
      the symptoms remain. If symptoms occur, participants will report them immediately to the&#xD;
      clinic staff and, if necessary, come to the clinic for an examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have about 10 clinic visits during the study. Most visits will last about 2&#xD;
      hours; those on vaccination days will last about 4 hours. ...&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, randomized, controlled, double-blinded, dose-escalation study to examine&#xD;
      tolerability, dose, and immune response of an HIV DNA plasmid vaccine. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      this vaccine will be safe for human administration and elicit immune responses to HIV. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability in humans of VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP&#xD;
      and secondary objectives are to evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccine and social impact&#xD;
      of participating in an HIV-1 vaccine trial.&#xD;
