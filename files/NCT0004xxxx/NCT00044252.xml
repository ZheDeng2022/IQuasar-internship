      This study will measure and compare hormone levels in women with catamenial epilepsy&#xD;
      (epilepsy in which seizures are more frequent during menstrual periods), women with seizures&#xD;
      not related to their menstrual cycle, and normal control subjects. It will determine whether&#xD;
      there are differences among the three groups in their hormone levels or in how fast the&#xD;
      levels change. It will also examine what relationship, if any, exists between hormone changes&#xD;
      and seizures in women with catamenial epilepsy. The hormones under study include the gonadal&#xD;
      hormones estrone, estradiol and progesterone, and the neuroactive steroids allopregnanolone,&#xD;
      pregnenolone, and dehydroepiandrosterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who meet the following criteria may be eligible for this 3-month study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Between 18 and 45 years of age, with catamenial epilepsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Between 18 and 45 years of age, with seizures, but not catamenial epilepsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Between 18 and 45 years of age, without seizures&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have a physical examination at the beginning of the study, at each&#xD;
      clinic visit, and at completion or withdrawal from the study. In addition, they will undergo&#xD;
      the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first 2 months, all participants will keep a diary of their temperature and onset of&#xD;
      menses. Women with epilepsy will also record their seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroencephalography (EEG)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers will have a 45-minute EEG (recording of the electrical activity of the&#xD;
      brain) at the beginning of each menstrual cycle and each day during the menses. Women with&#xD;
      epilepsy will have continuous EEG monitoring for 8 days, beginning 5 days before their&#xD;
      menstrual period is expected. The continuous monitoring can be done on an outpatient basis,&#xD;
      using a portable EEG recording device, or as an inpatient, with admission to the hospital for&#xD;
      the 8 days of recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have a small blood sample (2 teaspoons) drawn once a day on days 10,&#xD;
      14, 17, 19 and 21 of their menstrual cycle and three times a day on day 6 and for a period of&#xD;
      8 days, starting 5 days before the expected menses and continuing for 3 days of the next&#xD;
      cycle. For the days with three blood draws, a small needle that can stay in place for up to&#xD;
      72 hours will be placed in the arm to avoid the discomfort of multiple needle sticks.&#xD;

      Objectives. This is an initial pilot study to acquire information upon which a more specific,&#xD;
      statistically rigorous follow-on investigation will be based. The objectives of the overall&#xD;
      project are: (1) to compare the absolute levels and rates of change in levels of gonadal and&#xD;
      neuroactive steroids in women with complex partial seizures and catamenial epilepsy with&#xD;
      those of women with non-catamenial epilepsy and women volunteers without epilepsy, and (2) to&#xD;
      determine if fluctuations in the levels of gonadal hormones (estrone, estradiol,&#xD;
      progesterone) and neuroactive steroids (allopregnanolone, pregnenolone and&#xD;
      dehydroepiandrosterone) correlate with seizure occurrence and the frequency of interictal&#xD;
      spikes/wave discharges in women with catamenial seizure exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Populations. Group A: adult women with complex partial seizures and catamenial&#xD;
      exacerbations. Group B: adult women with complex partial seizures without catamenial seizure&#xD;
      exacerbations. Group C: adult female volunteers without epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. Subjects will undergo baseline monitoring of seizures and menses for two months prior&#xD;
      to entry. Upon enrollment into the study, blood (10 ml) will be drawn for determinations of&#xD;
      estradiol, estrone, progesterone, allopregnanolone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and&#xD;
      pregnenolone in all study populations once daily at 08:30 hr on menstrual cycle days, 10, 14,&#xD;
      17, 19 and 21; and three times daily at 08:30, 13:30 and 18:00 starting 5 days before&#xD;
      expected menses and continuing for a total of 8 days as well as on menstrual cycle day 6.&#xD;
      During 8 days starting 5 days before expected menses interictal spike activity and seizures&#xD;
      will also be monitored continuously with EEG. Comparisons of the rates of change of hormone&#xD;
      levels and spike and seizure frequency will be made using the time derivatives of&#xD;
      fluctuations in hormone levels or hormone level ratios. Comparisons of time series data will&#xD;
      be made using nonlinear regression with an arbitrary (cubic spine) model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Parameters. The goal of this preliminary study is to obtain data regarding the&#xD;
      fluctuation, during one menstrual cycle, of several hormones in epileptic and non-epileptic&#xD;
      women of reproductive age. If the data show a relationship between (i) falling levels of&#xD;
      plasma progesterone and allopregnanolone, (ii) increased levels of DHEA or pregnenolone or&#xD;
      (iii) increased ratios of estrogen/progesterone, DHEA/progesterone, DHEA/allopregnanolone,&#xD;
      pregnenolone/allopregnanolone and seizure manifestations and EEG documented interictal spike&#xD;
      and seizure activity it would support the hypothesis that alterations in the levels of these&#xD;
      steroid hormones are related to seizure exacerbations in women with catamenial epilepsy.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group A subjects will be 8 women between 18 and 45 years of age who have complex partial&#xD;
        seizures with Type 1 catamenial seizure exacerbation as previously defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group B subjects will be 8 women between 18 and 45 years of age with complex partial&#xD;
        seizures who do not meet the criteria for catamenial seizure exacerbations. The presence or&#xD;
        absence of Type 1 catamenial seizure exacerbation will be documented by a standard seizure&#xD;
        calendar self-reported for at least two consecutive menstrual cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients receiving antiepileptic drug therapy will continue on their medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects must agree to use double barrier contraceptives, have an intrauterine device&#xD;
        in place or practice abstinence during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be recruited from the epilepsy patient population at the National Institutes&#xD;
        of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects in groups A and B will be matched for seizure frequency. Volunteers will be&#xD;
        matched with the subjects in group A by age. In this pilot study, no attempt will be made&#xD;
        to match patients according to anticonvulsant medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient will be properly informed of the nature and risks of the study and give&#xD;
        informed consent in writing, prior to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any of the following conditions are cause for exclusion from the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any illness requiring chronic drug therapy other than antiepileptic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any history of an illness likely to be adversely affected by the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Psychiatric hospitalization lasting more than 2 months at any time prior to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Use of tricyclic antidepressants within 4 weeks prior to randomization and/or&#xD;
        anti-psychotic drugs within 2 weeks prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children will not be included in this pilot study, because the profile of hormonal&#xD;
        secretion undergoes profound changes during puberty.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Use of illicit drugs, alcoholism or binge drinking as per medical history inventory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women who are unwilling to use an alternative to oral contraceptives for contraception,&#xD;
        (double barrier contraceptives, intrauterine device or abstinence), and establish that they&#xD;
        are currently not pregnant by submitting to a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exposure to any other investigational drug within 12 weeks prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any history of endocrine dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women will be excluded if they do not have regular menstrual cycle intervals between 27 and&#xD;
        32 days or if they are pregnant, nursing or taking oral contraceptives or other&#xD;
        reproductive hormones.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If a need should arise to change the antiepileptic regime during the study this subject&#xD;
        will be excluded and replaced with another patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women currently taking Phenobarbital or another barbiturate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women who are unwilling to refrain from strenuous exercise during the study.&#xD;
