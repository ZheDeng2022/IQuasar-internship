  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to test the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of&#xD;
      minocycline compared to placebo in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder without cure or known treatment that&#xD;
      significantly improves function. Loss of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord of ALS&#xD;
      patients causes the progressive symptoms. Laboratory studies have linked inducible nitric&#xD;
      oxide synthase (iNOS) and caspase enzyme activation to motor nerve cell death in ALS.&#xD;
      Minocycline-a medication currently approved by the FDA for treatment of bacterial&#xD;
      infections-is a tetracycline antibiotic with high central nervous system penetration when&#xD;
      taken orally. The drug inhibits the activity of iNOS and caspase enzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minocycline has been tested and shown to protect nerve cells in many scientific experiments.&#xD;
      It reduces cell death and prolongs survival in animal models of ALS, stroke, trauma,&#xD;
      Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease. It has been shown to be beneficial in many&#xD;
      different animal experiments of ALS, conducted in Europe, Canada and the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minocycline has been tested in 2 preliminary human trials and has been shown to be safe in&#xD;
      patients with ALS. It has been well tolerated in conjunction with riluzole (Rilutek), the&#xD;
      only currently FDA-approved medication for ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is the final important step in determining whether minocycline improves the course&#xD;
      of ALS. The principle objective of this clinical trial is to determine whether minocycline&#xD;
      slows disease progression and helps maintain function in patients with ALS. This multi-center&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study will select patients early in the course of ALS, when a&#xD;
      neuroprotective therapy may be most beneficial. The study will measure change in function (as&#xD;
      detected by ALSFRS-R scores), strength, pulmonary function, survival, and quality of life.&#xD;
      Participants will undergo monthly outpatient evaluations and analysis of laboratory and&#xD;
      adverse events. This is a 13-month study.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        To be eligible for enrollment in this study, subjects must meet the following eligibility&#xD;
        criteria within fourteen days prior to randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A clinical diagnosis of laboratory-supported probable, probable or definite ALS,&#xD;
             according to modified EL Escorial criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  FVC greater or equal to 75% of predicted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Onset of weakness within 3 years prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If patients are receiving riluzole they must be on a stable dose for at least the past&#xD;
             thirty days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing age must be non-lactating and surgically sterile or using an&#xD;
             effective method of birth control and have a negative pregnancy test (adequate birth&#xD;
             control includes use of intra-uterine device or oral contraceptives plus a barrier&#xD;
             method, e.g. condom, diaphragm).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to give signed informed consent that has been approved by your&#xD;
             Institutional Review Board (IRB).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Requirement for tracheotomy ventilation (or non-invasive ventilation &gt; 23 hours/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of other neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's&#xD;
             disease, etc).&#xD;
