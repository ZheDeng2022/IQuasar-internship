      The purpose of the study is to assess the rate of elimination of bacteria by levofloxacin in&#xD;
      middle ear fluid of children with a rapid and severe onset of infection and inflammation of&#xD;
      the middle ear who are at high risk for infections that are difficult to treat.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rapid and severe onset of middle ear infection is a common bacterial infection in children.&#xD;
      These infections, particularly when they occur early in life and are recurrent, are&#xD;
      associated with considerable disease and can lead to increasingly serious infections. This is&#xD;
      a multicenter study to determine the effectiveness of levofloxacin in eliminating bacteria in&#xD;
      the middle ear fluid of children between 6 months and 5 years of age with a rapid and severe&#xD;
      onset of infection and inflammation of the middle ear (who are at high risk for infections&#xD;
      that are difficult to treat). The study consists of a 1-day screening period when patients&#xD;
      will be tested for eligibility for the study; a 4 to 6-day treatment, blood collection,&#xD;
      possible collection of fluid from the middle ear, and assessment period; and a post-treatment&#xD;
      period to assess the status of the middle ear infection. All patients will receive&#xD;
      levofloxacin 2 times daily (up to a maximum daily dose of 500 mg) mixed with liquid and taken&#xD;
      by mouth for 10 days. Safety evaluations will include laboratory tests, physical&#xD;
      examinations, vital sign measurements, and recording of adverse events, including any report&#xD;
      of joint pain or signs and symptoms of joint disease. Effectiveness will be assessed by the&#xD;
      rate of elimination of the bacteria identified at the start of the study and by signs and&#xD;
      symptoms, as well as microscopic evidence that the patient is cured of the middle ear&#xD;
      infection. The study hypothesis is that levofloxacin will be effective in eliminating&#xD;
      bacteria in the middle ear fluid of children with a rapid and severe onset of infection and&#xD;
      inflammation of the middle ear and who are at high risk for infections that are difficult to&#xD;
      treat. Levofloxacin 10 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg) 2 times daily (up to a maximum daily dose&#xD;
      of 500 mg) mixed with liquid and taken by mouth for 10 days&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with signs and symptoms of rapid onset of severe infection of the middle ear&#xD;
             defined as: either fluid draining from the middle ear (with a minimum of 2 of the&#xD;
             following: decreased or absent eardrum mobility seen on physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  yellow or white discoloration of the eardrum&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  opaque eardrum) and (a minimum of 1 of the following: ear pain within 24 hours of the&#xD;
             start of the study including the child's unexpected tugging or rubbing of the ear&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  marked redness of the eardrum&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  distinct fullness or bulging of the eardrum) or rapid onset of severe drainage of pus&#xD;
             from the external ear lasting less than 48 hours and not due to inflammation of the&#xD;
             external ear&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At risk for difficult-to-treat middle ear infection defined as having a minimum of 1&#xD;
             of the following: recurrent middle ear infection (defined as &gt;=3 episodes, including&#xD;
             the current episode, of rapid onset of rapid onset of severe middle ear infection&#xD;
             during the 6 months before the study or &gt;=4 episodes, including the current episode,&#xD;
             of rapid onset of rapid onset of severe middle ear infection during the year before&#xD;
             the study), persistent middle ear infection defined by signs and symptoms of rapid&#xD;

             treatment (with the exception of amoxicillin/clavulanate that included &gt;=90&#xD;
             milligrams/kilograms/day [mg/kg/day] of amoxicillin)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently taking antibiotic medication to prevent middle ear infection (must be&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Completed treatment with an antibiotic intended to treat middle ear infection within&#xD;
