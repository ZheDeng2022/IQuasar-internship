  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, open-label, multicenter, randomized, comparative study of Campath versus&#xD;
      chlorambucil as front line therapy in patients with progressive B-Cell Lymphocytic Leukemia&#xD;
      (B-CLL). Eligible patients must have previously untreated, Rai stage I-IV disease, and be&#xD;
      experiencing progression of their B-CLL requiring treatment. Patients who meet all&#xD;
      eligibility criteria may be randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either Campath or&#xD;
      chlorambucil. An estimated 284 patients (142 per treatment arm) from approximately 40 or more&#xD;
      investigational sites will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms.&#xD;
