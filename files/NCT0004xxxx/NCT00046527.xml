  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paclitaxel (Taxol, Bristol-Meyers Squibb) has been shown to be very effective against&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer, as well as other cancers. Because the Taxol formulation of&#xD;
      paclitaxel is dissolved in Cremophor, an organic solvent containing castor oil, and ethanol,&#xD;
      prolonged intravenous administration times are required; and because the solvent has caused&#xD;
      hypersensitivity reactions, a premedication schedule is required. ABI-007 is a new anticancer&#xD;
      medication containing the same active ingredient as Taxol, paclitaxel, but formulated as a&#xD;
      protein-stabilized material that is suspended in salt water and administered intravenously.&#xD;
      The time of administration is reduced, the dose of paclitaxel can be higher than is safe for&#xD;
      Taxol, and there is no premedication required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will determine the efficacy of this new formulation of paclitaxel, as compared to&#xD;
      Taxol, for patients with metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label comparative study, so patients will be randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      either the Taxol or ABI-007 forms of paclitaxel, but will know what medication they are&#xD;
      receiving. Treatment will be repeated every three weeks unless adverse events or treatment&#xD;
      failure require discontinuing study medication.&#xD;

      Taxol (Bristol-Meyers Squibb) is active against carcinomas of the ovary, breast, lung,&#xD;
      esophagus and head and neck. A number of dose schedules of Taxol have been tested in breast&#xD;
      cancer. Initial trials used 250 mg/m2 as a continuous infusion over 24 hours. Subsequently,&#xD;
      shorter infusions of Taxol over three hours were tested at a dose of 175 mg/m2, with response&#xD;
      rates of 30%-40%. Phase II studies using higher doses of Taxol at 200-250 mg/m2 had a&#xD;
      response rate of 56% in metastatic breast cancer patients. However, at these doses,&#xD;
      significant toxicities occurred, including neuropathy. There was a median granulocyte count&#xD;
      nadir at 100-200 cells/mm3 for the majority of courses administered. There were also&#xD;
      significant side effects associated with hypersensitivity to the Taxol vehicle, Cremophor-EL.&#xD;
      These hypersensitivity reactions require a premedication schedule that includes a&#xD;
      corticosteroid, an H2 antagonist and an antihistamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abraxis BioScience is testing a reformulated form of paclitaxel without Cremophor. This&#xD;
      formulation is a protein-stabilized, nanoparticle suspension of paclitaxel and human serum&#xD;
      albumin in normal saline. The potential advantages of this formulation are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Higher tolerated doses, with greater efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Longer drug persistence in tumor as a result of the nanoparticle formulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduced infusion time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduced risk of hypersensitivity with no required premedication schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  More rapid distribution of paclitaxel to the tissues based on pharmacokinetic data&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate ABI-007, as compared to Taxol, in patients with metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
