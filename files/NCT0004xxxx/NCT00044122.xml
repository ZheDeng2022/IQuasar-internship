  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine growth factors that promote and inhibit mast cell proliferation&#xD;
      resulting in mastocytosis, a disease of excessive mast cells in the body. These cells can&#xD;
      release chemicals that cause itching, blisters, flushing, bone pain and abdominal pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients up to 80 years of age with mastocytosis may be eligible for this 1-day study.&#xD;
      Participants will have one visit at NIH lasting up to 8 hours, during which they will undergo&#xD;
      the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory studies, if medically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to identify genetic changes important in the growth, development, and&#xD;
           functioning of mast cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the bone marrow procedure, the skin over the hipbone and the outer surface of the bone&#xD;
      itself are numbed with local anesthesia. Then, a special needle is inserted into the hipbone&#xD;
      and about 1 tablespoon of bone marrow is drawn into a syringe. Another needle is inserted&#xD;
      into the same area to collect a small piece of the bone marrow. Additional procedures may&#xD;
      include allergen testing, urinalysis, and 24-hour urine collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive an evaluation of their mastocytosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to examine those growth potentiating and inhibiting factors which&#xD;
      regulate mast cell number and survival in patients with mastocytosis, and to explore the&#xD;
      molecular basis of the disease process in hopes of improving therapy. Patients will carry the&#xD;
      diagnosis of mastocytosis based on abnormal bone marrow biopsy and aspirate, abnormal skin&#xD;
      biopsy, presence of urticaria pigmentosa, and if available, elevated serum tryptase level &gt;&#xD;
      20 ng/ml and the presence of aberrant mast cell morphology and surface markers of CD2 and&#xD;
      CD25. Mastocytosis patients will include children and adults from zero years to 80 years of&#xD;
      age. Unaffected relatives (age 2 to 80 years) may also be enrolled. The protocol is&#xD;
      designated for up to a 1-year enrollment period; with only a small number of enrolled&#xD;
      patients that will stay on study for more than one visit, based on investigator assessment of&#xD;
      contribution to study objectives. Participants will undergo standard physical exam, medical&#xD;
      history review, and blood collection for clinical and research laboratory evaluations. We&#xD;
      will collect clinical data and biological specimens for research evaluation from individuals&#xD;
      undergoing clinically indicated diagnostic procedures. Some patients may participate in&#xD;
      research evaluations including buccal swab collection, dietary intake assessment, stool&#xD;
      collection, exercise challenge, microbiome studies, and activity tracking. These studies are&#xD;
      optional. Patients may be asked to re-enter this protocol at a later time for further&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
