  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study uses positron emission tomography (PET) to examine brain function and signaling&#xD;
      involving phospholipids, and to see how signaling is related to blood flow. Much of the brain&#xD;
      is composed of fatty molecules called phospholipids. These molecules are involved in the way&#xD;
      brain cells signal each other to direct brain function. Brain disease may change&#xD;
      phospholipids and disturb brain structure and signaling. Studies of brain phospholipid&#xD;
      composition and metabolism may help clarify how the brain works in healthy people or stops&#xD;
      working effectively in disease states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers between 18 and 45 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates&#xD;
      are screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
      Participants undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PET scanning as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues and organs. For&#xD;
      this procedure, the subject lies on a table that is moved into a metal cylinder (the scanner)&#xD;
      and wears earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur during the scanning&#xD;
      process. Scanning time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours, with most scans lasting between 45&#xD;
      and 90 minutes. Subjects may be asked to lie still for up to 30 minutes at a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the PET scan, a catheter (thin plastic tube) is inserted into an artery in the subject's&#xD;
      wrist or elbow crease to collect blood samples during the procedure, and a second catheter is&#xD;
      placed in a vein in the opposite arm to inject radioactive tracers. The subject lies on the&#xD;
      scanner bed, wearing a special facemask and goggles. The mask helps hold the head still&#xD;
      during the scans, and the goggles either block all light or administer bright flashing&#xD;
      lights. Radioactive water is injected into the vein, followed by a 1-minute PET scan to&#xD;
      measure brain blood flow. This is repeated three more times. Then, a radioactive fatty acid&#xD;
      is injected into the vein, followed by a 1-hour PET scan to measure brain phospholipid&#xD;
      metabolism. This is repeated once. The images of blood flow and phospholipid metabolism in&#xD;
      the different regions of the brain under the conditions of darkness and during visual&#xD;
      stimulation provide information on how and where the brain responds to visual stimulation.&#xD;
      The entire procedure takes about 3 hours.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The binding of neurotransmitters and certain drugs to neuroreceptors in the brain is&#xD;
      considered to modify cognition and behavior by activating certain receptor-coupled effector&#xD;
      enzymes and initiating signal transduction cascades. One of these effector enzymes is&#xD;
      phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which when activated will release arachidonic acid (AA) from&#xD;
      phospholipids and initiate the AA cascade (Fitzpatrick and Soberman, 2001). AA and its&#xD;
      eicosanoid metabolites have multiple biological actions. We have developed an imaging method&#xD;
      to quantify and localize brain signal transduction involving PLA2 and AA in unanesthetized&#xD;
      rats and monkeys, using quantitative autoradiography or positron emission tomography (PET),&#xD;
      and radiolabeled AA. The aim of this protocol is to extend this method to humans with PET,&#xD;
      when brain imaging AA signaling in two experimental conditions (dark and visual flash&#xD;
      stimulation at a frequency of 3 Hz or 8Hz) in the same subject in the same PET session.&#xD;
      Radioactive [1-11C]AA will be injected intravenously in each condition, and PET will be used&#xD;
      to measure its incorporation coefficient k* in individual brain regions. Animal studies and&#xD;
      modeling have shown that the incorporation coefficient is proportion to PLA2 activation and&#xD;
      the release of AA from brain phospholipids (Rapoport, 2003). In addition, [15O]H20 will be&#xD;
      injected in each condition to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Based on our prior&#xD;
      studies in human subjects of rCBF during visual activation by flashing lights at different&#xD;
      frequencies (Mentis et al., 1997; Mentis et al., 1998; Mentis et al., 1996), we hypothesize&#xD;
      that statistically significant increments in rCBF and [11C]AA incorporation into brain will&#xD;
      be increased during visual activation compared with the dark (unactivated) condition. These&#xD;
      increments should be evident in primary visual cortex, association visual cortex, thalamus,&#xD;
      and frontal cortex. If our hypothesis proves correct and our method to measure [11C]AA&#xD;
      incorporation both during stimulation and in the dark proves feasible in the same subject in&#xD;
      the PET session, we believe that the method could be applied generally in humans to examine&#xD;
      brain PLA2-related signal transduction during physiological or pharmacological activation and&#xD;
      in healthy aging (Giovacchini et al., In press) and disease, particularly Parkinson and&#xD;
      Alzheimer disease (Hayakawa et al., 2001; Nariai et al., 1991).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to study 30 normal volunteers, each of whom will be subjected two stimulation&#xD;
      conditions in the same PET session, visual stimulation at a frequency of 3 or 8 Hz, or a dark&#xD;
      condition (0 Hz).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each PET scan session will last approximately 3 hours. Each subject will receive a total of&#xD;
      four [15O]H20 injections to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), and two [11C]AA&#xD;
      infusions to measure incorporation k* for AA during a single PET scan session. He/she will&#xD;
      have an arterial catheter and venous line inserted during the entire session, and one&#xD;
      transmission scan at the beginning of the session. The order of the scans will be randomized.&#xD;
      The order of 4 blood flow scans will be: Rest-Photic Activation-Photic Activation-Rest OR&#xD;
      Photic Activation-Rest-Rest-Photic Activation. The order of two [C11]AA scans will be&#xD;
      Rest-Photic Stimulation Or Photic Stimulation-Rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulation will be conducted via LED goggles at a flash frequency of 3 Hz and 8 Hz, evenly&#xD;
      divided among the 30 subjects, and at 0 Hz (dark condition). Statistical parametric mapping&#xD;
      and other statistical procedures will be used to identify brain regions in which k* for AA&#xD;
      and/or rCBF is elevated at 3 Hz compared with the dark condition; at 8 Hz compared with the&#xD;
      dark condition; and at 8 Hz compared with 3 Hz condition.&#xD;
