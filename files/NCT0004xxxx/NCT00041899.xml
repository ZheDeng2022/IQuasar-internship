      This study will compare blood levels of the drug CDB-2914 in healthy women receiving the&#xD;
      compound in crystalline powder form with the blood levels of women receiving an identical&#xD;
      dose of the drug in micronized form. Generally, absorption of compounds made into a&#xD;
      crystalline powder is less than that of micronized compounds, in which the substance is&#xD;
      processed into many similar-sized particles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CDB-2914 is a manmade hormone similar to the hormones cortisol and progesterone. The National&#xD;
      Institute of Child Health and Human Development is evaluating the ability of this drug to&#xD;
      treat reproductive conditions. Institute studies have shown that CDB-2914 can increase the&#xD;
      time to produce a mature egg in the ovary, and cause an early menstrual period, CDB-2914&#xD;
      might be used to treat fibroids and endometriosis pain. As part of its evaluation for these&#xD;
      purposes, this study will determine if absorption of crystalline and micronized powder forms&#xD;
      of CDB-2914 result in the same blood levels of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women between 18 and 50 years of age who are in good health may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Premenopausal women must not be pregnant (as determined by a urine pregnancy test) or&#xD;
      breastfeeding and must practice birth control during the study. Candidates will be screened&#xD;
      with a medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests. Women who use an IUD&#xD;
      for contraception are advised to also use a barrier contraceptive (diaphragm or condom) the&#xD;
      week after taking CDB-2914.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center inpatient service or the outpatient&#xD;
      day hospital twice for pharmacokinetic studies (blood drawing to measure blood levels of&#xD;
      CDB-2914 after a single dose of the drug). They will come to the Clinical Center at 7:00 a.m.&#xD;
      and have a catheter (thin plastic tube) inserted into an arm vein for drawing blood for the&#xD;
      first 24 hours of the study. Eight milliliters (about 2 teaspoons) of blood will be drawn 5&#xD;
      minutes and 1 minute before taking CDB-2914 (in either crystalline or micronized powder form)&#xD;
      and then at the following times after taking the drug: 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 150&#xD;
      and 180 minutes (3 hours), and 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 hours (5 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take all their meals in the day hospital or ward during the first 26 hours&#xD;
      of sampling. Inpatients will leave the hospital after the 24-hour blood draw and return as an&#xD;
      outpatient on days 2 through 5. At the 48-hour time point, additional blood will be drawn to&#xD;
      check blood counts and chemistries, and for liver and kidney function tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, compounds that are structurally similar to the naturally occurring steroids&#xD;
      have been examined for their ability to block or substitute for the action of the naturally&#xD;
      occurring steroids. On occasion, these substances have both effects, depending on the tissue&#xD;
      that is examined or on the physiology of the person receiving the agent. The development of&#xD;
      these kinds of compounds, called selective hormone receptor modulators, may provide new&#xD;
      treatments that are targeted to specific organs or tissues. One example of these compounds is&#xD;
      the selective estrogen receptor modulator raloxifene, which blocks estrogen action at the&#xD;
      uterus, and acts like estrogen at the bone, allowing its use in post-menopausal women as&#xD;
      estrogen replacement therapy without requiring progesterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates the progesterone receptor modulator CDB-2914. Earlier studies using&#xD;
      single doses of this compound show that it can slow ovarian and uterine development during&#xD;
      the menstrual cycle, and can induce menses, depending on when it is given during the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many steroids have an improved bioavailability when given in a micronized formulation.&#xD;
      Previous studies with CDB-2914 have used crystalline powder up to a dose of 200 mg. We wish&#xD;
      to compare the pharmacokinetic profile of crystalline and micronized CDB-2914, 10 mg. The&#xD;
      drug will be given as a single oral dose and blood will be drawn frequently over 12 hours and&#xD;
      then daily for five days for measurement of the compound.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Female gender--to evaluate effects in the target population for clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In good health. Chronic medication use is acceptable except for glucocorticoid use. Other&#xD;
        chronic medication use may be acceptable at discretion of the principal investigator.&#xD;
        Interval use of over-the-counter drugs is acceptable but must be recorded.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Using mechanical (condoms, diaphragms), abstinence, oral contraceptive, IUD or&#xD;
