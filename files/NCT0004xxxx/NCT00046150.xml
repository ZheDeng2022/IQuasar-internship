  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety of HMR 1964 and insulin aspart when used&#xD;
      in external pumps with respect to catheter occlusions, GHb assessment, insulin doses, blood&#xD;
      glucose parameters, hypoglycemic episodes, unexplained hyperglycemia, adverse events,&#xD;
      laboratory data, and vital signs.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects meeting all of the following criteria will be considered for enrollment into the&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women above the age of 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women are either not of childbearing potential (surgically sterile, or postmenopausal&#xD;
             for more than 2 years) or are not pregnant and agree to use a reliable contraceptive&#xD;
             measure for the duration of the study. Reliable contraceptive measures include the&#xD;
             follows: systemic contraceptive (oral, implant, injections), diaphragm with&#xD;
             intravaginal spermicide, cervical cap, intrauterine device, or condom with spermicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Type 1 diabetes mellitus as established in the medical history (for the purpose of&#xD;
             this protocol: onset of diabetes under the age of 40 and has required continuous&#xD;
             insulin therapy since diagnosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 1 year of continuous insulin treatment with at least 6 months of continuous&#xD;
             subcutaneous insulin infusion treatment immediately prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of the same type of external insulin pump (MiniMed programmable pump, or&#xD;
             Disetronic pump type H Tron Plus V 100 or D Tron) for at least 3 months prior to study&#xD;
             entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HbA1c &lt;8.5% measured at visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability and willingness to perform blood glucose monitoring using the sponsor-provided&#xD;
             blood glucose meter and subject diary at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Informed consent must be obtained in writing for all subjects at enrollment into the study&#xD;
        (see Section 12.3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects presenting with any of the following will not be included in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active proliferative diabetic retinopathy, as defined by the application of focal or&#xD;
             panretinal photocoagulation or vitrectomy, in the 6 months prior to visit 1, or any&#xD;
             other unstable (rapidly progressing) retinopathy that may require surgical treatment&#xD;
             (including laser photocoagulation) during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diabetes other than type 1 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of serious ketosis episode requiring hospitalization in the 3 previous months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of abscess at the infusion site in the previous 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pancreatectomised subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have undergone pancreas and or islet cell transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Likelihood of requiring treatment during the study period with drugs not permitted by&#xD;
             the study protocol (see Section 6.2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any investigational drug in the last month before visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of seizure disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity to insulin or insulin analogues or any other excipients in&#xD;
             the HMR1964 or insulin aspart formulation (see the Global Investigators Brochure [7]&#xD;
             and the insulin aspart SPC [13] for a list of excipients).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically relevant cardiovascular, hepatic, neurologic, endocrine, active cancer, or&#xD;
             other major systemic disease making implementation of the protocol or interpretation&#xD;
             of the study results difficult or would, in the opinion of the investigator, preclude&#xD;
             the safe participation of the subject in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Impaired hepatic function, as shown by but not limited to ALT or AST greater than&#xD;
             twice the normal upper limit measured at visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Impaired renal function, as shown by but not limited to serum creatinine &gt;177&#xD;
             micromol/L (&gt;2.0 mg/dL) measured at visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy (as determined by pregnancy blood test at visit 1) or breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Night shift workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mental condition rendering the subject unable to understand the nature, scope, and&#xD;
             possible consequences of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject unlikely to comply with protocol, e.g. an inability and unwillingness to&#xD;
             participate in adequate training, an uncooperative attitude, inability to return for&#xD;
             follow-up visits, and unlikelihood of completing the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Employee of the sponsor or of sponsor representatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have previously been treated with HMR1964.&#xD;
