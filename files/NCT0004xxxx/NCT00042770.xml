      RATIONALE: It is not yet known whether pleurodesis using a chest tube with infusions of talc&#xD;
      is more effective in improving quality of life than pleurodesis using a small catheter in&#xD;
      treating malignant pleural effusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of a chest tube and talc&#xD;
      with that of a small catheter in treating malignant pleural effusion in patients who have&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the success rate in patients with cancer who undergo pleurodesis using a&#xD;
           standard chest tube with talc slurry vs a small (PleurX) catheter for the treatment of a&#xD;
           symptomatic unilateral malignant pleural effusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the 30-day effusion control rate in patients treated with these procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare quality of life in these patients at 7-14 and 30-37 days after treatment with&#xD;
           these procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare patient acceptance and satisfaction after treatment with these procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the level of symptoms and dyspnea experienced by patients treated with these&#xD;
           procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the types, causes, and rates of early technical failures of these procedures in&#xD;
           these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the 30-day effusion recurrences in patients treated with these procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the 60-day durability of pleurodesis in patients treated with these procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the mortality, morbidity, and common surgical complications in patients treated&#xD;
           with these procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to&#xD;
      inpatient status (yes vs no), disease type (breast vs lung vs other), and concurrent systemic&#xD;
      chemotherapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients undergo placement of a standard pleural chest tube. Within 36 hours of&#xD;
           chest tube placement, patients undergo pleurodesis comprising intrapleural&#xD;
           administration of talc slurry once followed by clamping of the chest tube for 2 hours&#xD;
           while different patient positions are used to distribute the talc. The chest tube is&#xD;
           then unclamped to allow continuous drainage. When the chest tube drainage is less than&#xD;
           150 mL over 24 hours, pleurodesis is assumed and the chest tube is removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients undergo pleurodesis comprising placement of a small (PleurX) catheter&#xD;
           followed by pleural drainage for up to 90 minutes once daily. When the catheter drainage&#xD;
           is less than 30 mL per day for 3 consecutive days, pleurodesis is assumed and the&#xD;
           catheter is removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life and dyspnea are assessed at baseline and then at 7-14 and 30-37 days after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed at 30 and 60 days.&#xD;
