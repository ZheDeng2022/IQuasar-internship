      This two-part study will determine whether stem cells (primitive cells produced by the bone&#xD;
      marrow that can develop into blood cells or other types of cells) can be pushed out into the&#xD;
      bloodstream, relocate in the heart, and grow new heart muscle and blood vessels in patients&#xD;
      with chest pain caused by narrowing of their coronary (heart) arteries. The new blood vessels&#xD;
      may enable patients to do more activities before experiencing chest pain. Part 1 of the study&#xD;
      will evaluate in a small number of patients whether an increase in white blood cells&#xD;
      following administration of G-CSF (a drug used to move stem cells from the bone marrow to the&#xD;
      bloodstream) is safe in people with coronary heart disease. Part 2 will evaluate the effects&#xD;
      of the circulating stem cells on heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 21 years of age and older with coronary artery blockage that limits blood flow to&#xD;
      the heart (as shown by coronary angiography within 6 months of entering the study) and causes&#xD;
      chest pain that interferes with the ability to carry out daily living activities may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with blood tests, an exercise test,&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 24-hour Holter monitoring of heart rate and rhythm.&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Patients will be hospitalized at the NIH Clinical Center for 5 days. On the first day&#xD;
      after admission, an indwelling catheter (short plastic tube) will be placed in an arm vein to&#xD;
      avoid multiple needle sticks for blood sampling. Patients will then exercise on a treadmill.&#xD;
      Blood samples will be drawn before the exercise test and 2 hours after the test. The next 2&#xD;
      days, patients will receive a daily injection of G-CSF under the skin. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      drawn every day for 5 days to monitor the effect of G-CSF on moving cells into the&#xD;
      bloodstream. Additional samples will be drawn to determine the effects of G-CSF on the number&#xD;
      of stem cells that become heart cells, as well as any effects on blood clotting ability.&#xD;
      After discharge for the hospital, patients will return to the clinic 2 weeks after the&#xD;
      initiation of G-CSF treatment for a physical examination, blood tests, and a treadmill&#xD;
      exercise test. One month after the initiation of treatment, patients will return to the&#xD;
      clinic for a physical examination, blood tests, treadmill exercise test, an MRI study, and&#xD;
      fitting with a Holter monitor for 24-hour heart monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Patients will be hospitalized at the NIH Clinical Center for 5 days, undergoing the&#xD;
      same procedures as in Part 1, except they will receive G-CSF for 5 days instead of 2. They&#xD;
      will also undergo the same procedures detailed for the 2-week and 1-month follow-up visits.&#xD;
      Then, at 3 months they will again return to the clinic for a physical examination, routine&#xD;
      blood tests, and a treadmill exercise test. This concludes formal participation in the study.&#xD;
      However, patients are requested to return to the outpatient clinic once a year for follow-up.&#xD;

      Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or stenting and coronary artery bypass surgery&#xD;
      are effective therapies for relief of angina caused by coronary artery disease (CAD). However&#xD;
      many patients with CAD have failed attempts at conventional revascularization or remain&#xD;
      symptomatic despite optimized anti-ischemic medical therapy. For this growing number of&#xD;
      patients, there is a need for novel therapeutic approaches. Experimental studies in animal&#xD;
      models indicate that primitive pluripotential cells (or 'stem' cells) from bone marrow may&#xD;
      localize to ischemic myocardium, differentiate along endothelial, smooth muscle, and&#xD;
      cardiomyocyte lineages, and improve cardiac performance. A recent report has suggested that&#xD;
      granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, which mobilizes stem cells from bone marrow&#xD;
      into the circulation, may improve collateral blood flow to ischemic myocardium in patients&#xD;
      with CAD. The purpose of this protocol is to test the effectiveness of a related cytokine,&#xD;
      granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), that more potently mobilizes stem cells from&#xD;
      bone marrow, for the relief of myocardial ischemia and improvement in myocardial&#xD;
      contractility during stress in patients with CAD who are not good candidates for conventional&#xD;
      revascularization, or who do not want further attempts at conventional revascularization, and&#xD;
      who remain symptomatic on medical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that G-CSF will improve blood flow to the myocardium and the left&#xD;
      ventricular contractile response to stress by mobilizing pluripotential cells from bone&#xD;
      marrow with localization to ischemic regions of the heart, resulting in development of new&#xD;
      arteries and regeneration of contractile cardiomyocytes. The primary end-point of the Phase I&#xD;
      (safety) component of this study is absence of cardiovascular adverse events associated with&#xD;
      increased white blood cell counts following G-CSF administration in patients with CAD. The&#xD;
      secondary end-point for Phase I is determination of platelet aggregation and coagulation&#xD;
      activation before and during G-CSF administration. The primary endpoint of the Phase II&#xD;
      (efficacy) component of this study is improvement in magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI)-determined regional left ventricular contractility and gadolinium distribution (as an&#xD;
      index of blood flow) during stress at 1 month following G-CSF administration compared with&#xD;
      pretreatment baseline measurements. Secondary Phase II end-points will include determinations&#xD;
      of 1) efficacy of stem and endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) mobilization by G-CSF, and 2)&#xD;
      changes in treadmill exercise duration associated with G-CSF treatment. Demonstration of safe&#xD;
      and effective cytokine-induced mobilization of stem cells with cardiac benefit could result&#xD;
      in an important therapeutic option for CAD patients who have few alternatives for the relief&#xD;
      of myocardial ischemia and angina pectoris.&#xD;
