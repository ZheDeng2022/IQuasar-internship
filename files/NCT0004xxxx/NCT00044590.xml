  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) occurrence is higher in rural than in urban populations of&#xD;
      industrialized countries. Epidemiologic and human tissue studies suggest that pesticides may&#xD;
      be responsible for causing dopaminergic cell death at increased rates. While many&#xD;
      pathophysiologic pathways may be involved in the neurodegeneration responsible for PD,&#xD;
      genetic factors are likely to determine a general susceptibility to neurodegeneration.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      While many pathophysiologic pathways may be involved in the neurodegeneration responsible for&#xD;
      PD, genetic factors are likely to determine a general susceptibility to neurodegeneration.&#xD;
      There are a number of genetic polymorphisms of genes such as those coding for the cytochrome&#xD;
      p450 super-family of genes referred to as 'susceptibility genes'. However, they are generally&#xD;
      not sufficient to cause disease unless a person encounters exposure to an environmental&#xD;
      toxin: the disease is caused by a gene-environment interaction. Thus, it is imperative to&#xD;
      assess genetic susceptibility in individuals exposed to a toxin. We will test the&#xD;
      gene-environment interaction hypothesis by conducting an epidemiologic population-based&#xD;
      case-control study of newly diagnosed PD patients from three rural California counties: Kern,&#xD;
      Fresno, and Tulare. Over a four year period, we expect to collect 400 cases referred to us by&#xD;
      local neurologists, farm worker clinics, and Parkinson's foundations. For each case, one&#xD;
      population control will be selected at random from residential parcel maps and Medicare&#xD;
      databases and, in addition, one unaffected sibling control and - when possible - affected&#xD;
      siblings to avoid potential biases and inefficiencies inherent in the use of each type of&#xD;
      control. For each study subject, an environmental and occupational pesticide exposure&#xD;
      estimate will be derived using California pesticide-use reporting (PUR) data and information&#xD;
      about pesticide application on crops in combination with crop patterns shown in satellite&#xD;
      images and aerial photographs; in addition, extensive exposure interviews will be conducted&#xD;
      with all study subjects. In a three-tiered approach to examine the effects of&#xD;
      gene-environment interactions we will: 1) test for association (and linkage) of PD to&#xD;
      selected loci associated with PD in earlier studies using multiallelic repeat markers and&#xD;
      genotyping; 2) test for association using intragenic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)&#xD;
      of 50 candidate genes arrayed to create &quot;the PD array&quot;; and 3) use future technical&#xD;
      possibilities to screen for genome wide associations using array technology to scan&#xD;
      5,000-10,000 SNPs throughout the genome. Data analysis will employ hierarchical modeling&#xD;
      procedures to take into account multiple comparison issues and to incorporate prior knowledge&#xD;
      such as increased neurotoxicity due to the interaction of gene products and chemicals.&#xD;

        Our case population consists of patients with newly diagnosed idiopathic Parkinson's&#xD;
        disease living in central California; they will be patients who have elicited care from&#xD;
        health care providers. Controls will be randomly selected from Medicare records and matched&#xD;
        to cases according to age, race, and sex.&#xD;

          -  first Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis after January 1998&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  currently living in one of the three target counties (Kern, Tulare, Fresno)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have lived in California for at least 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        Case population exclusion criteria:&#xD;

          -  have not been diagnosed with idiopathic PD&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  first PD diagnosis before January 1998&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  currently living outside of Kern, Tulare, or Fresno counties&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have lived in California for fewer than 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        Control population inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have never been diagnosed with PD&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  currently living in one of the three target counties (Kern, Tulare, Fresno)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have lived in California for at least 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        Control population exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have been diagnosed with PD&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  currently living outside of Kern, Tulare, or Fresno counties&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have lived in California for fewer than 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        For each patient, one or more unaffected sibling controls and one population control will&#xD;
        be recruited. The population control are being selected randomly from Medicare records (95%&#xD;
        of all controls) and residential parcel listings (for those patients younger than 65 years&#xD;
        of age only). The controls are being marginally matched to cases according to 5-year age&#xD;
        categories (e.g. 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, etc.), race (white, African-American, Asian,&#xD;
        Hispanic, other), and sex. All study cases by definition will be patients who elicited care&#xD;
        from health care providers. We are aiming to enroll every newly diagnosed PD patient into&#xD;
        our study and expect patient population participating in our study that is as diverse as&#xD;
        the rural population.&#xD;
