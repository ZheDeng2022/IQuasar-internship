    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of six escalating&#xD;
      doses of SCIO-469 in RA patients. SCIO-469 belongs to a new class of treatments that inhibit&#xD;
      p38 kinase, a stimulatory modulator of pro-inflammatory factors including tumor necrosis&#xD;
      factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), all of which&#xD;
      are known to contribute to both symptoms and disease progression in patients with Rheumatoid&#xD;
      Arthritis.&#xD;

      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating study will&#xD;
      assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK and pharmacodynamics of SCIO-469 in patients&#xD;
      with active RA who also are receiving methotrexate. A total of 120 subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned and treated in one of seven dose groups with the total daily dose of SCIO-469&#xD;
      ranging from 0 to 180 mg. Dose groups will be staggered over four Treatment Periods. Safety&#xD;
      and available PK data from a Treatment Period with lower dose groups will be reviewed prior&#xD;
      to initiating higher dose groups in the next Treatment Period. Placebo subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized in all Treatment Periods. Study drug will be taken for 30 days. Each subject will&#xD;
      be followed for approximately 4 weeks after completing the 30-day Treatment Period. Safety&#xD;
      will be assessed by way of physical examination, medical history, vital signs, orthostatic&#xD;
      vital signs, chest radiograph, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory&#xD;
      evaluations (including serum chemistry, hematology, qualitative urinalysis, and liver&#xD;
      function tests), purified protein derivative test for tuberculosis, neurological tests,&#xD;
      adverse events, and concomitant medications through out the study. Study drug will be&#xD;
      administered for 30 days at one of the following dosage strengths; 30 mg, 60 mg, 90 mg. One&#xD;
      group of subjects will get 60 mg for one week followed by 120 for one week followed by 180 mg&#xD;
      for two weeks.&#xD;
