  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety of an experimental vaccine called Modified Vaccinia Virus&#xD;
      Ankara (MVA) for use against the smallpox virus. It will also investigate how many injections&#xD;
      of MVA are needed to produce immunity against vaccinia virus, which is closely related to the&#xD;
      smallpox virus. An effective smallpox vaccine exists, but it can cause side effects that, on&#xD;
      rare occasions, can be life-threatening. The FDA gave new license approval for Dryvax on&#xD;
      10/25/02, but has not been used in the general population since smallpox was eradicated&#xD;
      worldwide. Both the MVA and Dryvax® (Registered Trademark) vaccines are made using the&#xD;
      vaccinia virus, however the MVA vaccine contains a more attenuated, or weakened, form of the&#xD;
      virus. [http://www.fda.gov/cber/products/smalwye102502.htm]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 30 years of age, who have never been vaccinated with&#xD;
      a smallpox vaccine, may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a&#xD;
      medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests, including an HIV test and a&#xD;
      pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MVA, placebo and Dryvax® (Registered Trademark) will be administered by different methods.&#xD;
      The MVA vaccine and placebo are injected into an arm muscle with a needle and syringe. The&#xD;
      Dryvax® (Registered Trademark) vaccine is administered, as it was for many years, with a&#xD;
      special forked needle that is poked lightly into the skin of the upper arm, usually 15 times,&#xD;
      in a process called scarification. When the vaccine works, a small pus-filled blister forms,&#xD;
      followed by a scab and then scarring at the site of the vaccination. The formation of the&#xD;
      blister and scab is called a take, indicating that the vaccine is effective and is evidence&#xD;
      of the development of immunity. The development of a take suggests that an individual will be&#xD;
      protected against smallpox for at least a few years. If scarification does not take, it can&#xD;
      either mean that the person already has immunity or that the vaccine did not work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to groups, as well as, product randomly. For instance, the&#xD;
      first study participant could be enrolled into group 3. The Dryvax® (Registered Trademark)&#xD;
      dose is given as a challenge to see if the person has a take. A reduced take response or no&#xD;
      take, could suggest that MVA is able to produce an immune response. The dosing schedules vary&#xD;
      from 12 to 24 weeks and volunteers are in the study a total of 24 to 36 weeks, depending on&#xD;
      the number of injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be observed for at least 1 hour after each injection. They will come to the&#xD;
      clinic a week after MVA or placebo injections and at least twice a week after Dryvax®&#xD;
      (Registered Trademark) for about 21 days to have the injection site evaluated and&#xD;
      photographed. At each visit, participants will be asked about how they are feeling and if&#xD;
      they are taking any medications. Blood and urine tests will be done on injection days and at&#xD;
      follow up visits scheduled 1 and 4 weeks after each immunization as well as 12 weeks after&#xD;
      the Dryvax® (Registered Trademark) challenge dose. Additional tests may be done between&#xD;
      visits if medically necessary.&#xD;

      Phase I/II, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, schedule finding study of MVA.&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that MVA will be safe in humans when administered by intramuscular (IM)&#xD;
      injection and will result in an immune response comparable to that observed after Dryvax&#xD;
      primary vaccination. The primary objectives include: evaluating the safety of MVA&#xD;
      administered by intramuscular (IM) injection on single and multidose schedules and&#xD;
      identifying a schedule of MVA that provides clinical evidence of protection against vaccinia&#xD;
      (Dryvax) challenge. The secondary objectives are to compare the immunogenicity of Dryvax and&#xD;
      MVA as measured by vaccinia-specific neutralizing antibody, ELISA, and intracellular&#xD;
      cytokines assays and by a variola-specific neutralizing antibody assay that will be conducted&#xD;
      at the CDC on a subset of samples.&#xD;
