  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, multicenter, target enrollment of 250 evaluable patients, open-label&#xD;
      study of cetuximab in patients with refractory, metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Based on&#xD;
      prior studies, we predict that 70 to 75% of patients will be EGFR-positive. Patients must&#xD;
      have documented failure after receiving either at least two chemotherapy regimens for&#xD;
      metastatic disease or adjuvant therapy plus one chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease&#xD;
      provided that the patient progressed within 6 months of completing adjuvant therapy. Prior&#xD;
      chemotherapy must have included irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive an initial dose of cetuximab, 400 mg/m2, intravenously (i.v.) over 120&#xD;
      minutes, followed by weekly treatment with cetuximab, 250 mg/m2 i.v. over 60 minutes.&#xD;
      Patients who experience unacceptable toxicity or who have progressive disease will not&#xD;
      receive further cetuximab therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for a tumor response at a minimum of every 6 weeks while on&#xD;
      cetuximab therapy. Patients with stable disease or a partial or complete response may&#xD;
      continue to receive weekly cetuximab therapy, unless they are dose-delayed or discontinued&#xD;
      because of toxicity. Patients who have a partial or complete response must have a&#xD;
      confirmatory tumor assessment no less than 4 weeks after the initial evaluation demonstrating&#xD;
      a response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, there is a pharmacokinetic companion protocol which will determine the trough&#xD;
      and peak levels of cetuximab in 25 patients enrolled in the study at four to eight centers. A&#xD;
      pharmacologic serum sample for the determination of levels of cetuximab will be obtained&#xD;
      prior to the initial, fourth and sixth cetuximab infusions and 1 hour following the&#xD;
      completion of the initial, fourth and sixth cetuximab infusions in the first course; and&#xD;
      prior to and 1 hour post the completion of the first cetuximab infusion of each subsequent&#xD;
      course of therapy. A course of therapy is defined as six weekly infusions of cetuximab&#xD;
      monotherapy. ImClone will perform the pharmacokinetic analyses.&#xD;

                  that the patient progressed within 6 months of completing adjuvant therapy.&#xD;
                  Progressive disease will be defined as progression while on treatment or within 3&#xD;
                  months after receiving the last dose of therapy in a given regimen;&#xD;
