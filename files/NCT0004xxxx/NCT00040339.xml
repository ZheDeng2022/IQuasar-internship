      The purpose of this trial is to determine if hypothermia (body cooling), administered very&#xD;
      soon after a severe brain injury improves functional outcome. This pilot trial ended in July&#xD;
      2005. Please see clinicaltrials.gov record number NCT00178711 for the Phase III version of&#xD;
      the trial (see link below).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After brain injury, the brain produces certain chemicals that are harmful to the injured&#xD;
      tissues. Moderate hypothermia-also called body cooling-may slow or prevent the production of&#xD;
      these chemicals. Hypothermia also decreases the amount of oxygen needed by the brain, which&#xD;
      may provide some protection during this critical period. Earlier studies have shown that&#xD;
      maintenance of moderate hypothermia may have a helpful effect in head injury patients ages 16&#xD;
      to 45 who arrive at the hospital with a low body temperature suggesting that very early&#xD;
      cooling may be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study scientists will initiate hypothermia or body cooling to 35˚C within two hours&#xD;
      of severe brain injury to determine if body cooling improves functional outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may enter the study in one of two ways. They may be evaluated and surface cooling&#xD;
      begun at the scene by emergency medical services (EMS) personnel affiliated with the study;&#xD;
      or patients who arrive in the emergency department (ED) of the study hospital within 2 hours&#xD;
      of injury-and who have not already been evaluated by EMS personnel affiliated with the&#xD;
      study-will be evaluated and cooling begun, if applicable, by NABISH study personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NABISH-trained EMS personnel who reach a patient with a suspected severe head injury within 2&#xD;
      hours of injury will induce hypothermia to 35˚C at the scene, in transit, or in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NABISH study personnel will induce hypothermia to 35˚C in the ED in patients with suspected&#xD;
      severe head injury who reach the ED within 2 hours of injury if cooling has not already&#xD;
      begun. Patients who meet entry criteria (based upon past studies) for moderate hypothermia&#xD;
      for 48 hours will then be cooled to 33˚C and then gradually rewarmed after 48 hours at 33˚C.&#xD;
      Patients initially cooled to 35˚C within 2 hours of injury who prove during trauma evaluation&#xD;
      to have exclusion criteria for 48 hours of moderate hypothermia will be warmed from 35˚C to&#xD;
      37˚C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot trial ended in July 2005. Please see clinicaltrials.gov record number NCT00178711&#xD;
