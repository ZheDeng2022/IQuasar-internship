      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of daclizumab (also called Zenapax or&#xD;
      anti-CD25) in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, a type of vasculitis (blood vessel&#xD;
      inflammation). Wegener's granulomatosis can affect many parts of the body, including the&#xD;
      brain, nerves, eyes, sinuses, lungs, kidneys, intestinal tract, skin, joints, heart, and&#xD;
      other sites. Standard treatment is a combination of prednisone and a cytotoxic agent (a drug&#xD;
      that interferes with cell growth), usually cyclophosphamide or methotrexate. However, many&#xD;
      patients treated with this regimen have a disease relapse, and others cannot take these drugs&#xD;
      because of severe side effects. This study will focus on the effectiveness of daclizumab in&#xD;
      preventing disease relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Food and Drug Administration approved daclizumab in 1997 for preventing kidney transplant&#xD;
      rejection, and the drug has also been studied in people with an eye infection called uveitis.&#xD;
      The drug works by binding to a protein on T lymphocytes (white blood cells of the immune&#xD;
      system) called CD25. This prevents another protein, called interleukin-2, from binding to&#xD;
      this site, thereby preventing a series of events that normally results in inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 10 and 75 years of age with Wegener's granulomatosis may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a medical history review and physical examination, including&#xD;
      laboratory studies. If medically indicated, x-rays, consultations and biopsies (surgical&#xD;
      removal of a small tissue sample) of affected organs will also be conducted. All patients&#xD;
      will begin treatment with prednisone and cyclophosphamide daily. Those who improve on this&#xD;
      regimen will reduce the prednisone gradually and continue with cyclophosphamide until their&#xD;
      disease is in remission. While taking cyclophosphamide, patients must have blood and urine&#xD;
      tests done every 1 to 2 weeks. Those who achieve disease remission will stop cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      and start taking methotrexate once a week, usually by mouth but possibly by injection into&#xD;
      the muscle or skin. Blood and urine tests will be conducted once a week for 4 weeks while the&#xD;
      dosage is being adjusted and then once a month for the duration of treatment. Patients on&#xD;
      methotrexate whose prednisone dose is reduced to 10 to 30 mg every other day will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned either to receive or not receive daclizumab in addition to the methotrexate.&#xD;
      Daclizumab is given intravenously (through a plastic tube inserted into a vein) the day after&#xD;
      the randomization, then again in 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and once a month for 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will continue to taper their prednisone dose until it is stopped. Methotrexate&#xD;
      will continue for 2 years. Patients whose disease remains in remission at this time will&#xD;
      decrease the methotrexate dose. If there is no active disease when both prednisone and&#xD;
      methotrexate have been stopped, no further treatment will be given. If disease recurs at a&#xD;
      later time, treatment will be reinstituted. The treatment will be determined by the severity&#xD;
      of disease, other medical conditions, and history of side effects. Patients not randomized to&#xD;
      daclizumab who relapse while still taking methotrexate may be offered re-treatment with&#xD;
      daclizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated in the outpatient clinic every 4 to 8 weeks until randomization.&#xD;
      Patients not taking daclizumab will be followed every 4 to 12 weeks; those taking the drug&#xD;
      will be seen every 2 weeks for the first month, every month after that during the 18-month&#xD;
      treatment period, and every 4 to 12 weeks until all medications stop. Follow-up evaluations&#xD;
      include a physical examination, blood draws and, if medically indicated, X-rays. The total&#xD;
      study duration is 60 to 70 months.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of daclizumab as an adjunctive&#xD;
      treatment to methotrexate in maintaining remission that has been induced by cyclophosphamide&#xD;
      and glucocorticoids in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. In this study, all patients&#xD;
      will initially receive daily cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids and then at disease&#xD;
      remission, cyclophosphamide will be discontinued and patients will receive methotrexate for&#xD;
      remission maintenance. Following the switch to methotrexate and when the prednisone dose has&#xD;
      been tapered to 20mg QOD (plus or minus 10mg QOD), patients in remission will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive daclizumab or not receive daclizumab. Those randomized to receive daclizumab will&#xD;
      be treated with 1 mg/kg intravenously on day 0, week 2, week 4 and every month thereafter for&#xD;
      a total of 18 months (20 doses). Regardless to which arm the patient is randomized, they will&#xD;
      continue to receive methotrexate. Two years after the methotrexate was started, if the&#xD;
      patient remains in remission, this will be tapered and discontinued. Patients will be&#xD;
      prospectively monitored for evidence of disease relapse and drug toxicity. Specific&#xD;
      parameters that will be obtained include the time to disease remission, the rate and time of&#xD;
      disease relapse, and the incidence of drug-related adverse events.&#xD;
