      This study will examine the types of bacteria present in the dental plaque of patients with&#xD;
      persistent dry mouth. Saliva is essential for digestion and swallowing and for maintaining&#xD;
      the normal mineralization of teeth. People who suffer from dry mouth usually have a&#xD;
      significant increase in tooth decay (caries). This study will determine if this increase is&#xD;
      due solely to reduced salivary flow or also to an increase in certain types of bacteria in&#xD;
      the mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participating in the following NIDCR protocols may be eligible for this study:&#xD;
      Evaluation and Treatment of Salivary Dysfunction (84-D-0056), Natural History of Salivary&#xD;
      Gland Dysfunction and Sjogren's Syndrome Research Project (99-D-0070), and Salivary&#xD;
      Evaluation in Normal Volunteers (94-D-0018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have three appointments at the NIH dental clinic as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental examination and instruction on keeping a detailed diary of food intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (1 week after visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attachment of a bacteria collection device (described below) to the side of a tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 (48 hours after visit 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Removal of the collection device, tooth cleaning and polishing, and submission of food diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bacteria collection device is a 4mm x 2mm x 2mm square of sterilized tooth obtained from&#xD;
      slicing an extracted healthy tooth donated by another patient. The donated teeth are either&#xD;
      extracted impacted third molars (wisdom teeth) or teeth extracted for teeth straightening&#xD;
      (orthodontics). The device is heat-sterilized before being bonded to the participant's tooth.&#xD;
      The dental cement used for bonding can be removed after 48 hours with no damage to the&#xD;
      surface of the participant's tooth.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although significant improvements have been made in the dental health status of the US&#xD;
      population, dental caries remains a significant problem. The most recent Surgeon General's&#xD;
      Report (2000) noted that 20% of the US population bears 60% of the caries burden. Caries&#xD;
      incidence is even higher in children of minorities, the chronically ill, the physically&#xD;
      handicapped, the elderly and the institutionalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental Caries is a multi-factorial disease in which the fermentation of dietary carbohydrate&#xD;
      by oral bacteria results in acid dissolution of tooth structure. Important risk factors&#xD;
      include the frequency of dietary carbohydrate intake, intra-oral plaque levels, the levels of&#xD;
      cariogenic oral bacteria, salivary insufficiency and past fluoride exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A medical condition shown to be associated with increased caries risk and caries incidence is&#xD;
      Sjogren's syndrome (Kolavic et al 1997, Pedersen et al 1999, Almstahl et al 1999). Sjogren's&#xD;
      syndrome (SS) predominantly affects women and is an auto-immune disorder characterized by an&#xD;
      epitheliitis or exocrinopathy. Both primary and secondary forms are described. Secondary SS&#xD;
      sees the condition co-exist with other auto-immune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis (See&#xD;
      reviews by Fox and Maruyama 1997, Fox et al 1999, Pflugfelder 1998 )&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study by Sreebny and Zhu (Adv. Dent Res 1996), demonstrated that individuals with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of SS are nearly 40% more likely to harbor high levels of the species Lactobacillus&#xD;
      in plaque and saliva than healthy individuals. LB has been shown in to be a major etiological&#xD;
      agent in dental caries progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal hypothesis of this study is that SS patients are at a higher risk of caries&#xD;
      development not just because of reduced salivary flow (xerostomia) but also changes in the&#xD;
      output of organic and inorganic microbial regulatory components in saliva secondary to their&#xD;
      auto-immune disease. These alterations favor a selective increase in the proportion of&#xD;
      cariogenic microflora in plaque located on their teeth. Specifically, mutans streptococci&#xD;
      (MS) and Lactobacillus (LB) species are increased in frequency and number in SS patients&#xD;
      compared with xerostomic patients with no detectable auto-immune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will investigate microbial counts of MS and LB in the plaque of patients&#xD;
      with a clinical diagnosis of markedly reduced salivary flow (pooled unstimulated flow &amp;eq;&#xD;
      0.1 ml/min). All clinical procedures will take place at NIH. Some samples and all data,&#xD;
      without any patient identifiers, will be analyzed outside.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plaque samples will be collected from sites identified to be at high-risk for caries&#xD;
      initiation and development. It is generally accepted that discernment of microbial etiology&#xD;
      is blunted by using salivary or pooled plaque monitoring of MS and LB as a surrogate for&#xD;
      samples of plaque in areas of high caries risk. This is supported by current knowledge of the&#xD;
      biology of MS/LB and expected locations of carious lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva samples will not be collected due to difficulties in obtaining sufficient fluid as a&#xD;
      result of the concurrent xerostomia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will examine the relationship between MS/LB and reduced salivary flow in&#xD;
      two patient groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A patient group with reduced salivary flow AND a diagnosis of primary or secondary SS&#xD;
           (as per the Revised International Criteria for diagnosis of SS) OR auto-immune disease&#xD;
           of non-SS etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A non-disease control group, who do not meet the criteria for SS, with reduced salivary&#xD;
           flow AND who have suffered subjective symptoms of xerostomia or xerophthalmia for a&#xD;
           period longer than 6 months OR who are taking medication with xerogenic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plaque micro-organisms will be harvested from a &quot;collection device&quot; bonded to the surface of&#xD;
      a posterior tooth shown to be at high risk for caries development. Plaque collected in this&#xD;
      way has been shown to closely simulate the complex ecology of a mature cariogenic plaque. The&#xD;
      harvested organisms will then be plated on non-selective media for enumeration of total&#xD;
      microbial load and on selective media for enumeration of specific cariogenic bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More comprehensive knowledge of the effect of SS on microbial flora in different predeliction&#xD;
      sites for oral diseases would be of great value for effective treatment planning in SS and&#xD;
      for the evaluation of the effect of oral treatments and of preventive measures implemented in&#xD;
      individuals with SS.&#xD;
