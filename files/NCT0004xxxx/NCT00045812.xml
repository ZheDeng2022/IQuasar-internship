  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety and effectiveness of SCH-58235 (Ezetimibe) in lowering&#xD;
      sitosterol, plant sterol and cholesterol blood levels in patients with homozygous&#xD;
      sitosterolemia when added to the patients' current treatment regimen. Homozygous&#xD;
      sitosterolemia is an inherited disorder of sterol metabolism in which an excess of many plant&#xD;
      sterols, including sitosterol, is absorbed and not enough excreted. (Sterols are substances&#xD;
      used to form hormones, vitamins and membranes found in animal and plant lipids.). Patients&#xD;
      can develop atherosclerosis with coronary heart disease as early as childhood, as well as&#xD;
      other problems including arthritis, arthralgia, and tendon xanthomas (lipid deposits).&#xD;
      Current sitosterolemia treatments may include a low sterol diet, medications, intestinal&#xD;
      surgery, or a combination of these. Ezetimibe is a member of a new class of drugs called&#xD;
      &quot;specific cholesterol absorption inhibitors&quot; that may lower cholesterol, sitosterol and other&#xD;
      plant sterol blood levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with homozygous sitosterolemia 10 years of age and older may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Participants will have a medical history and physical examination and will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of two treatment groups. One group, which will include about 80 percent of&#xD;
      all study participants, will take 10 mg of Ezetimibe a day, and the second group (20 percent&#xD;
      of participants) will take a placebo (an inactive look-a-like pill).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have 7 clinic visits during the 12-week study, when some or all of the&#xD;
      following procedures and tests will be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate and temperature)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dietary maintenance - interview about how well that patient is adhering to the diet&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication review - interview about other medications the patient is taking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw for tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine sample for tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram (ECG) to measure the electrical activity of the heart&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw to determine sitosterol, other plant sterol levels, and lipid levels&#xD;
           (cholesterol and other blood lipid concentrations)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Xanthoma measurement (with a ruler and X-ray of the foot)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Homozygous sitosterolemia is an autosomally inherited recessive disorder of sterol&#xD;
      metabolism. Patients with homozygous sitosterolemia can present with accelerated&#xD;
      atherosclerosis with initial CHD events occurring in childhood. In addition, these patients&#xD;
      can have tendon xanthomas, hemolytic episodes, as well as arthritis and arthralgias. Plasma&#xD;
      levels of sitosterol and other dietary sterols are markedly elevated in homozygous&#xD;
      sitosterolemic patients, and are diagnostic of this disorder. A low sterol diet provides only&#xD;
      limited reduction in sitosterol levels and currently available medical treatments, such as&#xD;
      bile salt binding resins, are usually insufficiently effective or poorly tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCH-58235 is a member of a new class of therapeutic agents, specific cholesterol absorption&#xD;
      inhibitors, being developed to treat hypercholesterolemia. Preclinical animal studies and&#xD;
      clinical studies in humans have demonstrated significant reductions in serum cholesterol&#xD;
      levels with SCH-58235 treatment. In the current study, the efficacy and safety of SCH-58235&#xD;
      will be studied in patients with homozygous sitosterolemia, an inherited condition in which a&#xD;
      wide range of plant sterols, including sitosterol, are excessively absorbed and inadequately&#xD;
      excreted, leading to dramatic increases in tissue deposition. SCH-58235 may lower sitosterol&#xD;
      levels by directly inhibiting sitosterol absorption (since plant sterols and cholesterol are&#xD;
      structurally similar sterols) and/or by inhibiting cholesterol absorption and indirectly by&#xD;
      increasing hepatic uptake of plasma LDL with increased cholesterol and sitosterol excretion.&#xD;
      These mechanisms of action could lead to reductions in both plant sterol and LDL cholesterol&#xD;
      levels in these patients, thereby providing important clinical benefits. The current study&#xD;
      will determine if SCH-58235 will be safe and well tolerated and provide significant&#xD;
      reductions in plant sterols (plasma sitosterol and campesterol) and low-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations in patients with homozygous sitosterolemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study lasting 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Patients with a diagnosis of homozygous sitosterolemia who have an elevated plasma sitosterol&#xD;
      level on their current regimen will be studied. Patients will be eligible to enroll in the&#xD;
      study whether their current regimen is medication(s), surgical (prior ileal bypass),&#xD;
      apheresis, a combination of treatments, or no active regimen. The primary objective of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 10 mg/day of SCH-58235 in patients with&#xD;
      homozygous sitosterolemia who continue to have an elevated plasma sitosterol level.&#xD;
