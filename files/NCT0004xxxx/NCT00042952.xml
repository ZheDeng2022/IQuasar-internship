      Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for&#xD;
      tumor cell growth. Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of imatinib mesylate in treating&#xD;
      patients who have progressive, refractory, or recurrent stage II or stage III testicular&#xD;
      cancer or stage II or stage III ovarian cancer following cisplatin-based chemotherapy&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the activity of imatinib mesylate in patients with progressive, refractory, or&#xD;
      recurrent pure testicular seminoma or ovarian germ cell dysgerminoma after cisplatin-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in this patient population. III. Determine KIT&#xD;
      expression and identify mutations in the c-kit gene in patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a partial response or&#xD;
      stable disease with normalization of human chorionic gonadotropin may undergo surgical&#xD;
      resection of residual lesions at each tumor status assessment. If residual viable germ cell&#xD;
      tumor is present in the resected specimen, patients may resume imatinib mesylate. If no&#xD;
      viable germ cell tumor is present in the resected specimen, then no further therapy is&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 patients will be accrued for this study within 32-38 months.&#xD;
