    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the causes of acute and chronic rejection of transplanted hearts.&#xD;
      To find better ways to detect, treat and possibly prevent heart transplant rejection, more&#xD;
      information about the cause is needed. Acute and chronic heart transplant rejection may be&#xD;
      caused by certain substances the body produces in response to the new heart. This study will&#xD;
      try to find a blood or urine test that detects genes and proteins that can serve as markers&#xD;
      of rejection. Such a test may lead to earlier detection and improved treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years and above who are on a wait list for heart transplant at a UNOS-approved&#xD;
      heart transplant center, whose institutional review board has approved this protocol, may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Healthy volunteers will also be included in the study to establish a&#xD;
      database of normal values for comparison with patients undergoing heart transplant. In&#xD;
      addition, patients who have had a heart transplant within the past 1 to 5 years will be&#xD;
      enrolled in a pilot study. Normal volunteers will be screened for participation with an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (EKG) and echocardiogram, non-invasive tests to evaluate heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of medical records Patients who have had a heart transplant and those on a wait&#xD;
           list to receive a heart will have their medical records reviewed to collect information&#xD;
           on their condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples 60 cc (about 3 tablespoons) of blood will be collected from all&#xD;
           participants by needle stick in a vein. The sample will be analyzed for genes and&#xD;
           proteins that might predict heart rejection. In addition, many genes in blood cells and&#xD;
           cells lining blood vessels that are unrelated to heart transplant rejection and whose&#xD;
           functions or significance are unknown will also be examined for ideas for future&#xD;
           research. Patients enrolled while on a wait list will, after transplantation, have an&#xD;
           additional 44 cc (about 2 tablespoons) of blood collected at each heart biopsy and&#xD;
           rejection episode during the first year of transplant, and 60 cc collected with each&#xD;
           yearly biopsy for the next 9 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine samples Between 100 and 300 cc (3 to 10 ounces) of urine may be collected from all&#xD;
           participants to confirm blood test results&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiac transplantation has been successful in improving survival in end stage heart failure.&#xD;
      But graft rejection has limited survival after transplantation. In the first year, acute&#xD;
      cellular rejection and infection remain the most common causes of morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Afterwards, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), as a result of chronic vascular rejection,&#xD;
      is the major cause of morbidity and mortality. Within the first year post-transplantation,&#xD;
      almost two-thirds of recipients will experience at least one rejection episode. At five years&#xD;
      post-transplantation, nearly 50% of survivors will have CAV. Clinically, the symptoms of&#xD;
      acute rejection are relatively nonspecific (fatigue, dyspnea, fever). Most CAV patients&#xD;
      remain asymptomatic until they develop serious problems such as myocardial infarction, heart&#xD;
      failure, ventricular dysrhythmias or sudden cardiac death. Presently, the gold standard for&#xD;
      diagnosing acute cardiac allograft rejection is right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy. This&#xD;
      is an invasive method of diagnosis subject to morbidity and random sampling and&#xD;
      interpretation error. Likewise, the gold standard for diagnosing CAV is cardiac&#xD;
      catheterization with intravascular ultrasound, an invasive procedure also subject to&#xD;
      morbidity. Noninvasive methods such as electrocardiography, echocardiography, and nuclear&#xD;
      studies all have been studied, but have been unsuccessful, thus far, for either condition.&#xD;
      Peripheral blood evaluations of cytokines and cytoimmunologic markers have also been&#xD;
      unsuccessful in either condition. This clinical trial studies the feasibility of using&#xD;
      functional genomics and proteomics to identify genes and proteins respectively that can serve&#xD;
      as reliable biomarkers of acute cardiac cellular rejection and CAV. We plan to recruit&#xD;
      subjects who are on the transplant waiting list. We will analyze the blood of these patients&#xD;
      pre-transplant and serially post-transplant over one year and then regularly on a yearly&#xD;
      basis. By correlating putative biomarkers with clinical, histological, and imaging based&#xD;
      evidence of allograft disease we hope to build a database comprised of functional genomics,&#xD;
      cytokine, cytoimmunologic and proteomics data relevant to the immunologic relationship&#xD;
      between the donor organ and recipient. With this database we hope to obtain a minimal subset&#xD;
      of differentially expressed genes, cytokines, cytoimmunologic and protein change profiles&#xD;
      that is most predictive of both acute allograft rejection and CAV. This will eventually serve&#xD;
      as the basis for a diagnostic blood test. Thus, with the application of functional genomics,&#xD;
      cytokine, and cytoimmunologic analysis and proteomics we hope to derive a noninvasive method&#xD;
      to detect both acute cellular cardiac allograft rejection and CAV, thereby minimizing the&#xD;
      need for invasive methods of diagnosis. Further better understanding the genetic programs&#xD;
      triggered and protein changes induced during rejection may lead to the identification of&#xD;
      target pathways for developing new therapeutic approaches aimed at prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, several published reports have established that detection of donor DNA in recipient&#xD;
      s blood can serve as a diagnostic tool of graft injury. The level of donor DNA measured as&#xD;
      percentage of circulating cell-free donor DNA (%ccfdDNA) accurately diagnoses acute rejection&#xD;
      with a high sensitivity and specificity, at times several months before the diagnosis by&#xD;
      examining endomyocardial biopsies. The ability of cell free DNA to diagnose graft injury&#xD;
      early opens a new window to re-examine markers of rejection. These markers are traditionally&#xD;
      evaluated using biopsy results, often positive late during rejection. %ccfdDNA offers an&#xD;
      opportunity to better characterize our analyses.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA - for Transplant Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Adult heart transplant center generally accepts patients within the physiologic&#xD;
                  age range of 12 to 65 years old, however, for our study heart transplant patients&#xD;
                  must be 18 years of age or above.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Indication for cardiac transplantation as outlined by the 24th Bethesda&#xD;
                  Conference on Cardiac Transplantation. These are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Peak VO(2) less than 10 ml/kg per minute or less than 50% of maximal predicted VO(2)&#xD;
             with achievement of anaerobic metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe cardiac ischemia consistently limiting routine activity not amenable to&#xD;
             surgical or percutaneous revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recurrent symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias refractory to all accepted therapeutic&#xD;
             modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - for Transplant Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adult heart transplant centers exclude infants, toddlers, and children with a physiologic&#xD;
        age less than 12, and adults with advanced physiologic age (less than 65), however, for our&#xD;
        study we will exclude heart transplant patients less than 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The final decision to exclude a candidate from cardiac transplantation will be made by the&#xD;
        hospital's heart transplant committee. The committee uses, as a guideline, the criteria&#xD;
        outlined in the 24th Bethesda conference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA - for Control Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any healthy normal man or women who is the appropriate age and gender for matching to a&#xD;
        transplant patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - For Control Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. EKG with evidence of clinically relevant heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Echocardiogram with evidence of clinically relevant heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any disease process that is not well controlled by medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Total tobacco use for greater than one month over the last 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
