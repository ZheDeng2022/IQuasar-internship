  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and effects of the monoclonal antibody MRA in patients&#xD;
      with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Antibodies normally fight invading organisms. In&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, however, antibodies attack the body s own tissues. MRA is&#xD;
      an antibody manufactured in the laboratory that blocks the action of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a&#xD;
      substance that increases antibody production and is involved in inflammation that may cause&#xD;
      organ damage in SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with moderately active systemic lupus erythematosus may be&#xD;
      eligible for this 6-month study. Candidates will be screened with blood and urine tests,&#xD;
      chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (EKG), and screening tests for certain cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a total of up to seven infusions of MRA given every 2 weeks in the&#xD;
      clinic. The MRA is infused over a period of about 1 hour through a catheter (thin plastic&#xD;
      tube) inserted into an arm vein. Patients will be observed for 1 to 2 hours after each&#xD;
      infusion for drug side effects. For the first and last infusions, patients will return to the&#xD;
      clinic for blood tests 24 to 48 hours after the infusion. Additional tests may be done if&#xD;
      medically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three different doses of MRA will be used in three groups of patients. The first group (4&#xD;
      patients) will receive the lowest dose. If this dose is well tolerated, a second group (6&#xD;
      patients) will receive a higher dose. If this dose is also well tolerated, a third group (6&#xD;
      patients) will receive the highest study dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated at various intervals for up to 3 months after the last dose of&#xD;
      MRA. The follow-up visits will include a review of the patient s medical history, a physical&#xD;
      examination, blood and urine tests, and an EKG.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels are elevated in both human and murine systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematosus (SLE). Blocking the action of IL-6 ameliorates disease activity in murine&#xD;
      models of SLE. MRA is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the human IL-6 receptor. Data&#xD;
      from clinical trials in patients with rheumatoid arthritis suggest that MRA may be a safe&#xD;
      agent to block the effect of IL-6 and therefore may be used to evaluate the effects of IL-6&#xD;
      blockade in patients with SLE. In this open label, dose-escalating, Phase I study, up to 27&#xD;
      subjects with moderately active SLE may be enrolled. Subjects will be treated with bi-weekly&#xD;
      infusions of one of three doses (2mg/kg, 4 mg/kg or 8 mg/kg) of MRA for 12 weeks and followed&#xD;
      for 8 weeks after the last dose. Patients with or without lupus nephritis may be enrolled if&#xD;
      they do not require immediate immunosuppressive therapy other than prednisone at doses of&#xD;
      less than or equal to 0.3 mg/kg/day. Safety will be evaluated using standard clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory parameters. To assess the potential effect of MRA on SLE, clinical and laboratory&#xD;
      evaluations and surrogate markers of inflammation and disease activity, such as autoantibody&#xD;
      production and lymphocyte subsets, will be compared before and after the treatment. Patients&#xD;
      who either do not tolerate the drug or those who have a clinically significant increase in&#xD;
      their disease activity that does not respond to moderate doses of corticosteroids will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this regimen is shown to be well tolerated, studies of efficacy will be planned. This&#xD;
      agent is expected to be devoid of the most common toxicities of therapies commonly used in&#xD;
      the treatment of SLE, such as myelosuppression, amenorrhea and osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide important preliminary information about the safety and possible&#xD;
      effect of IL-6 blockade in SLE patients, an intervention that has been successful in animal&#xD;
      models but has not yet been studied in humans.&#xD;
