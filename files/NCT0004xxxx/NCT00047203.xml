      Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop&#xD;
      growing or die. Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of flavopiridol in treating&#xD;
      patients who have relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma&#xD;
    </textblock>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma&#xD;
      treated with flavopiridol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the disease-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Correlate disease response with t(11;14)(q13;q32) rearrangement, p16 methylation status,&#xD;
      and BCRP expression in patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Correlate disease response and drug treatment with cell cycle status and effects on&#xD;
      apoptosis and apoptosis regulatory proteins in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive flavopiridol IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Courses repeat every 21 days for up&#xD;
      to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 12 months,&#xD;
      patients achieving at least a partial response may continue treatment in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 6 months for 1 year.&#xD;
