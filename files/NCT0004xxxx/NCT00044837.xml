  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if the anti-HIV drugs nelfinavir (NFV),&#xD;
      lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), and efavirenz (EFV) change the amount of estrogen in the blood&#xD;
      when taken along with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HRT can be helpful for treating bothersome symptoms of menopause. However, it is not&#xD;
      routinely used in HIV-infected postmenopausal women because it is not known how HRT interacts&#xD;
      with anti-HIV drugs. The information obtained from this study will help doctors make&#xD;
      recommendations for HRT in postmenopausal HIV-infected women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The benefits of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in HIV-negative postmenopausal women&#xD;
      include the abatement of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, insomnia, mood changes,&#xD;
      vaginal dryness, urogenital and skin changes, and memory loss. HRT may also decrease risk for&#xD;
      primary cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, colon cancer, and possibly Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      and age-related macular degeneration. There may also be an overall survival benefit for&#xD;
      HIV-negative postmenopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy. Despite the potential&#xD;
      benefits of postmenopausal hormone replacement, it is seldom used in HIV-infected&#xD;
      postmenopausal women. One concern about HRT in HIV-infected women is the potential for&#xD;
      interaction with antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. Although the effect of HRT on ARV drug levels is&#xD;
      likely to be small, it is important to evaluate the safety of administering HRT concurrently&#xD;
      with ARVs. The information obtained from this study will help shape recommendations for&#xD;
      postmenopausal HRT in HIV-infected women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are enrolled into 1 of 4 study arms based on their current oral ARV regimens. Arm A&#xD;
      takes NFV plus nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Arm B takes LPV/r plus&#xD;
      NRTIs. Arm C takes EFV plus NRTIs. Arm D enrolls HIV-infected patients not on current ARVs,&#xD;
      or who are taking NRTIs only (no protease inhibitors [PIs] or nonnucleoside reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase inhibitors [NNRTIs]). All arms receive HRT with oral estradiol and&#xD;
      medroxyprogesterone acetate for 12 weeks. Arms A, B, and C have intensive PI or NNRTI&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling at entry and Week 4. All arms have estradiol PK sampling at&#xD;
      Week 4. Clinical and laboratory evaluations are done at entry, Week 4, and Week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARVs are not provided by this study. Only HRT is provided.&#xD;

             EFV regimens plus 2 or more acceptable NRTIs, or b) patients must not currently be&#xD;
             taking any ARVs, with the exception of an NRTI-only regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a way to obtain their ARVs outside of the study and agree to continue their ARV&#xD;
