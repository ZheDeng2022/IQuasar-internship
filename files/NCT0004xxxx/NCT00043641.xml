      This study will investigate low-level viral loads in HIV-infected patients taking highly&#xD;
      active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Although HAART reduces viral levels and restores&#xD;
      immune function to some degree, it does not cure HIV infection. The virus persists even at&#xD;
      levels below that which it can be detected. This study will examine where this residual virus&#xD;
      comes from in order to better understand the infection and the effectiveness of therapies. In&#xD;
      addition, the study will 1) evaluate the ability of a new test to detect the virus at low&#xD;
      levels; and 2) determine whether adding the protease inhibitor Kaletra to the HAART treatment&#xD;
      regimen for patients with a low viral load will further decrease their viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Patients&#xD;
      involved in the viral load test will be recruited from an NIAID HIV study in which they are&#xD;
      already participating. Three groups of patients will be enrolled: those with a viral load of&#xD;
      less than 50 copies/ml plasma, those with 51-500 copies/ml, and those with 501-5000&#xD;
      copies/ml. Patients involved in the Kaletra trial must have been taking HAART for 6 months or&#xD;
      more and have less than 50 viral copies/ml plasma. They will be screened for this study with&#xD;
      a history, physical examination, and routine laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the viral load test evaluation will donate 70 ml of blood up to four times.&#xD;
      No more than one sample will be collected per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the Kaletra trial will have blood samples drawn on two successive days and&#xD;
      will then be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. One group will begin Kaletra&#xD;
      therapy (four capsules two times a day) immediately; the other will undergo observation for 4&#xD;
      weeks before starting Kaletra. Depending on what group they are in, patients will provide&#xD;
      blood samples for viral load measurements and clinical samples according to the following&#xD;
      schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediate Kaletra&#xD;
&#xD;
      One sample each during weeks 1, 2, and 3, of therapy and two samples during week 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed Kaletra&#xD;
&#xD;
      One sample each during weeks 1, 2, and 3 of observation and two samples during week 4. After&#xD;
      starting therapy, one sample will be collected each week during weeks 1, 2, and 3 of therapy&#xD;
      and two samples during week 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, after the last dose of medicine on day 28, Kaletra therapy will be complete.&#xD;
      At the end of therapy, additional blood will be collected for viral sampling as follows: one&#xD;
      sample each during weeks 1, 2, and 3, and two samples during week 4 after Kaletra therapy.&#xD;

      This protocol is an exploratory study of HIV expression in patients who are receiving highly&#xD;
      active antiviral therapy and who have low viral loads below or near the current limit of&#xD;
      detection (50 copies/ml plasma). Recent studies have suggested that patients with suppressed&#xD;
      viral loads in this low range have continued HIV expression, but the amount and the origin of&#xD;
      this virus remains unknown. The amount of virus expression in plasma is uncertain because the&#xD;
      current viral load assays are imprecise in the cutoff range of 50-75 copies/ml plasma. The&#xD;
      origin of the HIV found at low viral loads detected is unknown as well; two possible sources&#xD;
      of virus include expression from long-lived reservoirs of infected cells, and low level&#xD;
      spreading infection to uninfected cells. Determining the origin of HIV expression has&#xD;
      clinical importance; currently available HIV drug therapy will have little effect on HIV&#xD;
      expression from established reservoirs, but more potent HIV therapy could potentially inhibit&#xD;
      a spreading HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we plan two principal objectives. First, we will investigate the level of HIV&#xD;
      expression in plasma samples at low viral loads using a new HIV load assay with enhanced&#xD;
      sensitivity and precision in the viral load range of 1-100 copies. If data from the survey&#xD;
      confirms acceptable performance characteristics for this assay we will proceed with stage II&#xD;
      of the protocol. In stage II we plan to determine, in several short-term intensification&#xD;
      approaches to investigate whether the incorporation of an additional antiretroviral to&#xD;
      suppressive HAART regimens (&quot;intensification HAART&quot;) will further suppress plasma virus. In a&#xD;
      small pilot study, we will plan to intensify regimens for 30 days in a nonrandomized fashion.&#xD;
      Secondly, we plan to study patients who are switching medications for preference or mild&#xD;
      toxicity. In these patients we will intensify their regimens for 30 days in an overlap&#xD;
      fashion, adding the new drug instead of switching medications. After 30 days of drug overlap,&#xD;
      we will continue the new drug and discontinue the identified antiretroviral. These initial&#xD;
      studies will assist in obtaining initial data and confirming the estimated sample size of a&#xD;
      larger, randomized study to rigorously investigate the virologic effects of drug&#xD;
      intensification. If these initial proof-of-concept experiments suggest that HIV may be&#xD;
      suppressed by intensification HAART, then we plan to expand the study in a larger controlled&#xD;
      trial to determine the degree of suppression possible with intensification therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a secondary objective we will investigate whether it is feasible to study HIV genetic&#xD;
      variation in samples from patients with suppressed viral loads using molecular techniques&#xD;
      developed to study HIV variation in patients with viral loads greater than 1000 copies/ml&#xD;
      plasma (protocol 00-I-0110).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to enroll up to 70 patients in a viral load survey cohort of HIV viral loads, and&#xD;
      analyze a series of samples from completed trials of antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
