  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about Obsessive-compulsive Disorder (OCD) in&#xD;
      children. OCD usually has a slow onset, and symptoms that may remain at a stable level over&#xD;
      time. A subset of children with OCD has a sudden onset and symptoms that fluctuate in&#xD;
      severity over time. This study will also compare healthy children to those with OCD. This is&#xD;
      an observational study; children who participate will not receive any new or experimental&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCD affects nearly 1% of the pediatric population. The symptoms of this illness can interrupt&#xD;
      development, causing significant psychological distress and producing life-long impairments&#xD;
      in social, academic, and occupational functioning. A subgroup of pediatric OCD has been&#xD;
      designated by the acronym PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated&#xD;
      with Streptococcal Infections). This type of OCD is characterized by sudden symptom onset and&#xD;
      a relapsing-remitting course of illness; exacerbation of symptoms occurs with scarlet fever&#xD;
      or strep. throat infections. This study will identify factors that distinguish children with&#xD;
      PANDAS OCD from children with non-PANDAS OCD, and will compare both groups to healthy&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with OCD and their parents are screened with interviews and a review of the child's&#xD;
      medical records. Participants have an initial evaluation that includes a psychiatric,&#xD;
      physical and neuromotor exam, neuropsychological testing, psychological interviews, and a&#xD;
      blood test. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRS) scans of the brain are also obtained.&#xD;
      The MRS scan does not use radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial evaluation, children with OCD have follow-up visits every 6 weeks for 12 to&#xD;
      24 months. They are seen yearly for 8 years after the study. If they have a significant&#xD;
      improvement or worsening of their symptoms, they are asked to make a maximum of two extra&#xD;
      visits. Parents of OCD patients are called four times a year to discuss any changes in the&#xD;
      child's condition between yearly visits. All participants have a 1-year follow-up visit upon&#xD;
      study completion.&#xD;

      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) affects nearly 1% of the pediatric population. The&#xD;
      intrusive symptoms of this illness can interrupt normative development, causing significant&#xD;
      psychological distress and producing life-long impairments in social, academic, and&#xD;
      occupational functioning. Current research supports a neurobiologic model for OCD. Converging&#xD;
      lines of evidence suggest that a post-infectious autoimmune-mediated process may be&#xD;
      associated with the pathogenesis of some pediatric cases. This subgroup has been designated&#xD;
      by the acronym, PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with&#xD;
      Streptococcal infections). The abrupt symptom onset and relapsing-remitting course of illness&#xD;
      characteristic of the PANDAS subgroup appears to define a distinct cohort of patients, in&#xD;
      whom symptom exacerbations occur synchronously with Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal&#xD;
      (GABHS) infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to perform prospective, longitudinal evaluations of a group of 72 children with&#xD;
      recent onset OCD and 72 age-/sex-matched healthy volunteers. All children will undergo a&#xD;
      comprehensive baseline assessment, including physical, neurological and psychiatric&#xD;
      evaluations, neuropsychological testing, structural MRI and MRS scans, and laboratory assays.&#xD;
      The children with OCD will be evaluated in the NIMH outpatient clinic at six-week intervals&#xD;
      for a 28-month period to obtain prospective ratings of neuropsychiatric symptom severity,&#xD;
      physical and neurological assessments, and anti-streptococcal antibody titers. At the end of&#xD;
      the observation period, each OCD patient will be placed into a cohort based on the course of&#xD;
      his or her symptoms: those displaying an acute onset and episodic course of OCD will be&#xD;
      assigned to the &quot;episodic&quot; group, while those children with a gradual onset and stable course&#xD;
      will comprise the &quot;persistent&quot; group. We hypothesize that the episodic group will have GABHS&#xD;
      infections concurrent with their neuropsychiatric symptoms exacerbations and will meet&#xD;
      criteria for the PANDAS subgroup. In contrast, children in the persistent group are not&#xD;
      expected to have distinct periods of relapse nor a temporal association between GABHS&#xD;
      infections and worsening of their symptoms. We expect that children in the PANDAS subgroup&#xD;
      will demonstrate cross-reactive antibodies (antistreptococcal/antineuronal) during symptom&#xD;
      exacerbations. At the conclusion of the study, we will perform group comparisons between the&#xD;
      episodic OCD and persistent OCD cohorts, as well as between the patients and controls. The&#xD;
      purpose of these comparisons is to identify baseline markers of membership in the PANDAS&#xD;
      subgroup. The possibilities include distinctive HLA subtypes, quantitative differences in&#xD;
      cytokines distribution, unique MRS chemical profiles, or a specific pattern of deficits on&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests of basal ganglia function.&#xD;
