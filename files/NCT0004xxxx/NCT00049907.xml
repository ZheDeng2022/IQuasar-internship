      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mild-to-moderate chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) has been reaching epidemic proportions in&#xD;
      the United States. Studies relating mild-to-moderate chronic renal insufficiency and&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk were limited and inconsistent. Although much had been learned about the&#xD;
      natural history and adverse outcomes associated with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), there&#xD;
      was little specific information regarding risk factors for the development or progression of&#xD;
      renal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was initiated in response to a Request for Applications entitled &quot;NHLBI Innovative&#xD;
      Research Grant Program&quot; released in July, 2001. The purpose of the initiative was to support&#xD;
      new approaches to heart, lung, and blood diseases and sleep disorders that used existing data&#xD;
      sets or existing biological specimen collections whether obtained through National Heart,&#xD;
      Lung, and Blood Institute support or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population-based study used data on an ethnically diverse large cohort of male and female&#xD;
      health plan enrollees with extended follow-up. The study evaluated: a) whether baseline and&#xD;
      decline in renal function over time were independent predictors of coronary heart disease&#xD;
      (CHD), stroke, heart failure and peripheral vascular disease; b) effect modifiers of these&#xD;
      relationships,including baseline hypertension and diabetes status. The study determined&#xD;
      whether baseline and increase over time in blood pressure level (as well as prevalent and&#xD;
      incident hypertension) were predictive of the subsequent risk of ESRD after adjusting for&#xD;
      diabetes and for baseline serum creatinine, proteinuria and hematuria. The study also&#xD;
      examined other potential predictors of ESRD including demographic factors (race/ethnicity,&#xD;
      level of education) total cholesterol level, family history of renal disease, body mass&#xD;
      index, sagittal abdominal diameter, cigarette (as well as cigar and pipe) smoking, coffee&#xD;
      intake, alcohol consumption, family history of renal disease and self-reported occupational&#xD;
      exposures. The study used existing longitudinal data resources at the Northern California&#xD;
      Kaiser Permanente Division of Research and available patient-level cross-linkage with the US&#xD;
      Renal Data System end-stage renal disease registry to obtain comprehensive renal and&#xD;
      cardiovascular outcomes.&#xD;
