      RATIONALE: Understanding why patients participate in a phase I clinical trial may help&#xD;
      doctors plan better treatment for cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying to determine the reasons for participation,&#xD;
      perceptions, and expectations of patients receiving treatment for cancer in phase I clinical&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the motivations, perceptions, and expectations of patients enrolled in a phase&#xD;
           I clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the influence of age, education, and gender upon the perception of these&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the difference in perceptions, motivations, and expectations of patients who&#xD;
           have previously participated in a phase I clinical trial vs those who have not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether patients' perceptions, motivations, and expectations change while&#xD;
           enrolled in a phase I clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Validate an interviewer-administered tool measuring the perceptions, motivations, and&#xD;
           expectations of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess patients' perception of the information they were given while enrolled in a phase&#xD;
           I clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are interviewed over the phone to evaluate their perceptions, motivations,&#xD;
      and expectations of phase I clinical trials. Patients complete a questionnaire comprising 24&#xD;
      questions over 30-45 minutes. Interviews are conducted within 1 week after enrolling in a&#xD;
      phase I clinical trial (prior to the first dose of study agent) and then again 2 months later&#xD;
      (or at the time the patient stops treatment). The first 10 patients enrolled complete an&#xD;
      additional 6 questions over 15 minutes during the first interview to validate the&#xD;
      questionnaire, but do not complete a second interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.&#xD;
