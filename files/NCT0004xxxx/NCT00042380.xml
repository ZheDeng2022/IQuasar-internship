      The purpose of this study is to find out if the soy-based dietary supplement Novasoy&#xD;
      (Registered Trademark) is effective for the short-term treatment of clinical depression. This&#xD;
      study will also evaluate whether Novasoy (Registered Trademark) is effective in treating the&#xD;
      anxiety that often accompanies depression and will assess the best dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novasoy (Registered Trademark) is a marketed botanical dietary supplement containing soy&#xD;
      isoflavones. The active form of the soy isoflavone genistin may be a novel treatment for&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric illnesses. The soy isoflavone's specific hormonal properties may also have&#xD;
      beneficial effects on brain function in depressed patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in two phases. During Phase I, participants will stop all&#xD;
      medications for at least 1 week. A psychiatric and medical examination will be conducted.&#xD;
      During Phase II, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either Novasoy (Registered&#xD;
      Trademark) or a placebo (an inactive pill) for 8 weeks. Participants who do not respond to&#xD;
      treatment after 5 weeks will be given a higher dose of their assigned medication. After the&#xD;
      8-week period, participants will be monitored for up to 3 months before being referred back&#xD;
      to their clinician for further treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Recurrent mood disorders can have devastating long-term effects, and the cost of these&#xD;
      illnesses in terms of human suffering, productivity and health care is enormous. It is now&#xD;
      recognized that, for many patients, the long-term outcome is often much less favorable than&#xD;
      previously thought, with incomplete inter-episode recovery, and a progressive decline in&#xD;
      overall functioning observed. Indeed, according to the Global Burden of Disease Study, mood&#xD;
      disorders are among the leading causes of disability worldwide, and are likely to represent&#xD;
      an increasingly greater health, societal, and economic problem in the coming years. Dietary&#xD;
      and nutritionally derived botanical compounds offer promise both for experimental&#xD;
      therapeutics of complex diseases and for chemoprevention of illnesses such as depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genistein is a polyphenolic molecule and the active form of the soy isoflavone, genistin. It&#xD;
      has both phytoestrogen and protein tyrosine kinase inhibiting properties. Since tyrosine&#xD;
      phosphorylation is involved in central nervous system regulation of neurotransmission&#xD;
      inhibition by genistein may be a novel strategy to directly modulate synaptic activity and&#xD;
      treat neuropsychiatric illnesses. Genistein's specific hormonal properties may also have&#xD;
      salutary effects on brain function in depressed patients. Genistein increases dopamine and&#xD;
      other monoamine activity, affects neurotrophic factor transcription, and has neuroprotective&#xD;
      properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an 8-week double blind parallel study that will examine the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Novasoy® (Registered Trademark) (CAS 446-72-0), a marketed botanical dietary supplement, in&#xD;
      acutely depressed male and female patients (n&amp;eq;60 in each group). The study has two&#xD;
      Periods. Study Period I is a washout phase (1 week) and evaluation period. Study Period II is&#xD;
      a monotherapy 8-week parallel, placebo controlled, acute treatment phase in which the&#xD;
      efficacy and tolerability of isoflavones is compared to baseline. After completing the 8-week&#xD;
      study period, subjects will be followed at the mood disorders clinic at NIMH for any&#xD;
      necessary treatment adjustment and referred back to their clinician for further treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, ages 18 and over, with a diagnosis of major depression (without psychotic&#xD;
      features), will be titrated onto an isoflavone mixture, Novasoy® (Registered Trademark), to a&#xD;
      specific target dose (genistin &amp;eq; 270mg/day in divided doses). At the end of week 5&#xD;
      nonresponders (less or equal to 50% improvement) will have one further titration to a higher&#xD;
      dose (genistin&amp;eq;360 mg/day in divided doses). Primary efficacy will be determined by&#xD;
      demonstrating a greater response rate using a well-validated rating scale. Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 with stratification for sex. Improvement in depressive symptoms is&#xD;
      hypothesized to be significantly greater in the active soy isoflavone group.&#xD;
