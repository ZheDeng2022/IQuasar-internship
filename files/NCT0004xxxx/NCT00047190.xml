  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of tipifarnib in treating patients who have&#xD;
      myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia. Tipifarnib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the response rate in MMM patients treated with R115777. II. To evaluate the&#xD;
      toxicity of R115777 in patients with MMM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the benefit of therapy with R115777 in alleviating disease-associated anemia&#xD;
      in patients with MMM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the benefit of R115777 in reducing palpable splenomegaly in patients with&#xD;
      MMM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the effect of R115777 on the hypercatabolic symptoms from MMM. IV. To&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of R115777 on the pathologic increase in circulating myeloid progenitors&#xD;
      in MMM patients through baseline measurement and measurement after the first cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To correlate response/relapse with in vitro myeloid colony sensitivity to R115777 at the&#xD;
      time of either response or relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate the effect of R115777 on bone marrow histologic features of MMM including&#xD;
      osteosclerosis, reticulin fibrosis, and angiogenesis (through serial bone marrow microvessel&#xD;
      density grading).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days&#xD;
      for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months for up&#xD;
      to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 15 months.&#xD;
