      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.&#xD;
      Thalidomide may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. Combining&#xD;
      whole-brain radiation therapy with thalidomide and temozolomide may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining whole-brain radiation therapy&#xD;
      with thalidomide and temozolomide in treating patients who have newly diagnosed brain&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the overall median survival time of patients with newly diagnosed brain&#xD;
           metastases treated with whole-brain radiotherapy in combination with thalidomide and&#xD;
           temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the radiographic response rate, median time to tumor progression, and median&#xD;
           time to neurologic response and progression in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the cause of death of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo radiotherapy daily 5 days a week for 3 weeks. Beginning on the day before&#xD;
      the first radiation treatment, patients receive oral thalidomide once daily and oral&#xD;
      temozolomide once daily for 21 days. Patients continue to receive thalidomide daily for up to&#xD;
      2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 1 and 3 months after completing radiotherapy, and&#xD;
      then every 3 months thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed at 1 and 3 months and then every 3 months thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 62 patients will be accrued for this study within 10 months.&#xD;
