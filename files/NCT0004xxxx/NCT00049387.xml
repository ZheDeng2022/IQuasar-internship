      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of tipifarnib when given&#xD;
      together with temozolomide and radiation therapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      glioblastoma multiforme or gliosarcoma. Tipifarnib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage&#xD;
      tumor cells. Combining tipifarnib, temozolomide, and radiation therapy may kill more tumor&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Establish MTD for R115777 in combination with Temozolomide with radiation in patients not&#xD;
      on EIAEDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define the safety of R115777 in combination with Temozolomide with radiation in this&#xD;
      patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess for evidence of antitumor activity in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of tipifarnib. Patients are stratified&#xD;
      according to concurrent use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (yes [closed to accrual as&#xD;
      of 3/15/05] vs no).&#xD;
&#xD;
      COMBINATION THERAPY: Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within&#xD;
      5-9 days after beginning tipifarnib, patients receive oral temozolomide once daily for 6&#xD;
      weeks and concurrently undergo partial brain radiotherapy daily 5 days a week for 6 weeks.&#xD;
      After completion of radiotherapy, patients proceed to adjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tipifarnib until the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2&#xD;
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 10 patients are&#xD;
      treated at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADJUVANT THERAPY: Patients continue to receive tipifarnib as above. With the initiation of&#xD;
      the next planned course of tipifarnib, patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-5.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 courses OR 1 year (whichever is longer) in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients with progressive disease are followed at 10 weeks&#xD;
      and then every 4 months. Patients who complete therapy are followed every 2 months for 1&#xD;
      year, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months&#xD;
      thereafter until disease progression.&#xD;

             recently developed a deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism who are on or will&#xD;
             take coumadin will be allowed to participate; however, the investigator should be&#xD;
