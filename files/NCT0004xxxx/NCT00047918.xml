      This study will 1) identify characteristics of bone marrow mast cells in patients with&#xD;
      unexplained anaphylaxis and flushing or with mastocytosis and 2) determine whether&#xD;
      mastocytosis might be the underlying cause of unexplained anaphylaxis in some patients with&#xD;
      this condition. Anaphylaxis is a hypersensitivity reaction in which patients may have&#xD;
      flushing, hives, stuffy nose, red itchy eyes, difficulty breathing, swelling of the tongue,&#xD;
      throat, palms and soles, abdominal cramping, lightheadedness, decreased blood pressure, and&#xD;
      loss of consciousness. Although allergens are a common cause of anaphylactic episodes, no&#xD;
      cause can be identified in up to 50 percent of patients who have recurrent events.&#xD;
      Mastocytosis is a disease of excessive mast cells in tissues such as skin and bone marrow.&#xD;
      These cells can release chemicals that result in itching, blisters, flushing, bone pain, and&#xD;
      abdominal pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older who have episodes of anaphylaxis or flushing with no&#xD;
      apparent cause or who have mastocytosis may be eligible for this study. Participants will&#xD;
      have a medical history and physical examination; blood tests to identify genetic changes that&#xD;
      are important in the growth, development, and functioning of human mast cells; and bone&#xD;
      marrow aspiration and biopsy. For the bone marrow procedure, the skin over the hipbone and&#xD;
      the outer surface of the bone itself are numbed with local anesthesia. Then, a special needle&#xD;
      is inserted into the hipbone and about 1 tablespoon of bone marrow is drawn into a syringe.&#xD;
      Another needle is inserted into the same area to collect a small piece of the bone marrow.&#xD;
      Additional procedures may include allergen testing, urinalysis, and 24-hour urine collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return to NIH for reassessment of disease status in 12 to 18 months. The&#xD;
      follow-up evaluation will include a history and physical examination, blood tests, possible&#xD;
      repeat bone marrow and aspiration in patients whose clinical signs or symptoms change&#xD;
      significantly, and other tests as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First-degree relatives (parents, children, siblings) may be enrolled in limited instances to&#xD;
      provide a blood sample for genetic analysis related to mast cell development and function for&#xD;
      comparison with that of patients when they have similar symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anaphylaxis is a severe systemic hypersensitivity reaction caused by release of mediators&#xD;
      from mast cells and basophils. Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis may include generalized&#xD;
      flushing, hives, stuffy nose, red and itchy eyes, difficulty in breathing, swelling of the&#xD;
      tongue, throat, palms and soles, gastrointestinal cramping, lightheadedness and loss of&#xD;
      consciousness. Although most common causes of anaphylaxis include foods, drugs and stinging&#xD;
      insects, a causative factor is not identified in up to 50% of the patients with recurrent&#xD;
      anaphylactic episodes. Mast cells are important mediators of anaphylaxis. This study will&#xD;
      examine the hypothesis that some patients with unexplained anaphylaxis may have systemic&#xD;
      mastocytosis, a disorder of pathologic mast cell proliferation, as an underlying cause. In&#xD;
      addition, it will investigate hematopoietic cells, which result in their tissue mast cells&#xD;
      being more susceptible to degranulation. The study will enroll patients with mastocytosis&#xD;
      with or without flushing or anaphylaxis, and patients with unexplained flushing or&#xD;
      anaphylaxis. Patients will receive a clinical evaluation, blood tests and a bone marrow&#xD;
      biopsy and aspirate. Research studies planned include flow cytometric analysis of blood and&#xD;
      bone marrow cells, investigation of mutations or polymorphisms in genes involved in mast cell&#xD;
      growth and differentiation, determination of surrogate disease markers and examination of&#xD;
      mast cell growth and function. The study will improve the understanding of the mechanisms&#xD;
      involved in anaphylactic reactions, which could in turn lead to development of strategies to&#xD;
      better prevent or treat the episodes.&#xD;
