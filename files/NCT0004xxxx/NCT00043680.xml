  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether the drug celecoxib (Celebrex® (Registered Trademark)) can&#xD;
      help stabilize or improve vision in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) who&#xD;
      are receiving photodynamic therapy, or PDT (also called cold laser treatment). The macula is&#xD;
      the part of the retina in the back of the eye that determines central or best vision. AMD can&#xD;
      severely impair central vision, affecting a person's ability to read, drive, and carry out&#xD;
      daily activities. This vision loss is caused by the formation of abnormal new blood vessels&#xD;
      in the choroid-a thin, pigmented vascular layer of the eye behind the retina-that leak blood&#xD;
      under the macula. PTD stops the growth of these blood vessels and slows the rate of vision&#xD;
      loss. However, the treatment usually does not cause vision to improve, and it has only a&#xD;
      temporary effect, requiring several treatments over 2 years. Furthermore, PDT does not work&#xD;
      in all patients and may actually cause some swelling and re-growth of blood vessels.&#xD;
      Celecoxib is an anti-inflammatory drug that, in animal studies, has prevented the growth of&#xD;
      abnormal blood vessels associated with tumors and with injury to the cornea. Thus, the drug&#xD;
      might reduce swelling and prevent vessel re-growth in AMD, enhancing the effectiveness of&#xD;
      PDT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 55 years of age and older with AMD and visual acuity of 20/20 to 20/200 may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Participants will be randomly assigned to take either celecoxib or a&#xD;
      placebo (a look-alike pill with no active drug) twice a day and undergo the various tests and&#xD;
      procedures detailed below. Not every examination will be done at every visit, but all may be&#xD;
      required at one visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood drawing: A blood sample is drawn from an arm vein to evaluate liver and kidney&#xD;
           function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination: Visual acuity and eye pressure are measured, and the lens, retina,&#xD;
           pupils and eye movements are examined&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photography: Photographs of the eye are taken using a special camera with a bright flash&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluorescein angiography: Pictures of the retina are taken to look for abnormal blood&#xD;
           vessels. A yellow dye is injected into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in&#xD;
           the eyes. The retina is photographed using a camera that flashes a blue light into the&#xD;
           eye. The pictures show if any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina,&#xD;
           indicating possible blood vessel abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indocyanine green angiography: This procedure, similar to fluorescein angiography, uses&#xD;
           a green dye to photograph the retina and identify portions of abnormal vessels in the&#xD;
           deepest part of the retina.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optical coherence tomography: This new technique uses light to produce a 2-dimensional&#xD;
           cross-sectional picture of the retina. The patient looks into a machine called an&#xD;
           optical coherence tomograph at a pattern of flashing and rotating red and green lights,&#xD;
           first with one eye and then the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week after starting the study medications, laser treatment will begin. For this&#xD;
      procedure, a needle is placed in an arm vein and a chemical called verteporfin (Visudyne®&#xD;
      (Registered Trademark)) is infused into the vein over 10 minutes. After 15 minutes, the eye&#xD;
      is anesthetized with numbing drops. A special contact lens is then placed on the eye and the&#xD;
      laser beam is directed to the eye for 83 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed in the clinic every 6 weeks for 36 weeks for various examinations&#xD;
      and possible re-treatment, if needed. Some patients will be asked to return 1 to 2 weeks&#xD;
      after the first PDT for an eye examination and fluorescein angiography.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) represents the most common cause of blindness in&#xD;
      patients over the age of 60. The major cause of vision loss in this disease is due to the&#xD;
      development of choroidal neovascularization. Several clinical trials have shown that eyes&#xD;
      with predominately 'well-defined' areas of neovascularization (lesions having at least 50% of&#xD;
      vessels which can be readily demarcated with fluorescein angiography) can benefit from&#xD;
      treatment with photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, this treatment benefit only results in a&#xD;
      reduction in the number of patients who suffer severe vision loss. Few patients demonstrate&#xD;
      an improvement in visual acuity. In addition, other neovascular lesions such as those with&#xD;
      predominate occult (vessels that are difficult to outline by fluorescein angiography) or pure&#xD;
      occult do not demonstrate any substantial treatment benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histopathologic studies have demonstrated the presence of an inflammatory response in the&#xD;
      retina of patients with choroidal neovascularization as well as in eyes receiving PDT. In&#xD;
      addition, in eyes receiving PDT, a vascular remodeling and continued neovascular process&#xD;
      occurs. Therefore, the use of celecoxib (Celebrex® (Registered Trademark)), a specific&#xD;
      cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, which possesses both anti-angiogenic as well as anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      properties, may be beneficial in patients with neovascular AMD undergoing PDT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be organized as a double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective&#xD;
      multi-center clinical trial to investigate the ability of celecoxib to alter the inflammatory&#xD;
      and neovascular responses in AMD patients undergoing PDT. The results of this study will&#xD;
      contribute to the design of a larger definitive clinical trial. The primary outcome measure&#xD;
      is a drop of 15 letters or more in best corrected visual acuity following initial PDT&#xD;
      treatment at 1 year. The secondary outcome measures are stabilization (drop of 4 letters of&#xD;
      less from baseline) or improvement of best corrected visual acuity following initial PDT&#xD;
      treatment at week 36, and an improvement by 5 or more letters in visual acuity from baseline&#xD;
      to week 36, time to retreatment with PDT, number of retreatments with PDT and a change in the&#xD;
      CNV size, the extent of leakage and staining detected by fluorescein angiography. Additional&#xD;
      outcome measures will be the change in size and extent of vascular remodeling and choroidal&#xD;
      new vessel formation as determined by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and high-speed&#xD;
      indocyanine green angiography (HS-ICG).&#xD;

        informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age greater than or equal to 50 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In at least one eye, diagnosis of AMD defined by the presence of drusen larger than 63&#xD;
        micro milli.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The presence of choroidal neovascularization under the fovea determined by the Principal&#xD;
        Investigator of each clinical site and defined as any one of the following fluorescein&#xD;
        angiographic (FA) features:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Early stippled hyperfluorescence of flat retinal pigment epithelium with ill-defined&#xD;
             boundary and little or mild leakage in the late frames of the fluorescein (occult).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Irregular elevation of the retinal pigment epithelium that does not exhibit discrete&#xD;
             or bright hyperfluorescence in the early transit phase of the angiogram. Stippled&#xD;
             hyperfluorescence may be present. Late frames may show persistent fluorescein staining&#xD;
             or leakage within a sensory retinal detachment overlying this area (occult).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Late phase leakage of undetermined source with leakage at the level of the retinal&#xD;
             pigment epithelium in the late-frames of the angiogram in which the source of the late&#xD;
             leakage cannot be determined from earlier-phase frames of the angiogram (occult).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A well-demarcated area of bright hyperfluorescence in the early phase of the&#xD;
             angiograpm with leakage through the mid- and late- phase frames which obscures the&#xD;
             boundaries of the area (classic).&#xD;
&#xD;
        The greatest linear dimension of the entire lesion (classic CNV, occult CNV and any&#xD;

        or equal to 5400 micro milli in greatest linear dimension on the retina as measured by the&#xD;
        treating ophthalmologist. If the lesion is designated as entirely occult, then&#xD;
        additionally, the greatest linear dimension of the lesion must be greater than 525 micro&#xD;
        milli (total area of 1/2 disc area). Additionally, if the lesion is designated as entirely&#xD;
        occult then there should be 'presumed recent disease progression' that may include the&#xD;
        presence of blood from CNV, growth of the lesion (at least 10% increase in the greatest&#xD;
        linear dimension) or deterioration inVA (a one line loss) within the preceding 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Visual acuity of 20/40 - 20/200 (66 - 34 letters) as measured on an ETDRS chart. If both&#xD;
        eyes are eligible then the eye with the worst visual acuity will be treated and considered&#xD;
        the study eye.&#xD;
