    <textblock>
      This prospective cohort study assesses the effects of exposure to organophosphate (OP)&#xD;
      pesticides on adverse reproductive outcomes in both male and female agricultural workers in&#xD;
      China. We will enroll women and their spouses, who are attempting to become pregnant, and&#xD;
      observe reproductive endpoints including (1) semen parameters (concentration, total count,&#xD;
      motility, progression and morphology), (2) menstrual disorders (oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea,&#xD;
      polymenorrhea, intermenstrual bleeding, prolonged menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, and&#xD;
      irregular menstruation); (3) alterations in hormone patterns including reduced estrogen&#xD;
      excretion (REE), anovulation, abnormal luteal phase (ALP), and abnormal follicular phase&#xD;
      (AFP) in women and abnormalities of LH, FSH, TSH, SHBG, inhibin-B and testosterone in men;&#xD;
      (4) fecundability; and (5) pregnancy outcomes including spontaneous abortion, preterm&#xD;
      delivery, low birth weight, and intrauterine growth retardation.&#xD;
