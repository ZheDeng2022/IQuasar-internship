      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the drug memantine&#xD;
      for treating major depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major depression is a serious public health concern that contributes to significant morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. Despite the availability of a wide range of antidepressant drugs, a proportion&#xD;
      of patients with major depression fail to respond to first-line antidepressant treatment,&#xD;
      despite adequate dosage, duration, and compliance. Recent studies suggest that the&#xD;
      glutamatergic system may play a role in the pathophysiology and treatment of depression.&#xD;
      Memantine and other agents which reduce glutamatergic neurotransmission may represent a novel&#xD;
      class of antidepressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of three phases. In Phase 1, participants will be tapered off all&#xD;
      psychiatric medications over a 2-week washout period. In Phase 2, participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive either memantine or placebo (an inactive pill) three times a day&#xD;
      for 8 weeks. Participants who do not respond to the treatment after 8 weeks will be taken off&#xD;
      the study and offered standard treatment. Weekly psychiatric evaluations will evaluate&#xD;
      treatment response. During Phase 2, participants who respond well to treatment will enter&#xD;
      Phase 3, a 16-week continuation phase of either memantine or placebo. Interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted every other week in the first month , then monthly thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a physical examination, neuropsychological tests, and eye blink tests&#xD;
      at baseline and at the end of the study. Pulse, blood pressure, and blood samples will be&#xD;
      taken throughout the study. Participants will undergo an electrocardiogram as well as&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Major affective disorders are common, severe, chronic and often a life-threatening illness.&#xD;
      Major depression contributes to significant morbidity and mortality. Impairment in physical&#xD;
      and social functioning resulting from depression can be just as severe as other chronic&#xD;
      medical illnesses. Suicide is the cause of death in 10-20% of individuals with recurrent&#xD;
      depressive disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the availability of a wide range of antidepressant drugs, clinical trials indicate&#xD;
      that 30% to 40% of patients with major depression fail to respond to first-line&#xD;
      antidepressant treatment, despite adequate dosage, duration, and compliance. Thus, there is a&#xD;
      clear need to develop novel and improved therapeutics for unipolar and bipolar depression.&#xD;
      Recent preclinical studies suggest that antidepressants may exert delayed indirect effects on&#xD;
      the glutamatergic system. Furthermore, a growing body of data suggests that mood disorders&#xD;
      are associated with regional volumetric reductions, and cell loss and atrophy. It is thus&#xD;
      noteworthy that lamotrigine, which, among other effects reduces glutamate release, has&#xD;
      antidepressant effects, and a pilot study has suggested that NMDA antagonists may have&#xD;
      antidepressant effects. Together, this data suggests that the glutamatergic system may play a&#xD;
      role in the pathophysiology and treatment of depression, and that agents, which more directly&#xD;
      reduce glutamatergic neurotransmission, may represent a novel class of antidepressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Memantine (Akatinol memantine), an agent that is approved in Germany for dementia syndrome,&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease has significant antiglutamatergic and neuroprotective properties, may&#xD;
      prove to have antidepressant properties in depressed patients. In this study, we propose to&#xD;
      investigate the potential efficacy of memantine, an agent which reduces glutamatergic output&#xD;
      via open-channel block of the NMDA receptor-associated ion channel. Most importantly,&#xD;
      memantine only blocks the channel during periods of abnormal, excessive activity, and leaves&#xD;
      relatively spared normal neurotransmission. This finding is the basis for the minimal side&#xD;
      effect profile displayed by memantine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, ages 18 to 80, with a diagnosis of major depression (without psychotic features),&#xD;
      will be randomized to double-blind treatment outpatient study to receive either memantine&#xD;
      (5-20mg/day) or placebo for a period of 8 weeks. Following this acute period, patients who&#xD;
      fully respond could enter a 16-week continuation phase. Acute efficacy will be determined by&#xD;
      demonstrating a greater response rate using specified criteria. Approximately 112 patients&#xD;
      with acute major depression will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects may be included in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male or female subjects, 18 to 80 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female subjects of childbearing potential must be using a medically accepted means of&#xD;
        contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Each subject must have a level of understanding sufficient to agree to all tests and&#xD;
        examinations required by the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must be considered reliable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Each subject must understand the nature of the study and must sign an informed consent&#xD;
        document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must fulfill the criteria for major depression, recurrent without psychotic&#xD;
        features as defined in DSM-IV based on clinical assessment and confirmed by structured&#xD;
        diagnostic interview SCID-P.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must have an initial score at Visit 1 and Visit 2 of at least 22 on the MADRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must not have a decrease in the total score of MADRS of greater than 20 % during&#xD;
        washout (between Visits 1 and 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Current major depressive episode of at least 4 weeks duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded from the study for any of the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Lack of response to more than 2 antidepressants (adequate dose and duration).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participation in a clinical trial of another investigational drug within 1 month (30 days)&#xD;
        prior to study entry (Visit 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female subjects who are either pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Serious, unstable illnesses including hepatic, renal, gastroenterologic, respiratory,&#xD;
        cardiovascular (including ischemic heart disease), endocrinologic, neurologic, immunologic,&#xD;
        or hematologic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with uncorrected hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with one or more seizures without a clear and resolved etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Documented history of hypersensitivity or intolerance to amantadine or prior treatment with&#xD;
        memantine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        DSM-IV substance abuse or dependence (except nicotine and caffeine) within the past 90&#xD;
        days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Treatment with an injectable depot neuroleptic within less than one dosing interval between&#xD;
        depot neuroleptic injections prior to Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Treatment with a reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor, guanethidine, or guanadrel within&#xD;
        1 week prior to Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Treatment with fluoxetine within 6 weeks prior to Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Treatment with any other concomitant medication with primarily CNS activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Treatment with clozapine within 4 weeks prior to Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Treatment with amitriptyline (elavil) within 4 weeks prior to Visit 2 since amitriptyline&#xD;
        and similar TCAs may manifest a mild NMDA receptor antagonism, as demonstrated in&#xD;
        electrophysiological studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Treatment with the anticonvulsants carbamazepine (tegretol, carbatrol, tegretol XR and&#xD;
        similar derivatives), gabapentin (neurontin) or felbamate (felbatol) within 4 weeks prior&#xD;
        to Visit 2 because these drugs may interfere with NMDA receptor function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Treatment with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) within 3 months (90 days) prior to Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Current diagnosis of schizophrenia or other psychotic or bipolar disorder as defined in the&#xD;
