  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the experimental HIV vaccine pGA2/JS2 is safe and is&#xD;
      well tolerated at two different doses. Another important purpose of this study is to observe&#xD;
      how the immune system responds to the vaccine at different dose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccines are given to people to help their bodies fight infection. The vaccine being tested&#xD;
      in this study is a DNA vaccine. The pGA2/JS2 plasmid DNA vaccine instructs the body to make&#xD;
      some HIV proteins. These HIV proteins may trigger an immune response. Because only a few of&#xD;
      the many proteins HIV needs are made through DNA vaccination, there is no risk of getting HIV&#xD;
      from the vaccination. This and other similar DNA vaccines have been tested for safety in&#xD;
      mice, rabbits, and monkeys. The vaccine has been well tolerated at doses to be used in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DNA vaccination has induced immune responses in animals to a number of viral, bacterial, and&#xD;
      parasite derived antigens. Early clinical experiences with HIV DNA vaccines in humans&#xD;
      indicate: 1) the tolerability and short-term safety of DNA at doses up to 5000 mcg in humans&#xD;
      are excellent; and 2) there is potential for immunogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pGA2/JS2 DNA vaccine is part of a planned prime/boost regimen of a DNA vaccine prime&#xD;
      followed by a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine boost. In studies in monkeys, a&#xD;
      combination of a DNA vaccine and an MVA vaccine protected the monkeys against disease caused&#xD;
      by a monkey virus similar to HIV. The current study is an initial investigation of the safety&#xD;
      and immunogenicity of the DNA vaccine given alone. The pGA2/JS2 DNA vaccine expresses gag,&#xD;
      protease, reverse transcriptase, env, tat, vpu, and rev.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups. People in Group A receive either 2 injections&#xD;
      of a lower dose (300 mcg) of the DNA plasmid vaccine or the placebo control. People in Group&#xD;
      B receive either 2 injections of a higher dose (3000 mcg) of the DNA plasmid vaccine or the&#xD;
      control. Group B will be enrolled only if the vaccine is found to be safe and well-tolerated&#xD;
      during the initial 2-week evaluation of all participants in Group A. Participants receive&#xD;
      vaccinations administered at Months 0 and 2. All vaccinations are administered by&#xD;
      intramuscular (IM) injection in an outpatient setting. Participants have about 10 clinic&#xD;
      visits during this study, including the screening and injection visits. Participants give&#xD;
      blood and urine samples at study visits. They are tested for HIV before entering the study&#xD;
      and 4 more times during the study. Women who can become pregnant may undergo up to 3&#xD;
      pregnancy tests during the study period.&#xD;
