      The main outcome of this study will be to compare the prevalence of PA AF episodes longer&#xD;
      than 30 seconds versus the prevalence of PA AF episodes including episodes shorter than 30&#xD;
      seconds, in adult patients who survived IS or TIA with no previous history of AF, after 7-day&#xD;
      Holter monitoring. Based on the previous assumptions, the secondary objectives of the project&#xD;
      will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the prevalence of patients diagnosed with BAF after 24-hour, 72-hour, and&#xD;
           7-day Holter monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study the feasibility of using information obtained from the ECG during sinus rhythm,&#xD;
           for example the characteristics of the P-wave, to predict the presence of PA AF and BAF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To Collect a new database of multi-monitored, high-resolution, long-term ECG signals.&#xD;
           The data will be used by the My-Atria consortium for research purposes, for the&#xD;
           development and validation of arrhythmia detection algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the study are intended to have an impact on how AF is screened, diagnosed, and&#xD;
      treated. The results will also contribute to the choice of the most appropriate secondary&#xD;
      stroke prevention modality, which therefore refers to the treatment of subjects who have&#xD;
      already had an episode of IS or TIA.&#xD;

      Rational:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although patient management and treatment has greatly improved in recent years, atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation (AF) remains the most common arrhythmia related with stroke, heart failure,&#xD;
      sudden death and cardiovascular morbidity in the global population1. Considering the general&#xD;
      adult population, the prevalence of AF is less than 1%, while in people aged 75-84 it reaches&#xD;
      7%2,3, and is expected to increase in the elderly population and in patients with certain&#xD;
      predisposing risk factors4-10. Recent studies show that 20-30% of stroke survivors are likely&#xD;
      related to AF11-14 and, if not treated properly, it can lead to serious consequences such as&#xD;
      future thromboembolic complications, recurrence of stroke episodes or death15-17. The UK&#xD;
      National Clinical Guidelines for Stroke Patient Management, provided by the Royal College of&#xD;
      Physicians18, recommend cardiac monitoring for at least 12 hours for people with IS or TIA&#xD;
      who would be eligible for secondary prevention treatment for AF and at least 24 hours for&#xD;
      monitoring for patients with no other known cause of stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2016 ESC guidelines for the treatment of AF instead recommend monitoring of at least 72&#xD;
      hours in patients with IS or TIA, for example 72 hours of Holter monitoring after the stroke&#xD;
      event12,19, or for longer periods20,21. Given the intermittent nature of AF and its&#xD;
      inclination to be asymptomatic, it would be useful to test the hypothesis that this last&#xD;
      approach could lead to a better diagnosis strategy of AF and consequently could clarify the&#xD;
      relationship between AF and stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detection of AF episodes has improved with the rapid development of technology in the medical&#xD;
      field, and recently there has been an increase in interest in evaluating whether brief atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation (BAF) episodes, less than 30 seconds, carry a similar risk to those of greater&#xD;
      length and whether these constitute an indication for treatment. Although new research is&#xD;
      focusing on detecting BAF episodes, uncertainty persists in determining whether or not these&#xD;
      episodes increase the risk of stroke, as well as the treatment needed for the aforementioned&#xD;
      range of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study in patients with first episode of IS or TIA and presence of AF detected by&#xD;
      standard ECG concluded that in 6.3% of 869 cases AF was paroxysmal22. The definition of&#xD;
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PA AF) in this specific case was related to those episodes of&#xD;
      AF that spontaneously converted into sinus rhythm. Similarly, in another study from 2010,&#xD;
      previously undiagnosed PA AF was found in 9.2% of the population with IS or TIA23; in the&#xD;
      latter study, the mean monitoring time was 22.6 hours and the presence of only episodes of&#xD;
      BAF was detected in 72% of the people diagnosed with PA AF while the rest of the patients&#xD;
      also had longer episodes of 30 seconds. Similar results were obtained in an AF study in the&#xD;
      population with IS or TIA after mobile cardiac telemetry in which 85% of device-reported&#xD;
      episodes were found to be less than 30 seconds24. These results encourage researchers to&#xD;
      focus more on the subject, therefore in this study we want to investigate the real prevalence&#xD;
      of BAF. The results could guide clinicians to determine the most appropriate preventive and&#xD;
      curative interventions for this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The international consortium &quot;My-Atria&quot; - which brings together universities, companies and&#xD;
      hospitals from five European countries including Italy, Spain, Germany, Sweden and the&#xD;
      Netherlands - aims to develop a multidisciplinary network to develop research and training&#xD;
      &quot;without barriers&quot; between academic, industrial and clinical entities in the area of atrial&#xD;
      diseases. Mortara Instrument EU company, as a member of the My-Atria Consortium, and the UOC&#xD;
      of Neurology and Stroke Network of the Ospedale Maggiore in Bologna, are both interested in&#xD;
      the relationship between cardiovascular risk and BAF. It therefore seems logical to join&#xD;
      forces and move together in the same direction by proposing a protocol with the aim of&#xD;
      studying whether BAF represents a biomarker of increased cardiovascular risk and consequently&#xD;
      investigating the clinical relevance and modality of a screening process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New methodologies are needed to detect and predict even brief episodes of AF, so there is a&#xD;
      need to collect a new database of multiple, high resolution, long-term monitoring ECG&#xD;
      signals. The data will be used by the members of the My-Atria Consortium for research&#xD;
      purposes, for the development and validation of arrhythmia detection algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome of this study will be to compare the prevalence of PA AF episodes longer&#xD;
      than 30 seconds versus the prevalence of PA AF episodes including episodes shorter than 30&#xD;
      seconds, in adult patients who survived IS or TIA with no previous history of AF, after 7-day&#xD;
      Holter monitoring. Based on the previous assumptions, the secondary objectives of the project&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational study with transversal design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population concerns adult subjects admitted to the Neurology and Stroke Network&#xD;
      UOC, diagnosed with IS or TIA (confirmed through standardized clinical practice).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrollments will be made for a total number of about 660 patients. Considering that, in&#xD;
      the UOC of Neurology and Metropolitan Stroke Network at the Ospedale Maggiore in Bologna&#xD;
      there is an absolute number of patients with stroke or TIA episodes that is equivalent to&#xD;
      about 800 per year, the study considers an enrollment phase lasting about one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main parameters / endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absolute number of AF episodes (i.e. all AF episodes shorter than seven days) and BAF in&#xD;
      adult patients with recent IS or TIA with no previous history of AF, in order to identify and&#xD;
      compare prevalence rates to determine the clinical relevance of any BAF screening process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absolute number of BAF episodes detected with Holter 24 hours, 72 hours and 7 days after&#xD;
      recent IS or TIA event, with the aim of comparing detected prevalence rates to support the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the prevalence of BAF will increase in patients subjected to a longer&#xD;
      continuous monitoring time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extent of the burden on clinical staff and risks and benefits associated with participation&#xD;
      in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is non-interventional, involves the application of two Holter devices for a total&#xD;
      duration of 7 days in addition to routine clinical practice (which involves monitoring, but&#xD;
      without continuous recording via multi-parameter monitor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will be treated according to the normal diagnostic and therapeutic&#xD;
      procedure and will not directly benefit from participation in this study. Participation in&#xD;
      the study could be associated with the risk of mild adverse skin reactions due to the&#xD;
      presence of electrodes of Holter devices, to be applied to the upper chest of the subject or&#xD;
      to patient discomfort (the materials used are already commercially available, tested and used&#xD;
      in normal clinical practice). Nursing staff will be able to remove the devices if the&#xD;
      discomfort for the patient becomes intolerable. For the clinical staff, the burden will&#xD;
      mainly be due to the provision of an informed consent form (ICF), the compilation of the data&#xD;
      collection form (CRF) and the application, decontamination and data download of Holter&#xD;
      devices. The data collected will be made anonymous in accordance with the laws and&#xD;
      regulations on privacy (GDPR).&#xD;
