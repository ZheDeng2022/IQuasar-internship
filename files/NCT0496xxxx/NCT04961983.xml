      This is a field trial with a randomized pre-test post-test control group design. This trial&#xD;
      is the second phase of an exploratory mixed methods research. Prior to this trial, a&#xD;
      qualitative study through in-depth interviews to tour guides from 11 language divisions and&#xD;
      also policy makers of Indonesian Tour Guide Association Bali branch (HPI Bali). The education&#xD;
      model for tour guides were developed based on the integration of theory of planned behavior&#xD;
      (TPB) and identity theory. This educational model is expected to improve the behavior of tour&#xD;
      guides in providing travel health information to tourists they serve, which is currently&#xD;
      still lacking. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the measurement of behavior can not be&#xD;
      conducted. Therefore, this trial aims to test the efficacy of the comprehensive education&#xD;
      model to improve the indirect and direct determinants of the behavior namely attitude,&#xD;
      subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, role identity, actual behavioral control and&#xD;
      behavioral intention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research hypothesis are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The comprehensive travel health education model improves the attitude of tour guides&#xD;
           towards providing travel health information to tourists?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The comprehensive travel health education model improves the subjective norms of tour&#xD;
           guides towards providing travel health information to tourists?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The comprehensive travel health education model improves the perceived behavioral&#xD;
           control of tour guides in providing travel health information to tourists?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The comprehensive travel health education model improves the role identity of tour&#xD;
           guides as a travel health promoter for tourists?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The comprehensive travel health education model improves the actual behavioral control&#xD;
           of tour guides in providing travel health information to tourists?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The comprehensive travel health education model improves the intention of tour guides to&#xD;
           provide travel health information to tourists?&#xD;

      1. Study design: This is a field trial with a randomized pre-test post-test control group&#xD;
           design. This trial is the second phase of an exploratory mixed methods research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study setting: Data collection will be conducted in Bali, Indonesia, started from&#xD;
           September 2021 to February 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study population: The target population in this study are all general tour guides in&#xD;
           Bali, Indonesia. The accessible population are general tour guides who are registered as&#xD;
           members of HPI Bali who can be reached during the data collection period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sample size: The calculation of the minimum sample size in this study was carried out&#xD;
           with the assistance of the WHO Sample Size Determination software using the hypothesis&#xD;
           test formula for the mean difference of two populations (one-sided).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Based on the sample size calculation with the above formula, the minimum sample size for&#xD;
           each group is 69 tour guides. Taking into account the drop-out rate of 10%, the number&#xD;
           of samples for each group is 76 tour guides. Thus, the total number of samples for&#xD;
           intervention and comparison groups in this study is 152 tour guides.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Sample selection: The sample selection was carried out with disproportionate stratified&#xD;
           random sampling using a sampling frame namely the list of tour guides who are registered&#xD;
           as the members of Indonesian Guides Association (HPI) Bali Branch from 11 language&#xD;
           divisions. The number of samples in each division for intervention and control group&#xD;
           ranged from 5 to 8 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Sample allocation: Permuted block randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Study variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Dependent variable is comprehensive travel health education model.&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  familiarity with Zoom usage,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  familiarity with WhatsApp usage.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  type of tourism activities,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  employer's policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Research instrument:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The instrument that will be used in this study is a questionnaire. The measurement using&#xD;
      questionnaire will be conducted before the intervention (pre-test) and after the intervention&#xD;
      (post-test). The developed questionnaire consists of several parts, namely the identity or&#xD;
      socio-demographic characteristics of the subjects, job characteristics, characteristics of&#xD;
      tourists served, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, role identity,&#xD;
      actual behavior control and behavioral intentions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire was developed based on the guidelines for developing a questionnaire for&#xD;
      TPB-based interventions and the results of the qualitative study. The assessment for each&#xD;
      statement item on the attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control and role&#xD;
      identity, uses a Likert scale consisting of seven scales, namely: 1 = strongly disagree, 2 =&#xD;
      disagree; 3 = disagree, 4 = undecided, 5 = somewhat agree, 6 = agree; 7 = strongly agree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire on the actual behavior control section consists of questions related to&#xD;
      knowledge about prevention and first aid for tourism health problems. Questions to measure&#xD;
      knowledge were developed based on the material provided during the intervention. The correct&#xD;
      answer for each knowledge question will get a score 1, while the wrong or 'do not know'&#xD;
      answer will be given a score 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire on the behavioral intention section is also written in statement format.&#xD;
      The assessment for each statement item uses a Likert scale consisting of seven scales,&#xD;
      namely: a scale of 1 = strongly not intending, 2 = not intending; 3 = lack of intention, 4 =&#xD;
      undecided, 5 = somewhat intend, 6 = intend; 7 = very intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The validity and reliability of the questionnaire will be tested before it being used in data&#xD;
      collection. Twenty tour guides will be involved in the pilot test of the questionnaire. If&#xD;
      necessary, improvements will be made to the questionnaire based on the test results. The&#xD;
      questionnaire is self-administered and will be given to the subjects in digital format.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Descriptive statistic Quantitative data obtained from the questionnaire will be analyzed&#xD;
           descriptively by calculating the frequency distribution for data on a categorical scale&#xD;
           and by calculating the total value, mean, median, standard deviation and range of values&#xD;
           from minimum to maximum on continuous scale data. On the variables of attitude,&#xD;
           subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and role identity, a positive statement&#xD;
           will get a score of 1 = strongly disagree; 1 = strongly disagree; 2 = disagree; 3 =&#xD;
           disagree; 4 = doubtful; 5 = somewhat agree; 6 = agree; 7 = strongly agree. As for&#xD;
           negative statements, the score given is the opposite, namely a score of 7 = strongly&#xD;
           disagree; 6 = disagree; 5 = disagree; 4 = doubtful; 3 = somewhat agree; 2 = agree; 1 =&#xD;
           strongly agree. The actual behavioral control score was 1 for correct answer and 0 for&#xD;
           wrong answer and 'do not know' answer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Chi square test Comparison of sample characteristics in the intervention and control&#xD;
           groups in terms of control variables (age, gender, education, length of work, employment&#xD;
           status, tourists' country of origin, type of tourism activities and employer's policy)&#xD;
           was also carried out using the chi square test. Through this test, it will be known&#xD;
           whether there are differences in the two groups based on these variables. If the p value&#xD;
           &gt; 0.05, the two groups are the same (comparable), whereas if p value ≤ 0.05 then the two&#xD;
           groups are different in terms of the variables tested. Variables that have a p value ≤&#xD;
           0.05 will be tested in multivariate analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Normality test Data normality test is conducted to determine whether or not the data on&#xD;
           attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, actual behavior control, role&#xD;
           identity and behavioral intentions scores are normally distributed, as a prerequisite&#xD;
           for being able to perform parametric statistical tests. Based on the sample size, the&#xD;
           normality test will be carried out using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If the normality&#xD;
           test produces a p value &gt; 0.05 then the data distribution is normally distributed. On&#xD;
           the other hand, the data is not normally distributed if the p ≤ 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Homogeneity test The purpose of the homogeneity test is to find out whether the two&#xD;
           groups to be compared have the same variance. According to the sample size, homogeneity&#xD;
           test will be carried out using Levene's test. If the results of the homogeneity test&#xD;
           show a p value &gt; 0.05 then the variance between groups is homogeneous. On the other&#xD;
           hand, if the p value ≤ 0,05, the variance of the two groups is not homogeneous.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Mean comparison test The mean comparison test will be conducted to determine whether&#xD;
           there is a difference in the mean between the intervention and the control group&#xD;
           (difference in the mean of two independent samples). The mean comparison procedure used&#xD;
           in this study is the independent samples t test. However, testing with independent&#xD;
           samples t test is a parametric test which assumes the data is normally distributed and&#xD;
           both groups have the same variance. The interpretation of the test results is that Ho is&#xD;
           accepted if the p value &gt; 0.05 or the zero value lies within the confidence interval for&#xD;
           the difference in the mean, on the other hand Ho is rejected if the p value ≤ 0,05 or&#xD;
           the zero value lies outside the confidence interval for the mean difference of the two&#xD;
           groups. If the data is not normally distributed, the data will be transformed.&#xD;
           Furthermore, if the transformation cannot make the data normally distributed, the data&#xD;
           will be analyzed by non-parametric statistical tests, namely the Mann Whitney U test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition to the comparison of the mean between the intervention and comparison&#xD;
           groups, a comparison test of the means was also carried out for the control variables.&#xD;
           For categorical-scale control variables with two categories, a t-test was performed,&#xD;
           such as a comparative analysis of the mean for the intervention and control groups.&#xD;
           Meanwhile, for control variables that have more than two categories, an analysis of&#xD;
           variance (ANOVA) test will be carried out. If the assumptions for the parametric&#xD;
           statistical test are not met, the Kruskal-Wallis test is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Multivariate analysis After the bivariate analysis, a multivariate analysis was carried&#xD;
           out which aims to control the inter-correlation between the variables under study. In&#xD;
           multivariate analysis, all dependent variables are tested simultaneously. If the&#xD;
           assumptions for parametric statistical analysis are met, the statistical test used is&#xD;
           multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). MANOVA is chosen because there is more than&#xD;
           one continuous-scale dependent variable to be tested and more than one categorical-scale&#xD;
           independent variable with two or more categories. If the assumptions are not met, then a&#xD;
           non-parametric MANOVA statistical test is performed.&#xD;
