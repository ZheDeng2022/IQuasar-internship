      OBJECTIVE To improve chronically ill adolescents' transition to adult care by preparing and&#xD;
      supporting the parents. The study aim is to improve parents' (of chronically ill adolescents,&#xD;
      16-18 years) transition readiness by offering them a brief transition program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS Young peoples´ self-management skills are mainly developed at home, guided by&#xD;
      their parents, rather than in consultations with health professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a nurse-led transfer intervention focusing on parents'&#xD;
      knowledge, skills and attitudes will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. improve the parents´ readiness for their child's transition to adult health care&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. support the parents' gradual handing over of treatment responsibility to the adolescent&#xD;
           and, that an improvement in parental transition readiness will&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. strengthen the adolescent's self-management skills and increase his/her readiness for&#xD;
           transition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND Transfer from paediatric to adult care for chronically ill adolescents is&#xD;
      associated with no-shows and low treatment adherence, as well as anxiety and concerns among&#xD;
      parents. Studies show that support for parents results in better transition for both parties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      ParTNer-STEPs is a transfer program consisting of three initiatives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a website with information about the adult department and legal changes as well as&#xD;
           advice from other parents and young people&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. online teaching events (web based seminars) for parents&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. transfer consultations across the paediatric and adult department&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD The intervention will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) study over&#xD;
      two years. The project will be carried out in four paediatric outpatient clinics at&#xD;
      Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Denmark: nephrology, hepatology, neurology&#xD;
      and rheumatology. Based on a power calculation, the investigators aim to include parents of&#xD;
      minimum 62 adolescents. Primary outcome: Parents' transition readiness (TR). Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes: Adolescents' TR, self-management skills, and quality of life.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN The study design is a randomized controlled trail (RCT) study in a period of 6&#xD;
      to 18 months before the adolescent is transferred to adult care (depends on when the&#xD;
      participant is recruited before transfer) and three months after transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUTMENT Potential participants will be contacted by the paediatric nurses at the four&#xD;
      outpatient clinics and briefly informed of the study. If the parents are interested in the&#xD;
      project, the project coordinator will provide the parents with oral and written information&#xD;
      of the study, including the fact that they can withdraw from the study at any time without&#xD;
      consequences for their child's treatment. There will also be provided written information to&#xD;
      their adolescent child and the adolescent will also get the opportunity to speak directly to&#xD;
      the project coordinator, if they have any questions. Finally, after time to consider their&#xD;
      participation in the project, a written consent will be obtained. Under the recruitment&#xD;
      process the investigators will carefully consider the risk of coercion, autonomy, and&#xD;
      confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION Randomisation will be conducted after screening and written consent of parents.&#xD;
      Randomisation will by conducted by computer-generated (REDCap) random numbers as a dyad&#xD;
      (adolescent and parents) with a ratio of 1:1 (using algorithm to stratify by the four&#xD;
      outpatient's clinic). The dyads will be randomised into two groups 1) receive the&#xD;
      intervention (standard care plus ParTNer-STEPs until their child´s transfer to adult care) or&#xD;
      2) standard care (control group). Once the database has defined a dyad's allocation, no&#xD;
      changes can be made. Those randomised to the intervention arm will then receive access to the&#xD;
      intervention materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE-SIZE No previous studies have focused on whether it´s possible to increase parents´&#xD;
      transition readiness score (TR) by offering them a transfer program. A previous&#xD;
      cross-sectional study found that parents of chronically ill adolescents have an average TR&#xD;
      score of 3.12 (SD 0.68). Based on our clinical experience, advice from the author of the&#xD;
      primary outcome questionnaire, and a review of each item in the questionnaire (Medical&#xD;
      self-management and transition readiness), the investigators assume that it will be possible&#xD;
      to increase the parents' TR score in the intervention group with 0,5 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are planning an RCT study with a continuous response variable from an&#xD;
      independent control- and intervention group with 1 control(s) per intervention subject. Based&#xD;
      on a previous study the investigators assume the response within each group will be normally&#xD;
      distributed with standard deviation 0.68. If the true difference in the intervention and&#xD;
      control means is 0.50, the investigators will need to include parents of 31 individual&#xD;
      adolescents in each group to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the population means&#xD;
      of the intervention and control groups are equal with probability (power) 0.80. The Type I&#xD;
      error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05. Thus, the&#xD;
      investigators need to recruit a total of parents of at least 62 individual adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SETTING The intervention will be carried out at the nephrology, hepatology, neurology and&#xD;
      rheumatology paediatric and adult outpatient clinics at Copenhagen University Hospital,&#xD;
      Rigshospitalet, Denmark. The investigators have chosen these four specialties, because low&#xD;
      treatment adherence and non-attendance in the patient group could result in permanent&#xD;
      disabilities or critical consequences. In Denmark adolescents transfer to adult care when&#xD;
      turning 18 years old regardless of the adolescent's maturity or transitional readiness. Each&#xD;
      paediatric clinic has at least one youth ambassador (a nurse with special interest and&#xD;
      training in adolescent medicine). The existing transitional care includes youth consultations&#xD;
      using the split-visit model and assessment of adolescent transition readiness. The clinics&#xD;
      currently have no programmes targeting parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICS The project will adhere to the regulations established by the Ethical Guidelines for&#xD;
      Nursing Research in the Nordic Countries, all relevant laws and regulations in Denmark, and&#xD;
      to the Declaration of Helsinki II and is approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency,&#xD;
      reference no. VD-2018-396.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have formally enquired the regional research ethics committee with a full&#xD;
      clinical description of the project. They have reviewed the project and given us permission&#xD;
      to perform the study (reference no. FSP 20031083).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Danish legislation studies such as register research projects, interview surveys&#xD;
      and questionnaire surveys can be performed without formal ethical approval cf. section 1 and&#xD;
      2 in the committee law as no human biological material is included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before obtaining consent from the parents, the investigator will provide all participants&#xD;
      with oral and written information of the study, including the fact that they can withdraw&#xD;
      from the study at any time without consequences for their child's treatment. The&#xD;
      investigators will carefully consider the risk of coercion, autonomy, and confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATACOLLECTION Data will be collected though questionnaires at baseline and every six months&#xD;
      up to three months after the adolescent's transfer to adult care. Questionnaires will be sent&#xD;
      out via email or by post based on participants´ wishes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANGEMENT All data will be handled confidential and stored in the password protected&#xD;
      software REDCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS A detailed statistical analysis plan (SOP) will be developed when all&#xD;
      participants have completed the final measurement (six months after the completed&#xD;
      intervention) in collaboration with statisticians. The investigators plan to include t tests,&#xD;
      Pearson's Chi-square test, regression analysis, intention to treat and linear models.&#xD;
      Logistic regression analyses will be carried out to describe transition readiness and&#xD;
      allocation of responsibility within the intervention group and compare it to the control&#xD;
      group's score. Socio-demographic data and the parents' uncertainty-score will be considered&#xD;
      as variables. The SOP will be confirmed among all project group members before the&#xD;
      investigators will be looking into data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MISSING DATA, DROP OUT AND LOST TO FOLLOW UP Loss to follow-up and missing data for various&#xD;
      reasons is impossible to avoid in randomized trials. The investigators will apply the&#xD;
      analysis framework in which missing data related to the intention-to-treat approach depend on&#xD;
      making plausible assumptions about the missingness of the data and including all participants&#xD;
      in subsequent sensitivity analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Attempt to follow up all randomized parents, even if they withdraw from allocated&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Perform a main analysis of all observed data that are valid under a plausible assumption&#xD;
           about the missingness of the data (i.e., Model-based: data as observed; using linear&#xD;
           mixed effects models, assuming that data are 'Missing at Random' [MAR]).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Perform sensitivity analyses to explore the effect of departures from the assumption&#xD;
           made in the main (#2) analysis (i.e., a non-responder-imputation: using the value at&#xD;
           baseline to replace missing data will correspond to a non-responder imputation; these&#xD;
           models will potentially be informative even if data are 'Missing Not At Random' [MNAR]).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Account for all randomized parents, at least in the sensitivity analyses (covered by #2&#xD;
           and #3 above, plus the corresponding analyses based on the per protocol population).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interpretation of the corresponding statistical measures of uncertainty of the treatment&#xD;
      effect and treatment comparisons will involve consideration of the potential contribution of&#xD;
      bias to the P-value, 95% confidence interval, and of the inference in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary analysis population will be all parents with available data at baseline,&#xD;
      statistically modelled using repeated-measures linear mixed effects models (see above). These&#xD;
      models will be valid if data are 'MAR'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity: The investigators will analyze all variables, with missing data being handled by&#xD;
      multiple imputation techniques. When the different sensitivity analyses agree, and the&#xD;
      analyses on the sensitivity analyses and the main analysis lead to essentially the same&#xD;
      conclusions, confidence in the trial results is increased.&#xD;
