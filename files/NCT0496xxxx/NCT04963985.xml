  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN) is a fatal illness resulting from autosomal&#xD;
      dominantly inherited single-point mutations on the transthyretin gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tafamidis is a specific stabilizer of both variant and wild-type TTR. Tafamidis binds to TTR&#xD;
      at the thyroxine binding sites and inhibits TTR tetramer dissociation, the rate limiting step&#xD;
      in the amyloidogenic process. The result disrupts the amyloid cascade and fibril formation&#xD;
      and interrupts disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study provides the basis for the study of the effect of tafamidis on the stability of&#xD;
      transthyretin and its safety, tolerance and efficacy in patients with transthyretin amyloid&#xD;
      polyneuropathy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transthyretin amyloidosis is a protein misfolding disease with a broad spectrum of&#xD;
      manifestations. When the peripheral nerves are affected predominately, the disease is termed&#xD;
      transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN). When the heart is primarily affected, the&#xD;
      disease is called transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). ATTR-PN is a fatal illness&#xD;
      resulting from autosomal dominantly inherited single-point mutations on the transthyretin&#xD;
      gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tafamidis is a specific stabilizer of both variant and wild-type TTR. Tafamidis binds to TTR&#xD;
      at the thyroxine binding sites and inhibits TTR tetramer dissociation, the rate limiting step&#xD;
      in the amyloidogenic process. The result disrupts the amyloid cascade and fibril formation&#xD;
      and interrupts disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In China, ATTR-PN is rare, estimated at approximately 1997 persons . In recent years, about&#xD;
      30-40 case reports have been published and several ATTR-PN families were reported with&#xD;
      different TTR gene mutations from those observed in Europe. Delay in the time to diagnosis is&#xD;
      a major obstacle to the optimal management of ATTR-PN in China, and patients will typically&#xD;
      wait several years between the emergence of first clinical signs and receiving an accurate&#xD;
      diagnosis. There is a critical need to raise disease awareness, to facilitate earlier&#xD;
      diagnosis and an urgency to enable access to treatment given the significant unmet medical&#xD;
      need in this rare and fatal disease.&#xD;
