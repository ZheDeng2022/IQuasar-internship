  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the fact that arterial vasodilation can be advantageous for endovascular&#xD;
      catheterization and that an increase in body temperature can cause vasodilation by activating&#xD;
      the cholinergic active vasodilator system, this study was planned to observe whether there&#xD;
      was a significant change in the diameter of artery through ultrasound and to confirm the&#xD;
      effectiveness of heating in the traditional palpation technique and the US-guided technique&#xD;
      after local warming of the insertion site of arterial catheter in adult patients undergoing&#xD;
      cardiac surgery.&#xD;

      Arterial cannulation is one of the important clinical techniques commonly used for real-time&#xD;
      monitoring of blood pressure changes or when repeated blood tests are required. However,&#xD;
      complications such as bleeding, hematoma, and vascular occlusion may occur if the operator&#xD;
      has little or no experience in the procedure, or if arterial cannulation is not easy due to&#xD;
      the patient's underlying disease and systemic factors. This situation prolongs the anesthesia&#xD;
      induction time and may cause great harm to the patient in cases with a high bleeding&#xD;
      tendency, such as in cardiac surgery. Various studies have reported various arterial&#xD;
      cannulation techniques so far, and there have been many advances in arterial cannulation&#xD;
      techniques due to the general use of ultrasound (hereafter US). However, there is still a&#xD;
      risk of complications due to inexperience in the use of US or poor vascular status of the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
