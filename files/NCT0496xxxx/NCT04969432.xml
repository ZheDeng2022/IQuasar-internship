      The current study was conducted to comparison of the Client-centered (CC) intervention with&#xD;
      face-to-face (FF) and TR methods after Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). The pilot study was&#xD;
      planned to examine the impact of the CC intervention on quality of life, perceived&#xD;
      occupational performance and satisfaction. The current study was designed according to the&#xD;
      CONSORT statement, which provides a standardized method for randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      design. Approval for the study was granted by the Local Ethics Committee. Written informed&#xD;
      consent was obtained from all participants prior to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants A total of 56 older adults who were admitted to the occupational therapy&#xD;
      department of a public university between January 2021 and May 2021 were screened.&#xD;
      Participants who were eligible according to the evaluation and inclusion-exclusion criteria&#xD;
      one week after TKA were included in the study. The study inclusion criteria were: (1) age&#xD;
      between 65 and 75 years; (2) Mini Mental State Examination score of ≥24; (3) education level&#xD;
      of at least completion of elementary school; (4) having undergone unilateral TKA surgery; (5)&#xD;
      access to technological equipment; and (6) ability to understand and follow verbal&#xD;
      instructions. The exclusion criteria were defined as: (1) revision surgery; (2) having any&#xD;
      chronic disease that will affect the rehabilitation process; (3) auditory and visual problems&#xD;
      that may affect rehabilitation implementation and communication; (4) postoperative&#xD;
      complications (e.g., nerve injury and deep vein thrombosis); and (5) attendance of any&#xD;
      rehabilitation program (physiotherapy, speech therapy, psychotherapy, etc.) during the study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement The demographic characteristics of the participants were recorded, including age,&#xD;
      sex, education level, body mass index (BMI), other people in the house where they lived, and&#xD;
      marital status. The Mini Mental State Examination was used to determine the cognitive status&#xD;
      included in the inclusion criteria. The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure and the&#xD;
      Nottingham Health Profile were applied to all the subjects twice, before and after&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments Mini Mental State Examination Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), which was&#xD;
      used in the inclusion criteria of the study, was used to determine the cognitive state of the&#xD;
      participants. From a maximum total of 30 points, a score of 24 is accepted as the threshold&#xD;
      value, with scores below this value indicating problems in cognitive functions. Turkish&#xD;
      validity and reliability studies of the test have been conducted and the researcher found the&#xD;
      MMSE positive and negative predictive values .90 and .95 respectively and kappa score .86.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Canadian Occupational Performance Measure The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure&#xD;
      (COPM) is a measure that determines the problems faced by individuals in the field of&#xD;
      occupational performance through a semi-structured interview. Occupational performance&#xD;
      problems are evaluated with self-reported performance and satisfaction scores. In the first&#xD;
      step, ADL problems experienced by individuals in the areas of self-care, productivity and&#xD;
      leisure are determined and each occupation is scored according to importance. The subject&#xD;
      then selects a maximum of 5 occupations according to their importance scores and gives&#xD;
      performance and satisfaction scores in a Likert-type system of 1- 10 for each occupation. The&#xD;
      overall performance and satisfaction scores are obtained as the total of the performance and&#xD;
      satisfaction scores of each occupation divided by the number of occupations. The Turkish&#xD;
      version of COPM was used to evaluate the perceived occupational performance and satisfaction.&#xD;
      The Turkish adaptation performed and test re-test reliability of Turkish version of COPM&#xD;
      performance was .988 and satisfaction .986, indicating excellent reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nottingham Health Profile The Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) is a general quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire that measures perceived health problems and the level of these problems&#xD;
      affecting normal ADL. The questionnaire consists of 38 items related to health status. Each&#xD;
      item is answered as yes or no, and each section is scored between 0-100, with 0 indicating&#xD;
      the best health status, and 100, the worst health status. In the Turkish adaptation study,&#xD;
      test-retest reliability of the subscales (dimensions) of the scale varied between 0.70 and&#xD;
      0.92, and internal consistency values ranged between 0.56 and 0.87, confirming its validity&#xD;
      and reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The intervention program which was used both method (TR and FF) is designed to&#xD;
      consist of 4 weeks, 4 days a week, 45-minute sessions. The caregiver actively participated in&#xD;
      the treatment in order to prevent any possible injuries and to perform the applications more&#xD;
      smoothly during the entire intervention process. The FF method was performed in the&#xD;
      occupational therapy unit. The CC interventions with TR were delivered through real-time&#xD;
      interaction programs such as Zoom, Skype, WhatsApp video call, or Microsoft Teams, according&#xD;
      to the preference of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Client-centered intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CC intervention developed according to the literature and based on a systematic therapy&#xD;
      process, characterized by an active participatory attitude of both the participants after TKA&#xD;
      process and the therapist, consisted of 5 phases: (1) CC goal-setting, (2) negotiating a&#xD;
      therapy plan, (3) the actual intervention, (4) an evaluation of the outcome and (5) finally&#xD;
      reporting to relevant others. The key aspect of this intervention was the CC approach in&#xD;
      which the therapist is trained to clarify the prioritized goals of the patient. The therapy&#xD;
      procedure was implemented according to the prioritized goals determined in the COPM. The&#xD;
      stages are explained below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First stage: Setting a measurable, realistic, and achievable goal for the solution of&#xD;
      occupations involving performance problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second stage: Develop and evaluate the pros and cons of possible solutions by brainstorming&#xD;
      through the occupation determined with the COPM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third stage: After deciding on a possible solution, making a plan and taking action:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adaptation of the occupation determined with the COPM, making alterations to one or more&#xD;
           of the following: who (involving another person), where (making a change in the place),&#xD;
           when (changing the time), how (altering the way of application) and what (adding up new&#xD;
           steps at the beginning or end of the occupation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Planning the steps of the occupation (in accordance with priority),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bringing together occupation-related information and resources&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fourth stage: Revising the therapy process which has been activated with the CC training&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifth stage: Receiving feedback about individual's experiences and making alterations to the&#xD;
      course of action when necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Data were analyzed with SPSS version 25.0 statistical software. Data&#xD;
      were presented as mean ± standard deviation values. The conformity of the data to normal&#xD;
      distribution was analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The data were seen not to be&#xD;
      distributed normally, so non-parametric statistical methods were used. Differences between&#xD;
      groups were analyzed with the Chi-square test for nominal data. Comparisons between the&#xD;
      groups were made using the Mann-Whitney U test. Pre- to post-intervention changes within the&#xD;
      groups were analyzed with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Quade's rank analysis of covariance&#xD;
      test was used to compare between group analysis. Statistical significance was evaluated at&#xD;
      levels of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The power of the study and effect sizes were analyzed using G*Power software, version&#xD;
      3.1.9.2. Power analysis was performed to calculate the sample size. It was determined that 21&#xD;
      subjects were needed in each group to ensure a power of 90%, assuming a two-tailed test for α&#xD;
      equal to 0.05. Effect size was calculated using the means and standard deviations of the&#xD;
      groups. Effect size benchmarks were determined as &lt;0.30, 0.30-0.80, and &gt;0.80, interpreted as&#xD;
      small, moderate, and strong, respectively.&#xD;
