  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy of apraglutide in increasing&#xD;
      intestinal energy absorption in relation to metabolic balance assessments.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, multicenter trial to evaluate the change in absolute energy&#xD;
      absorption over metabolic balance periods of apraglutide in adult subjects with SBS-IF and&#xD;
      CIC. The active pharmaceutical ingredient is apraglutide, an investigational GLP-2 analogue.&#xD;
      The trial consists of an evaluation period of 52 weeks.&#xD;
