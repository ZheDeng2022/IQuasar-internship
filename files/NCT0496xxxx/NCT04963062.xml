  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of urinary tract stone disease is increasing. According to the National Health&#xD;
      and Nutrition Examination Survey, as of 2012, 10.6% of men and 7.1% of women in the United&#xD;
      States are affected by renal stone disease. This has led to an increased demand on Urologists&#xD;
      for efficient and safe surgical treatment of stone disease. Over the past two decades,&#xD;
      ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy has become the treatment of choice for most ureteral and&#xD;
      renal stones globally. The holmium laser is considered the gold standard for laser&#xD;
      lithotripsy. Holmium laser lithotripsy with Moses and the thulium laser are new technologies&#xD;
      meant to improve the efficiency of laser lithotripsy. Both are FDA approved treatment&#xD;
      modalities for stone disease. Two in vitro studies have compared Moses versus thulium and&#xD;
      shown that thulium has higher ablative volumes then the holmium laser with Moses, but no&#xD;
      clinical trials have compared the two treatment modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, investigators are going to conduct a prospective, randomized clinical trial to&#xD;
      determine whether there is a difference in procedural time, intraoperative parameters or&#xD;
      stone free rate between the Holmium laser with Moses and the thulium laser. This is&#xD;
      significant as this may lead to shorter overall operative times, which may result in&#xD;
      decreased operative costs and complications.&#xD;

    <description>The holmium laser with Moses is FDA approved. It emits two separate laser pulses with a short time interval between them. The first pulse divides the water between the laser fiber tip and the stone and the second pulse hits the stone unobstructed. The goal is to increase stone ablative volume and decrease retropulsion of the stone.</description>
