  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims is to verify the hypothetize that inhaled Tranexamic Acid (TXA) or&#xD;
      Terlipressin (TER) will be associated with an increase in the rapid control of hemoptysis&#xD;
      without side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized double-blind multicenter triple arm trial compares the administration of TXA&#xD;
      to TER to placebo in patients with mild to severe hemoptysis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In over 90% of cases, hemoptysis is due to a bronchial or non-bronchial systemic arterial&#xD;
      mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embolization of Bronchial Arteries (EBA) is the main specific treatment but is not easily&#xD;
      available. Medical treatment for hemoptysis is not evidence-based.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the investigators will dispense trial drugs using inhalation route which has&#xD;
      not been evaluated in mild to severe hemoptysis in previous trials. In addition, as opposed&#xD;
      to previous trials, the investigators will assess the safety of trials drugs during hospital&#xD;
      stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acid tranexamic (TXA), an antifibrinolytic drug, reduces bleeding in uterine and traumatic&#xD;
      haemorrhage by blocking the action of plasmin on fibrin. Intravenous terlipressin (TER), a&#xD;
      vasoconstrictor, contributes to control digestive haemorrhage but presents many&#xD;
      contraindication when administrated by intravenous route.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator hypothetize that inhaled antifibrinolytic (TXA) or vasoconstrictor (TER)&#xD;
      will be associated with an increase in the rapid control of hemoptysis without side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into 3 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active treatment 1: Tranexamic Acid 500 mg three times a day (every 8 hours) for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active treatment 2: Terlipressin 1 mg three times a day (every 8 hours) for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo: normal saline nebulization three times a day (every 8 hours) for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a hierarchical analysis, the comparison between TXA and TER will be tested once&#xD;
      superiority on efficacy of both inhaled TXA and TER vs placebo is demonstrated. The above&#xD;
      secondary objectives will then be assessed for the comparison of TXA versus TER.&#xD;
