    <textblock>
      Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disorder that cause as&#xD;
      other neurodegenerative diseases profound declines in functioning and thus, require&#xD;
      caregiving for assistance with daily living. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of a multimodal intervention as proposed by the NYU Caregiver Counseling and Support&#xD;
      Intervention (NYUCI) on the quality of life of patients and their caregivers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disorder, which is&#xD;
      characterized by a variable combination of parkinsonism, cerebellar dysfunction, autonomic&#xD;
      failure, and additional signs. No effective treatment is available. MSA patients have a poor&#xD;
      prognosis with a median survival ranging between 6 and 10 years. MSA as other&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases cause profound declines in functioning ; thus, many patients&#xD;
      require caregivers for assistance with daily living. Caregiving can also be extremely&#xD;
      stressful, and many caregivers experience declines in mental health. All of these&#xD;
      repercussions contribute to the deterioration of the caregiver's quality of life and they can&#xD;
      have an impact on the patient, in particular, on the patient's survival. Improving quality of&#xD;
      life is a major element and identifying effective targeted interventions would bring&#xD;
      immediate and direct benefit to patients and their families. In this context, it seems that a&#xD;
      multimodal intervention as proposed by the NYU Caregiver Counseling and Support Intervention&#xD;
      (NYUCI) developed by Mittelman could contribute to improve disease management and better&#xD;
      coping with daily living difficulties. The NYUCI strategy combines sessions of individual and&#xD;
      family counseling, support group participation, and additional on-call telephone&#xD;
      consultations in a flexible counseling approach that is tailored to each caregiving family&#xD;

    <description>Score of other sub-dimension of the MSA Quality of Life scale. The MSA-QoL questionnaire is composed of three different subscales: motor (14 items), non-motor (12 items) and emotional/social (14 items). The response options for each question range from 0 (no problem) to 4 (extreme problem) with higher total scores reflecting more impaired quality of life. The MSA-QoL also includes a visual analogue scale (VAS) of how satisfied patients feel (range 0-100, with lower scores indicating lower quality of life).</description>

    <description>The intervention consists of identifying the individual needs of each caregiver and patient and identifying sources of improvement in the management of daily life, including the optimization of social support. This optimization requires the involvement of people in the environment (family, friends, neighbours) who can provide help, support of any kind, recurrent or punctual, minimizing negative family interactions and maximizing positive contributions by each in supporting and supporting the individual.&#xD;
The intervention is personalized in the sense that the content of each session seeks to adapt itself to the specificities of the couple situation and its surroundings.&#xD;
