  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, with high mortality. About 5% to&#xD;
      10% of breast cancers are hereditary. Most inherited cases of breast cancer are associated&#xD;
      with germline mutations in genes, such as BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2. The cumulative breast&#xD;
      cancer risk for BRCA1, BRCA2 or PALB2 mutation carriers was high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the increased breast cancer risk for the inherited mutation carriers, the risk of&#xD;
      subsequent contralateral breast cancer for the mutation carriers with breast cancer was also&#xD;
      significantly increased. Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy was usually recommended to the&#xD;
      breast cancer patients with BRCA mutation. However, many breast cancer patients refused the&#xD;
      contralateral prophylactic mastectomy, due to the surgical injury, potential surgical&#xD;
      complications, deleteriously affected body image and sexuality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solid evidence validated that radiotherapy after surgery resulted in a reduced local&#xD;
      recurrence for three times lower than surgery alone. It is thought that radiation would&#xD;
      eliminate the microscopic tumors which may already exist in the breast. Thus, we proposed&#xD;
      that for the breast cancer patients with BRCA1, BRCA2 or PALB2 deleterious germline&#xD;
      mutations, prophylactic irradiation to the contralateral breast may reduce the risk of&#xD;
      subsequent contralateral breast cancer. And we would like to further compare the effect of&#xD;
      prophylactic irradiation to the published data from traditional prophylactic contralateral&#xD;
      mastectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, with high mortality. In the US in&#xD;
      2018, the number of estimated new cases of breast cancer accounted for 30% of all the new&#xD;
      cancer cases in women, while the estimated deaths of breast cancer accounted for 14% of all&#xD;
      new cancer deaths. In Chinese females, the most commonly diagnosed cancer was breast cancer,&#xD;
      accounting for 19% of total cases. And breast cancer was the main 5 most common causes of&#xD;
      cancer-related deaths in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 5% to 10% of breast cancers are hereditary. Most inherited cases of breast cancer are&#xD;
      associated with germline mutations in two genes: BRCA1 (BRCA1 DNA repair associated) and&#xD;
      BRCA2 (BRCA2 DNA repair associated). The cumulative breast cancer risk for BRCA1 or BRCA2&#xD;
      mutation carriers at age 70 years reached as high as 50% in US population and 37% in Chinese&#xD;
      population. Benefiting from the next generation sequencing technology, more inherited gene&#xD;
      mutations were discovered. Among these new discovered susceptibility genes, PALB2 (Partner&#xD;
      and localizer of BRCA2) was associated with high increased risks of breast cancer in both&#xD;
      Chinese and US population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the increased breast cancer risk for the inherited mutation carriers, the risk of&#xD;
      subsequent contralateral breast cancer for the mutation carriers with breast cancer was also&#xD;
      significantly increased. For contralateral breast cancer in BRCA mutation carriers, the&#xD;
      cumulative risk for 10 years after breast cancer diagnosis was as high as 25% and for 20&#xD;
      years reached to 40%, as compared 3% and 12% respectively in non-carriers. Contralateral&#xD;
      prophylactic mastectomy was usually recommended to the breast cancer patients with BRCA&#xD;
      mutation, as it can absolutely reduce the risk of contralateral primary cancer. However, many&#xD;
      breast cancer patients refused the contralateral prophylactic mastectomy, due to the surgical&#xD;
      injury, potential surgical complications, deleteriously affected body image and sexuality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solid evidence validated that radiotherapy after surgery resulted in a reduced local&#xD;
      recurrence for three times lower than surgery alone. It is thought that radiation would&#xD;
      eliminate the microscopic tumors which may already exist in the breast. Thus, we proposed&#xD;
      that for the breast cancer patients with BRCA1, BRCA2 or PALB2 deleterious germline&#xD;
      mutations, prophylactic irradiation to the contralateral breast may reduce the risk of&#xD;
      subsequent contralateral breast cancer. And we would like to further compare the effect of&#xD;
      prophylactic irradiation to the published data from traditional prophylactic contralateral&#xD;
      mastectomy.&#xD;
