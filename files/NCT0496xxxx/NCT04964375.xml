      This is a Phase 1, Open-Label Study of ABSK043 to Assess Safety, Tolerability, and&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary antitumor activity will also be assessed. Investigate the pharmacodynamics (PD)&#xD;
      effects and Investigate the metabolites of oral ABSK043&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will start with a dose escalation part of single-agent ABSK043 administered in&#xD;
      repeated 28-day cycles in patients with advanced solid for safety and tolerability. The&#xD;
      expansion part of oral ABSK021 at recommended dose of expansion (RDE) will be followed for&#xD;
      further evaluating safety and tolerability among selected tumor types. Preliminary antitumor&#xD;
      activity will also be assessed.&#xD;

For each dose,In the escalation part, sequential cohorts of patients will receive an oral dose of ABSK043 QD in repeated 28-day cycles. Starting dose level will be 200 mg QD. Then, patients will continuously receive ABSK043 once daily (QD) in repeated 28-day cycles.For the Dose Expansion Phase, patients will each receive orally administered doses of ABSK043 at the RDE in repeated 28-day cycles.</description>
