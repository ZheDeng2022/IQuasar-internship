  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19, a novel coronavirus, has caused widespread mortality and morbidity since it emerged&#xD;
      in 2019. There is ongoing research and growing literature describing severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome (SARS-COV-2). There is a growing population of individuals who have recovered from&#xD;
      acute SARS-COV-2 infection. The long-term effects of COVID-19 are unknown. There are growing&#xD;
      reports of sequelae after acute SARS-CoV-2 not limited to fatigue, dyspnea, reactive airway&#xD;
      disease, organizing pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary emboli,&#xD;
      and tracheal disease. The incidence and natural history of these findings is unstudied.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is a leading cause of death worldwide. The long-term effects of the virus are&#xD;
      unknown. There is lack of reliable information about the natural history of post acute&#xD;
      sequelae. Although there are limited evidence-based treatment guidelines, many patients&#xD;
      receive unproven therapies. Given the mortality and morbidity associated with the illness and&#xD;
      the growing number of patients who have survived COVID-19 the long-term effects are a growing&#xD;
      area of inquiry. This study is designed to better understand the effects of SARS-CoV-2 that&#xD;
      develop over time. This study will characterize the recovery process, epidemiology, and&#xD;
      natural history of post-acute sequelae. This includes the clinical spectrum of recover and&#xD;
      subsets of patients who have symptoms outside the standard course. Factors studied will&#xD;
      include the individual, clinical context, severity of disease, duration of symptoms and the&#xD;
      impact of treatment for acute SARS-CoV-2. This study will include a breadth of severity from&#xD;
      those treated as outpatients, those requiring hospitalization, and those requiring critical&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key personnel will extract data recorded in the electronic health record (EHR) as part of&#xD;
      routine clinical care in the evaluation in treatment of COVID-19 and its sequelae. Data such&#xD;
      as incidence, prevalence, demographics, comorbidities, duration of illness, severity, level&#xD;
      of medical care, measures of organ function, drug treatments, laboratory values, pulmonary&#xD;
      function tests, computed tomography images, and other data from clinical care will be&#xD;
      retrospectively entered into electronic data capture (REDCap).&#xD;
