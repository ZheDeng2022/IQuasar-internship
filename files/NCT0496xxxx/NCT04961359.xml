      Popular topic: Phase I clinical trial of recombinant new coronavirus vaccine (CHO cell) (3~17&#xD;
      years old) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product name: Recombinant new coronavirus vaccine (CHO cell),Each dose contains 25μgNCP-RBD&#xD;
      protein/0.5mL/bottle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indications: Prevention of respiratory diseases caused by new coronavirus infection .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research population: healthy people aged 3 to 17 . Research Unit: Hunan Provincial Center for&#xD;
      Disease Control and Prevention. Research purpose:Main purpose:To evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of recombinant New Coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells) in healthy people aged 3 to&#xD;
      17. Secondary purpose: To explore the immunogenicity and persistence of recombinant New&#xD;
      Coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells) in healthy people aged 3 to 17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall design:A single center, randomized, blind, placebo-controlled trial design was&#xD;
      adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunization program: 0, 1, and 2 months. Dose:25μg/0.5mL/bottle. Study population: 75&#xD;
      healthy people aged 3 to 17 years old, both male and female.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test groups: 3 to 5 years old: 20 cases in experimental group and 5 cases in placebo group; 6&#xD;
      to 11 years old: 20 patients in the experimental group and 5 patients in the placebo group;&#xD;
      12 to 17 years old: 20 patients in experimental group and 5 patients in placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research plan and implementation:According to the age from big to small, it was divided into&#xD;
      three stages: 12 to 17 years old, 6 to 11 years old, 3 to 5 years old. The subjects of each&#xD;
      age group were randomly divided into the experimental vaccine group and the placebo control&#xD;
      group, 20 in the experimental vaccine group and 5 in the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first stage, the subjects aged 12 to 17 years old were randomly divided into the&#xD;
      experimental vaccine group (20 cases) and the placebo group (5 cases); The safety data of 0-7&#xD;
      days after the first dose were evaluated by the researchers. If the suspension / termination&#xD;
      criteria were not met, the second phase of the study was carried out, and the subjects aged&#xD;
      6-11 years old in the trial vaccine group (20 cases) and placebo group (5 cases) were&#xD;
      randomly enrolled; The safety data of subjects aged 6 to 17 years old from 0 to 7 days after&#xD;
      the second dose of vaccine were evaluated by the researchers. If the suspension / termination&#xD;
      criteria were not met, the third phase study was carried out, and the subjects aged 3 to 5&#xD;
      years old in the trial vaccine group (20 cases) and placebo group (5 cases) were randomly&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects were followed up for 30 days after each dose. If the suspension / termination&#xD;
      criteria were met, DSMB would decide whether to vaccinate the next dose; In other cases, it&#xD;
      was up to the researchers to decide whether or not to receive the follow-up dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. The incidence of all AEs within 1 month after the first dose to the full course of&#xD;
      vaccination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Total AE incidence;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The incidence of AEs related to research vaccines;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The incidence of grade 3 and above AE;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The incidence of grade 3 and above AEs related to research vaccines;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The incidence of AEs leading to withdrawal;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The incidence of AEs related to research vaccines leading to withdrawal; 2. The&#xD;
           incidence of all serious adverse events (SAE) and the incidence of SAE related to the&#xD;
           vaccine within 12 months after the first dose to the full course of vaccination; 3.&#xD;
           Changes in the clinical significance of the laboratory test indicators after first and&#xD;
           second dose of inoculation compared to before the first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunogenicity endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Humoral immunity: before the first dose of vaccination, 1 month,3 month and 6 months after&#xD;
      the full vaccination, neutralizing antibodies of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), S protein&#xD;
      binding antibody (IgG), RBD protein binding antibody (IgG) ) Positive rate; The levels of&#xD;
      neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, S protein binding antibody (IgG) and RBD protein&#xD;
      binding antibody (IgG) and their relative immunity 1 month , 3 month and 6 months after the&#xD;
      full vaccination of all subjects increase the multiple before.&#xD;
