    <textblock>
      IPF is a progressive scarring lung condition causing coughing and breathlessness. IPF&#xD;
      patients often have reflux disease meaning stomach acid may be breathed into the lungs,&#xD;
      potentially damaging them. Medicines which stop stomach acid production, proton pump&#xD;
      inhibitors (PPIs), can be used to reduce reflux symptoms including heartburn. Some&#xD;
      researchers suggest PPIs also reduce IPF progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research aims to see if IPF progresses slower if treated with PPIs. Based on the&#xD;
      results, we will be able to recommend whether or not IPF patients should take PPIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will involve 298 IPF patients from approximately 37 UK hospitals. At the beginning&#xD;
      of the study, we will ask patients to start performing weekly breathing tests at home using&#xD;
      equipment provided, and ask those with a cough to use a device to count the number of times&#xD;
      they cough in 24hours. We will ask them to answer two questions rating their coughing and&#xD;
      breathlessness, and complete questionnaires on their coughing, IPF, sleep habits and general&#xD;
      condition. People will be given a PPI, called lansoprazole, or dummy tablets, twice per day&#xD;
      for 12 months. They will be given a leaflet telling them what to do about reflux symptoms. At&#xD;
      the end of the study, we will repeat these tests and analyse the results. We will record any&#xD;
      side effects people may get. If people suffer side effects, they can reduce the dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People taking medicines that interact with PPIs or have other serious medical conditions&#xD;
      won't be able to participate. People receiving PPIs will only be able to participate if they&#xD;
      can stop taking their medication without their heartburn returning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and usually fatal lung disease with a&#xD;
      poor prognosis. IPF patients frequently have other medical conditions as well, with reflux&#xD;
      disease being one of the most common. Previous studies and a review of data already collected&#xD;
      suggest that treatments used to reduce reflux disease symptoms, proton pump inhibitors&#xD;
      (PPIs), may reduce IPF disease progression and improve survival rates. Current IPF treatment&#xD;
      guidelines cautiously advise PPI treatment for IPF patients, however there hasn't been a&#xD;
      study which investigates this specifically yet even though doctors and government groups have&#xD;
      said one is needed. There are thought to be links between cough, reflux, sleep and IPF. As a&#xD;
      result we will be asking a sub-group of patients to complete two 24 hour sessions of cough&#xD;
      frequency monitoring as a sub-study. Some of these participants may be asked to wear a&#xD;
      wrist-based activity and sleep monitor during these periods also. In addition, we will ask&#xD;
      patients to complete two questionnaires on their sleeping habits to further investigate this&#xD;
      link. At the end of the trial, we will able to recommend whether or not IPF patients should&#xD;
      take PPIs routinely or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is a clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product (drug). The drug is&#xD;
      well established and approved for use for another medical condition. The drug will be&#xD;
      assessed against placebo (dummy) tablets, with patients allocated to either group by chance.&#xD;
      Patients on the drug and dummy tablets will be assessed at the same time. Neither patients&#xD;
      nor their doctors or the research team will know which treatment they have been allocated to.&#xD;
      We will be running the study at approximately 37 hospitals across the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study visits may take place remotely without the participant needing to attend the&#xD;
      hospital. However, face-to-face onsite visits are also permitted if preferred/feasible. All&#xD;
      participants will receive central training via video call, with a trained clinical&#xD;
      physiologist, following consent on how to complete domiciliary spirometry assessments.&#xD;
      Further training will be provided during follow-up if deemed required following a review of&#xD;
      the data. Questionnaires will be completed either electronically or by post.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potentially eligible patients will be approached remotely or in clinic after being identified&#xD;
      from local patient lists/databases. They will be given/sent the relevant study literature to&#xD;
      consider participation in the study and will be followed-up by a member of the local research&#xD;
      team after they have had at least 24hours to consider participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interested patients will be invited to a virtual or face-to-face screening appointment where&#xD;
      they will be counselled on the study and what it entails in order to provide informed consent&#xD;
      to participate. The patient will then be asked to complete baseline questionnaires, provide&#xD;
      demographic, medical history and concomitant medication, and any other relevant study&#xD;
      information, complete spirometry assessments over 5 days at home using a domiciliary&#xD;
      spirometer and provide a blood sample for safety in order for the investigator to confirm&#xD;
      their eligibility for the trial. Patients may also provide a blood sample for analysis in&#xD;
      future research if the visit takes place at the recruiting site. In addition, eligible&#xD;
      participants may complete a 24hour period of cough frequency monitoring, and activity and&#xD;
      sleep monitoring if applicable, if they have consented to do so. Patients in receipt of PPIs&#xD;
      without a clear clinical indication for them at consent, will undergo a two week wash-out&#xD;
      period (following agreement from the patient and their GP) to ascertain whether it is safe to&#xD;
      stop this treatment and monitor whether their symptoms subside. Patients who remain&#xD;
      asymptomatic at the end of this period will proceed to enter the study. For those whose&#xD;
      symptoms return, PPI treatment will recommence and they will not enter the study. Once the&#xD;
      results of all baseline assessments are known, patients will be randomised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive an initial 6 month supply of trial medication and be instructed to&#xD;
      take 2 tablets twice daily (approximately 12 hours apart), 30 minutes before meals, for 12&#xD;
      months. Participants will commence weekly domiciliary spirometry assessments, for 12 months,&#xD;
      from this point onwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3 months post-randomisation, participants will complete the relevant questionnaires and&#xD;
      provide blood samples for safety checks. Domiciliary spirometry assessments remain ongoing.&#xD;
      Participants involved in the sub-study will again undergo cough frequency monitoring, and&#xD;
      activity and sleep monitoring if applicable, for a final 24 hour period. Patients will be&#xD;
      asked to report any changes in their medical history, medication and any events which they&#xD;
      have experienced since their last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted again at 6 months post-randomisation where they we will&#xD;
      complete questionnaires and provide a safety blood samples. Domiciliary spirometry&#xD;
      assessments remain ongoing. Participants will again be asked to report any changes in their&#xD;
      medical history, medication and any events which they have experienced since their last&#xD;
      visit. Participant adherence to the trial medication will be checked. A final supply of trial&#xD;
      medication will be dispensed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 9 months post-randomisation, local site staff will contact patients to record any changes&#xD;
      in their medical history, medication and any events experienced since their last visit.&#xD;
      Patients will be required to complete the required questionnaires and provide a blood sample&#xD;
      for safety checks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final study assessments will be at 12 months post-randomisation. Patients will be&#xD;
      required to complete all necessary questionnaires, provide a blood sample for safety analysis&#xD;
      and a final set of domiciliary spirometry assessments will occur over a 5 day consecutive&#xD;
      period. If participants have consented to do so, an additional blood sample will be taken for&#xD;
      analysis in future research studies if the visit occurs on site. Patients will be required to&#xD;
      report any changes in their medical history, medication and any events they have experienced&#xD;
      since their last report to site staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants are suspected of or confirmed to have experienced any of the following they&#xD;
      may reduce the dose of their trial treatment, at any point during the study, to 1 tablet,&#xD;
      twice daily (approximately 12 hours apart), 30 minutes before meals: infection including&#xD;
      pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection and/or hypomagnesaemia. Participants may also&#xD;
      reduce dose if the participant or clinician wishes them to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample for genotype analysis may be taken at any study timepoint which occurs&#xD;
      face-to-face, if the participants consents to provide one. Safety blood samples will be taken&#xD;
      at the participant's GP surgery where visits take place remotely. Remote follow-up may take&#xD;
      place via video or phone call.&#xD;

             defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high FSH&#xD;
             level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in&#xD;
             women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However in the&#xD;
             absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Receipt of another investigational drug or biological agent associated with another&#xD;
             clinical trial within the 4 weeks prior to TIPAL study enrolment or 5 times the drug&#xD;
             half-life, whichever is the longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Receiving long-term oxygen therapy.&#xD;
