  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies the effects of occupational therapy fatigue management in&#xD;
      patients with renal cell cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic).&#xD;
      Many patients diagnosed with cancer experience cancer-related fatigue. These patients that&#xD;
      are also on immunotherapy can experience added distressing fatigue that impacts their daily&#xD;
      lives. Occupational therapy uses a client-centered and holistic approach to work&#xD;
      collaboratively with patients to assess fatigue and develop strategies to manage each&#xD;
      individual's specific needs. Fatigue-based management is a fundamental component of&#xD;
      occupational therapy rehabilitation regimens. This trial may help patients address and reduce&#xD;
      their fatigue.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if an occupational therapy (OT)-based intervention can reduce cancer-related&#xD;
      fatigue by 10 percent as measured by the brief fatigue inventory (BFI) tool, in patients&#xD;
      undergoing immunotherapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if an OT-based intervention can improve pain ratings. II. To determine if an&#xD;
      OT-based intervention can improve indices of depression. III. To determine if an OT-based&#xD;
      intervention can improve indices of anxiety. IV. To determine if an OT-based intervention can&#xD;
      maintain a reduced level of fatigue beyond the period of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participate in OT sessions weekly for 3 weeks over 30 minutes each. Patients also&#xD;
      complete questionnaires to assess anxiety, depression, fatigue and pain at baseline, 5 and 12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Pain ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 5 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pairwise differences of score will be calculated for the PAIN assessment tools per patient, between baseline and the follow-up time points of 5 and 12 weeks. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the change in pain score, (from baseline to 5- and 12- weeks). Plots will be utilized to help visualize the changes in scores over time. The scale for the PAIN tool ranges 0-10, with the higher scores indicating worse outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 5 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pairwise differences of score will be calculated for the Depression assessment tool per patient, between baseline and the follow-up time points of 5 and 12 weeks. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the change in the PROMIS Depression score, (from baseline to 5- and 12- weeks). Plots will be utilized to help visualize the changes in Depression scores over time. Total score for the PROMIS Depression tool ranges from 8 to 40, with higher scores indicating worse outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 5 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pairwise differences of score will be calculated for the PROMIS Anxiety tool per patient, between baseline and the follow-up time points of 5 and 12 weeks. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the change in the anxiety score, indices of anxiety and depression, and fatigue score (from baseline to 5- and 12- weeks). Plots will be utilized to help visualize the changes in anxiety scores over time. The total possible score for the PROMIS for the PROMIS for the PROMIS Anxiety tool ranges from 7 to 35, with higher scores indicating worse outcomes.</description>
