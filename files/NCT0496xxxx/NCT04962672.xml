  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. It is estimated that approximately 55,000&#xD;
      Canadians are surviving with brain tumors. It is projected that around 3000 persons will be&#xD;
      diagnosed with brain and spinal cord tumors, and approximately 75 percent patients will not&#xD;
      survive. Out of all brain cancers, high-grade gliomas [Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)] impose&#xD;
      highest morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is important to explore ways in which&#xD;
      Investigators can improve and prolong the lives of patients suffering from brain cancers,&#xD;
      particularly high-grade glioma, which is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far the Investigators know that the surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are the three&#xD;
      corner stones management options for these patients, and majority of the research have been&#xD;
      conducted on these three major domains. Therefore, it is imperative to explore the other&#xD;
      variables those may impact survival characteristics. One of the integral variables of the&#xD;
      brain cancer surgery is anesthesia. Interestingly, the role of anesthetics was explored in&#xD;
      some other non-brain solid organ tumor surgeries. It is observed that out of the two main&#xD;
      types of anesthesia [one is through intravenous (propofol) and other one is gaseous&#xD;
      (sevoflurane)], intravenous based anesthesia maintenance regime may delay the cancer&#xD;
      progression and prolong the recurrence free period. In addition, two very large retrospective&#xD;
      studies with approximately 11,000 and 18,000 patients respectively, showed that as compared&#xD;
      to gaseous (volatile anesthetics) based, intravenous (propofol) based anesthesia conferred&#xD;
      some protection against cancer progression and was also associated with lesser overall&#xD;
      mortality. The exact nature of these protective mechanisms is not known but in animal and&#xD;
      other laboratory-based experiments, propofol seems to inhibit cancer formation steps, delays&#xD;
      inflammation and provide protection from cancer cell growth. This is a feasibility study for&#xD;
      knowing various aspects of workflow; recruitment characteristics of participants and various&#xD;
      obstacles in implying anesthesia based protocols so that the Investigators can conduct a&#xD;
      well-designed multicenter international randomized study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Canada, cancer is the most common cause of death. Among solid organ cancers, brain tumors,&#xD;
      depending upon type and grading, impose significant morbidity and mortality. In addition,&#xD;
      cancer progression and recurrence is one of the most common complications in management of&#xD;
      high-grade gliomas and among all, Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the most common and&#xD;
      aggressive primary brain cancer. Many factors have been demonstrated to affect glioma&#xD;
      progression . Some of the most consistently sited variables are age, grade of tumor, tumor&#xD;
      size and location, molecular diagnosis, extent of resection, and chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, though, anesthesia remains an integral part of glioma surgeries, and two&#xD;
      types of anesthetics (total intravenous agent, such as, propofol and volatile, such as&#xD;
      sevoflurane) are commonly used during maintenance phase of general anesthesia (GA) across&#xD;
      over all world; their effects on brain cancer progression are not yet investigated&#xD;
      extensively. Recent studies have highlighted that there could be an association of anesthesia&#xD;
      with cancer progression in other solid organs. Very few researches have been published&#xD;
      demonstrating the relationship between type of anesthetic and glioma progression. One study&#xD;
      found that exposure of glioblastoma stem cells to volatile agent (isoflurane) increased their&#xD;
      migration capacity in vitro and increased their migration distance in vivo in animals. A&#xD;
      second study found that exposure of glioma stem cells to sevoflurane increased tumor cell&#xD;
      proliferation as well as tumor markers, most notably hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF), which&#xD;
      are associated with cancer growth. Finally, a retrospective cohort study published in 2019&#xD;
      compared the progression free survival (PFS) of patients who underwent high-grade glioma&#xD;
      surgery using two different types of anesthetics. They found that, for patients with low KPS,&#xD;
      anesthesia maintenance with propofol yielded a longer PFS compared to sevoflurane (15). With&#xD;
      this background, it seems propofol based anesthesia may limit the progression of brain cancer&#xD;
      progression and therefore, the purpose is to evaluate type of anesthetics (propofol versus&#xD;
      sevoflurane) as a factor responsible for glioma progression and survival characteristics. As&#xD;
      the Investigators are planning for a future phase III study, it is imperative to understand&#xD;
      thoroughly the details regarding feasibility, workflow, enrollment and drop out&#xD;
      characteristics, reasons of deviation and adherence rates to anesthesia protocols and&#xD;
      problems in follow ups. Therefore, this feasibility study is a path to a well-designed larger&#xD;
      multicenter randomized study.&#xD;
