  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, global, multi-center, open-label, multiple-dose, first-in-human study of&#xD;
      MIL97 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, biomarkers and efficacy in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumor. The study consists of a dose escalation&#xD;
      phase and a dose expansion phase. An accelerated titration design (cohorts 1-2 only) followed&#xD;
      by 3+3 dose-escalation design will be used in dose escalation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The starting dose for dose escalation phase is 0.01 mg/kg Q3W, followed by 5 dose cohorts&#xD;
      (0.03mg/kg Q3W, 0.1mg/kg Q3W, 0.2mg/kg Q3W, 0.3mg/kg Q3W and 0.45mg/kg Q3W). Duration of dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicity (DLT) observation is 21 days. Based on data of 3-week treatment regimen,&#xD;
      one or two dose levels may be chosen for Q2w regimen. Duration of dose limiting toxicity&#xD;
      (DLT) observation is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One or two dose cohorts will be chosen (either 2-week regimen or 3-week regimen cohorts) to&#xD;
      expand to total of 10 subjects in each cohort for further exploration of PK as well as safety&#xD;
      and efficacy.&#xD;
