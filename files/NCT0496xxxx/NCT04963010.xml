      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopy can reduce the incidence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer, and the&#xD;
      reduction in distal colon cancer is more pronounced than proximal colon cancer. Compared with&#xD;
      CRC found on screening, interphase CRC is more likely to occur in the proximal colon above&#xD;
      the splenic flexure. Adenoma detection rate (ADR) is an important quality indicator of&#xD;
      colonoscopy. Compared with ADR&gt;20%，the incidence of interphase CRC is 10 times higher for&#xD;
      endoscopists with ADR&lt;20%. For every 1% increase in ADR, the risk of interphase CRC can be&#xD;
      reduced by 3%, and fatal interphase CRC can be reduced by 5%. It is reported in the&#xD;
      literature that the second forward view examination of the right colon (cecum, ascending&#xD;
      colon, liver flexure) can significantly improve the right colon ADR, however, there is no&#xD;
      report on the impact of second forward view examination of the proximal colon ADR (cecum,&#xD;
      ascending colon, liver flexure, and transverse colon).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the impact of second forward view examination of the proximal colon on adenoma&#xD;
      detection rate Inclusion criteria： Patients ≥18 years of age undergoing screening, follow-up&#xD;
      monitoring, and diagnostic colonoscopy Exclusion criteria：&#xD;
&#xD;
      ①Cecal intubation failed. ②Have a history of colorectal surgery. ③Insufficient bowel&#xD;
      preparation, Boston Bowel Preparation Score (BBPS) &lt;6 points. ④Inflammatory bowel disease or&#xD;
      intestinal tuberculosis. ⑤Familial polyp syndrome. ⑥Recovery of polyp specimens failed, and&#xD;
      no histopathological data. ⑦Patients with coagulation dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients ≥ 18 years of age who came to our hospital's Digestive Endoscopy Center for&#xD;
      screening, follow-up monitoring and diagnosis of colonoscopy. After successfully insert the&#xD;
      cecum, colonoscope withdrawal to the splenic flexure, all polyps found during the withdrawal&#xD;
      process were resection,then they were randomized to standard withdrawal colonoscopy or second&#xD;
      forward view according to the random number table (1:1) to perform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      proximal colon adenoma detection rate：proportion of patients with proximal colon adenoma&#xD;
      found in all colonoscopy patients Secondary Outcome total adenoma detection rate：proportion&#xD;
      of patients with colonic adenoma found in all colonoscopy patients Cecal insertion time: the&#xD;
      time elapsed from introducing the colonoscope into the anus until intubation of the cecum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      proximal colon withdrawal time: observation time of proximal colon total withdrawal time:the&#xD;
      time measured from when the colonoscope reaches the cecum to the time the scope is withdrawn&#xD;
      from the anus in the absence of polyp removal BBPS：Boston bowel preparation score&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design Patients ≥ 18 years of age who came to our hospital's Digestive Endoscopy&#xD;
      Center for screening, follow-up monitoring and diagnosis of colonoscopy. After successfully&#xD;
      insert the cecum, colonoscope withdrawal to the splenic flexure, all polyps found during the&#xD;
      withdrawal process were resection,then they were randomized to standard withdrawal&#xD;
      colonoscopy or second forward view according to the random number table (1:1) to perform.&#xD;
      Patients in the second forward view (SFV) group were inserted into the cecum again ,&#xD;
      colonoscope withdrawal to the splenic flexure, and the newly discovered polyps in the second&#xD;
      forward view were also resection. Patients in the standard withdrawal colonoscopy withdraw&#xD;
      the scope from the splenic flexure until exiting the anus,observe, if polyps are found,&#xD;
      undergo endoscopic resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assistant is responsible for recording the time.Cecal insertion time refers to the time&#xD;
      elapsed from introducing the colonoscope into the anus until intubation of the cecum.&#xD;
      Proximal colon withdrawal time refers to the observation time of proximal colon. And the&#xD;
      total withdrawal time refers to the time measured from when the colonoscope reaches the cecum&#xD;
      to the time the scope is withdrawn from the anus in the absence of polyp removal. Record&#xD;
      BBPS, the number, location, size, Paris type and postoperative pathology of polyps.&#xD;
