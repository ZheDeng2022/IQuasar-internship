  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 12-month prospective cohort study is to evaluate post-operatory pain,&#xD;
      patient satisfaction, and treatment outcomes (i.e., healing) when the newly-developed, 510k&#xD;
      FDA-approved multisonic energy GentleWAve System (Sonendo, Inc., Laguna Hills, CA) is used in&#xD;
      complex root canal procedures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Apical Periodontitis (AP) is a disease where multiple types of bacteria, including those that&#xD;
      can live without oxygen, create a bacterial film on the tissues around teeth. These bacteria&#xD;
      colonize the dying pulp tissue, invade channels within teeth and other openings, and create&#xD;
      an inflammatory response of the tissues surrounding the teeth. Therefore, the primary goal of&#xD;
      endodontic treatment is to reduce bacteria numbers by removing remaining tissues, bacterial&#xD;
      films, and infected dentine (i.e., layer of tooth below the enamel). Healing of apical&#xD;
      periodontitis (AP) is expected, in the majority of cases, if proper bacterial disinfection is&#xD;
      accomplished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elimination of these bacteria can be achieved by a combined action of several treatments.&#xD;
      Lately, irrigation and mechanical instrumentation techniques have been developed with this&#xD;
      intention. Some new technologies are based on the concept of using minimally-invasive&#xD;
      instruments with hydrodynamic cavitation generating a broad spectrum of sound waves within&#xD;
      the degassed fluid inside of the tooth. However, there is not enough evidence in the&#xD;
      literature to support its efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that the GentleWave (GW) hydrodynamic cavitation system&#xD;
      (Sonendo, Inc., Laguna Hills, CA) will achieve a high success rate in treating and healing&#xD;
      apical periodontitis (AP), a disease where a bacterial film is formed on the tissues around&#xD;
      the teeth.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline of Cone Beam Computed Tomography Periapical Index (CBCTPAI) across 1 year</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 6-months; 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed by the evaluator measuring the estimated tooth on the CBCT and assigning an index score on the CBCT. A score of 0 denotes an intact periapical bone structure. A score of 1 denotes a diameter of periapical radiolucency &gt;0.5-1mm. A score of 2 denotes a diameter of periapical radiolucency &gt;1-2mm. A score of 3 denotes a diameter of periapical radiolucency &gt;2-4mm. A score of 4 denotes a diameter of periapical radiolucency &gt;4-8mm. A score of 5 denotes a diameter of periapical radiolucency &gt;8mm. A score of 6 denotes (n) + E = expansion of periapical cortical bone. A score of 7 denotes (n) + D = destruction of periapical cortical bone.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline of peripical index (PAI) across 1 year.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 6-months post-baseline; 12 months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed by asking the evaluator to evaluate the PAI score at each X-ray. A value of 1 denotes normal periapical structures. A value of 2 denotes small changes in the bone structure. A value of 3 denotes changes in bone structure with some mineral loss. A value of 4 denotes apical periodontitis with well-defined radiolucent areas. A value of 5 denotes severe apical periodontitis with exacerbating features.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline of modified wound healing scale (Mod-CWHS) across 1 year</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-baseline; 12 months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed by the evaluator evaluating the research subject's healing status on a scale of 1-3. A value of 1 is &quot;Uneventful wound healing with no gingival edema, erythema, suppuration, discomfort or barrier exposure. A value of 2 is &quot;Uneventful wound healing with slight gingival edema, erythema, or discomfort but no suppuration. 3 is a value of poor wound healing with significant gingival edema, erythema, discomfort, loss of barrier or any suppuration.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline of pain severity in 0-10 pain severity scale across 1 year</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 2 days post-baseline; 1 weeks post-baseline; 2 weeks post-baseline; 6 months post-baseline; 12-months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed by asking the research subject their current level of pain on a 0-10 scale, and the patient will circle one line.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Day 2 of research subject's thoughts on treatment result across 1 year.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days post-baseline; 1-week post-baseline; 2-weeks post-baseline; 6-months post-baseline; 12 months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed by asking the research subject to assess their own treatment result on a scale of 0 to 10 and circling one line.</description>
