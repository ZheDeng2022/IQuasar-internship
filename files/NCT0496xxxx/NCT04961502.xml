      The main objective of this study is to describe the humoral and cellular response to BNT162b2&#xD;
      vaccination in people over age 75 institutionalized in the long-term care units of the Paris&#xD;
      Public Hospitals (APHP)&#xD;

      This is an interventional study with minimal risk and constraints, multicenter with&#xD;
      biological collection. Two populations are studied: patients and members of care staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For patients and staff: age, gender, existence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)&#xD;
           infection and whether or not it is symptomatic and date of first positive RT-PCR test,&#xD;
           medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For patients: nutritional status (loss of appetite, weight loss, body mass index,&#xD;
           albuminemia)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccination antibodies are measured using 3 blood sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first carried out before the anti-Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination; the&#xD;
      second on D21 (shortly before the vaccination booster injection) and the third on D50-54.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, during the first sample, assays will be carried out informing us of your&#xD;
      nutritional and inflammatory status.&#xD;
