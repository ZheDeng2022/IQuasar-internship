  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combined measurement of the pulmonary diffusing capacity to carbon monoxide (CO) and&#xD;
      nitric oxide (NO) (DLCO/NO) has recently been standardised and validated for clinical use. It&#xD;
      involves a very short breath-hold time (â‰¤5 seconds), and it may be repeated up to 12 times&#xD;
      without affecting measurements, and it is thus ideal for assessing acute changes in pulmonary&#xD;
      diffusing capacity and its components during various physiological manoeuvres. The aim of the&#xD;
      present study is to compare the test-retest reliability of pulmonary diffusing capacity&#xD;
      measurements during postural changes (sitting vs. supine) vs. rest-to-exercise. DLCO/NO will&#xD;
      either be measured in the sitting position during rest vs. exercise or in the sitting and&#xD;
      supine posture, and this will be repeated within 1-7 days in 20 healthy individuals that will&#xD;
      be randomised to one of the two interventions. Statistically,the test-retest relaibility of&#xD;
      sitting-to-supine vs. rest-to-exercise changes in DLCO/NO will be compared by parametric&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
