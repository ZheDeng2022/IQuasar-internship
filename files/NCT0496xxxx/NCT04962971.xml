  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary discomfort includes a set of signs such as an urgent need to urinate, high frequency&#xD;
      of urination per day, discomfort / difficulty or burning sensation when urinating, smelly&#xD;
      urine. This urinary discomfort represents in women 2 to 5% of the reasons for consultation&#xD;
      (Berg, 1991) and can have various etiologies but the bacterial origin is the most frequent.&#xD;
      Cranberries are traditionally used for urinary comfort and the prevention of urinary&#xD;
      disorders with bacterial origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objective is to collect in real life efficacy and tolerance data from the&#xD;
      consumption of 3 cranberry extracts in order to highlight the qualitative and quantitative&#xD;
      characteristics of these extracts which are directly involved in the improvement of urinary&#xD;
      discomfort or situation of recurrent cystitis symptomatic episodes in women.&#xD;
