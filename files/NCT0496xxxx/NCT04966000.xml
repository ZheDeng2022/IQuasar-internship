  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary data will be collected about which individuals with spatial neglect from right&#xD;
      hemisphere stroke (aiming vs perceptual neglect) improve with Prism Adaptation Training and&#xD;
      if there is a particular pattern of damage in the brain that predicts both the type of&#xD;
      neglect experienced and whether neglect is improved following Prism Adaptation Training&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For preliminary data, twelve individuals with right hemisphere stroke and spatial neglect&#xD;
      will participate. After pretesting for type of neglect and its severity, they will have an&#xD;
      MRI with Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). Then they will complete 10 sessions of Prism&#xD;
      Adaptation Therapy and complete neglect post-testing. Response to Prism Adaptation Therapy&#xD;
      will be assessed by comparing neglect scores pre- and post-training. Traditional lesion&#xD;
      mapping, structural and functional lesion disconnectivity analyses, and tract-based spatial&#xD;
      statistics of DTI measures will be used to examine whether any patterns of damage/dysfunction&#xD;
      are related to a diagnosis of aiming neglect and response to Prism Adaptation Therapy.&#xD;

    <description>Participants wear goggles with built-in prisms (a 20-diopter lens) that shift the visual scene to the right. While wearing the googles they reach to and cross out 60 lines/circles, requiring them to learn to reach more leftward than the visual targets appear. Participants can only see the end of their movements.</description>
