  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to generate pilot data for a grant proposal to evaluate the impact&#xD;
      of intermittent cold exposure (ICE) on brown and white adipose tissue (BAT/WAT) function in&#xD;
      children with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The condition NAFLD is the most&#xD;
      common liver disease in both adults and children. There are many emerging drug therapies for&#xD;
      NAFLD but at considerable cost in terms of potential side effects. In a mouse model of&#xD;
      diet-induced obesity, ICE was shown to help activate BAT, which may help NAFLD and other&#xD;
      obesity associated health risks. Given that children have more BAT than adults, we&#xD;
      hypothesise that intermittent cold exposure via a cooling vest in children with NAFLD will&#xD;
      increase BAT stores or function. We will investigate whether intermittent cold exposure via a&#xD;
      cooling vest device will stimulate BAT and also establish whether the cooling vest is&#xD;
      acceptable to children and young people. If it is acceptable and has an impact on BAT&#xD;
      function this could be a new treatment to reduce the severity of metabolic disorders&#xD;
      associated with obesity, particularly fatty liver, e.g. hepatic steatosis. In stage 1, we&#xD;
      will investigate the impact of intermittent cold exposure (ICE) on brown and white adipose&#xD;
      tissue (BAT/WAT) function in young people aged 16 to 26 years old, as a feasibility study to&#xD;
      optimise the cooling process. In stage 2, we will investigate the impact of ICE on BAT and&#xD;
      WAT function in 8-16 year olds with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and matched&#xD;
      controls. Participants will have thermal imaging, MRI scans and provide samples before and&#xD;
      after wearing the cooling vest.&#xD;

      ICE BAT is a single centre pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In stage 1, 12 young people aged 16-26 will be recruited into the study. Participants will&#xD;
      use a cooling garment (for 1-2 hours). MRI scans and thermal imaging will be performed before&#xD;
      and after ICE to evaluate BAT size and activation. Liver steatosis will be evaluated using&#xD;
      MRI Proton Dense Fat Fraction (PDFF). Serum markers of BAT activation and glucose/lipid&#xD;
      metabolism will be measured before and after ICE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In stage 2,12 children with NAFLD and 12 age- and sex-matched controls will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the study. In stage 2a, healthy controls will use a cooling garment (for 1-2 hours) and&#xD;
      undergo MRI scan and thermal imaging before and after ICE to evaluate BAT size and&#xD;
      activation. Liver steatosis will be evaluated using MRI PDFF. In stage 2b the NAFLD patients&#xD;
      will be asked to attend for one day and if they are happy to continue, will use a cooling&#xD;
      garment (for 1-2 hours/day for a further 4 days). MRI scans and thermal imaging will be&#xD;
      performed before and after ICE on day 1 and day 5 to evaluate BAT size and activation. Liver&#xD;
      steatosis will be evaluated using MRI PDFF. Serum markers of BAT activation and glucose/lipid&#xD;
      metabolism will be measured on day 1 and day 5. Participants with NAFLD, will be asked to&#xD;
      give a faecal sample for analysis of their gut microbiome before the study and after day 5 of&#xD;
      ICE treatment.&#xD;
