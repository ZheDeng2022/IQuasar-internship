  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to provide evidence as to whether consumption of tart cherry juice can reduce&#xD;
      the risk of gout and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in an acute context. The proposed study is&#xD;
      a 2-way cross-over, randomised, placebo-controlled trial and aims to answer the following&#xD;
      research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What effect does a single 30mL serving of tart cherry concentrate have on serum uric&#xD;
           acid and urinary excretion of uric acid in healthy individuals, when compared with&#xD;
           water?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What effect does a single 30mL serving of tart cherry concentrate have on markers of&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease risk and oxidative stress in healthy individuals, when compared&#xD;
           with water?&#xD;
&#xD;
      By measuring acute changes in serum urate, fractional urinary urate excretion, inflammatory&#xD;
      markers, oxidative stress markers and CVD risk markers (namely central and brachial blood&#xD;
      pressure, and arterial stiffness), it will highlight possible mechanisms through which tart&#xD;
      cherry may reduce risk of gout and/or CVD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Healthy, non-smoking, adult volunteers (n = 15) will be recruited to a 2-way cross-over,&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 13 has been calculated using data from White et al. (2018), using the&#xD;
      primary outcome of change in serum uric acid level. Between-person variations in serum urate&#xD;
      was established at approximately 50 µmol/L. Within-subject variation to apple juice was&#xD;
      approximately 35 µmol/L. It has been estimated that cherry juice will produce a fall in serum&#xD;
      urate of approximately 15 µmol/L (Jacob et al., 2003). Therefore, 13 participants will be&#xD;
      needed to detect this change with 80% power at an alpha level of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will avoid strenuous exercise for 72-hours prior to the study until 24-hours&#xD;
      post-consumption of the test drinks; compliance will be assessed through completion of a&#xD;
      physical activity diary. They will also follow a low-polyphenolic diet for 48-hours prior to&#xD;
      the study until 24-hours post-consumption of the test drinks; participants will be provided&#xD;
      with a list of foods/drinks to avoid and compliance will be assessed through completion of a&#xD;
      food diary. Participants will be provided with instructions of foods to avoid and a low&#xD;
      polyphenolic pasta ready-meal, dessert and low nitrate water to consume the evening preceding&#xD;
      the study day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend the laboratory following an overnight fast. Blood pressure (central&#xD;
      and brachial) and arterial stiffness will be measured using a non-invasive Vicorder device. A&#xD;
      venepuncture blood sample will be collected by a researcher trained in phlebotomy before&#xD;
      consumption of the test drink. Approximately 10 ml of blood will be taken during each&#xD;
      venepuncture. A urine sample will also be collected. Participants will consume 250 ml of tart&#xD;
      cherry juice or neutral control (water) on two occasions, at least one week apart; the&#xD;
      sequence order will be random. The cherry juice comprises 30 mL tart cherry concentrate&#xD;
      diluted with 220 mL water. Further venous blood samples will be taken at 1 and 2 hours&#xD;
      post-consumption. These will be supplemented with finger-prick samples collected at 3, 5 and&#xD;
      24 hours post drink. Post-drink measures of arterial stiffness will be taken at 1, 2, 3, 5&#xD;
      and 24-hours post-consumption. Additional urine samples will also be collected between 0-2,&#xD;
      2-4, 4-5, 5-8, 8-11, and 11-24 hours, post-consumption of the test drinks. Participants'&#xD;
      water intake during each laboratory visit will be standardised at 500 ml. Participants will&#xD;
      be provided with a low-polyphenolic sandwich lunch, pasta ready-meal dinner, dessert, snacks&#xD;
      and low nitrate water to consume following the 5-hour measurements. Participants will return&#xD;
      to the laboratory the next morning following a 12-hour fast for their 24-hour measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be analysed for serum uric acid and creatinine concentrations at all time points&#xD;
      and for CRP (a measure of inflammation) at baseline, 2, and 5 hours, post-drink. White blood&#xD;
      cells (lymphocytes) will be separated from whole venous blood samples collected at baseline,&#xD;
      1 and 2-hours post-drink consumption for the analysis of oxidative DNA damage. Urine samples&#xD;
      will be analysed for uric acid and creatinine to calculate fractional excretion of urinary&#xD;
      uric acid (using a commercial colorimetric assay). Polyphenolic metabolites from the test&#xD;
      drink will also be analysed in urine samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: The effect of the treatment (tart cherry versus water) on all outcome&#xD;
      variables will be analysed with 2-way repeated measures ANOVAs. A statistical significance&#xD;
      level of P≤ 0.05 will be set.&#xD;
