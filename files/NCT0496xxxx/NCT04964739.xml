    <textblock>
      Adults (ages 18+) who would like to reduce their cannabis use (N=224) will be enrolled in an&#xD;
      8-week treatment program. All participants will receive counseling (1 goals session with a&#xD;
      therapist followed by 7 weekly computerized cognitive-behavioral therapy sessions). Detailed&#xD;
      cannabis assessments (biological and self-report) will be conducted throughout treatment and&#xD;
      at 1-, 2-, and 3-months post-treatment completion. Daily electronic diaries will be&#xD;
      administered via text message to record detailed logs of cannabis use quantity and frequency.&#xD;
      Salivary samples will be collected (and video observed) daily throughout treatment to analyze&#xD;
      for progesterone.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Investigators support data sharing as essential for scientific advancement. It is expected that primary outcome papers will be completed and submitted to appropriate peer-reviewed scientific journals within 180 days of data lock. Requests for data from this project by individuals outside of the research team will be reviewed by the team following data lock. Data sharing will adhere to all provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the rights and privacy of people who participate in research will be protected at all times. The requesting Investigator must specify the subset of variables needed or provide a detailed justification of why the complete dataset is absolutely necessary. Data made available to other investigators will be free of identifiers that would permit linkages to individual research participants and variables that could lead to deductive disclosure of the identity of individual subjects.</ipd_description>
