  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a significantly higher in people after&#xD;
      spinal cord injury (SCI) than in the general population. As a positive pressure therapy&#xD;
      (CPAP) is often poorly tolerated, a mandibular advancement device (MAD) can be used for the&#xD;
      treatment of OSA. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of MAD in people&#xD;
      with SCI and to verify their adherence to the therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a disorder with serious health consequences. Compared to the&#xD;
      general population, a significantly higher prevalence of OSA was found in individuals with&#xD;
      spinal cord injury (SCI). As treatment, positive pressure therapy in the respiratory tract&#xD;
      during sleep (CPAP) is commonly instituted. However, CPAP therapy is often rejected or poorly&#xD;
      tolerated by patients. Alternatively, the American Association of Sleep Medicine recommends&#xD;
      the use of Mandibular Advancement Devices (MAD). The MAD prevents the upper airway from&#xD;
      collapsing by anterior displacement of the mandible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is to determine the efficacy of MAD therapy in people with SCI and to&#xD;
      verify their adherence to the therapy. The research group will consist of 60-80 subjects. The&#xD;
      selection of suitable participants will be based on the results of a polygram. The MAD for a&#xD;
      group of subjects with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) higher than five will be fabricated&#xD;
      using their dental impressions. Subsequently, the subjects will be retested while wearing the&#xD;
      MAD and outcomes will be compared. The evaluation will include a set of questionnaires.&#xD;
      Adherence to therapy will be checked after three and six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that the results of the study will confirm the effectiveness of&#xD;
      MAD devices in the treatment of OSA in the monitored group. Most importantly, the&#xD;
      investigators intend to set a standard for a long-term system of diagnosing and addressing&#xD;
      OSA in individuals with SCI.&#xD;

    <description>The obstructive Apnea-Hypopnea Index is defined as the mean number of obstructive apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep, thus: the occurrence of 5 to 14 events per hour of sleep means presence of mild apnea, 15 to 29 moderate apnea and â‰¥ 30 severe apnea. The AHI is derived from overnight polygraphy.</description>

    <description>The Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) will measure the subjective daytime sleepiness, assesses the propensity to sleep under inappropriate circumstances. The ESS questionnaire consists of 8 questions about daytime sleepiness in various situations. The minimum scale values of 0-7 indicate no likeliness of being abnormally sleepy, the maximum scale values of 16-24 indicate excessive sleepiness.</description>

    <description>The WHOQOL-BREF will be used to measure the quality of life. This instrument is a self-administered questionnaire comprising 26 questions on the individual's perceptions of their health and well-being over the previous two weeks. Scores range from 0 to 100 with 100 indicating a higher quality of life.</description>
