  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Historically, serial testing of patients with metastatic breast cancer has included a&#xD;
      combination of physical exam, symptom evaluation, laboratory testing, and imaging.&#xD;
      Circulating tumor biomarkers are sometimes also incorporated. Frequent testing with numerous&#xD;
      diagnostics at each time point is a significant burden to patients and to healthcare systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DiviTum® TKa assay measures TK1 activity. Numerous studies have illustrated the&#xD;
      prognostic nature of plasma or serum TK1 activity level in metastatic cancer. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the incorporation of data from DiviTum® TKa measurement into&#xD;
      the treatment monitoring schema will be associated with physician desire to change the&#xD;
      near-term usage and/or timing of other routine restaging tests, including either standard&#xD;
      tumor imaging or tumor marker testing. Given the relatively low rate of disease progression&#xD;
      in this first-line population, it is expected that most of this change will be an intended&#xD;
      reduction in scheduling of routine treatment surveillance testing with increase in intervals&#xD;
      of subsequent tumor restaging imaging by at least 4 weeks. Secondarily, the consequences of&#xD;
      rescheduling of routine surveillance testing may ultimately result in an absolute reduction&#xD;
      in the number of some tests used during the time period examined.&#xD;
