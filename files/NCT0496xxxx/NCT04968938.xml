    <textblock>
      This Phase 2, Open Label study will provide supportive data on the safety and effectiveness&#xD;
      of MDMA-assisted therapy in participants with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This&#xD;
      study will be conducted at a single study site in Vancouver, BC. There will be at least 2&#xD;
      co-therapy pairs. The study will enroll up to 20 participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Preparatory Period will consist of three 90-minute non-drug Preparatory Sessions. A&#xD;
      flexible divided dose of MDMA, will be administered during the Treatment Period with&#xD;
      manualized therapy in up to two open-label Study Drug Sessions. During the Treatment Period,&#xD;
      each Study Drug Session is followed by three 90-minute Integrative Sessions of non-drug&#xD;
      therapy. The Study Drug Sessions are scheduled roughly 3 to 5 weeks apart.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious debilitating disorder that negatively&#xD;
      impacts a person's daily life. PTSD is a stress-related psychiatric condition that may occur&#xD;
      following a traumatic event such as war, disaster, sexual abuse, violence, terrorism, and&#xD;
      accidents. PTSD negatively impacts a person's daily life, resulting in relationship&#xD;
      difficulties, difficulty in finding and maintaining a job, reduced cognitive and psychosocial&#xD;
      functioning, substance abuse, high-cost healthcare use, and increased depression and suicide&#xD;
      risk. Available PTSD treatments, including medications and therapy, effectively treat only a&#xD;
      fraction of people who try them for adequate dose and duration. People with PTSD can be&#xD;
      treated with psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies. In the past decade, there has been a&#xD;
      growing amount of research into medications and other methods that may augment the&#xD;
      effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD&#xD;
&#xD;
      3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine is a drug that releases serotonin, norepinephrine and&#xD;
      dopamine in the brain and indirectly increases levels of the neurohormones oxytocin, arginine&#xD;
      vasopressin and cortisol. The combined neurobiological effects of MDMA increase compassion,&#xD;
      reduce defenses and fear of emotional injury, and enhance communication and introspection.&#xD;
      MDMA produces anxiolytic and prosocial effects, which counteract avoidance and hyperarousal&#xD;
      in the context of therapy. A combined treatment of MDMA and therapy may be especially useful&#xD;
      for treating PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 2, Open Label study will provide supportive data on the safety and effectiveness&#xD;
      of MDMA-assisted therapy in participants with PTSD. This study will be conducted at a single&#xD;
      study site in Vancouver, BC. There will be at least 2 co-therapy pairs. The study will enroll&#xD;
      up to 20 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Preparatory Period will consist of three 90-minute non-drug Preparatory Sessions. A&#xD;
      flexible divided dose of MDMA, will be administered during the Treatment Period with&#xD;
      manualized therapy in up to two open-label Study Drug Sessions. During the Treatment Period,&#xD;
      each Study Drug Session is followed by three 90-minute Integrative Sessions of non-drug&#xD;
      therapy. The Study Drug Sessions are scheduled roughly 3 to 5 weeks apart.&#xD;

    <description>20-item self-report questionnaire in which respondents indicate the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms, derived from the symptoms of PTSD per DSM-5. The gold standard for diagnosing PTSD is a structured clinical interview such as the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5). When necessary, the PCL-5 can be scored to provide a provisional PTSD diagnosis.The self-report rating scale is 0-4 for each symptom, reflecting a change from 1-5 in the DSM-IV version. Rating scale descriptors are the same: &quot;Not at all,&quot; &quot;A little bit,&quot; Moderately,&quot; &quot;Quite a bit,&quot; and &quot;Extremely.&quot;</description>
