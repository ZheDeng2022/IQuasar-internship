      The primary study objective is to assess the safety of afamelanotide while the secondary&#xD;
      objective is to assess whether the therapy affects the size of the penumbra, by increasing&#xD;
      blood flow, restoring oxygen supply to the brain, and reducing the amount of cerebral oedema&#xD;
      (fluid) which is seen as a result of the stroke. Positive findings would indicate that the&#xD;
      drug is able to support brain tissue-at-risk and provide overall neuroprotection and benefit&#xD;
      to stroke patients.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes of neurological function as measured by the National Institutional Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS).</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to Day 42.</time_frame>
    <description>The validated NIHSS records the level of impairment caused by a stroke in 11 items:&#xD;
A score equal or less than 8 represents mild AIS, a score between 9 and 15 represents moderate AIS, a score equal or above 16 represents severe AIS.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of daily activities as measured by the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS).</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to Day 42.</time_frame>
    <description>The mRS indicates the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of patients who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability. The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms (0) to death (+6).</description>

    <description>Six adult patients with clots located in the higher segments of the brain and who are ineligible for alternative treatments will be enrolled in the study and evaluated for six weeks. The study will assess patients' brain injury with computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as using recognised methods of clinical evaluation to measure changes in patients' neurological and cognitive function following treatment.</description>
