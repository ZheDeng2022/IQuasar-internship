  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls are dangerous leading to injuries, hospital admissions and even death. Fall prevention&#xD;
      is a priority but effective programs only reduce falls by 30%. Weak hip muscles may be one&#xD;
      reasons individuals experience a loss of balance. However individuals who have weak hip&#xD;
      muscles may be unable to exercise at sufficient intensities to improve their hip muscle&#xD;
      strength. The purpose of this study is to utilize a common physical therapy method,&#xD;
      neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), on the hip muscles to improve hip muscle&#xD;
      strength and improve balance. The new program focuses on using NMES during a resistance&#xD;
      training program along with exercise to improve standing balance, walking and stepping over&#xD;
      objects. This study will test the additive effect of NMES applied to the hip muscles during a&#xD;
      balance and strengthening program to improve balance and mobility, and ultimately reduce the&#xD;
      risk of falls in older Veterans at high risk for falls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Falls are a leading cause of disability in older adults. Decreased lower extremity muscle&#xD;
      mass and strength contribute to balance and mobility limitations. More recent work also&#xD;
      suggests that in addition to the traditional targets of muscle mass of the thigh and leg&#xD;
      muscles, dysfunction of the hip abductors may contribute to balance and mobility limitations&#xD;
      resulting in increased fall risk. Older adults with impaired hip abductor muscles demonstrate&#xD;
      increased amounts of intramuscular fat (IMAT) in and around the muscles, decreased hip&#xD;
      abductor strength, lower balance scores, increased gait variability (a predictor of future&#xD;
      falls), and poor stepping mechanics when recovering from a balance perturbation. Increased&#xD;
      IMAT and muscle dysfunction of the hip abductors may contribute to poor hip abductor muscle&#xD;
      recruitment and make changing these muscle during a traditional intervention difficult.&#xD;
      Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is one method to improve muscle mass, strength&#xD;
      and quality in older adults, but has not traditionally been used on the hip abductors. The&#xD;
      investigator's central hypothesis is that the addition of NMES applied to the primary hip&#xD;
      abductors during a multimodality balance intervention (MMBI) will result in greater reduction&#xD;
      in fall risk and larger improvements in muscle and mobility function than MMBI alone. The&#xD;
      investigators will test this hypothesis with the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine the 3-month effects of a multimodality balance intervention with and&#xD;
      without NMES on fall risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To examine the 3-month effects of a multimodality balance intervention with and&#xD;
      without NMES on functional outcomes including muscle function and composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To evaluate the retention of balance, muscle changes and reduced falls after a&#xD;
      multimodality balance intervention with and without NMES&#xD;
