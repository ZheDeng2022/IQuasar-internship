      The objective of the present study is to confirm in a multicentric study the utility of our&#xD;
      viability test in large cohort of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients under&#xD;
      treatment and to determine if the test could help physicians to discontinue isolation&#xD;
      measures in hospital setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) are hospitalized for diagnosis and treatment,&#xD;
      isolation measures are mandatory in order to prevent transmission. Recommendations are to&#xD;
      maintain isolation until patients are no more infectious, which is ascertained when cultures&#xD;
      of respiratory specimens become negative (culture conversion). After administration of&#xD;
      antibiotics, the average time to culture conversion is one month for patients with&#xD;
      drug-susceptible TB, but 5%-30% cases require more than two months and up to 6 months can be&#xD;
      required for multiresistant (MDR)-TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microscopic examination of bacilli in respiratory samples is mainly used as a surrogate&#xD;
      marker but because bacilli staining does not differentiate alive from dead bacilli, the&#xD;
      interpretation of positive smears is misleading. After 1-2 months of treatment, bacilli can&#xD;
      be considered dead while they are still alive and isolation measures are thus erroneously&#xD;
      discontinued. Conversely, bacilli can be considered viable while they have already been&#xD;
      killed by the treatment and patients kept inadequately in isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome the misleading results, attempts have been made to develop viability biomarkers&#xD;
      for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the agent of tuberculosis. Studies using RNA or DNA&#xD;
      gave convincing results but their cost is not affordable in most part of the world. Those&#xD;
      using fluorescein probes are easiest but studies have shown either conflicting results, or&#xD;
      have been evaluated only for a short period of time after initiation of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, we evaluated a fluorescent staining able to differentiate dead bacilli from alive,&#xD;
      which was previously used for detection of industrial environmental pathogens - the&#xD;
      Live/Dead® BacLight™ Bacterial viability test (Invitrogen, Biocentric, France). Briefly, the&#xD;
      test permits to visualize the bacteria using SYTO-9 and propidiumiodide (PI) fluorescent&#xD;
      dyes, which both bind to DNA but penetrate specifically cytoplasmic membrane: SYTO-9&#xD;
      penetrates all bacilli, either viable or not, whereas the PI penetrates only in cells with&#xD;
      damaged membrane. Consequently, the viable bacteria are impermeable to PI and only fluoresced&#xD;
      due to SYTO-9 appearing green under the fluorescent microscope, whereas dead bacteria are&#xD;
      marked by both fluorescent dyes and appear red.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We firstly adapted the kit to mycobacteriology and assessed, in in vitro experiments, the&#xD;
      concordance of the test with the culture results. Then, we showed in an observational&#xD;
      prospective study its accurateness to predict culture results in patients undergoing&#xD;
      antituberculous therapy: the viability test correctly predicted all culture-positive samples&#xD;
      in the first two months after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the present study is to confirm in a multicentric study the utility of our&#xD;
      viability test in large cohort of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients under&#xD;
      treatment and to determine if the test could help physicians to discontinue isolation&#xD;
      measures in hospital setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the test is quick (less than 1 h for the test versus a median of 23 days for culture)&#xD;
      and easy to perform, it would be useful to help physicians to maintain isolation in clinical&#xD;
      settings while avoiding unnecessary cultures. Since the test is also cheap (&lt;1 € for&#xD;
      reagents) this issue could be particularly valuable in countries with limited resources and&#xD;
      where cultures are unavailable.&#xD;

    <measure>Result of the viability test (positive or negative) compared to culture results (reference test). - The reference test will be considered as positive (C+) if Mtb are grown on solid or liquid media et negative (C-) if the cultures remain sterile after 42</measure>

    <description>The culture will be judged positive in case of isolation of tubercle bacilli in solid or liquid medium and will be judged negative if the culture is sterile after 42 days of incubation in liquid medium and 60 days in solid medium. If the culture is contaminated with bacteria other than tubercle bacilli, it will be considered uninterpretable.&#xD;
- The microscopic viability test will be judged positive in the event of observation of at least 1 bacillus per slide is stained with Syto9 in fluorescent green per slide on microscopic examination of the smear and will be judged negative if no bacillus fluoresces in green .&#xD;
Each test will be interpreted blind to the results of the other and the results of the TVmol. the diagnostic indices of the microscopic viability test will be calculated</description>
