    <textblock>
      This study examines the feasibility and preliminary effects of user-centered exergames (video&#xD;
      game-based physical exercise) in persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). The user-centered&#xD;
      exergames were developed within a interdisciplinary team to meet the requirements of the&#xD;
      end-users. The individualized exergames were designed for the Dividat Senso, a pressure&#xD;
      sensitive plate connected to a personal computer and a frontal screen. This concurrent&#xD;
      motor-cognitive training aims to improve motor and cognitive functions in an ecological valid&#xD;
      setting. The cognitive functions are triggered by specific stimuli in the game scenarios. The&#xD;
      video games are controlled via specific (whole body) movements as steps, weight shifting,&#xD;
      jumps, and arm movements. The training focus is mainly on balance and coordination as well as&#xD;
      executive functions and attention. Furthermore, the meaningful games (colorful and appealing&#xD;
      visuals) were designed to motivate the players to move.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are allocated to the either the intervention group or the control group&#xD;
      (quasi-randomization). Participants in the intervention group perform 16 training session&#xD;
      over a period of 4 to 8 weeks (depending on in- or out-patient). One training session lasts&#xD;
      between 15-25 minutes. Since the difficulty of the games is adaptive to the ability level of&#xD;
      each participant, they should neither be over- nor under-challenged. Participates in the&#xD;
      control group continue their normal daily routine over 8 weeks. Measurements are performed&#xD;
      before, in-between, and after the intervention period to assess feasibility parameters as&#xD;
      well as motor and cognitive functions in all participants.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study was designed to examine the feasibility of the intervention as well as to get&#xD;
      preliminary results about the effects of the user-centered exergame training on motor and&#xD;
      cognitive functions in persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire study last 5 months (March 2021 to July 2021) and is performed in three study&#xD;
      locations (two rehabilitation clinics and one physiotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PwMS are informed by their local physiotherapists and research associates about the study.&#xD;
      All interested PwMS are then screened for eligibility. A sample size of 30 PwMS is&#xD;
      anticipated where 15 participants are allocated to the intervention group and 15 participants&#xD;
      to the control group (quasi-randomization). Measurements are performed before, in-between,&#xD;
      and after the intervention period to assess feasibility parameters as well as motor and&#xD;
      cognitive functions in all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group:The user-centered exergames were developed within a interdisciplinary team&#xD;
      to meet the requirements of the end-users. The individualized exergames were designed for the&#xD;
      Dividat Senso, a pressure sensitive plate connected to a personal computer and a frontal&#xD;
      screen. The pressure-sensitive plate allows a precise analysis of the user's movements&#xD;
      through several high-resolution sensors. Furthermore, this plate detects position and timing&#xD;
      information that are then used to provide the user with real-time feedback and/or game&#xD;
      adaptations. To support users with potential balance issues and to avoid fall events, a&#xD;
      handrail is mounted around the plate.This concurrent motor-cognitive training aims to improve&#xD;
      motor and cognitive functions in an ecological valid setting. The cognitive functions are&#xD;
      triggered by specific stimuli in the game scenarios. The video games are controlled via&#xD;
      specific (whole body) movements as steps, weight shifting, jumps, and arm movements. The&#xD;
      training focus is mainly on multi-tasking, balance and coordination as well as executive&#xD;
      functions and attention. Furthermore, the meaningful games (colorful and appealing visuals)&#xD;
      were designed to motivate the players to move. Participants in the intervention group perform&#xD;
      16 training session over a period of 4 to 8 weeks (depending on in- or out-patient). One&#xD;
      training session lasts between 15-25 minutes. Since the difficulty of the games is adaptive&#xD;
      to the ability level of each participant, they should neither be over- nor under-challenged.&#xD;
      Each participant starts the exergame training at the lowest level to get familiar with the&#xD;
      game control system. As the exergame will automatically adapt (individual progression) during&#xD;
      play time, participants are challenged at their individual motor and cognitive level.&#xD;
      Furthermore, participants write down the amount, type, and duration of activities besides the&#xD;
      exergames training in an activity diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group:Participants of the control group are instructed to continue their normal daily&#xD;
      activities over the period of eight weeks. To evaluate the amount of active time, the&#xD;
      participants get an activity diary where they can write down the amount, type, and duration&#xD;
      of their activities.&#xD;
