  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate the effects of GB34 acupuncture, performed&#xD;
      as adjuvant to standard medical treatment, on clinical response and laboratory parameters of&#xD;
      patients with a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute cholecystitis is a frequent complication of gallbladder stones. The prevalence of&#xD;
      gallbladder stone is 10-15% and in 35% of patients complications and recurrent symptoms&#xD;
      develop in their lifetime. Acute cholecystitis is one of the most frequently encountered&#xD;
      acute surgical conditions. It is manifested in 3-10% of patients referred to emergency&#xD;
      departments with complaints of abdominal pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the gold standard of therapy is laparoscopic cholecystectomy in symptomatic&#xD;
      cholecystitis and related complications, more than 70% of patients respond well to medical&#xD;
      treatment at first place. Actually, timing of cholecystectomy was studied extensively, yet is&#xD;
      still debatable. Early cholecystectomy is the operation performed within 72 hours of the&#xD;
      beginning of the symptoms. Delayed cholecystectomy is the operation performed 6 weeks after&#xD;
      the suppression of the inflammation. Investigators perform early cholecystectomy is in cases&#xD;
      with perforation and complication like gangrenous or emphysematous acute cholecystitis&#xD;
      whereas delayed cholecystectomy is preferred in the remaining patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact it is known for some time that ear and body acupuncture have modulatory effects on&#xD;
      motor functions of gallbladder and even provide some improvement in acute cholecystitis.&#xD;
      Previously, studies demonstrating that GB34 has specific effects on the motility of bile&#xD;
      ducts were published. More recently, researchers were able to demonstrate that GB34 electro&#xD;
      acupuncture have positive effects on gall bladder wall thickness and on WBC levels, by using&#xD;
      an experimental rabbit model of acute cholecystitis. Additional functional MR studies were&#xD;
      used to distinguish the neural specificity of the acupuncture points. GB34 were found to&#xD;
      induce a specific response pattern which is more significant in motor functions in brain.&#xD;
      Furthermore it is known for decades that acupuncture other than point specific effects,&#xD;
      triggers self-healing mechanisms of the body via endogen pathways.&#xD;
