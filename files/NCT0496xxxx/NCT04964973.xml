  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chest pain is one of the most difficult problems to solve after thoracic surgery. Its correct&#xD;
      control is often quite difficult, which can cause complications due to an ineffective cough&#xD;
      and superficial respiratory movements. It could provoke secretion retention, lung&#xD;
      atelectasis, and even pneumonia. In addition, insufficient treatment of postoperative pain&#xD;
      also causes a slower recovery of mobility, delaying the incorporation to daily life&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) is a technique that attempts to establish pain&#xD;
      control by applying electrical current through superficial electrodes Is transcutaneous&#xD;
      electrical nerve stimulation effective for the pain rehabilitation approach after thoracic&#xD;
      surgery? Are there spirometry changes related to pulmonary function after the application of&#xD;
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation in postoperative rehabilitation of thoracic&#xD;
      surgical patients?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients likely to be part of the study will have an exhaustive medical history. Said&#xD;
      clinical history will have, as a basis, the following aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Filiation data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personal history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of intervention carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incisions made.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronology, location and characteristics of pain. Once intervened, the data&#xD;
           corresponding to the surgical intervention performed will be collected. Once the period&#xD;
           of 7 days after the intervention has passed and in the absence of complications and&#xD;
           pleural drainage, the period of respiratory physiotherapy will begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of quality of life The SF-36 (Short Form Health Survey) health questionnaire will&#xD;
      be carried out. This questionnaire is used in medical and mental health research and, in&#xD;
      general, in health-related research. It offers an overview of the health status of the&#xD;
      person, with the advantage that it is quick and easy to fill out, while also being easy to&#xD;
      assess. In the same way, by allowing the numerical assessment of different aspects of the&#xD;
      health of the person, it becomes an excellent tool for any research related to health. It&#xD;
      contains 36 questions that address different aspects related to the daily life of the person&#xD;
      who fills in the questionnaire. These questions are grouped and measured in 8 sections that&#xD;
      are evaluated independently and give rise to 8 dimensions that the questionnaire measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eight dimensions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physical functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Limitation due to physical problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Body pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Functioning or social role.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Limitation due to emotional problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Vitality, energy or fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. General perception of health. In 1991, the project known as &quot;International Quality of&#xD;
           Life Assessment&quot; (International Quality of Life Assessment Project, IQOLA) was started,&#xD;
           which basically consists of adapting and testing the intercultural applicability of a&#xD;
           generic instrument called the SF-Health Survey. (Short Form 36 Health Survey).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Spanish version of the SF-36 is one of the most widely used generic instruments in the&#xD;
      national territory, both in descriptive studies that measure the impact on HRQL in different&#xD;
      patient populations and for the evaluation of therapeutic interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The necessary tools to make a correct pain assessment. In this sense, two ways of measuring&#xD;
      it will be established:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Self-reports, where the visual analog scale (VAS) will be the basic measurement tool.&#xD;
           The pain will be marked with a scale from 0 (absence of pain) to 10 (maximum possible&#xD;
           pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The standardized tests, as an objective of the study, are also proposed to analyze&#xD;
           sensitive, affective and behavioral aspects of pain in these patients, it is for this&#xD;
           reason that the Mc Gill test will be the tool to take into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of respiratory function The different respiratory parameters will be measured by&#xD;
      spirometry (Siebel spirometer): Forced Vital Capacity (FVC); Forced expiratory volume of the&#xD;
      first second (FEV1); FEV1 / FVC (Tiffeneau Index).&#xD;
