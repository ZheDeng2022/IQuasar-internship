  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-centre, observational study which enrolls 150 IBS-C patients and 150&#xD;
      non-IBS-C patients in China.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The potential study subject will be identified by the investigators by face-to-face visit,&#xD;
      and there will be only 1 visit in this study. Every patient will complete both ROME IV and&#xD;
      the Simplified Diagnosis Tool during the visit, and in the same day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will collect results of the ROME IV and the Simplified Diagnosis Tool. Sensitivity&#xD;
      and specificity of simplified diagnosis methodology compared with ROME IV will be analysed&#xD;
      after all the data has been collected.&#xD;

        With the ratio of IBS-C/non-IBS-C as 1:1, when the sample size is 300, assuming the&#xD;
        sensitivity and specificity using ROME IV as reference are 0.85 and 0.85 respectively, a&#xD;
        two-sided 95% confidence interval will produce confidence interval widths of 0.12 and 0.12&#xD;
        respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, with the same assumption as above, a total sample size of 300 (which includes&#xD;
        150 subjects with the IBS-C) achieves 99% power to detect a change in sensitivity/&#xD;
        specificity from 0.7 to 0.85 using a two-sided binomial test. The target significance level&#xD;
        is 0.05.&#xD;
