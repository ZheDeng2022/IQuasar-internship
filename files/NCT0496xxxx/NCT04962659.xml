      This is a pilot study of the feasibility and potential impact of a Mindfulness-Based Music&#xD;
      and Songwriting program (delivered via telehealth) on stress and well-being in&#xD;
      parents/caregivers of children with intellectual or developmental disabilities. Participants&#xD;
      are randomized to participate in the mindfulness program or a business-as-usual control&#xD;

&#xD;
      During mindfulness sessions, parents/caregivers are supported by a therapist to learn and&#xD;
      apply mindfulness practices through music-based meditations and songwriting. Participants&#xD;
      write two songs during the program. Parents complete surveys throughout the program.&#xD;
