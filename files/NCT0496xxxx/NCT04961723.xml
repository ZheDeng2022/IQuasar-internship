      Self-testing with easy-to-use rapid diagnostic tests has been successfully used for diseases&#xD;
      such as HIV. The availability of self-testing has been shown to increase testing rates and&#xD;
      testing acceptability in diverse populations around the world, in large part due to its&#xD;
      convenience and privacy advantages.7 Self-testing has also been effectively used to reach key&#xD;
      populations who may not be covered by traditional healthcare programs, such as persons who&#xD;
      inject drugs (PWID) and men who have sex with men (MSM). In Georgia, HIV self-testing has&#xD;
      been offered to MSM through an online platform promoting their uptake.11-12 In the present&#xD;
      study aims to evaluate the acceptability and impact of using an online platform to enable&#xD;
      home delivery of HCV self-testing in Georgia for PWID and MSM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Georgia, a middle-income country with an estimated population of 3.7 million people, is among&#xD;
      the world's highest-burden countries for HCV, with an estimated sero-prevalence of 7.7% in&#xD;
      the general population and a higher burden of disease in high-risk populations such as&#xD;
      persons who inject drugs. In 2015, Georgia embarked on an elimination program for HCV which&#xD;
      includes the expansion of HCV testing, linkage to care, and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The country made a substantial progress in HCV testing, linkage to care and treatment during&#xD;
      the last five years, but the gap still remains that needs to be addressed through testing of&#xD;
      different screening modalities to reach marginalized groups of the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-testing with easy-to-use rapid diagnostic tests has been successfully used for diseases&#xD;
      such as HIV. The availability of self-testing has been shown to increase testing rates and&#xD;
      testing acceptability in diverse populations around the world, in large part due to its&#xD;
      convenience and privacy advantages. The present study aims to evaluate the acceptability and&#xD;
      impact of an online program enabling home delivery of HCV self-testing (HCVST) for people who&#xD;
      inject drugs (PWID) and men who have sex with men (MSM) in Georgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Centres for Disease Control (NCDC) and FIND, in conjunction with the Georgian&#xD;
      national HCV elimination program, Batumi Imedi, Equality Movement, Tanadgoma, and Tbilisi New&#xD;
      Way are evaluating HCV self-testing as a way to expand outreach, improve HCV testing rates,&#xD;
      and increase linkage to care among HCV-infected PWID and MSM. The ability to utilize an&#xD;
      existing online platform promoting HIV self-testing, selftest.ge, will enable the study to&#xD;
      examine how offering HCV self-testing may help Georgia reach its goal of nationwide&#xD;
      elimination of HCV&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to describe the acceptability and impact of an online platform offering home&#xD;
      delivery of HCV self-tests to PWID and MSM. Since HCV self-tests detect the presence of&#xD;
      antibodies to HCV, indicating exposure to HCV, any individual reporting a positive HCV&#xD;
      self-test will be referred to HCV RNA confirmatory testing in order to identify active HCV&#xD;
      infection. Those confirmed to have active HCV infection with a positive HCV RNA test will be&#xD;
      linked to HCV treatment and care. Rates of testing and linkage to care will be measured,&#xD;
      along with knowledge, attitudes, and practices around HCV testing and care&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled trial comparing an online platform providing home-delivery of&#xD;
      HCV self-tests to referral to standard of care community-based HCV testing sites in PWID and&#xD;
      MSM in Georgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be recruited through an existing HIV self-testing program using an&#xD;
      online platform to promote the study. Interested participants will sign up to be contacted&#xD;
      for study eligibility screening and consent. All study participants will complete a baseline&#xD;
      survey collecting demographics and knowledge and attitudes towards HCV testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be done among participants who primarily identify as MSM (arm 1, 2 and 3)&#xD;
      and separately among participant who primarily identify as PWID&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1: MSM postal delivery Participants who identify primarily as MSM will receive a&#xD;
           home delivered HCV self-test kit in non-identifiable packaging. The kit will include the&#xD;
           test, instructions for use (IFU), and information about additional supporting materials,&#xD;
           such as access to live chat and a call center for questions about testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2: MSM peer delivery Participants who identify primarily as MSM will schedule a peer&#xD;
           delivery of the HCV self-test kit and IFU. The peer will provide basic information about&#xD;
           the test, what to do if the test is reactive, and how to access to live chat and a call&#xD;
           center for questions about testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 3: MSM control Participants who identify primarily as MSM will receive information&#xD;
           about standard of care HCV antibody testing available at local testing sites in their&#xD;
           community. Participants will also have access to live chat and a call center for&#xD;
           questions about HCV testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 4: PWID peer delivery Participants who identify primarily as PWID will schedule a&#xD;
           peer delivery of the HCV self-test kit and IFU. The peer will provide basic information&#xD;
           about the test, what to do if the test is reactive, and how to access to live chat and a&#xD;
           call center for questions about testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 5: PWID control Participants who identify primarily as PWID will receive information&#xD;
           about standard of care HCV antibody testing available at local testing sites in their&#xD;
           community. Participants will also have access to live chat and a call center for&#xD;
           questions about HCV testing All participants will be sent a telephone reminder Follow-up&#xD;
           survey #1 which includes the opportunity to upload any testing result approximately 2-4&#xD;
           weeks after enrolment. A second Follow-up survey will be sent after the closure of the&#xD;
           first survey. Up to 3 reminders may be sent for each survey if a survey has not been&#xD;
           completed. Participants will receive 10 GEL phone credit (~3 USD) for completion of the&#xD;
           first follow up questionnaire to enter test result and an additional 10 GEL for&#xD;
           completion of the follow-up survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any participants who report HCV antibody positive result through the study will be contacted&#xD;
      by the project staff and offered confirmatory testing and appropriate linkage to care through&#xD;
      the national HCV program. For all arms study staff will contact to the participants who&#xD;
      report HCV antibody positive result via the online platform and will provide information&#xD;
      about the next steps for diagnostic and treatment, information about the treatment&#xD;
      facilities. Those participants will be contacted again after 6 weeks and will be asked if&#xD;
      they received the next HCV care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HCV test used in the intervention group is an oral fluid test (OraQuickÂ® HCV Self-Test).&#xD;
      Although use as a self-test is still research use only, it has been validated by the&#xD;
      manufacturer for self-testing. The test has also already been CE marked and WHO pre-qualified&#xD;
      as an in vitro diagnostic for professional use by healthcare workers.&#xD;

    <description>The OraQuickÂ® HCV Self-Test is a lateral flow rapid diagnostic that can detect anti-HCV antibodies in oral fluid. Instructions for Use (IFU) for OraQuickÂ® HCV Rapid Antibody Self-Test have been developed in Georgian for the previous 2 studies conducted in Georgia using the OraQuickÂ® HCV Rapid Antibody Self-Test. The IFU has been optimized taking in the feedback on the IFU resulting from the aforementioned studies. As this HCV test is not approved for self-test use in Georgia, all tests will be labelled as Research Use Only (RUO) and test results will not be used for patient management.</description>
