  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use the University of Washington's ALACRITY Center's (UWAC) Discover, Design,&#xD;
      Build, &amp; Test (DDBT) method to develop and test an intervention to address the MH health&#xD;
      needs of older adults in senior housing who are forced to not only shelter-in-place but&#xD;
      cannot have family or other visitors during this time. Older people (those over 60 years in&#xD;
      age) are especially vulnerable and are more likely to have severe - even deadly - coronavirus&#xD;
      infection than other age groups. These facts led to the need to have older adults socially&#xD;
      isolate in order to protect their health; visits with family and friends are limited, and in&#xD;
      senior housing (independent, supported and assisted care residences) have limited such visits&#xD;
      by family to one person a day. This necessary practice of social distancing, while addressing&#xD;
      an important public health crisis, unintentionally creates social isolation and loneliness,&#xD;
      another deadly epidemic amongst the older population. Even before COVID-19, social isolation&#xD;
      and loneliness was a prominent mental health and social problem in the aged, one that is&#xD;
      associated with increases in other chronic conditions, dementia and suicide. Effective&#xD;
      interventions for social isolation exist but are difficult to access and may not address all&#xD;
      the concerns older adults have about this particular period of social isolation. The purpose&#xD;
      of this proposed study is to deploy an adaptation of Behavioral Activation Therapy called&#xD;
      Stay Connected to treat depression in older adults. The adaptation will allow activity&#xD;
      directors and staff in these settings and senior centers to deliver the therapeutic elements&#xD;
      of the intervention (behavioral activation) in the context of social&#xD;
      distancing/shelter-in-place policies. Social workers in these settings will oversee the&#xD;
      activity director and staff delivery of the intervention. The investigators are working with&#xD;
      a variety of senior housing types (HUD certified and private systems) and senior centers in&#xD;
      Skagit (rural) and King (urban) counties of WA so that the resulting intervention is not tied&#xD;
      to economic levels or access to digital technology.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Staff and residents from 6 rural and urban senior communities or senior centers will&#xD;
      participate in this study. Senior communities or senior centers will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      training and materials in either Stay Connected or a resource guide. The investigators will&#xD;
      work with 2 staff from each community or senior center and conduct baseline, 4 week and 9&#xD;
      week assessments with staff and 20 residents from each community setting (N=12 staff and 120&#xD;
      residents).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline PHQ-9 at 4 Weeks and 9 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 consists of 9 depression items and one disability item. Each time is associated with a DMS symptom of depression, which the participant rates whether or not they have experienced the symptom over the last two weeks, with severity rating of 0-3. It is one of the few measures that is brief (it takes less than one minute to give) and has been found to have excellent sensitivity to change over time. Older adult participants will complete this measure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline GAD-7 at 4 Weeks and 9 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To assess for co-occurring anxiety, we will use the GAD-7, a 7- item screener for generalized anxiety. It consists of items related to GAD. Participants rate on a scale of 0-3 how much they have experienced in the last two weeks. The scale is a valid screener for GAD. Older adult participants will complete this measure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline SDS at 4 Weeks and 9 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SDS will be used as measure of disability/functional status. This is a brief analog disability scale, which uses visual-spatial, numeric and verbal anchors. The scale has been validated in medical and psychiatric populations with a variety of psychiatric diagnoses. Older adult participants will complete this measure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>UCLA Loneliness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline UCLA Loneliness Scale at 4 weeks and 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 20-item scale designed to measure one's subjective feelings of loneliness as well as feelings of social isolation. Participants rate each item as either O (&quot;I often feel this way&quot;), S (&quot;I sometimes feel this way&quot;), R (&quot;I rarely feel this way&quot;), N (&quot;I never feel this way&quot;). Older adult participants will complete this measure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioral Activation Scale (BADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline BADS at 4 weeks and 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale (BADS) can be used to track changes weekly in the behaviors hypothesized to underlie depression and specifically targeted for change by behavioral activation. It examines changes in the following areas: activation, avoidance/rumination, work/school impairment, and social impairment. The BADS consists of 25 questions, each rated on a seven point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 6 (completely). Older adult participants will complete this measure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PROMIS Social Isolation - Short Version</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline PROMIS Social Isolation at 4 weeks and 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Social Isolation item bank assesses perceptions of being avoided, excluded, detached, disconnected from, or unknown by, others. Older adult participants will complete this measure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at study completion (average of 9 months later)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a four item measure of intervention acceptability, where each item is rated on a 1-5 scale, with 1 = not at all acceptable and 5 = very acceptable. Staff participants will complete this measure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention Usability Scale (IUS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at study completion (average of 9 months later)</time_frame>
    <description>This measures how easy the intervention/system is to use and learn. Used for interventions (e.g., therapeutic modalities).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at study completion (average of 9 months later)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a four item measure of how suitable an intervention is for the circumstances.</description>
