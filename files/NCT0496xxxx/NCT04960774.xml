  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is one of the most common oral diseases, which is characterized by alveolar&#xD;
      bone resorption and destruction. In China, as a major country in the incidence of&#xD;
      periodontitis, there is a huge population of patients with severe periodontitis, and the&#xD;
      incidence rate is as high as 12.1-16.1% . Previous studies have suggested that the prevalence&#xD;
      and severity of periodontal disease increase with age. However, recent articles on meta&#xD;
      analysis and related epidemiological investigations suggest that the prevalence of severe&#xD;
      periodontitis does not increase with age, and the prevalence of SP remains at about 10% even&#xD;
      in the elderly. In order to comprehensively analyze the risk factors of this population, it&#xD;
      is inseparable from the analysis of gene polymorphism. At present, it is considered that the&#xD;
      main genes that may be related to the severity of periodontitis are IL-1 α-889, rhIL-talk 1 β&#xD;
      + 3953, 6-174, 10-597, CD14-260, CD14-159, MMP1-1607 and so on, which may be related to the&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is one of the most common oral diseases, which is characterized by alveolar&#xD;
      bone resorption and destruction. In 2010, severe periodontitis (severe periodontitis,SP) had&#xD;
      become the sixth largest epidemic disease in the world, affecting 10.8% of the global&#xD;
      population or 743 million people . In China, as a major country in the incidence of&#xD;
      periodontitis, there is a huge population of patients with severe periodontitis, and the&#xD;
      incidence rate is as high as 12.1-16.1% . The fourth National Oral Health Epidemiological&#xD;
      Survey also found that the oral health of residents aged 35-44 is generally poor , which has&#xD;
      become a major obstacle to the implementation of the &quot;Healthy China 2030&quot; strategy. Previous&#xD;
      studies have suggested that the prevalence and severity of periodontal disease increase with&#xD;
      age . The possible reasons for this phenomenon are as follows.First, the cumulative effect of&#xD;
      attachment level and bone loss with age.Second, changes related to the aging process, such as&#xD;
      drug intake, decreased immune function, and changes in nutritional status interact with risk&#xD;
      factors can increase the susceptibility to periodontitis. However, recent articles on meta&#xD;
      analysis and related epidemiological investigations suggest that the prevalence of severe&#xD;
      periodontitis does not increase with age, and the prevalence of SP remains at about 10% even&#xD;
      in the elderly. In addition, the global meta analysis with large sample size showed that the&#xD;
      prevalence of SP increased sharply between 30 and 40 years old, peaked at about 38 years old.&#xD;
      This trend of severe periodontitis with age is not consistent with our traditional cognition,&#xD;
      and there is no related research to explain this trend. However, it is found that 30-40 years&#xD;
      old patients with severe periodontitis account for a large proportion, so it is of great&#xD;
      significance to analyze the risk factors of this group and carry out targeted prevention and&#xD;
      control. In order to comprehensively analyze the risk factors of this population, it is&#xD;
      inseparable from the analysis of gene polymorphism. Studies related to severe periodontitis&#xD;
      gene polymorphism are mainly focused on Toll-like receptor (Toll-likereceptors), interleukin&#xD;
      (interleukin,IL), immunoglobulin receptor (Immunoglobulinreceptors), formyl peptide receptor&#xD;
      (Formylpeptide receptor), vitamin D receptor (VitaminDreceptor, VDR) and matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteinases (matrixmetalloproteinase,MMP). At present, it is considered that the main&#xD;
      genes that may be related to the severity of periodontitis are IL-1 α-889, rhIL-talk 1 β +&#xD;
      3953, 6-174, 10-597, CD14-260, CD14-159, MMP1-1607 and so on, which may be related to the&#xD;
      severity of periodontitis.&#xD;
