  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this post market clinical follow-up (PMCF) investigation is to&#xD;
      follow the progress of exuding chronic wounds to healing, or up to 12 weeks, whichever occurs&#xD;
      first, consecutively using Exufiber® as primary dressing, and Mepilex® Border Flex (Mepilex&#xD;
      Border Comfort) as primary dressing.&#xD;

      This investigation is as a prospective, open, non-comparative, multi-centre investigation&#xD;
      with the aim to follow exuding chronic wound progression. The investigation will include&#xD;
      subjects from three populations suffering from exuding chronic wounds (Venous Leg Ulcers,&#xD;
      Diabetic Foot Ulcers and Pressure Ulcers). The target wound for all subjects will initially&#xD;
      be treated with Exufiber® as primary dressing. As the wound progress and wound exudate&#xD;
      production is reduced, the Exufiber will be replaced by the Mepilex Border Flex dressing. For&#xD;
      ulcers located at sacrum or heel, the Mepilex Border Heel or Mepilex Border Sacrum will be&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
