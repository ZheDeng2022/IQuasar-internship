  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Speech and voice disorders are observed in almost 90% of patients with PD during their course&#xD;
      of illness. Reduced voice pitch inflections or monotone speech, reduced vocal loudness,&#xD;
      prosody disorders, the imprecise articulation of the consonants, hoarseness, and breathy&#xD;
      voice is also observed in patients with PD; these symptoms often lead to reduced speech&#xD;
      intelligibility. The aim of this study will to investigate the possible changes in the voice&#xD;
      and speech features in people with PD after a combined speech and music therapy using&#xD;
      Telerehabilitation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      the investigators of this study propose to conduct a pilot randomized, controlled trial in&#xD;
      patients with PD to assess the potential effectiveness of a Telerehabilitation intervention&#xD;
      that encourage a higher level of speech performance. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      patients in the combined treatment group will have more and better improve in the study&#xD;
      outcome measures after treatment and 3 month follow up, as compared with patients in speech&#xD;
      therapy group and music therapy group.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>loudness</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in loudness at 4 weeks and 3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Change in loudness over the period of the study which will be based on analysis of acoustic recordings. Loudness of voice will be measured in produce the vowel /a /, reading and spontaneous speech. Data will be analyzed using Praat, freeware program for the analysis and reconstruction of acoustic speech signals.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Voice Handicap Index (VHI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in VHI at 4 weeks and 3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Persian version of Voice Handicap Index (VHI) over the period of the study. The VHI measures the influence of voice problems on a patient's quality of life. The VHI is a 30 item scale. The total scores range is 0-120. A score 60-120 indicates severe voice problem.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>maximum phonation time (MPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in MPT at 4 weeks and 3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Change in maximum phonation time (MPT) over the period of the study. MPT will be measured by asking the subject to produce the long vowel /a/. This vocalization is measured three times, and the longest MPT is recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Speech Intelligibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in Speech Intelligibility at 4 weeks and 3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Change in fudalla speech intelligibility rating scale over the period of the study. This scale consists of 7 rates in which the number 1 indicates Speech is not intelligible and number 7 indicates Speech is totally intelligible.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire (SDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in SDQ at 4 weeks and 3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Persian version of Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire (SDQ) over the period of the study. The SDQ is a 15 item scale. The total scores range is 0-45. A score higher 11 indicates swallowing difficulty.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dysphagia handicap index (DHI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in DHI at 4 weeks and 3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Persian version of Dysphagia handicap index (DHI) over the period of the study. The DHI is one of the instruments used for measuring a dysphagic patient's self-assessment. it reflects the patient's quality of life. DHI is a 25 item scale. The total scores range is 0-100. A higher score indicates a greater impact of swallowing disorders on quality of life</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>northwest dysphagia patient check sheet (NDPCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in NDPCS at 4 weeks and 3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Persian version of northwest dysphagia patient check sheet (NPCS) scores over the period of the study. The NDPCS has five and 28 items. Each item is scored as safe or unsafe. The total score is calculated from the total number of unsafe items. The more unsafe observations indicates swallowing difficulty.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Geriatric Depressive Scale (GDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in GDS at 4 weeks and 3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Persian version of Geriatric Depressive Scale (GDS) scores over the period of the study. GDS is a 15 item scale. Each item is scored as yes or no. More than 5 signs indicate the possibility of depression and more than 10 signs of depression indicate definite depression.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in jitter at 4 weeks and 3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Change in jitter over the period of the study, which will be based on analysis of acoustic recordings. jitter will be measured in produce the vowel /a/. Data will be analyzed using Praat, freeware program for the analysis and reconstruction of acoustic speech signals.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>shimmer</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in shimmer at 4 weeks and 3 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Change in shimmer over the period of the study, which will be based on analysis of acoustic recordings. shimmer will be measured in produce the vowel /a/. Data will be analyzed using Praat, freeware program for the analysis and reconstruction of acoustic speech signals.</description>
