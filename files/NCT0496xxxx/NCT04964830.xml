  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project examines sleep quality (e.g. prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea(OSA)),&#xD;
      dimension of upper airway, jaw function, well-being and quality of life in children with&#xD;
      large overjet compared to a control group. In addition, the effect of treatment with a&#xD;
      mandibular advancement device (MAD) on sleep quality, upper airway and jaw function are&#xD;
      examined, and how these factors affect the children's well-being and quality of life.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep is very important for children's growth, development and learning. The anatomy and size&#xD;
      of the airway and position of the jaw can affect children's sleep. Children with large&#xD;
      overjet due to a posterior position of the mandible have smaller airways compared to children&#xD;
      with neutral occlusion. Reduced dimensions of the upper airways may increase the risk of&#xD;
      impaired sleep quality and the sleep related breathing disorder obstructive sleep apnoea&#xD;
      (OSA), which causes symptoms e.g. failure to thrive, irritability, behavioural disorders,&#xD;
      fatigue, which affects the children's growth, development, and learning negatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with large overjet due to mandibular retrognathia in Denmark are offered orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment in municipal dental care and are in most cases treated with a mandibular&#xD;
      advancement device (MAD) keeping the mandible in a forward position relative to the maxilla.&#xD;
      MADs are also used to treat adults with mild-moderate obstructive sleep apnoea while they&#xD;
      sleep. This can reduce the number of apnoea periods by up to 75% as well as preventing&#xD;
      daytime sleepiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No previous study have examined sleep quality, upper airway, jaw function, well-being and&#xD;
      quality of life in children with large overjet before, during and after MAD treatment&#xD;
      compared to a control group with normal occlusion.&#xD;
