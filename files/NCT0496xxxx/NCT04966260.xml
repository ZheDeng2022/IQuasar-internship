  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with advanced and life-threatening illnesses experience challenges across multiple&#xD;
      domains of function including physical, psychological, social, and spiritual. The benefits of&#xD;
      non-pharmacological interventions for palliative care patients are well recognized, but are&#xD;
      relatively under-utilized. Virtual Reality (VR) therapy may help address these challenges and&#xD;
      be a valuable addition to the current therapies used in palliative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VR is a computer generated, three-dimensional environment that individuals can explore and&#xD;
      interact with using specialized equipment such as a head-mounted display with internal&#xD;
      sensors. VR has been increasingly adapted for applications in healthcare, as a simulation for&#xD;
      medical training and an intervention tool to impact pain management, stress and anxiety. VR&#xD;
      has the potential to improve both physical and psychological symptoms in patients with&#xD;
      terminal illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is a small randomized controlled trial to understand the impact of VR on&#xD;
      physical symptoms, psychological symptoms and quality of life in patients at the end of life.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to a single comparator session, single session of standard&#xD;
      VR, or single session of personalized VR. The comparator arm will consist of participants&#xD;
      viewing an ordinary two-dimensional video on an iPad such as a peaceful nature scene. The&#xD;
      standard VR arm will consist of participants viewing a &quot;bucket list&quot; experience self-selected&#xD;
      from a VR library i.e. an experience the participant desires but has never experienced. The&#xD;
      personalized VR arm will consist of participants viewing content that is personally&#xD;
      meaningful to them. This content will be obtained through either a) family/friends creating a&#xD;
      personalized video (e.g. video footage of their summer cottage) or b) the participant will&#xD;
      select an experience from the VR library that is personally meaningful (e.g. visiting their&#xD;
      honeymoon destination, exploring their childhood hometown, etc.) if option a) is not&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete self-report questionnaires about their physical and psychological&#xD;
      symptoms and quality of life before and after the intervention (two days and seven days post&#xD;
      intervention). Participants will also complete a feedback survey to evaluate their&#xD;
      satisfaction with the intervention. Surveys will be administered by the research assistant.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a small randomized controlled trial conducted in a study population of patients admitted to a geriatric palliative care unit. The clinical team will determine if the patient is eligible for the study. Patients and families/friends of patients who are randomized to the personalized VR will be consented over the telephone by the research assistant., Participants will then be randomly assigned into one of the three study arms: comparator, standardized VR or personalized VR, on a 1:1:1 basis using computer-generated random numbers and a block size of 3 without additional stratification.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, post-intervention, 2 day follow up, 7 day follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The ESAS is a self-report measure used to assist in the assessment of pain, tiredness, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, appetite, wellbeing, and shortness of breath (Bruera, Kuehn, Miller, Selmser, &amp; Macmillan, 1991). The severity of the symptom at the time of the assessment is rated from zero to ten, with zero meaning the symptom is absent and ten meaning worst possible severity. For the purpose of the study the ESAS was modified to include two additional items, headache and dizziness.&#xD;
Analysis of the ESAS scores across the different time points will help determine whether VR effects are transient (within 24 hours) or sustained (after 2 and 7 days).</description>

    <measure>Change in Missoula-VITAS Quality of Life Index (MVQOLI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention, post-intervention, 2 day follow up, 7 day follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The MVQOLI evaluates subjective quality of life among people living with advanced, life-threatening illness by assessing the domains of symptoms, function, interpersonal, wellbeing, and transcendence (Schwartz, Merriman, Reed, &amp; Byock, 2005). Each domain includes three Likert-scale evaluation questions.&#xD;
Analysis of the MVQOLI scores across the different time points will help determine whether VR effects are transient (within 24 hours) or sustained (after 2 and 7 days).</description>

    <description>There are two types of personalized VR: 1) Family/friends provide personalized content (e.g., life stories, photos, videos) that will be used during the VR session. Family/friends of participants in the personalized VR group will have the opportunity to upload custom photos, videos, life stories or capture their own 360Â° footage of family events using a GoPro camera that will be loaned to them for the study. This content will be uploaded to a cloud-based portal. 2) If the family/friends of those in the personalized VR arm are unavailable/unable/unwilling to provide personalized content the participant will select a video from the VR library of an experience that is personally memorable to them, such as their childhood hometown, a favourite vacation destination. The session will be facilitated by the therapeutic recreation staff on the unit.</description>
