  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SI-053 is a novel powder formulation containing temozolomide (TMZ), an alkylating&#xD;
      chemotherapy agent, in an excipient which forms a viscous gel upon reconstitution in water.&#xD;
      SI-053 will be used as an add-on to SoC for newly diagnosed GBM. SoC consists of maximal safe&#xD;
      resection followed by radiation therapy (RT) with concomitant TMZ and adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      with TMZ. For MGMT promoter methylated GBM, lomustine and TMZ may be administered plus&#xD;
      radiation therapy&#xD;

    <description>Single arm study. Dose escalation will follow a rule-based 3 + 3 design using increasing doses of SI-053. Subjects will receive a single i.c. dose of room-tempered SI-053 gel, which will be applied onto the walls of the cavity formed after tumor resection using a sterile spatula.This will be followed by chemo-radiotherapy commencing at least 21 and no later than 35 days after SI-053 administration. The dose escalation part of the trial will follow a rule-based 3 + 3 design using a total of six dose levels of SI-053 (optional dose of 50 mg will be used to de-escalate in case of DLT at 75 mg) that consist of increasing amounts of TMZ in a constant amount of excipient and sterile WFI. These dose levels are planned to be tested in 21 subjects, including three more subjects at preliminary RP2D.The dose expansion phase will enroll an additional six subjects,to be treated at the RP2D in order to gather additional safety and preliminary efficacy data at that dose.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Signed informed consent form (ICF) prior to the start of any trial-related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject age ≥ 18 years with an upper limit of 70 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. In the Investigator's opinion, subject is able and willing to comply with all trial&#xD;
             requirements for the duration of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Suspected primary, newly diagnosed supratentorial GBM (Grade IV glioma per WHO&#xD;
             guidelines) based on signs/symptoms and MRI (obtained maximally 10 days prior to&#xD;
             surgery, using the same MRI settings as will be used for post-surgery MRI; if the MRI&#xD;
             is older than 10 days or if it is taken at a local clinic, this has to be repeated&#xD;
             within 10 days before the surgery), needing maximum safe resection followed by&#xD;
             chemoradiotherapy as per institutional guidelines (Stupp protocol: radiotherapy [60 Gy&#xD;
             total; 10 Gy per week for 6 weeks] plus concomitant TMZ [75 mg/m2 of body surface area&#xD;
             per day; 7 days per week from first to the last day of radiotherapy], followed by six&#xD;
             cycles of adjuvant TMZ [150 to 200 mg/m2] once daily for 5 consecutive days, followed&#xD;
             by 23 days of no treatment prior to the next cycle; or CeTeG protocol for MGMT&#xD;
             promoter methylated GBMs: up to six courses of lomustine [100 mg/m2 on Day 1 plus TMZ&#xD;
             [100-200 mg/m2 per day on Days 2-6 of the 6-week course] in addition to radiotherapy&#xD;
             [59-60 Gy], if preferred by the investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Preliminary histological diagnosis of GBM by an intraoperative &quot;frozen section&quot;,&#xD;
             analyzed during surgery is mandatory before administration of SI-053. A final&#xD;
             diagnosis is made by histopathological and molecular analysis of the resected tumor&#xD;
             tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. It is the surgeon's estimation that maximum safe resection of the contrast enhancing&#xD;
             part of the tumor with image-guided surgery is possible and it is not expected that&#xD;
             the ventricular system will be opened during surgery. When the ventricular system is&#xD;
             opened during surgery, no SI-053 will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The tumor volume as assessed by pre-surgery MRI is at least 10 mL, and the actual&#xD;
             resection bed volume based on the surgeon's estimation after surgery enables complete&#xD;
             administration of a single dose of SI-053.&#xD;
