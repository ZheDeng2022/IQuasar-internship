      Purpose of the Proposed Project. The literature makes clear that poverty and financial&#xD;
      hardship and lack of social support are significant risk factors that create a household&#xD;
      environment conducive to Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs). The purpose of our project is&#xD;
      to reduce ACEs-related risk factors that threaten child wellbeing in the homes of low-income&#xD;
      families by maximizing Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) claims among populations of focus in&#xD;
      Bernalillo County, and disseminating successful strategies for risk-reduction throughout the&#xD;
      state. We will do this by integrating outreach and education regarding ACEs and EITC benefits&#xD;
      across our robust community-based initiatives, training programs, networks, and collaborators&#xD;
      that work with frontline health workers [Community Health Workers (CHWs) and Medical&#xD;
      Assistants (MAs)].&#xD;

      Goal. The goal of this project is to reduce risk factors and increase protective factors for&#xD;
      ACEs by measurably reducing household financial strain, financial insecurity, and economic&#xD;
      instability, and increasing social support for low-income populations of focus in Bernalillo&#xD;
      County (with an emphasis on designated Economic Opportunity Zones (EOZs) as required by the&#xD;
      award) by increasing EITC utilization. We will accomplish this using an innovative strategy&#xD;
      to mobilize frontline health workers to conduct EITC outreach, education, referral, and&#xD;
      support across our robust community-based initiatives, collaborations, networks, and training&#xD;
      programs, and to disseminate this model for increasing EITC utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives. This project has three objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Objective 1. By Y1, M12, increase capacity for EITC outreach and education among 28&#xD;
           core, established, multi-sectoral partner agencies by engaging them in the planning,&#xD;
           design, and implementation to 56 trainings for frontline health workers and staff as&#xD;
           measured by: A.) Improvement in scores on a pre/post test administered to 65 frontline&#xD;
           health workers and 25 partner agency staff before and after the training regarding&#xD;
           knowledge and understanding of ACEs-related risk and protective factors and EITC&#xD;
           benefits, eligibility, logistics, and referral. B.) Documented increase in the number of&#xD;
           times agency frontline health workers and staff use existing EITC materials from&#xD;
           national EITC campaigns or the Internal Revenue Service website or start to use the&#xD;
           tools following the training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objective 2. By Y3, M6, increase EITC utilization in Bernalillo County by a minimum of&#xD;
           5200 new EITC filed claims during the project implementation period by tax filers who&#xD;
           have not previously filed for EITC in the past 12 months by mobilizing our partners and&#xD;
           their 65 CHWs to conduct EITC education, outreach, screening and referral for free tax&#xD;
           preparation assistance (65 CHWs x 10 clients per quarter x 2 years), and co-sponsorship&#xD;
           of a minimum of 48 community outreach events reaching a minimum of 480 potential EITC&#xD;
           filers (48 events x 10 filers).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objective 3. By Y3, M12, using a rigorous evaluation of project activities and outcomes,&#xD;
           demonstrate a statistically significant change in ACEs risk/protective factors between&#xD;
           baseline and four months among a cohort of 200 EITC filers in order to demonstrate&#xD;
           evidence that mobilizing community agencies and frontline health workers is a strong&#xD;
           model for increasing EITC utilization: A.) Demonstrate a decrease in household financial&#xD;
           strain, financial insecurity, and household economic instability as measured by a change&#xD;
           in mean score of at least 0.77 on the In Charge Financial Distress/Financial Well-being&#xD;
           Scale (IFDFW). B.) Demonstrate an increase in informational social support as measured&#xD;
           by the informational support questions from the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support&#xD;
           Survey (MOS-SSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome and Impact. The outcome of this project will be to create a cadre of trained&#xD;
      frontline health workers and community agencies with the knowledge and capacity to provide&#xD;
      EITC outreach, information, screening, and referrals to low-income clients to increase&#xD;
      utilization of EITC in New Mexico. The anticipated impact of this effort will be that more&#xD;
      New Mexicans will file EITC claims and the funds they receive will help to ameliorate the&#xD;
      stress of financial hardship and reduce poverty. Furthermore, the experience of working with&#xD;
      the frontline health worker will increase social support and utilization of EITC, both of&#xD;
      which will reduce negative social determinants of health and risk factors for ACEs and&#xD;
      increase preventive factors for ACEs of children who live in some of the most at-risk homes,&#xD;
      improving the wellbeing of these children today and creating a foundation for them to have&#xD;
      healthier lives as adults.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The proposed intervention will have five components:&#xD;
We will conduct trainings for our partner agencies and their frontline health workers to increase knowledge and understanding of: 1.) Risk/protective factors for ACEs and 2.) Eligibility criteria and filing requirements and procedures for EITC.&#xD;
Working with our partners, we will also conduct EITC educational outreach and information sessions targeted to potential EITC filers.&#xD;
We will track program level EITC data regarding screening and assistance provided to clients by CHWs in our network and the number of clients who submit EITC claims and the amounts received.&#xD;
We will conduct a pre/post survey with clients who submit EITC claims to determine whether EITC reduces risk factors and increases protective factors for ACEs.&#xD;
We will disseminate this model throughout the state.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Our partners will screen and refer a minimum of 5200 clients (65 CHWs x 10 clients per quarter x 2 years) for EITC. Our evaluation team will track the number of individuals screened, the number found to be eligible/not eligible, the number referred out and to which free tax prep service, and if available, the number who use the free tax prep service, the number who file a tax claim for EITC, the number who receive EITC benefits, and the amount of the benefit.&#xD;
We will conduct community-level EIT outreach by integrating EITC outreach and education into planned community events in the neighborhoods and service areas of our partners. The events will provide information about the EITC to the public. We will have a minimum of 48 events to reach a minimum of 480 potential filers (48 events x 10 participants each).</description>

    <intervention_name>Assistance with EITC</intervention_name>
    <description>We will conduct a statistical analysis of the impact of EITC funds on ACEs risk and protective factors in the lives of EITC benefit recipients. Project CHW team members will invite 200 clients who qualify to receive EITC benefits to participate in the study using an approved recruitment script. With those who agree to participate, the CHW team member will obtain consent and administer a baseline survey. A post-survey will be administered at 4 months.&#xD;
In addition, we will gather qualitative data to help us understand impacts of this project. The post-survey will contain an open/qualitative response question asking participants to describe how the EITC benefit impacted them, how they felt when they received it, how important it was, and what they did with the funds. In Y2, the Research Team will conduct interviews with a subset of 20 clients who participated in the pre/post survey.</description>
