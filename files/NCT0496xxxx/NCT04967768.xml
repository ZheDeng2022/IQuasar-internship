  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orthopedic residents, like all other healthcare professionals, face unique challenges during&#xD;
      the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The rapid spread of COVID-19 has forced healthcare&#xD;
      systems around the world to adapt. As in many other specialties, it has led to many changes&#xD;
      in the training of orthopedic residents including restructuring of surgical training, a&#xD;
      reduction in elective surgery cases, and re-assignment of residents to COVID-19-related&#xD;
      clinical duties. As a result, the standard training curriculum has been interrupted and the&#xD;
      number of surgical cases has decreased, limiting the ability of the residents to meet the&#xD;
      range and number of patient follow-up and treatment requirements set by the Turkish&#xD;
      Orthopedics and Traumatology Education Council (TOTEK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The already stressful work environment of orthopedic residents has become more stressful and&#xD;
      anxious with the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no well-designed survey studies that have shown the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic&#xD;
      on orthopedic resident education and well-being from the resident's perspective. Therefore,&#xD;
      the purpose of this nationwide survey study was to document and analyze the effects of the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic on the real-life experiences of orthopedic residents in Turkey.&#xD;
