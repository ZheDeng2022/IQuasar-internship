      Randomized Clinical Trial in rugby sports club in Lahore. A Sample size of 26 is calculated&#xD;
      using epitol.Group A: Sports specific training Treatments will be provided in 30 mins per&#xD;
      week for 3 consecutive weeks. Weight programs include closed chain exercises (squats,&#xD;
      pushups) and open chain exercises (leg press, chest fly using dumbbell) Stretch shortening&#xD;
      cycle (enhances performance through storage of elastic energy during eccentric phase and&#xD;
      activation of stretch reflex).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: neuromuscular training Treatments will be provided in 30 mins per week for 3&#xD;
      consecutive weeks Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF)&#xD;

      Rugby require constant pace changes that generates high musculoskeletal demand in rugby one&#xD;
      of the commonly affected area is low back pain that can affect player performance and can be&#xD;
      accelerated by injury, health and lifestyle factors and possibly by joint pain or&#xD;
      musculoskeletal disorders. Data will be collected from players in registered rugby clubs of&#xD;
      district Lahore. Informed consents will be taken from all participants with the knowledge of&#xD;
      aims and procedure. The results of this study will help to improve treatment protocols&#xD;
      options for players how it affects the rehab process and how it affects the movement and pain&#xD;
      how it affects the rehab process and how the pain restricts movements among rugby players.&#xD;
      This study will be based on a randomized clinical trial used to study the different level of&#xD;
      effectiveness of sports specific training versus neuromuscular training on dynamic balance&#xD;
      mobility, flexibility in field rugby players. Subjects with low back pain meeting the&#xD;
      predetermined inclusion &amp; exclusion criteria will be divided into two groups by randomization&#xD;
      to avoid any plagiarism. Dynamic Balance, measured with Star Excursion Balance Test; Active&#xD;
      Range of Motion (ROM), using a manual goniometer and Lumbar Flexibility, assessed with&#xD;
      Fingertip-to-floor test will be used for data collection. Subjects in one group will be&#xD;
      treated with Bilateral stretches, contract-relax PNF stretching training and other will be&#xD;
      treated with weight training, aerobic exercises. Each subject will receive a total four weeks&#xD;
      treatment session, thirty minutes sessions will be performed once a week for three weeks.&#xD;
      Three evaluations will be performed once before treatment One week after treatment and four&#xD;
      week post treatment follow-ups. Sample size 26 each group contains 13 participants. All&#xD;
      statistical analysis will be performed with spss16.0.&#xD;

    <description>The test originally incorporated reaching in eight directions while standing on each foot. the 8 different directions are following: anterior, anteromedial, medial, posteromedial, posterior, posterolateral, lateral and anterolateral.&#xD;
SEBT performance scores using the following simple equations:&#xD;
Average distance in each direction (cm) = Reach 1 + Reach 2 + Reach 3 / 3&#xD;
Relative (normalised) distance in each direction (%) = Average distance in each direction / leg length * 100</description>

    <description>The patient is asked to bend forward and attempt to reach for the floor with their fingertips. The physical therapist then measures the distance between the patient's right long finger and the floor using a standard measuring tape.&#xD;
Mean fingertip- to-floor test was 21.5 21.7cm (range, 0-48cm) for men and 19.6 22cm (range, 0-50cm) for women</description>
