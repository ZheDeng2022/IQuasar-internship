      The objective of the study is to collect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from&#xD;
      healthy volunteers for the research and production of UCAR T cells used for Clinical trails.&#xD;

      The study is a single-center study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening period: All volunteers are required to sign a written informed consent form&#xD;
           for the study; after the signing of informed consent form, the demographic data and&#xD;
           medical history of the volunteers will be collected, and physical examinations and local&#xD;
           laboratory tests will be performed to assess the eligibility of the volunteers.&#xD;
           Volunteers who meet all the inclusion criteria and do not meet any exclusion criteria&#xD;
           will receive peripheral venous whole blood sampling, and the volunteers receiving&#xD;
           apheresis based on the assessment results will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Apheresis period: 25 volunteers who meet the inclusion criteria will undergo collection&#xD;
           of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by means of apheresis.&#xD;
