    <textblock>
      Breast surgery, which includes mastectomy, breast reconstructive surgery, or lumpectomies&#xD;
      with sentinel node biopsies, may lead to the development of chronic pain and long-term opioid&#xD;
      use. In the era of an opioid crisis, it is important to risk-stratify this surgical&#xD;
      population for risk of these outcomes in an effort to personalize pain management. The opioid&#xD;
      epidemic in the United States resulted in more than 40,000 deaths in 2016, 40% of which&#xD;
      involved prescription opioids. Furthermore, it is estimated that 2 million patients become&#xD;
      opioid-dependent after elective, outpatient surgery each year. After major breast surgery,&#xD;
      chronic pain has been reported to develop anywhere between 35% - 62% of patients, while about&#xD;
      10% use long-term opioids. Precision medicine is a concept at which medical management is&#xD;
      tailored to an individual patient based on a specific patient's characteristics, including&#xD;
      social, demographic, medical, genetic, and molecular/cellular data. With a plethora of data&#xD;
      specific to millions of patients, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) modalities to&#xD;
      analyze big data in order to implement precision medicine is crucial. We propose to&#xD;
      prospectively collect rich data from patients undergoing various breast surgeries in order to&#xD;
      develop predictive models using AI modalities to predict patients at-risk for chronic pain&#xD;
      and opioid use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this is to develop predictive models using artificial intelligence&#xD;
      algorithms to predict acute and chronic pain and opioid use in patients undergoing breast&#xD;
      surgery. Development of these models will involve prospectively collecting data from this&#xD;
      surgical population, including: 1) survey results from the Brief Pain Inventory, Fibromyalgia&#xD;
      Survey Criteria, and PROMIS scales (depression scale, anxiety scale, physical function scale,&#xD;
      fatigue scale, sleep disturbance scale); 2) pharmacogenomics (single nucleotide peptides from&#xD;
      COMT, BDNF, SCN11a, OPRM1, ABCB1, CYPD26, and CYP34A, to name a few); 3) preoperative&#xD;
      comorbidities (including but not limited to diabetes mellitus, chronic pain, psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders, substance abuse history, obstructive sleep apnea, etc); 4) preoperative labs (i.e.&#xD;
      hemoglobin); 5) demographic data (i.e. socioeconomic status, religion, ethnicity; primary&#xD;
      language spoken, age, body mass index, sex, etc); 6) preoperative medication use; 7) primary&#xD;
      surgical diagnosis; 8) surgery; and 9) social support system. Intraoperative data will&#xD;
      include: 1) primary anesthetic type; 2) case duration; 3) total opioid use; 4) non-opioid&#xD;
      analgesic use; 5) heart rate hemodynamics; and 6) blood pressure hemodynamics. Postoperative&#xD;
      data will include: 1) total opioid use; 2) discharge medications; 3) hospital length of stay;&#xD;
      4) pain scores; 5) postoperative vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate); and 6)&#xD;
      participation with physical therapy. The primary outcome measures will be opioid use in the&#xD;
      acute period and chronic postoperative stage (30 and 90 days and 6 months) and development of&#xD;
      chronic pain (up to 6 months after surgery). The model with the best performance will be used&#xD;
      to develop a predictive analytic system aimed to identify high risk opioid patients in order&#xD;
      to allocate expert pain management resources to those patients. We hypothesize that we can&#xD;
      develop an accurate model for identifying high risk opioid users and patients at-risk for&#xD;
      chronic pain in these surgical populations and subsequently implement a predictive analytic&#xD;
      system that can detect these patients early-on.&#xD;
