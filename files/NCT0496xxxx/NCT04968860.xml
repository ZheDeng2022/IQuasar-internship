    <textblock>
      Among the different types of cancer that most affect children, leukemia is the principal. One&#xD;
      of the main treatments for leukemia is chemotherapy. Among the most common side effects of&#xD;
      chemotherapy are nausea and/or vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, alopecia, neuropathy,&#xD;
      opportunistic infections, and oral mucositis. It is still necessary to establish which&#xD;
      microorganisms are predominant in the oral microbiota of children with leukemia, which&#xD;
      factors influence it, what is its relationship with oral mucositis and what is their impact&#xD;
      in the quality of life. To better understand the risks of secondary infection, it is&#xD;
      important to develop preventive and/or therapeutic strategies to control the side effects of&#xD;
      antineoplastic treatment in the mouth that may negatively impact the quality of life, to&#xD;
      expose the risk of death as well as raise hospital costs for the care of children with&#xD;
      leukemia. Objective: To identify the clinical characteristics of the oral condition, types of&#xD;
      microorganisms of the oral microbiota, and quality of life in children/adolescents with acute&#xD;
      lymphoid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia before and during antineoplastic treatment, and&#xD;
      compare them with healthy children/adolescent individuals. Methodology: Longitudinal,&#xD;
      case-control study, with a convenience sample. The study group, composed of&#xD;
      children/adolescent individuals who have a definitive diagnosis of acute lymphoid leukemia or&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia. The control group, non-syndromic children/adolescents, with no&#xD;
      history of cancer, matched by age and gender. The clinical condition of the mouth will be&#xD;
      evaluated by means of indexes: dental caries index (dmft index), gingival index (GA), and&#xD;
      simplified oral hygiene index. The assessment of the quality of life through the ohip-14 and&#xD;
      POS-version14 quality of life questionnaire and microbiological evaluation of saliva through&#xD;
      MALDI-TOF analysis. Statistical analysis will be performed through relative risk for cohort&#xD;
      study with more than three paired groups. Odds ratio, for the control group more than three&#xD;
      controlled groups and Mcnemere, for comparison with the control group, for more than three&#xD;
      paired groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In children, non-communicable diseases such as cancer are increasing every year. It became a&#xD;
      priority on the global child health agenda. Each year, there were an estimated 30.000 new&#xD;
      cases of cancer in children/adolescent individuals. In Brazil, between 2018-2019, there were&#xD;
      12.500 new cases of cancer in children and adolescents up to 19 years of age. The mortality&#xD;
      rate was 7.917 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the types of cancer that most affect children, leukemia is the most prevalent. In 2018,&#xD;
      there was a forecast of 437.033 new cases of leukemia with a mortality of 309.006 individuals&#xD;
      around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the main treatments for leukemia is chemotherapy, the side effects can affect&#xD;
      different parts of the body that may present since the beginning of the treatment.&#xD;
      Chemotherapy produces systemic toxicity resulting in anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia&#xD;
      that is more intense in the treatment of oncohematological diseases when compared to solid&#xD;
      tumors. Among the most common side effects of chemotherapy are included nausea and/or&#xD;
      vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, alopecia, neuropathy, opportunistic infections, and oral&#xD;
      mucositis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies reported that the intensity of oral mucositis, as well as the risk of sepsis&#xD;
      from secondary infection in the mouth of individuals with cancer, they can be influenced by&#xD;
      some specific microorganisms present in the oral cavity. Factors such as oral hygiene,&#xD;
      presence of dental caries, and periodontal disease may be related to the type of&#xD;
      microorganisms present in the oral cavity. There is a lack of studies about microbiota oral&#xD;
      in leukemic children. Oral microbiota in children with leukemia is predominantly composed of&#xD;
      gram-positive microorganisms such as Streptococus viridans, Streptococous mutans and&#xD;
      Lactobacillus when compared to adults oral microbiota where gram-negatives microorganisms&#xD;
      such as Klebsiella spp., E coli, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas spp. predominate. It is noteworthy&#xD;
      that it is necessary to establish what kind of microorganisms are predominant in the oral&#xD;
      microbiota of children with leukemia, also which factors influence it, and what is the&#xD;
      relationship among the oral mucositis, general clinical status, and quality of life of the&#xD;
      children/adolescent with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it is important to identify the risks of secondary infection in oral cavity, to be&#xD;
      able to develop preventive and/or therapeutic strategies to control the side effects of&#xD;
      antineoplastic treatment in the mouth that can negatively impact the quality of life, expose&#xD;
      the risk of death as well as raise hospital costs for the care of children with leukemia.&#xD;
