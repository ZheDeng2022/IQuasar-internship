      INTRODUCTION: After stroke, perceptual impairments, such as negative body perception,&#xD;
      contribute to social isolation and depression. In the subacute poststroke phase, art therapy&#xD;
      is effective in improving depression, self-esteem, and community integration. Yet, no study&#xD;
      has explored the effectiveness of art therapy at the chronic stage of a stroke; where motor&#xD;
      recovery is slowed, and body image and self-esteem are deeply challenged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: Primary; to assess the feasibility of an art therapy program (ATP) in the chronic&#xD;
      phase of stroke. Secondary; to explore the effects of ATP on perceptual impairment (body&#xD;
      image/self-esteem), mood and community integration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD: Nine adults (stroke ≥6 months) will participate in the ATP consisting of a thematic&#xD;
      group visit to the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts followed by an art workshop, supervised by an&#xD;
      art therapist (7 visits over 4 months). Feasibility will be evaluated by triangulating data&#xD;
      from interviews and subject assessment questionnaires and by assessing retention and&#xD;
      attendance. The effects of the ATP will be assessed by changes in perceptual and mood&#xD;
      impairment questionnaires (Body Image States, Self-Esteem scales, Beck Depression&#xD;
      Inventory-Short-Form) and community integration questionnaire (The Community Integration&#xD;
      Questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS AND OUTCOMES: The project will confirm the feasibility of ATP to improve&#xD;
      perceptual impairment and community integration post-stroke.&#xD;

    <description>Beck Depression Abbreviated Inventory : The scale comprises 13 items scored on a 4-point continuum scale (0 = least, 3 = most), with a total summed score ranging from 0 to 39. Higher scores correspond to greater depressive severity</description>

    <description>Body Image States Scale: This 6-item questionnaire assesses, among other things, the persons dissatisfaction or satisfaction (from extremely dissatisfied with to extremely satisfied with) their physical appearance, body size, body shape and weight. The measure is the composite mean of the six 9-point items whereas low scores reflect more negative body image states and high scores reflect more positive states</description>

    <description>Community Integration Questionnaire: It is a 15-item questionnaire that aims to identify participants' level of integration into home, family life, social activity, and productive activity. The overall score, which represents a summation of the scores from individual questions, ranges from 0 to 29 whereas a higher score indicates greater integration, and a lower score reflects less integration.</description>
