      Anaesthetic depth and complications after major surgery: an international, randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial - The BALANCED trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this large, international, randomised controlled trial that enrolled patients aged 60&#xD;
      years and over with significant comorbidity and at increased risk of complications after&#xD;
      major surgery, we found no evidence that light general anaesthesia (bispectral index 50) was&#xD;
      superior to deep general anaesthesia (bispectral index 35) in reducing 1-year mortality. The&#xD;
      BALANCED long term follow up study will look at whether depth of anesthesia affects long term&#xD;
      (beyond 1 year) survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that targetting BIS 50 will result in superior long term survival&#xD;
      compared to targetting BIS 35.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two secondary hypotheses are that BIS titration to BIS 50 will&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. reduce local cancer recurrence or metastatic spread and consequently improve long-term&#xD;
           survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. reduce postoperative delirium and associated cognitive impairment and consequently&#xD;
           improve long-term survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both these mechanisms would be expected to take longer to manifest as reduced survival than&#xD;
      1-year all-cause mortality primary outcome in the Balanced trial. Trials of cancer outcomes&#xD;
      often use 5-year survival or similar timeframes to determine evidence of clinical benefit. A&#xD;
      steeper cognitive trajectory due to intermediate outcomes such as delirium and cognitive&#xD;
      impairment may take longer than 1 year to produce a clinically important difference in&#xD;
      survival 30. The 10.6% relative risk reduction seen in the Balanced trial could translate to&#xD;
      a statistically and clinically meaningful survival difference in this high-risk population.&#xD;
      This population may have 5-year survival of ~80% translating to an absolute survival&#xD;
      difference of ~2% potentially (if the ~10% RRR is maintained beyond 1 year). The alternative&#xD;
      is that there is no long-term mortality difference which would provide continuing clinical&#xD;
      guidance of the safety of current practice in patients who are not at high risk of delirium.&#xD;
      This study could provide a rationale for trials in larger populations (such as the total&#xD;
      Balanced trial population) or targeted subgroups such as cancer and delirium to provide&#xD;
      further mechanistic insights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term survival is an important patient-centred outcome. The mechanisms described above&#xD;
      may manifest in longer-term outcomes providing a clear rationale for the current trial.&#xD;

        Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be the same as the Balanced trial with participants&#xD;
        limited to those sites described above. Survival data will be censored at date of accessing&#xD;
        mortality database.&#xD;

        Exclusion The intention-to-treat (ITT) population is defined as all randomised participants&#xD;
        who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria who had surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The per-protocol (PP) population is defined as all randomised participants in the study who&#xD;
        meet all the inclusion/exclusion criteria for BALANCED with BIS group classified according&#xD;
        to the actual median BIS value achieved irrespective of randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants were allocated to the BIS=50 group if the achieved median BIS is between 45&#xD;
        and 55 inclusive, and to the BIS=35 group if the achieved median BIS is between 30 and 40&#xD;
        inclusive. Participants who are not within these ranges will be excluded from these&#xD;
        analyses.&#xD;
