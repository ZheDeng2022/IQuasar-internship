  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In outpatient hand surgery, 40% of patients report moderate to severe pain within 24 hours of&#xD;
      the operation. Effective pain management is therefore essential to ensure a comfortable and&#xD;
      safe return home for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loco-regional anesthesia is the optimal method of analgesia for complex hand surgery. It&#xD;
      involves the injection of a local anesthetic (LA) near the nerves responsible for the&#xD;
      sensitivity of the arm. Following a single injection of long-acting local anesthetic, the&#xD;
      maximum duration of analgesia is limited to approximately 13 hours, with great variability&#xD;
      between individuals. In order to provide pain relief over a longer period of time, placing&#xD;
      catheters near nerves has become a routine practice at the CHUM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infraclavicular nerve block is one of the most widely used loco-regional anesthesia&#xD;
      techniques for hand surgery. This block can be achieved either by paracoracoid (PC) or&#xD;
      costoclavicular (CC) approach. Both approaches are currently used at the CHUM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PC approach involves inserting a needle under the lower rim of the clavicle below the&#xD;
      coracoid process. This approach makes it possible to reach the 3 different nerve bundles,&#xD;
      located around the axillary artery, which are involved in the sensitivity of the hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CC approach, more recently described, proposes an insertion of the needle under the lower&#xD;
      edge of the clavicle but in a lateral way to the axillary artery which makes it possible to&#xD;
      reach the nerves at a place where the 3 main nerve bundles are still joined together. The&#xD;
      clustering of nerve structures at the injection site may facilitate the spread of local&#xD;
      anesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have demonstrated that the CC approach requires a smaller volume compared to&#xD;
      the PC approach to achieve perineural blockade. The effective dose 90 (ED90) for the CC&#xD;
      approach was 19 mL while it is 31 mL for the PC approach. This is explained by the greater&#xD;
      proximity between the three nerve bundles targeted in the CC approach and a lower prevalence&#xD;
      of anatomical variations at this level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, studies on the subject are rare and do not allow conclusions to be drawn on the&#xD;
      superiority of either approach.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether the costoclavicular approach (CC) provides a&#xD;
      better sensory block 48 hours after catheter installation than the infraclavicular block&#xD;
      performed by the paracoracoid approach (PC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of continuous perineural blocks performed on an outpatient basis, LAs are&#xD;
      delivered after insertion of a catheter by a low flow elastomeric pump (maximum 5 mL/h).&#xD;
      Considering that the nerve structures are closer to each other with the CC approach, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that with the same mode of administration, the efficacy of the&#xD;
      continuous block at 48 h obtained by the CC approach will be greater than the block produced&#xD;
      by the PC approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients scheduled to undergo an upper limb surgery requiring a continuous infraclavicular&#xD;
      nerve block will be contacted by a member of the research team before surgery to receive&#xD;
      information regarding the study and obtain informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining consent, participants will be randomly assigned to two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Placement of an infraclavicular perineural catheter by paracoracoid approach; Group&#xD;
      B: Placement of an infraclavicular perineural catheter using a costoclavicular approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only the anesthesiologist performing the technique and his assistant will know the group to&#xD;
      which the patient has been assigned. The blocks will be carried out in a standardized manner&#xD;
      and in accordance with the establishment's procedures. After bringing the patient to the&#xD;
      induction room and installing the recommended monitoring equipment, the anesthesiologist will&#xD;
      administer an intravenous premedication. The patient will be installed in a supine position.&#xD;
      After disinfecting the skin, the anesthesiologist will inject a small amount of local&#xD;
      anesthetic to numb the skin in the area where the block will be performed and then locate the&#xD;
      nerve bundles under ultrasound guidance using the approach to which the patient has been&#xD;
      assigned (Group A or B). When the area has been located, the injection of a local anesthetic&#xD;
      (bupivacaine) will be performed and the catheter installed and fixed. Multimodal analgesia&#xD;
      will be used for postoperative pain relief including acetaminophen, non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs and hydromorphone as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty minutes after the catheter insertion, a sensory-motor assessment of the blocked&#xD;
      territory will be performed. During surgery, the patient may be sedated or receive general&#xD;
      anesthesia at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. The surgery will be performed according&#xD;
      to the usual procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In day-care surgery, a disposable elastomeric pump will be installed to ensure the perineural&#xD;
      infusion of LA. The patient will receive the usual information about postoperative analgesia&#xD;
      and the use of the pump. Follow-up details will be reviewed with the patient prior to&#xD;
      discharge from hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up teleconsultation will be made the day after surgery and two days after surgery.&#xD;
      As part of these calls, the following items will be assessed: sensory level and motor&#xD;
      function of the forearm, level of pain and opioid use, presence of side effects, quality of&#xD;
      sleep and satisfaction towards the analgesic technique used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will benefit from a daily follow-up call by nurses from the Acute Pain Service&#xD;
      (APS) for up to 72 hours. In the absence of adverse effects, catheters will be removed by&#xD;
      patients 72 hours after surgery.&#xD;
