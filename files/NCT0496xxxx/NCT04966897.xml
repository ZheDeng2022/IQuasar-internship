      without PERT (&quot;PERT-free&quot;), nutritional supplement for blood lipid levels, safety and&#xD;

      This is a single center, randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial (with a follow-on&#xD;
      single-blind safety evaluation stage), assessing a ready-to-drink nutritional supplement used&#xD;
      without PERT (&quot;PERT-free&quot;), nutritional supplement for blood lipid levels, safety and&#xD;
      tolerability compared to a standard of care nutritional supplement used concomitantly with&#xD;
      PERT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that the PERT-free nutritional supplement will be equivalent to, or&#xD;
      superior to, a standardized nutritional shake with regard to fat absorption, as indicated by&#xD;
      blood lipid (triglyceride) levels while maintaining tolerability and safety without the use&#xD;
      of PERT. The objective is to evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a &quot;PERT-free&quot;&#xD;
      nutritional shake compared to a standard nutritional shake used concomitantly with PERT.&#xD;
      Measurements include components of a standard lipid blood panel (triglycerides, cholesterol,&#xD;
      HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and VLDL cholesterol), absorption of fat-soluble vitamins&#xD;
      (vitamin D) and symptoms associated with EPI. Other objectives include evaluating&#xD;
      palatability and patients' impressions of the products.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Single center, randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial with a single blind stage evaluation assessing the GBNS for safety, tolerability and blood lipid levels compared to a standard nutritional supplement with PERT. Phase 1: After an overnight fast, subjects in Arm 1 administered PERT placebo with the GBNS and those in Arm 2 will be administered standard nutritional supplement with PERT. Blood samples collected at baseline and hourly over 6 hours for all subjects. Subjects will return for crossover treatment no fewer than 4 days and no more than 14 days after with the same steps as the above but with patients switching treatment arms. Phase 2: Starting the day following the 2nd treatment the 6 day, single-blind safety stage begins with subjects randomized to GBNS with PERT-placebo or the standard nutritional supplement with PERT. One week after the end of the Home Trial (+/- 3 days) patients will return for an end of study visit.</intervention_model_description>

MAGs are readily absorbed by enterocytes without the need of digestion by pancreatic lipases. The &quot;MAG oil&quot; is produced enzymatically from almond oil. The product also contains essential amino acids, carbohydrates as simple sugars and fat-soluble vitamins and minerals.
