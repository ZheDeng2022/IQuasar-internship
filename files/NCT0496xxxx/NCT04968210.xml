  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disease in which clinically relevant&#xD;
      symptoms present a few years after the onset in rise of pulmonary arterial pressure.&#xD;
      Increased PA pressure presents an overload on the right ventricle (RV), with RV failure being&#xD;
      a common cause of mortality in PAH. Current therapeutic targets help reduce vascular&#xD;
      resistance and RV afterload, however, RV dysfunction may continue to progress. Therefore, the&#xD;
      reason for RV failure in PAH cannot be contributed to altered vascular hemodynamics alone but&#xD;
      may be related to metabolic alterations and failure of adaptive mechanisms in the RV.&#xD;
      Providing a better understanding of metabolic remodeling in RV failure may permit the&#xD;
      development of RV-targeted pharmacological agents to maintain RV function despite increased&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular pressures. This study will evaluate how cardiac metabolism changes in&#xD;
      response to pulmonary vasodilator therapy in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PAH is a silent progressive disease of the pulmonary vasculature that often presents&#xD;
      clinically later in the course of disease. Symptoms, including severe shortness of breath,&#xD;
      present on average 2 years post onset as pulmonary arterial pressures rise due to elevated&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Elevated PVR causes right ventricular (RV) overload,&#xD;
      metabolic shifts and myocardial remodeling resulting in impaired RV contractility,&#xD;
      dysfunction, and subsequent RV failure. Right heart failure is a common cause of death in&#xD;
      patients with PAH. Currently, all therapies for PAH target the pulmonary vasculature by&#xD;
      improving pulmonary vasodilation and reducing vascular resistance. There is limited direct&#xD;
      effect on the myocardium, although RV function generally improves with reduced afterload.&#xD;
      However, despite reduction in PVR with vasodilators, the resting RV dysfunction may&#xD;
      ultimately progress in patients with PAH. Thus, the reason for RV failure cannot be&#xD;
      completely attributed to the changes in pulmonary vascular hemodynamics but may also be&#xD;
      related to metabolic shifts and failure of compensatory mechanisms in the RV. A better&#xD;
      understanding of how the RV myocardium remodels in RV failure from PAH and in response to&#xD;
      pulmonary vasodilator therapy may allow for development of RV-targeted therapies to maintain&#xD;
      RV function despite continually elevated afterload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are very few existing techniques to study cardiac metabolism in vivo.&#xD;
      Nuclear medicine techniques (i.e., Positron Emission Tomography, PET, and Single Photon&#xD;
      Emission Computer Tomography, SPECT) are limited in that they utilize radiolabeled tracers&#xD;
      which cannot distinguish the tracer and its metabolic products and expose patients to&#xD;
      ionizing radiation. Hyperpolarized (HP) magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) of&#xD;
      13C-labeled species enables large-scale determination of cellular metabolism linked to&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms of disease without the use of ionizing radiation, and&#xD;
      represents a unique and novel method to image real time in vivo cardiac metabolic substrate&#xD;
      utilization coupled to cardiac function. Currently, the canonical HP compound utilized is&#xD;
      13C-pyruvate. The short-lived, non-radioactive, HP 13C-pyruvate metabolites are biologically&#xD;
      analogous to their endogenous analogues and can reveal enzymatic activity (e.g., lactate&#xD;
      dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase) before and after interventions that are not readily&#xD;
      answered by PET or any other imaging method. Importantly, HP MRSI has the potential to reveal&#xD;
      metabolic mechanisms associated with cardiac disease states, understand the relationship of&#xD;
      metabolism with contractile function, and may be a biomarker for determining therapeutic&#xD;
      efficacy. These techniques will enable robust imaging of cardiac metabolism with quantitative&#xD;
      measures derived from both the RV and LV. Measurement of downstream products of pyruvate&#xD;
      metabolism, including lactate, alanine, and bicarbonate, will allow for real time activity&#xD;
      assessment of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), pyruvate&#xD;
      dehydrogenase (PDH), respectively. The measurement of these downstream products of&#xD;
      metabolism; namely, bicarbonate and lactate, will permit the assessment of the relative&#xD;
      contribution of oxidative metabolism and glycolysis. Since the imaging is performed on a&#xD;
      clinical MRI system, metabolism can be studied simultaneously with classic parameters of&#xD;
      cardiac function.&#xD;
