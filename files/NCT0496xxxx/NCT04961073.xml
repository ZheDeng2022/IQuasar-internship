  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hong Kong is facing an increasing threat of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which is&#xD;
      compounded by population aging. In 2016, 25,771 registered deaths (approximately 55%) were&#xD;
      attributed to NCDs. In addition, NCDs caused 104,600 potential years of life lost before 70&#xD;
      years of age. WHO has identified four major behavioral risk factors - tobacco use, harmful&#xD;
      use of alcohol, an unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity - that contribute substantially to&#xD;
      NCDs and can increase the risk of death. Most premature deaths from NCDs are preventable via&#xD;
      lifestyle modification. Therefore, helping people adopting healthy lifestyle practices, such&#xD;
      as having a balanced diet and engaging in irregular physical activity, and quitting&#xD;
      health-risk behaviors, such as smoking and harmful use of alcohol can help prevent NCDs and&#xD;
      improve the quality of life and overall health of the population. However, many people are&#xD;
      unmotivated or find it difficult to modify their risk behaviors, despite their awareness of&#xD;
      the associated health hazards.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes and&#xD;
      chronic respiratory diseases, are the most common and preventable causes of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality both globally and locally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 41&#xD;
      million (71%) of the 57.7 million global deaths each year are attributed to NCDs. NCDs are&#xD;
      often associated with older age groups, but evidence shows that more than 15 million of all&#xD;
      deaths attributed to NCDs occur between the ages of 30 and 69 years. The total number of&#xD;
      annual deaths of NCDs will further increase to 55 million by 2030 unless urgent preventive&#xD;
      measures are taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hong Kong is facing an increasing threat of NCDs, which is compounded by population ageing.&#xD;
      In 2016, 25,771 registered deaths (approximately 55%) were attributed to NCDs. In addition,&#xD;
      NCDs caused 104,600 potential years of life lost before 70 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHO has identified four major behavioural risk factors - tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol,&#xD;
      an unhealthy diet and physical inactivity - that contribute substantially to NCDs and can&#xD;
      increase the risk of death. Most premature deaths from NCDs are preventable via lifestyle&#xD;
      modification. Therefore, helping people adopting healthy lifestyle practices, such as having&#xD;
      a balanced diet and engaging in regular physical activity, and quitting health-risk&#xD;
      behaviours, such as smoking and harmful use of alcohol can help prevent NCDs and improve&#xD;
      quality of life and the overall health of the population. However, many people are&#xD;
      unmotivated or find it difficult to modify their risk behaviours, despite their awareness of&#xD;
      the associated health hazards. Our previous studies showed that many smokers continued to&#xD;
      smoke even after receiving a diagnosis of cancer, diabetes or cardiovascular disease. In&#xD;
      addition, health risk behaviours co-occur in clusters and that many people exhibit multiple&#xD;
      risk behaviours. A sample of 16,818 adults from the 1998 US National Health Interview Survey&#xD;
      revealed that 52% had two or more risk behaviours, including physical inactivity, overweight,&#xD;
      cigarette smoking and risky drinking. Our previous study in Hong Kong also found associations&#xD;
      between smoking and physical inactivity, an unhealthy diet and alcohol consumption. People&#xD;
      with multiple health risk behaviours are usually associated with a higher increased risk of&#xD;
      NCDs and face more challenges in the adoption of a healthy lifestyle than those with a single&#xD;
      health risk behaviour. A review of the literature reveals that most interventions have been&#xD;
      developed and evaluated targeted at people with single risk behaviour rather than multiple&#xD;
      risk behaviours. It is crucial therefore to develop and evaluate appropriate interventions&#xD;
      that targeting people with multiple risk behaviours with the aim to help them quit&#xD;
      health-risk behaviours and adopt a healthy lifestyle, either sequentially or concurrently.&#xD;
      First, however, a thorough understanding of the clustering of multiple health risk behaviours&#xD;
      and the factors associated with such behaviours are crucial before any appropriate&#xD;
      interventions can be developed and evaluated. The aim of the study is to investigate the&#xD;
      prevalence of multiple risk behaviours and their association with health consequences among&#xD;
      people aged 30 years or above. The objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the clustering patterns of multiple health risk behaviours;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify factors associated with multiple risk behaviours; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To find out the association between risk behaviours and non-communicable diseases.&#xD;
