  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, 2-arm study to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy in 12 weeks of FMX101 minocycline foam, 4%, compared to vehicle, in&#xD;
      the treatment of subjects with moderate to severe facial acne vulgaris.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Qualified subjects will be randomized to receive 1 of the following 2 treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FMX101 4% minocycline foam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vehicle foam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with qualifying lesion counts and Investigator's Global Assessments (IGA) of acne&#xD;
      severity scores and will be assigned to 1 of 2 treatments according to the randomization&#xD;
      schedule. Subjects will apply the assigned study drug topically once daily for 12 weeks as&#xD;
      directed. Subjects will be advised to apply the study drug at approximately the same time&#xD;
      each day, preferably in the evening at bedtime. Both the Investigator and subject will be&#xD;
      blinded to the study drug identity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return for visits at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12. At the discretion of the&#xD;
      clinic staff, for the convenience of subjects or clinic staff, visits can be scheduled to&#xD;
      occur 2 days before or after the nominal schedule date for the Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12&#xD;
      visits. Efficacy evaluations (acne lesion counts and IGAs) will be performed at each visit&#xD;
      during the study.&#xD;
