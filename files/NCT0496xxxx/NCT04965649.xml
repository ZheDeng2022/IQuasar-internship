      The aim of this project is to test whether low levels of BcrAbl1, despite the presence of&#xD;
      resistance mutations, are related to high levels of innate CD8+ T cells, in the hypothesis&#xD;
      that these cells have an anti-tumor role. This research aims to investigate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An association between the rate of innate CD8+ T cells and the evolution of Phi+&#xD;
           pathologies (Chronic Myeloid Leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive Acute&#xD;
           lymphocytic leukemia (Phi+ ALL) carrying a resistance mutation, according to the ELN&#xD;
           2013 and Phi LMC recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An association between the level of innate CD8+ T cells and the expansion of TKI&#xD;
           resistance clones, assessed as the number of BcrAbl1 copies carrying the mutation&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before the advent of the first targeted therapies with imatinib in 2000, chronic myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (CML) was the most feared myeloproliferative syndrome (MPS, Philadelphia+), with a&#xD;
      median survival of 3 years. Apart from a small percentage of patients who do not respond or&#xD;
      respond poorly to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the probability of survival is now very&#xD;
      close to that of the general population when patients are on lifelong TKI therapy (leukemic&#xD;
      stem cells have low sensitivity to TKIs). Some patients with good response to treatment are&#xD;
      likely to consider stopping treatment but just over 50% of them will have to resume it. So&#xD;
      many patients will have to take TKIs for life, which poses several problems:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - intolerance to the various molecules depending on the toxicity of each one,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - development of resistance to TKIs, characterized by a rise in the percentage of&#xD;
           BcrAbl1 fusion RNA, despite treatment or increased dosages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many causes of these resistances including those known for any molecule:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pharmacokinetic causes which can be evaluated by the plasma dosage of the molecules;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leukemic cell-related causes: passage into the cell depending on antagonism between&#xD;
           influx pump (hOct1) and efflux pumps (MDR1) and failure to bind to the BcrAbl1 target&#xD;
           (pharmacodynamics), mainly by mutation of the tyrosine kinase domain of Abl1,&#xD;
           exceptionally by amplification of the Abl1 gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These apply to the consolidation phase of Phi+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Phi+ALL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of BcrAbl1 account for approximately 25 - 30%&#xD;
      of the causes of first line treatment resistance, but can reach 50 - 60% of resistance in 2nd&#xD;
      line treatment.The presence of these mutations requires a change of molecule, when possible.&#xD;
      More than 100 TKD mutations have been described. The development/selection of these mutations&#xD;
      affects both first-generation TKIs (imatinib) and second-generation TKIs (dasatinib,&#xD;
      nilotinib and bosutinib). Resistance mutations are even emerging for the third-generation&#xD;
      TKIs (ponatinib). Sensitivity profiles are therefore available to help choose the right&#xD;
      molecules beyond first-line treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among all these mutations, some are particularly fearsome such as T315I (only sensitive to&#xD;
      ponatinib) or T315M or L (resistant to all molecules, including ponatinib). Nîmes University&#xD;
      Hospital is one of the seven centers of the 2005 STIC program devoted to searching for TDK&#xD;
      mutations. In 2018, we had detected 93 different mutations in 68 patients with resistance&#xD;
      mutations, including 23 cases of T315I, by low-sensitivity techniques (Sanger sequencing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We now have a far more sensitive method involving the use of Next Generation Sequencing,&#xD;
      coupled with very high fidelity Polymerase Chain Reactions offering new perspectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD8+ T cells are classically involved in tumor control. This has led to a promising new&#xD;
      approach to the treatment of tumors: immunotherapy targeting inhibitory receptors or &quot;immune&#xD;
      checkpoints&quot; (CTLA4, PD1 or its ligand PDL1 for example). These are negative feedback&#xD;
      pathways set up following prolonged T cell activation. When T lymphocytes are stimulated over&#xD;
      long periods they begin to express this type of receptor on their surface. These inhibitory&#xD;
      receptors inhibit T cell functioning and proliferation. Antibodies targeting these receptors&#xD;
      block this negative feedback pathway, thereby enhancing T cell activity. Because lymphocytes&#xD;
      directed against tumor antigens overexpress these inhibitory receptors, administration of&#xD;
      antibodies targeting them can enhance anti-tumor immune activity and, in some patients,&#xD;
      induce tumor regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classically, the presence of a type T315I mutation is associated with an explosive increase&#xD;
      in the rates of BcrAbl1 linked to a progression of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia. This was also&#xD;
      the case for other mutations like E255K. Thus, we have a few cases of &quot;atypical&quot; T315I with&#xD;
      BcrAbl1 levels lower than or equal to 1% and a percentage of T315I close to 100% for more&#xD;
      than one year or a patient with a BcrAbl1 level of around 1% for more than 2 years and&#xD;
      carrying a T315I at 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So it seems that the mere presence of certain mutations such as T315I does not explain the&#xD;
      progression of the disease alone. This explosive progression might be linked to a second&#xD;
      event (at least) specific to the leukemic cell, such as the mutation of another gene (not yet&#xD;
      described) or linked to the environment of the leukemic cell, such as control by the immune&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;atypical&quot; evolution of these TKI resistance mutations, particularly T315I, which is as&#xD;
      frequent as it is frightening, could be controlled by these innate CD8+ T cells. This would&#xD;
      explain the long periods (up to more than 2 years documented) of the presence of clones&#xD;
      carrying these mutations with no marked disease progression, except, exclusively on a&#xD;
      molecular level, a BcrAbl1 level close to 1%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to test whether low levels of BcrAbl1, despite the presence of&#xD;
      resistance mutations, are related to high levels of innate CD8+ T cells, in the hypothesis&#xD;
      that these cells have an anti-tumor role. This research aims to investigate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An association between the rate of innate CD8+ T cells and the evolution of Phi+&#xD;
           pathologies (Chronic Myeloid Leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive Acute&#xD;
           lymphocytic leukemia (Phi+ ALL) carrying a resistance mutation, according to the ELN&#xD;
           2013 and PFi-LMC recommendations.&#xD;
