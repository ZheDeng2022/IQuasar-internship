  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized controlled study with crossover design is to examine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of mother-driven interventions, skin-to-skin contact (SSC) and recorded&#xD;
      mother's heartbeats as sound and vibration (MHB), compared to oral glucose in relieving&#xD;
      neonatal acute pain related to heel lance as a painful procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of interventions will be assessed using validated pain scales (PIPP-R and&#xD;
      NIAPAS), sensory cortex activation (near-infrared spectroscopy, NIRS), muscle tension (EMG)&#xD;
      and changes in physiological indicators (oxygen saturation, heart rate, respiratory rate).&#xD;
      The secondary objectives will include evaluating the effectiveness of interventions in&#xD;
      relation to infant recovery, evaluating the use of EMG and NIRS monitoring in neonatal pain&#xD;
      assessment compared to pain scales, the assessment of neonatal glymphatic system by NIRS and&#xD;
      the mother's view of interventions and experience of participation.&#xD;

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Three research assistants (NICU nurses) who are blinded to the intervention condition (30% oral glucose and combination of 30% oral glucose and the mother's heartbeat intervention) will be perform calculation of infant PIPP-R and NIAPAS scores independently. Calculating NIAPAS scores will requires observation of the neonate's body, so during the skin-to-skin contact the intervention condition cannot be blinded. NIRS and EMG signals will be analyzed by researchers who are unaware of the nature of intervention and whether they are analyzing a noxious or non-noxious stimulation. To minimize observer bias, research assistants and researchers analyzing the NIRS and EMG signal will not be permitted to attend data collection sessions and will not share datasets or communicate with each other regarding the study.</masking_description>

    <measure>Muscle activation related painful stimulus</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured 30 seconds post-painful procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The study will be evaluated the effect of painful stimulation on the activation of the Corrugator Supercilii muscle by electromyographic measurement (EMG). Several tools developed for neonatal pain assessment are based in part (e.g. NIAPAS, PIPP-R) or completely (e.g. Neonatal Facial Codin System) on the observation of facial expressions. In pain assessment tools, one indicator is the brow bulge, which has also been found in fetal studies to be related to stress or fetal distress. In this study, a Faros360 device will be used to measure muscle tension. Electrodes will be attached immediately above the eyebrows, laterally to the iris.</description>

Skin-to-skin positioning will be taken account comfortable position as possible for mother and the baby, easy to access heel for blood sample and interference minimizing during video recording and continuous NIRS, ECG, EMG and oxygen saturation measurement. Skin-to-skin contact will be continued for approximately thirty minutes after completion of blood sampling.
