  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reconstruction of soft tissue defects around the foot and ankle region is a challenging&#xD;
      problem for reconstructive surgeons due to the lack of locally available tissues for&#xD;
      transposition, the relatively poor skin circulation, and the special structural&#xD;
      characteristics of this area, bones and tendons can easily become exposed due to trauma. so&#xD;
      foot injuries are often associated with a loss of soft tissues and exposed bones . The&#xD;
      plantar skin is thick, with solid anchorage to the deep structures. Therefore, the&#xD;
      reconstructive aim is to restore the stability of the foot skin to adapt to weightbearing and&#xD;
      to resist shearing forces. In addition, good sensibility should be considered in the&#xD;
      reconstruction. Additional considerations the ankle region has great tension during movement,&#xD;
      and good stability is required for shoes wearing. The medial plantar flap has been&#xD;
      effectively used in the reconstruction of soft tissue defects localized to the plantar foot,&#xD;
      forefoot, posterior heel, and ankle in small to medium sized defects . This flap can be&#xD;
      transferred to the defect as a proximally or distally pedicled island flap . The distally&#xD;
      based sural artery flap frequently used for reconstruction of soft tissue defects of the&#xD;
      lower leg, foot and ankle in medium and large sized defects .Fascio-cutaneous flaps are&#xD;
      highly effective and easy to perform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a comparative study designed for assessment of the clinical applications of&#xD;
      distally based sural flap versus medial plantar artery flap regarding the size of the defect&#xD;
      , operative technique and their outcomes (success and complications) as a reconstructive&#xD;
      option for foot and ankle defects.&#xD;

    <description>The functional outcomes are graded as excellent, good, and poor. The criteria for excellent results are the survival of the flap without any flap loss and walking without any aids . Survival of the flap with minimum complications and walking with aids are the criteria for good results. A result is considered poor when an alternative reconstructive procedure is considered</description>

    <description>Medial plantar artery flap is a fasciocutaneous island flap raised from the non-weightbearing instep of the plantar foot. The dominant vascular pedicle of the flap consists of the medial plantar artery and venae comitantes</description>

    <description>Distally based sural artery flap is a fascio-cutaneous island flap taken from the posterior aspect of the middle third of the leg and fed by the lower peroneal septo-cutaneous perforators in reverse fashion. Its vascular basis is the close association between the median superficial sural artery and peroneal artery perforators</description>
