      Purpose: To evaluate the activity of a gel composed of 10% peel powder of unripe banana (Musa&#xD;
      sapientum) combined with lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus) oil, at 0.1% concentration, in&#xD;
      patients with chronic ulcers. Methods: This is a clinical, individual, analytical,&#xD;
      interventional, longitudinal, prospective, controlled study with convenience sampling. Three&#xD;
      groups will be used, as follows: control group 1 (CG1) with 7 participants will be treated&#xD;
      with collagenase, control group 2 (CG2) with 7 participants will be treated with a gel&#xD;
      composed of 10% unripe banana peel powder, and study group (SG) with 11 patients will be&#xD;
      treated with the abovementioned gel combined with lemongrass oil at 0.1% concentration. The&#xD;
      ulcer areas will be analyzed once a week for 4 weeks. Afterward, wound areas will be measured&#xD;
      and the obtained data will be subjected to statistical analysis.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Twenty-five people, regardless of gender, participated in this study. The patients were divided into 3 groups (Control 1, Control 2 and, Study Group). The Control Group 1 (CG1) consisted of seven participants who were subjected to a standardized treatment (collagenase ointment was selected for this treatment), the Control Group 2 (CG2) accounted for seven participants who used a gel made of 10% peel powder of unripe banana (M. sapientum), and the Study Group (SG) involved eleven participants who used the abovementioned gel combined with lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus) oil at 0.1% concentration.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>All collected measurements (drawings) were scanned and saved in JPEG format and the areas were calculated using the ImageJ® software13.&#xD;
The ImageJ® was set to measure the area in centimeters, with a pixel of 118.67, establishing a fixed value. The areas were calculated individually in the software and the values were saved in an Excel spreadsheet.</description>
