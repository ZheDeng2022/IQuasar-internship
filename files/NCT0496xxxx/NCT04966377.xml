      This study, which is designed according to the experimental model with randomized pre-test&#xD;
      and post-test control group, will be carried out with Syrian women who apply to Empowered&#xD;
      Migrant Health Center in İstanbul province, Sultanbeyli district, where Syria citizens are&#xD;
      immigranted. The population of the study consisted of all Syrian women aged 40-69 under&#xD;
      temporary protection who came to the Empowered Migrant Health Center at the time of the&#xD;
      research. The working group will be composed of 80 Syrian women who meet the selection&#xD;
      criteria. According to the sources, the frequency of breast cancer screening in Turkey is&#xD;
      taken as 15%; For the study at 95% confidence level, d=0,6 was taken and n=136 sample size&#xD;
      was taken. Considering that there may be those who left during the research period, 14 women&#xD;
      will be taken as substitutes and the sample will be completed to a total of 150 in order to&#xD;
      increase the power of representing the universe. A personal questionnaire prepared by the&#xD;
      researcher in line with the literature, Health Belief Model Scale, Mammography Self-Efficacy&#xD;
      Scale, Champion Breast Cancer Fear Scale, Breast Self Examination Checklist Form, will be&#xD;
      administered to Syrian women under temporary protection who applied to the empowered migrant&#xD;
      health center and agreed to participate in the study.According to the sample pool formed by&#xD;
      the women included in the study, the participants were assigned to 2 groups as experiment and&#xD;
      control with the &quot;Research Randomizer&quot; program. Each group will be determined as 75 people. A&#xD;
      4-week training program will be applied to the experimental group. The women in the&#xD;
      experimental group will be given a self-breast examination control calendar after their first&#xD;
      training. Afterwards, motivational interviews will be held once a month for the second and&#xD;
      third months. A &quot;Nurse-managed screening consultancy telephone support line&quot; will be&#xD;
      established for Syrian women within the scope of the Nurse Navigation Program. Reminder phone&#xD;
      calls will be made 4 times a week. Personal questionnaire, Health Belief Model Scale,&#xD;
      Mammography Self-Efficacy Scale, Champion Breast Cancer Fear Scale, Breast Self Examination&#xD;

      In this study, it is aimed to present an innovative approach in ensuring the participation of&#xD;
      Syrian women under temporary protection in breast cancer screening. For this purpose, Nurse&#xD;
      Navigation Program Based On Health Belief Model In Breast Cancer Screening (NaHeB-CaS) will&#xD;
      be applied to affect the health beliefs of Syrian women. The research is carried out with a&#xD;
      randomized controlled double-blind pre-test post-test control group. The randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial was based on the guidelines proposed by the Consolidated standard of Reporting&#xD;
      TrialsCONSORT 2010. The data of the research will be collected at Istanbul/Sultanbeyli&#xD;
      Empowered Migrant Health Center between June and October 2021. Introductory Information&#xD;
      Questionnaire, Health Belief Model Scale, Mammography Self-Efficacy Scale, Champion Breast&#xD;
      Cancer Fear Scale and Breast Self-Examination Checklist Form, prepared by the researcher in&#xD;
      line with the literature, will be applied to women who apply to this immigrant health center&#xD;
      and agree to participate in the research. Pre-tests will be given to the experimental and&#xD;
      control groups in a training room at the Empowered Migrant Health Center. Data collection&#xD;
      will take approximately 15-20 minutes. Pre-tested Syrian women will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      the sample pool to be divided into experimental and control groups. Romany women will be&#xD;
      divided into experimental and control groups using the Simple Random Method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Tools Personal questionnaire;Introductory features questionnaire consisting&#xD;
      of 32 questions developed by the researchers in line with the literature; It questions&#xD;
      women's socio-demographic characteristics (age, number of children, educational status,&#xD;
      etc.), their beliefs about early diagnosis practices, their genetic characteristics, and&#xD;
      their status regarding early diagnosis practices for cancer. The introductory features&#xD;
      questionnaire was translated into Arabic in a way that individuals can understand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health Belief Model Scale: The scale, which is used to determine the beliefs and attitudes of&#xD;
      individuals regarding breast cancer, BSE, CBE and Mammography, was developed by Champion in&#xD;
      1984 and was last revised in 1999. The validity and reliability of the Arabic version of the&#xD;
      revised Champion Health Belief Model Scale was conducted by Mikhail and Petro-Nustas. The&#xD;
      Cronbach's Alpha value of the original scale was reported to be 0.65-0.90, and test-retest&#xD;
      correlations of 0.40-0.68. According to the validity and reliability study of the scale for&#xD;
      Syrian women, the number of items; sensitivity perception (5-25 points), caring perception&#xD;
      (8-40 points), health motivation perception (6-30 points), BSE benefit perception (6-30&#xD;
      points), BSE perception of obstacles (7-35 points), self- efficacy perception (9-45 points),&#xD;
      mammography barrier and benefit perception (12-60 points), and clinical breast examination&#xD;
      barrier and benefit perception (9-45 points) sub-dimensions. The scale is in a 5-point Likert&#xD;
      type and for each item, between 1 and 5, 1 is &quot;very bad&quot;; 2 &quot;bad&quot;; 3 &quot;medium&quot;; 4 &quot;good&quot;; 5&#xD;
      was rated as &quot;very good&quot;. Higher scores mean that sensitivity and caring increase, health&#xD;
      motivation for health motivation, benefits for benefit perception, barriers for obstacle&#xD;
      perception, and self-efficacy for self-efficacy are perceived high. Scoring is reversed for&#xD;
      items in the obstacles sub-dimension in the scale. A high total score in the scale for the&#xD;
      sub-dimensions other than the barriers, explains that the individual's perceptions of health&#xD;
      related to breast cancer screening behaviors are high and the rate of exhibiting the behavior&#xD;
      will be high. Written permission was obtained from the author to use the Health Belief Model&#xD;
      Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mammography Self-efficacy scale: The scale was developed by Champion et al in 2005. The&#xD;
      Chronbach Alpha value is specified as 0.87 . The Arabic validity-reliability study of the&#xD;
      scale was conducted by Al-Zalabani. The scale consists of 10 items and aims to assess women's&#xD;
      perceived self-efficacy for mammography screening. In the Arabic evaluation of the scale,&#xD;
      5-point Likert-type scaling ranging from 1 to 5 &quot;strongly disagree&quot;, &quot;disagree&quot;, &quot;undecided&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;agree&quot;, &quot;strongly agree&quot; method was used. The total possible score ranges from 10 to 50&#xD;
      points, indicating a higher level of self-efficacy as the total score increases. Al-Zalabani&#xD;
      found the Cronbach's Alpha value of the scale to be 0.88.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Champion Breast Cancer Fear Scale: Champion Breast Cancer Fear Scale (CMKKÖ) is an 8-item&#xD;
      measurement tool developed by Champion. This scale determines the relationship between breast&#xD;
      cancer and mammography behavior and women's emotional responses and is used to screen for&#xD;
      breast cancer fear behavior. Alyami et al. In 2019, the scale was translated into Arabic and&#xD;
      its validity and reliability study was carried out and published in 2021. The scale is&#xD;
      five-point Likert type. Responses to the scale are scored as &quot;strongly disagree&quot; 1 point,&#xD;
      &quot;disagree&quot; 2 points, &quot;undecided&quot; 3 points, &quot;agree&quot; 4 points, &quot;strongly agree&quot; 5 points. The&#xD;
      lowest score that can be obtained from the scale is 8, and the highest score is 40. A high&#xD;
      score indicates a high fear of breast cancer. For the Champion Breast Cancer Fear Scale&#xD;
      Arabic, Cronbach's correlation coefficient is 0.94.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast self-exam checklist form: This checklist form was made in order to determine the&#xD;
      practices that the individuals participating in the research knew about breast&#xD;
      self-examination before nursing care and the behaviors they gained after nursing care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of the research, the data obtained from all tests will be evaluated and reported&#xD;
      in the SPSS package program. Descriptive statistics, paired t test, mc nemar test and&#xD;
      correlation analysis will be used in the evaluation of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the study, ethics committee approval (number: 220/132) from the Social and&#xD;
      Human Sciences Ethics Committee of Ondokuz Mayıs University and permission from the Migration&#xD;
      Policy and Projects Department of the General Directorate of Migration Management (No:&#xD;
      62103649000E. 20374) were obtained. Later, institutional permission was obtained from the&#xD;
      Istanbul Provincial Health Directorate (E-15916306-604.01.01) to practice in the Strengthened&#xD;
      Migrant Health Center. Before the start of the study, the women participating in the study&#xD;
      were informed about the purpose of the study and their written consent was obtained with the&#xD;
      Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
