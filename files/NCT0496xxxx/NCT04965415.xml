  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Workers in small businesses bear a disproportionate burden of occupational fatalities,&#xD;
      illnesses, and injuries. The investigators conducted an intervention research project to&#xD;
      determine how an intervention at the organizational level modifies business Total Worker&#xD;
      Health (TWH) practices, safety climate, and health climate. In turn, the investigators aimed&#xD;
      to determine whether organizational TWH adoption impacts individual workers' lifestyle health&#xD;
      outcomes. In addition, the investigators also evaluated the use of the RE-AIM public health&#xD;
      impact evaluation framework in the small business setting, with the intention of improving&#xD;
      generalizability, maintenance, and dissemination of interventions and of guiding future TWH&#xD;
      intervention design for both research and practice. The investigators conducted a lagged&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (L-RCT) to determine how different doses of an&#xD;
      organizational-level TWH intervention (Health Links vs. Health Links + TWH Leadership&#xD;
      Training) resulted in improvement and maintenance of TWH programming and organizational&#xD;
      climates for safety and health, in small enterprises, over 36 months. The investigators also&#xD;
      evaluated whether it resulted in improvements in workforce lifestyle health risks. In the&#xD;
      short and mid-term, the goals and outputs of this project is a greater understanding of the&#xD;
      theoretical underpinnings of TWH interventions and a model to test the implementation of the&#xD;
      TWH interventions as well as an improvement the ability of TWH researchers and practitioners&#xD;
      to apply this knowledge to TWH intervention design, implementation and evaluation to ensure&#xD;
      generalizability. The long-term goal of this project is to impact worker safety, health and&#xD;
      well-being through the continued use of these principles in small businesses.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Businesses are randomly assigned to one of two arms, and the intervention is evaluated using a stepped wedge design. In the active comparator arm, businesses participate in an existing organizational-level intervention called Health Links in the first year of the study. Businesses randomly assigned to the experimental arm in the first year receive the TWH leadership program, in addition to Health Links. Businesses in the active comparator arm eventually receive the experimental intervention in the second year of the study.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Help businesses undergo transactional (i.e., business management practices) and transformational (i.e., business leadership and culture) change. Transactional change component: Health Links is an existing community-based intervention that seeks to help businesses - especially small and medium-sized businesses - incorporate Total Worker Health (TWH) programming into their business practices through assessment, advising, and certification. There is evidence that this consultation intervention is effective at helping businesses develop and implement policies and programs.Transformational change component: The experimental arm includes TWH leadership training for small business owners and other senior leaders. This is a three-month training that includes assessments, in-person training, and virtual training transfer activities. The goal is to help the leader understand their organization's current approach to TWH, identify areas for improvement, and to take action.</description>
