      This project aims to: 1. Evaluate the possible relationship between MGD and HRT in&#xD;
      perimenopausal women; 2. To explore the mechanism of HRT treatment on MGD through clinical&#xD;
      trials;3. Optimize treatment methods by exploring the mechanism, and develop more&#xD;
      personalized and systematic treatment plans for MDG patients in the perimenopausal period.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>After local anesthesia, a 35mm×5mm filter paper strip was placed longitudinally into the conjunctival sac of the lower eyelid. After 5 minutes, the length of the moist part was recorded. Less than 10mm was considered abnormal.</description>

    <measure>Noninvasive tear break-up time test (NITBUT)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>After fluorescein staining, patients were asked to close their eyes and measure the time until the first tear film break point appeared.The average of the three measurements was recorded and was considered abnormal for less than 10 seconds.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The scoring of corneal fluorescein staining</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The cornea was divided into two groups on average. After staining, the upper, middle and lower corneal sites were recorded and the scores of each site were recorded.0= no punctate staining;1= less than half staining: 2= more than half staining;3= total staining;And the cumulative score (0-9 points) for each quadrant.CFS was assessed at each follow-up.</description>

        MGD is a relatively new field of research in ophthalmology, so it has not been extensively&#xD;
        studied up to now. However, MGD is believed to be a major cause of DE disease worldwide. It&#xD;
        is estimated that MGD accounts for more than two-thirds of all DE cases. In one study, MGD&#xD;
        accounted for 78 % of DE patients. The estimated incidence of MGD in Asian adults over 40&#xD;
        years of age ranges from 46.2% to 69.3%. Previous studies have shown that the production&#xD;
        and stability of tears in postmenopausal women are reduced, and hormone replacement therapy&#xD;
        can restore SLT values to the normal range. However, some studies have reported that women&#xD;
        who receive HRT have a higher mortality rate than women who do not.&#xD;
