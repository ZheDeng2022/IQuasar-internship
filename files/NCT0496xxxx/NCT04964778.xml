  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A SKED© is a stretcher typically used for for confined space, high angle, or technical&#xD;
      rescue. SKED© is not an acronym; the word came from fusing two words: &quot;Sled&quot; and &quot;Skid.&quot; Over&#xD;
      the last several years, as recommendations for spinal protection and utilization of adjunct&#xD;
      field hardware for patient application changes, there have been conflicting training and&#xD;
      practice regarding optimizing patient packaging utilizing the SKED© system. Specifically,&#xD;
      there is disagreement in terms of optimal packaging to ensure no decompensation of&#xD;
      respiratory status of the patient objectively, as well as comfort level subjectively solely&#xD;
      related to the packaging method utilized. Several training bodies currently employ different&#xD;
      practices of packaging including use of an Oregon Spine Splint-II© (OSS-II) system within a&#xD;
      SKED©, foam padding, vacuum mattress configuration, or even no additional adjunct at all. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to determine whether adjuncts to the SKED© system impact&#xD;
      respiratory physiology, or patient comfort while being dragged over horizontal ground.&#xD;

      This study will be a randomized controlled, non-blinded trial The setting of this study will&#xD;
      be an area of level ground, outdoors at a state park. Study enrollment goal is 50 subjects.&#xD;
      This was determined by review of statistics from similar studies, available funding and time&#xD;
      frame allocated to complete the study. There is not planned interim analysis, and no criteria&#xD;
      for ending the study early. Each participant will be packaged using a SKED© system with no&#xD;
      assumed spinal injury. Each subject will be packaged with SKED© only; SKED©+OSS-II©;&#xD;
      SKED©+Vacuum mattress; SKED©+foam padding. Each patient packaged within their respective&#xD;
      systems as one unit will be subject to a 30 meter controlled drag over terrain chosen to&#xD;
      mimic a standard dry backcountry extrication drag. Then carried back to the start by a 4&#xD;
      person carry team to simulate a carry out scenario. The same 30 meter ground area will be&#xD;
      used for all systems. Built in safety during the drag includes a manually monitored electric&#xD;
      winch system with load cells and two safety operators walking alongside the packaged patient.&#xD;
      Target movement will be approximately 1.5-2 miles per hour.&#xD;
