  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acetaminophen (APAP) is the most commonly used NSAIDS in clinic, and it is also a common&#xD;
      cause of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). In 2012, the proportion of DILI caused by APAP in&#xD;
      the United States was 51%, while in Asia, it was only 7.10%. Previously, a small cohort study&#xD;
      in the United States screened for some of the susceptibility genes for DILI due to APAP by&#xD;
      the Genome wide association study (GWAS) method. However, the genetic susceptibility loci&#xD;
      based on the US cohort were not applicable to the Chinese population. Therefore, we make a&#xD;
      study design include Chinese population who ingested APAP and divided them into case group&#xD;
      and control group according to the occurrence of DILI. We hope to be able to find the root of&#xD;
      differences at the genetic level and explore new pathogenic mechanisms.&#xD;

&#xD;
           •Gastric lavage time: &lt;1 hour, ≥1 hour&#xD;
&#xD;
           (iv) Estimation of sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
           Parameter source：&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Focus on drug metabolizing enzymes, immunogenic loci&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The distribution of APAP-dependent DILI susceptibility allele frequencies in Asian&#xD;
                populations based on literature findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Parameter value：&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis: Gene-Environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcome Model: Baseline risk P0=0.10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetic Effect =1.2,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Power=0.8, Type I error rate=0.05 (two-sided).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results： The case sample size should be 113 with a control sample size of 226.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Exposure/risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Definition. Exposure factors refer to susceptibility genes for DILI caused by APAP,&#xD;
      including：&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2,036,060 marker sites&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) :HLA-A and HLA-B immune loci.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genotype-Imputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) Measurement methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adopt candidate gene strategy. The candidate gene strategy is a flexible approach with&#xD;
           low cost, relatively simple quality control and statistical analysis, and a relatively&#xD;
           easy biological explanation behind the association because the genes selected are all&#xD;
           important for the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Using the hypothesis-driven approach. Considering the hypothesis that some specific&#xD;
           genes may be associated with the study outcome, a sequence-based approach was chosen for&#xD;
           the analysis of potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs), selecting&#xD;
           SNPs that are more likely to be of functional value associated with drug metabolizing&#xD;
           enzymes, immunogenic loci, drug transport proteins, drug-acting receptors and other&#xD;
           links, especially those located in candidate genes coding regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Using custom chips. The Expanded Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array (MEGAEX), a microarray&#xD;
           built by consortia with enhanced capabilities to understand complex diseases in a&#xD;
           variety of populations. This commercially available microarray determines individual&#xD;
           drug response through the detection of 2,036,060 marker loci. It also complements HLA-A&#xD;
           and HLA-B immune loci information to complete Genotype-Imputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Quality control The study has a strict standard test operation procedure, and relevant&#xD;
      training is conducted for the personnel involved in the test before the start of the&#xD;
      experiment, and the test can only be conducted after passing the training. We have a quality&#xD;
      control center with dedicated personnel responsible for subject progress and data quality&#xD;
      control. An online digital randomization platform and information entry management system is&#xD;
      set up based on the web server terminal, which is capable of timely case randomization&#xD;
      grouping and electronic clinical case observation form information entry, and can effectively&#xD;
      and automatically check and correct errors during the information entry process. That is, it&#xD;
      helps to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the entered information, and can provide&#xD;
      real-time data monitoring for the supervisors. In addition, this study will monitor the&#xD;
      conduct of experiments and data entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Data Management Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data Center: The data management center established by the national data management&#xD;
           standard undertakes data management work.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data management system: REDCap is used to establish electronic case report forms for&#xD;
           online data collection and management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection: Data entry by independent data registrants not involved in the study in&#xD;
           the study lead unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data consistency monitoring: Data consistency monitoring by an independent third-party&#xD;
           monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data audit and locking: Data is audited, cleaned and locked by a dedicated data manager.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Statistical analysis plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Hypothesis testing. H0: No difference in genes between subjects with and without liver&#xD;
      damage after ingestion of APAP H1: Significant genetic differences between subjects with and&#xD;
      without liver damage after ingestion of APAP&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) Analytical strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continuous variables were described as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median of&#xD;
           interquartile range (IQR), and differences between groups were analyzed by two-factor&#xD;
           ANOVA or nonparametric tests. Categorical variables were expressed as numbers and&#xD;
           percentages and analyzed by logistic regression models.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) between control groups was tested using the&#xD;
           goodness-of-fit χ2 test. Using haplotype analysis view（Haploview） 4.2 software, the&#xD;
           haplotype region group was selected considering the linkage disequilibrium between tags&#xD;
           of single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the&#xD;
           association between genotype and risk of DILI from APAP by dominance ratios (ORs) and&#xD;
           95% confidence intervals (CIs) with gastric lavage and antidote use as covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three different genetic models were used to synthesize the role of tagSNPs. Software&#xD;
           package for Hardy-weinberg analysis(SHEsis) online program was used for haplotype&#xD;
           analysis under logistic regression model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All analyses were performed using Statistics is a powerful statistical software&#xD;
           platform(SPSS) for Windows (version 26.0 USA). Two-tailed P values &lt;0.05 were considered&#xD;
           statistically significant.&#xD;
