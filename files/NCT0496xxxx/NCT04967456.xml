  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of Laser Doppler flowmetry in determining&#xD;
      the changes in the pulpal blood flow during the post-traumatic period of traumatised&#xD;
      permanent teeth.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic injuries of permanent teeth in children and adolescents are very common. The&#xD;
      conventional pulp vitality tests are inaccurate and unreliable techniques in assessing the&#xD;
      pulp vitality during the post-traumatic period, as well as during the immature teeth&#xD;
      examination. The aim is to evaluate the efficacy of Laser Doppler flowmetry in determining&#xD;
      the changes in the pulpal blood flow during the post-traumatic period of traumatised&#xD;
      permanent teeth. The study is designed as a randomized, split-mouth, controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial. The measurement of the blood flow of the dental pulp of both, traumatised and&#xD;
      non-traumatised teeth, will be performed, using a laser doppler flow monitor, emission&#xD;
      wavelength 785nm±10nm, dual-channel laser Doppler monitoring option.&#xD;

    <description>The traumatised and non-traumatised teeth, test and control, will be assessed by LDF, providing an accurate and precise investigation. The temperature in the dental office will be constant and the patient will be seated in a &quot;state position&quot; in the dental chair. According to the manufacturer's recommendations, a patient's relaxation of 10 minutes before the monitoring process will be obtained. The measurements of blood flow will be performed for 180 seconds at each session. All the measurements will be recorded.</description>

    <description>Measurement of the blood flow of the dental pulp will be performed, using a laser doppler flow monitor &quot;mVMS-LDF2TM&quot; (Moor Instruments Ltd Millwey Axminster Devon, UK), emission wavelength 785nm±10nm, dual-channel laser Doppler monitoring option. Two probes will be used, each consisting of one afferent and one efferent optic fiber to conduct the light to and from the tooth surface. The probe is stainless steel needle-like tube, which is 10-80 mm long and 1.5 mm in the diameter. The utilised parameter settings will be: Average power - 1.0 mV; Diameter of the probe - 1.5 mm; Frequency - 40 Hz; Monitoring time-180 seconds (sec)</description>
