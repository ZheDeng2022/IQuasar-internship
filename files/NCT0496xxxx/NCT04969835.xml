    <textblock>
      This open-label, First-into-Human (FIH) study will evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and early efficacy of AVA6000, a FAP-activated pro-drug of doxorubicin,&#xD;
      in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic solid tumours. In Phase Ia, using a 3+3&#xD;
      design, escalating doses of AVA6000 will be administered to patients with a range of solid&#xD;
      tumour types to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase II dose&#xD;
      (RP2D). In Phase 1b, the selected RP2D dose will be assessed in one to three tumour types.&#xD;

      This study is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1, open-label, multicentre, dose-escalation study&#xD;
      investigating AVA6000 monotherapy administered intravenously (IV) in patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced (unresectable) and/or metastatic solid tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two parts: Phase 1a (Dose Escalation) and Phase 1b (Dose&#xD;
      Expansion):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1a (Dose Escalation): The dose-escalation phase is designed to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and MTD and/or RP2D of AVA6000, administered as monotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1b (Dose Expansion): The dose-expansion phase will comprise 1 to 3 expansion arms in&#xD;
      specific tumour types to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AVA6000 at the MTD or RP2D&#xD;
      when administered as monotherapy. The tumour types to be explored in Phase 1b, will be&#xD;
      determined based on evaluation of the Phase 1a data and the protocol will be amended&#xD;
      accordingly.&#xD;
