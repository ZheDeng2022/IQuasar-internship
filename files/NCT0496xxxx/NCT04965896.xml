  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is some evidence to suggest that the timing of a meal intake directly impacts&#xD;
      postprandial insulin and glucose responses, with meals consumed later during the day being&#xD;
      more metabolically detrimental that the same meals consumed during the day. This information&#xD;
      is particularly pertinent to the 16% of people employed in shift-work professions in&#xD;
      Australia who have little choice but to eat during the late evening and overnight. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to compare two effect of different meals or snacks (control vs test&#xD;
      meal) on blood glucose and insulin at night time in healthy adults. This study will enable to&#xD;
      develop suitable meals to consume at night time that can reduce the higher glucose and&#xD;
      insulin responses that are a consequence of eating late into the night.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eating in the morning results in a more effective clearance of blood sugar (glucose).&#xD;
      However, some people, such as shift workers, have no choice but to eat at night. Previous&#xD;
      studies have shown that consuming protein at night can be effective at lowering blood sugar.&#xD;
      The investigators here propose that nuts would be a healthy snack to eat at night time as&#xD;
      they are a good source of protein and may help to reduce the high levels of blood glucose&#xD;
      observed by eating at night time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this cross-over study is to compare the effect of a snack high in nuts compared&#xD;
      with a control snack similar in macronutrients (cheese and crackers) on postprandial blood&#xD;
      glucose and insulin in healthy participants after consumption of a meal known to raise blood&#xD;
      sugar (white rice). The investigators hypothesise that compared with a standard snack, a&#xD;
      snack containing nuts will show a lower postprandial glucose and insulin response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will complete an initial screening questionnaire to check eligibility.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will attend the research facilities after 5h fasting at night (from&#xD;
      18.30pm-22.00pm) on two occasions, when they will receive plain white rice (75g of available&#xD;
      carbohydrate) alongside either 30 g of mixed nuts (test meal) or a snack with cheese and&#xD;
      crackers (control meal) that is equivalent in energy and macronutrient content. During the&#xD;
      visits, a finger prick fasting glucose sample will be collected. Repeated finger prick&#xD;
      samples will be collected at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes after the meal&#xD;
      intake. These samples will be used for glucose and insulin measurement. Postprandial glucose&#xD;
      and insulin iAUC will be calculated. Differences in glucose and insulin concentrations and&#xD;
      iAUC as well as glucose time to peak will be compared between the two treatment conditions.&#xD;
