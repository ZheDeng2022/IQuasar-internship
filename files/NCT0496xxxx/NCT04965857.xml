      Quality assurance of the laboratory examinations. Prospective non-interventional study with&#xD;
      ThinPrep slides collected during the German Co-Screening Program and routinely sent to the&#xD;
      lab to prospectively evaluate the clinical performance of the Hologic Genius Digital Cytology&#xD;
      (DC) system vs. the liquid-based cytology (LBC) manual microscopic approach&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cause of cervical cancer is a persistent infection with high-risk types of human&#xD;
      papillomavirus (HPV). Cytology has been the gold standard for cervical screening since the&#xD;
      introduction of routine screening with the Pap test in the 1950s due to its effect on&#xD;
      mortality in regions with screening programs. Since that time, there have been several&#xD;
      technological advances (LBC, Imaging) to improve and automate cervical cytology, resulting in&#xD;
      increased disease detection and efficiency. The Hologic's Genius Digital Diagnostics System&#xD;
      is a CE-IVD (CE-marked in vitro diagnostic device) marked digital cytology platform. For&#xD;
      quality assurance and to prospectively evaluate the Hologic Genius Digital Cytology (DC)&#xD;
      system in the lab, selected routinely screened and already archived slides will be&#xD;
      additionally reviewed with the liquid-based cytology (LBC) manual microscopic approach. Only&#xD;
      anonymized results will be evaluated.&#xD;
