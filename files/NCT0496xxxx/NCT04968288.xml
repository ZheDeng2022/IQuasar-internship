      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kaposi s sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV) causes several kinds of cancer, Kaposi sarcoma (KS), a&#xD;
      form of Multicentric Castleman s Disease (MCD) and a type of lymphoma known as Primary&#xD;
      Effusion Lymphoma (PEL). These cancers can occur alone or at the same time in the same&#xD;
      patient. MCD can cause a lot of symptoms and problems with various organs in the body, making&#xD;
      patients feel quite unwell. If unrecognized, the disease can be fatal. Medications such as&#xD;
      rituximab alone or in combination with chemotherapy may help treat MCD but there is little&#xD;
      known about the long term effects and the natural course of MCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand the biology of KSHV-MCD to help identify how this disease causes illness&#xD;
      and how cancer treatments known to be effective in MCD may help patients with this condition.&#xD;
      This study also aims to help identify ways to treat the disease by providing other standard&#xD;
      cancer treatments that would be useful to use to treat MCD based on what we know about this&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 18 years of age and older with KSHV-MCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT scan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an initial evaluation. This will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of participants symptoms and ability to perform their normal activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging studies such as CT and PET scans. Participants may have a contrast agent injected&#xD;
      into their arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photographs to document skin lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional skin biopsy. For this, a small piece of the skin will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional lymph node needle biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional samples of the fluid in the space around the lungs, intestines, or heart&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional sample of the liquid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEXA scan to examine the bones&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional limb measurements or cognitive tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians will give participants recommendations about treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After their initial evaluation and any treatment, participants will have additional visits.&#xD;
      These will occur every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months for the second year,&#xD;
      and then once a year for up to 1 year.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multicentric Castleman s disease (MCD) is a rare but lethal Kaposi s sarcoma-associated&#xD;
           herpesvirus (KSHV) associated lymphoproliferative disorder with a historical median&#xD;
           survival of 2 years. It occurs more often in HIV-infected individuals than those without&#xD;
           HIV infection. The poor prognosis is not fully explained by the underlying HIV, as the&#xD;
           HIV-negative cases appear to have little or no survival advantage over the HIV-positive&#xD;
           cohort. The disease has no defined standard treatment and there is much to be learned&#xD;
           about its pathogenesis and natural history with current treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with KSHV-MCD may present with other KSHV-associated conditions such as Kaposi&#xD;
           sarcoma (KS) and may develop primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) following their diagnosis,&#xD;
           which may affect morbidity and mortality. It is not clear how these concurrent&#xD;
           conditions develop simultaneously and over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Since 2004, the HIV and AIDS Malignancy Branch has studied the natural history and&#xD;
           assessed novel therapies for KSHV-MCD which has contributed to the development of at&#xD;
           least two therapies that are now considered as first-line therapies: (1) rituximab plus&#xD;
           liposomal doxorubicin and (2) high dose zidovudine plus valganciclovir.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These therapies plus either rituximab alone or other rituximab-based therapies that have&#xD;
           been developed over the last 15 years have resulted in durable responses in patients&#xD;
           with KSHV-MCD and have substantially improved the prognosis of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The longitudinal evaluations along with tissue sample collection, imaging studies, and&#xD;
           participant reported outcomes will allow for the development of a better understanding&#xD;
           of the natural history of this disease, and the development of the basis for more&#xD;
           effective treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To study and describe the natural history of KSHV-MCD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &gt;= 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsy proven KSHV-associated MCD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This will be a long-term study to comprehensively study participants with KSHV-MCD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history will be collected, and participants followed throughout the course of&#xD;
           their illness, with particular attention to patterns of disease presentation, recurrence&#xD;
           and progression, response to therapies, and duration of responses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue samples and blood will be obtained from participants during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We anticipate accruing 135 participants on this protocol&#xD;
