  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will evaluate study processes and feasibility of a future large-scale&#xD;
      clinical trial that proposes to test whether low-risk children managed as outpatients with&#xD;
      community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and procalcitonin (PCT) levels &lt;0.25 ng/mL treated with&#xD;
      placebo have a similar clinical response to those treated with antibiotics and fewer adverse&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial is a 3-site, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial&#xD;
      assessing the feasibility of comparing amoxicillin to placebo in children 12 months to &lt;6&#xD;
      years of age who present to the ED with Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP), a procalcitonin&#xD;
      (PCT) concentration of &lt;0.25 ng/mL, and who will be treated as outpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and Enrollment This trial will enroll over a 6-month period and take place at three&#xD;
      sites (Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Cincinnati Children's Hospital&#xD;
      Medical Center and The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia) that are or were members of the&#xD;
      Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), a federally funded network of 18&#xD;
      pediatric EDs that have an established and successful history of completing large-scale&#xD;
      clinical trials in the ED. This study will enroll 36 patients in total (2 patients per month,&#xD;
      per site). Clinical research coordinators (CRCs) at participating EDs will screen potentially&#xD;
      eligible patients with respiratory tract symptoms and discuss eligibility with the treating&#xD;
      attending physician. If thought to be eligible and a diagnosis of CAP is presumed by the&#xD;
      treating physician, the CRC will approach the patient to complete screening procedures. The&#xD;
      study will proceed in 2 stages, each with its own informed consent process. During Stage 1,&#xD;
      baseline characteristics and serum PCT levels will be ascertained. Stage 2 will consist of a&#xD;
      randomized trial of amoxicillin vs. placebo in the subset of patients from Stage 1 that have&#xD;
      PCT &lt;0.25 ng/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization After enrollment and confirmation of a PCT &lt;0.25 ng/mL, patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to a 10-day course of either amoxicillin (80-100 mg/kg divided BID up to 4,000&#xD;
      mg/day) or placebo. Randomization to amoxicillin or placebo will be at a 1:1 ratio with block&#xD;
      sizes of 2 and 4. Patients will be stratified by the clinical site and randomization will be&#xD;
      performed through an online system. As a double-blind clinical trial, the study patients and&#xD;
      their parents/guardians, investigators and study staff will be blinded to study treatment&#xD;
      assignment for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration Local investigational drug pharmacies will be provided with active&#xD;
      study medication (i.e., amoxicillin) and matching placebo. Site pharmacies at each&#xD;
      institution will store study drug and dispense as needed. Study medications will both be&#xD;
      liquid reconstituted from powder, and will resemble each other with regards to appearance,&#xD;
      favor, consistency and packaging. Study products will be labeled with numerical codes that&#xD;
      will maintain allocation concealment. Site investigational pharmacies will be provided with&#xD;
      amoxicillin and placebo, in addition to the randomization scheme. The pharmacy will aliquot&#xD;
      amoxicillin and placebo into blinded bottles based on randomization scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up The guardians of participants will be asked to complete a daily symptom diary,&#xD;
      using an online data collection form in REDCap, during the first 7 days after the initial&#xD;
      Emergency Department study visit. The follow-up will assess patient condition, clinical&#xD;
      response, signs or symptoms of clinical deterioration and other adverse effects. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be assessed at day 7 (+/- 2 days), using video chat technology that is standard&#xD;
      on most smart phones, tablets, and computers. Video follow-up will be performed by site&#xD;
      clinician investigators. In the rare case that a mobile device or computer with video chat&#xD;
      technology is not available to the family, the day 7 follow-up will occur by telephone or&#xD;
      text through an online system. A final follow-up, performed by site research staff, by&#xD;
      telephone call, will occur at Day 21 (+/- 2 days) to assess overall disease course and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection At baseline, demographics, medical history, and history of current illness&#xD;
      will be obtained from all participants during stage 1 (pre-randomization). Vital signs will&#xD;
      be obtained and a brief physical examination will be performed. After the initial ED visit,&#xD;
      patients will record symptoms on daily basis for 6 days via an online data collection form.&#xD;
      Follow-up assessments will be completed via telehealth visit or telephone for days 7 and 21.&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will collect data regarding symptoms, adverse events and return to medical&#xD;
      care, in addition to assessing adherence to study procedures (i.e., medication adherence and&#xD;
      daily symptom diary completion). If there is concern for adverse events or deterioration that&#xD;
      may warrant medical care, the participant's caregiver will be instructed to contact their&#xD;
      primary care physician, emergency department, or call 911, as indicated.&#xD;
