  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Inadequate antibody response to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has been described&#xD;
      among kidney transplant recipients. Immunosuppression level and specifically, use of&#xD;
      antimetabolite in the maintenance immunosuppressive regimen, are associated with inadequate&#xD;
      response. In light of the severe consequences of COVID-19 in solid organ transplant&#xD;
      recipients, we believe it is justified to examine new vaccination strategies in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis: BECAME is a single center, open label, investigator-initiated&#xD;
      randomised controlled, superiority trial, aiming to compare immunosuppression reduction&#xD;
      combined with a third BNT162b2 vaccine dose versus third dose alone. The primary outcome will&#xD;
      be seropositivity rate against SARS-CoV-2. A sample size of 154 patients was calculated for&#xD;
      the seropositivity endpoint assuming 25% seropositivity in the control group and 50% in the&#xD;
      intervention group. A sample of participant per arm will be also teste for T-cell response.&#xD;
      We also plan to perform a prospective observational study, evaluating seropositivity among&#xD;
      ~350 kidney transplant recipients consenting to receive a third vaccine dose, who are not&#xD;
      eligible for the randomised controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics and dissemination: The trial is approved by local ethics committee of Rabin medical&#xD;
      center (RMC-0192- 21). Results of this trial will be published; trial data will be available.&#xD;
      Protocol amendments will be submitted to the local ethics committee.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All recipients more than 6 months post transplantation and at least 3 weeks following second&#xD;
      vaccine dose will be approached and invited to a first study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At first visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signed informed consent will be obtained from participants willing to participate by&#xD;
           study investigators who usually work in the transplantation clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anti-spike antibody response will be assessed using SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant (AbbottÂ©)&#xD;
           assay. Participants who have a documented seronegative test in the last 6 weeks will not&#xD;
           be tested again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be invited for an additional visit once negative serology will be reported,&#xD;
      within 7 days of serology collection. At this second visit all participants who gave informed&#xD;
      consent to participate in either the prospective non-randomised study or RCT will receive a&#xD;
      single vaccine dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, participants in the RCT will be randomised into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Third booster dose of BNT162b2 (one standard dose) with no change in immunosuppression&#xD;
           protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Third booster dose of BNT162b2 (one standard dose) with immunosuppression reduction&#xD;
           according to protocol (mycophenolic temporary cessation 4 days before (5 half-lives) and&#xD;
           one week (expected antibody response) after vaccination (to allow for antibody&#xD;
           response).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who will test seronegative will be informed by the study coordinator by phone in&#xD;
      which study arm they will be participating and receive instructions for immunosuppression&#xD;
      reduction both during the phone call and by written instructions provided to each patient&#xD;
      during the first visit (see Appendix). Participants in the observational study will receive a&#xD;
      third vaccine standard dose, without any change in immunosuppression (beyond routine care)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antibodies titer against spike protein will be evaluated again 2 weeks and 3, 6, 12&#xD;
           months after the third vaccine dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T-cell response will be evaluated for a subset of patients in each group (estimated 20&#xD;
           patients per arm) before booster dose, at 2 weeks after booster dose, and at 3 months.&#xD;
           For T cell response quantification peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) will be&#xD;
           stimulated for 24 hours with spike protein and secreted interferon-gamma (IFNg) will be&#xD;
           measured by ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up for adverse events, rejection and SARS-CoV-2 infection will be performed at 2&#xD;
           weeks and at three, 6 and 12 months post third vaccination dose&#xD;
