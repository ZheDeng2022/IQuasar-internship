  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is of considerable scientific and clinical importance to assess tobacco withdrawal&#xD;
      accurately since withdrawal severity is highly determinant of smoking cessation success. In&#xD;
      addition, smoking cessation pharmacotherapy produces its effects on smoking abstinence by&#xD;
      suppressing such symptoms. However, in order to ensure that a measure of tobacco withdrawal&#xD;
      is sensitive to severe withdrawal, it is essential to examine a period of unmedicated&#xD;
      abstinence. The current study aims to validate, and possibly enhance, a revised Wisconsin&#xD;
      Smoking Withdrawal Scale long and brief version for use in research and clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hundred adults who smoke cigarettes daily and report a desire to quit smoking will be&#xD;
      enrolled. This is a treatment-delay, one-group clinical trial that is intended to enhance the&#xD;
      assessment of tobacco withdrawal amongst participants who try to quit smoking with delayed&#xD;
      use of cessation medication. Participants will not receive any pharmacotherapy during the&#xD;
      first 1 week of their quit attempt and will initiate 8 weeks of combination nicotine&#xD;
      replacement therapy (C-NRT; nicotine patch + nicotine mini-lozenge) starting 1 week past the&#xD;
      target quit day (TQD). Participants will receive 4 counseling sessions as well (1 pre-quit, 3&#xD;
      post-quit). Participants will complete 4 weeks of ecological momentary assessment (EMA)&#xD;
      smartphone surveys including a 2-week baseline (starting TQD-14) and 2-week post-TQD (1-week&#xD;
      un-medicated, 1-week using C-NRT).&#xD;

    <description>Nicotine patch and mini-lozenge dosing will be based off the 2008 Public Health Services (PHS) Clinical Practice Guideline and package insert with adjustments to account for the delayed start 1-week post-TQD. All participants will receive 2mg mini-lozenge due to the superior palatability of the 2mg lozenges. Participants are encouraged to use at least 5 mini-lozenges per day for the full 8 weeks. Participants who report any smoking or nicotine use (e.g., even a cigarette puff, e-cigarette use) in the 3 days before C-NRT distribution will receive 4 weeks of 14mg and 4 weeks of 7mg nicotine patches. Participants who report complete abstinence from smoking and nicotine in the 3 days before C-NRT distribution will receive 8 weeks of 7mg nicotine patches.</description>
