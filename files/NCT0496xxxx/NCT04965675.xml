  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To find out if eptinezumab is better than placebo (normal saline solution) in lowering the&#xD;
      number of days with migraine in young people ages 12 to 17 with chronic migraine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study includes a single intravenous (IV) infusion of the study drug and consists of a&#xD;
      screening period (4 weeks), a double-blind, placebo-controlled period (12 weeks), and a&#xD;
      safety follow-up period (8 weeks). Participants confirmed eligible will be randomized (1:1:1)&#xD;
      to receive a single IV infusion of either eptinezumab 300 milligrams (mg) dose (weight&#xD;
      adjusted; targeting adult exposure after 300 mg IV), eptinezumab 100 mg (weight adjusted;&#xD;
      targeting adult exposure after 100 mg IV), or placebo at randomization visit. The doses will&#xD;
      be adjusted for the participant's body weight.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has a diagnosis of migraine (with or without aura) as defined by&#xD;
             International Classification of Headache Disorders 3 (ICHD-3) guidelines with history&#xD;
             of chronic migraine, of at least 6 months prior to the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  During the 28-day screening period, the participant must adequately complete the&#xD;
             headache eDiary on at least 24 of the 28 days following the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  During the 28-day screening period, the participant must have ≥15 to ≤26 headache&#xD;
             days, of which at least 8 are migraine days as documented in the eDiary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has previously been enrolled in this study and exposed to eptinezumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has been exposed to any monoclonal antibody treatment (including&#xD;
             exposure in a study) &lt;6 months prior to the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has been exposed to another calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)&#xD;
             antibody (including exposure in a study investigating a CGRP antibody) &lt;6 months prior&#xD;
             to the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has a history or diagnosis of complicated migraine (ICHD-3 version,&#xD;
             2018), chronic tension-type headache, hypnic headache, cluster headache, hemicrania&#xD;
             continua, new daily persistent headache, or unusual migraine subtypes such as&#xD;
             hemiplegic migraine (sporadic and familial), migraine with brainstem aura,&#xD;
             ophthalmoplegic migraine, or migraine with neurological accompaniments that are not&#xD;
             typical of migraine aura (diplopia, altered consciousness, or long duration).&#xD;
