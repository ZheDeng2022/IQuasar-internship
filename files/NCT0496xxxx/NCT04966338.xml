  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ocrelizumab produced by&#xD;
      CinnaGen compared with Ocrevus® (Roche, Switzerland) in subjects with relapsing remitting&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis (RRMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the participants will receive one of the following regimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ocrelizumab (CinnaGen) or Ocrevus® (Roche, Switzerland) ,600 mg (given as dual infusions of&#xD;
      ocrelizumab 300 mg on Days 1 and 15 of the first 24-week treatment cycle and as single&#xD;
      infusions of 600 mg on Day 1 for each 24-week treatment cycle, thereafter) every 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to verify the equivalency of Ocrelizumab (CinnaGen)&#xD;
      versus Ocrevus® (Roche, Switzerland) in reducing the annualized relapse rate (ARR) in&#xD;
      participants with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) at 2 years.&#xD;
