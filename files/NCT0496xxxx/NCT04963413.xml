  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In prior trials of CMV RNA-pulsed dendritic cell vaccines, there has been a narrow window&#xD;
      between surgery and initiation of chemoradiation to enroll patients and perform leukapheresis&#xD;
      (to obtain cells needed to generate investigational vaccine). Patients who had started&#xD;
      chemoradiation were not eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators propose to conduct a pilot study to evaluate the ability to&#xD;
      generate pp65 full-length LAMP RNA-pulsed DCs in patients who have completed standard&#xD;
      external beam radiation and concomitant temozolomide who are receiving adjuvant temozolomide&#xD;
      chemotherapy at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will enroll adult patients with newly diagnosed WHO Grade IV glioma (GBM)&#xD;
      who have completed standard of care chemoradiation and are receiving adjuvant temozolomide&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Patients will undergo leukapheresis and resume their adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      cycles following their treatment plan for 1 to 2 cycles while CMV pp65 RNA-pulsed DCs are&#xD;
      generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After QA/QC release, study Vaccine #1 will be given at day 22-24 of the TMZ cycle. All&#xD;
      patients will receive Td booster (5 Lf) with Vaccine #1 regardless of booster history.&#xD;
      Vaccine #2 and #3 will occur at 2-week intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following TMZ cycle will start about 2 weeks after Vaccine #3. Patients may complete up&#xD;
      to 6 to 12 adjuvant cycles every 5 weeks with pp65 full-length RNA-pulsed DCs administered at&#xD;
      day 22-24 of each cycle until all available vaccines are exhausted with a maximum of 10 study&#xD;
      vaccines or until disease progression (whichever comes first).&#xD;
