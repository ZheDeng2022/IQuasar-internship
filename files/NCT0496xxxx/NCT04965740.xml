  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to collect insights from first responders and military&#xD;
      personnel on their need for, use of, and interest in physical and/or mental health medical&#xD;
      marijuana or psychedelic-assisted therapy programs. These preliminary data will help to&#xD;
      inform and guide the development of a larger patient-oriented study and the design of a&#xD;
      clinical program geared towards enhancing therapy treatments for first responders and&#xD;
      military personnel.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Members of first response teams including police, firefighters, paramedics, and military&#xD;
      personnel in Canada, the United States, Oceana, and Europe will be asked to participate. The&#xD;
      majority of these teams are unionized, consisting of municipal, provincial and federally&#xD;
      organized unions throughout Canada, United States, Oceana and Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whenever possible, the research team will provide an invitation to its members via union&#xD;
      representatives. These unions are a trusted source for first responders and military&#xD;
      personnel as they are intended to have the best interests of these first responders in mind.&#xD;
      The union representatives possess the contact information of the first responders and&#xD;
      military personnel. The unions routinely circulate e-mails to members that include&#xD;
      information relevant for members such as upcoming events, important meetings, team activities&#xD;
      on and off-duty, and opportunities to participate in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emails with the link to the survey will be circulated to members approximately every month&#xD;
      for 3 months, or until at least 1000 participants have responded. The link to the survey may&#xD;
      also be shared through personal connections among first responders and/or word of mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be sent a link to open an anonymous survey which they can complete at their&#xD;
      location and time of choosing. Once the survey link has been accessed by a potential&#xD;
      participant, background information will be provided regarding the project that includes an&#xD;
      informed consent statement. Participants may leave the survey at any time should they wish to&#xD;
      discontinue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey will be distributed to first responders and military personnel using an online&#xD;
      questionnaire. This survey will contain questions about basic demographics, history of mental&#xD;
      health conditions, satisfaction with current life status, past use of cannabis and other&#xD;
      psychedelic substances, and interest and potential barriers in trying psychedelic or medical&#xD;
      marijuana-assisted physical or mental health therapy in a research or clinical context. The&#xD;
      Brief Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning (13) and a subset of questions from the National&#xD;
      Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Quick Screen (14) have been integrated into the survey to&#xD;
      enhance reliability and validity of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. Once the survey has been&#xD;
      submitted, participants will have the option to click a link to enter their email address&#xD;
      using a separate collection form, if they would like to be contacted for future research&#xD;
      opportunities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The list of email addresses will not be linked to the survey results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed from all completed (fully or partially) and submitted surveys. Every&#xD;
      question will contain a &quot;Prefer Not to Say&quot; option if a response is mandatory.&#xD;
