  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, there are no studies of the therapeutic effects of varied work-focused programs in&#xD;
      Veterans undergoing outpatient substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. The investigators&#xD;
      propose a randomized clinical trial to test the effects of work-focused programs on improving&#xD;
      sobriety and other clinical outcomes in Veterans early in the course of recovery from SUD.&#xD;
      Veterans will be randomized to either receive or not receive referral for work-focused&#xD;
      therapeutic programs. Primary aim is to examine effects of work-focused programs on sobriety&#xD;
      outcomes, namely sobriety and global functioning. Secondary aim is to examine effects of&#xD;
      work-focused programs on psychiatric symptoms, self esteem/efficacy, and quality of life.&#xD;

      The investigators propose a trial to test the effects of Incentive Therapy (IT) and Other&#xD;
      Therapeutic and Supported Employment Services (Other TSES) on improving SUD outcomes in newly&#xD;
      recovering Veterans in outpatient treatment. In line with eligibility criteria for different&#xD;
      TSES programs, the investigators will employ a two branch study: One branch will be for&#xD;
      Veterans who are not interested in pursuing competitive employment, and will be a two arm RCT&#xD;
      with randomization (2:1) to referral for IT + treatment as usual (TAU; including usual SUD&#xD;
      outpatient treatment) or TAU alone. The second branch will be for Veterans who express&#xD;
      interest in competitive employment, and will be a two arm RCT with randomization (2:1) to&#xD;
      referral for TSES competitive employment services + TAU or TAU alone. Total Intent to Treat&#xD;
      sample will be 140 (n=70 per branch). Primary outcomes will be percent days abstinent during&#xD;
      3 month active phase and clinical global impression scale scores at 6 months. Secondary&#xD;
      outcome will be psychiatric symptoms, self esteem/efficacy and quality of life.&#xD;
