    <textblock>
      This is an open-label and uncontrolled study to evaluate the comparative PK of EQ143&#xD;
      following oral single dose administration in adult healthy volunteers different racial and&#xD;

      therapy in China at the 110 mg dose for the treatment of patients with Epidermal Growth&#xD;
      Factor Receptor (EGFR) T790Mmutation-positive, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),&#xD;
      who have progressed during or after EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy.&#xD;
