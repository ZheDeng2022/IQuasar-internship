  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, sham controlled, dose finding study of the EmitBio RD-X19 device in&#xD;
      individuals with symptomatic COVID-19 in the outpatient setting. Study subjects will&#xD;
      self-administer treatment twice daily for 7 days with a one-week follow-up period at Day 14&#xD;
      (+/- 2 days) and will not be aware of which treatment group to which they have been&#xD;
      randomized. Clinical outcomes will be assessed via patient reported outcomes (questionnaire&#xD;
      and diary cards) and virologic outcomes will be assessed post baseline on Days 3, 5, 8, and&#xD;
      14 via biospecimen collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of the study is to evaluate multiple doses of the RD-X19 treatment device&#xD;
      and establish evidence for safety and efficacy for each of the RD-X19 doses compared to sham&#xD;
      in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with outpatient COVID-19. The primary efficacy outcome is&#xD;
      time to sustained symptom resolution. Other clinical and microbiological outcomes will also&#xD;
      be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability (local reactogenicity) will be assessed actively and study subject&#xD;
      diary card data recorded at each clinic visit by review of potential treatment emergent&#xD;
      adverse events (TEAEs) and targeted oral and physical examinations. Volunteers will be&#xD;
      instructed to contact designated clinical trial staff for AEs of a medically-urgent nature as&#xD;
      soon as is practically possible and to seek immediate medical care, if needed. Study subjects&#xD;
      who experience progression of disease to a grade 3 severity score (e.g SpO2 ≤ 93%, or&#xD;
      respiratory rate ≥30/ minute on room air) will be instructed to urgently seek medical care at&#xD;
      their nearest Urgent Care or Emergency Department. Study subjects who progress to severe&#xD;
      acute respiratory distress syndrome with substantial risk for mortality without immediate&#xD;
      medical intervention will be referred directly by site staff to their closest hospital. All&#xD;
      study subjects who are hospitalized will be tracked to assess time to hospital discharge or&#xD;
      death; the time and date of these events will be captured as part of the trial data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic, liver, kidney and hematological laboratory evaluations will be performed at&#xD;
      baseline and at Day 14 or early termination (and potentially during unscheduled) clinic&#xD;
      visits. Methemoglobin assessments will be performed at baseline and Day 14.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Positive for SARS-CoV-2 as detected using an FDA authorized SARS-CoV-2 antigen test at&#xD;
             or within 24 hours of the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. COVID-19 signs and symptoms within 72 hours from symptom onset, including at least two&#xD;
             moderate* or greater symptoms from: cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, headache,&#xD;
             unexplained chills and/or sweats, myalgia, fatigue, nausea (with or without vomiting).&#xD;
&#xD;
             o Alternatively, subjects with the presence of at least one moderate symptom and&#xD;
             either a) a fever with an oral temperature of at least 100.5° F or b) shortness of&#xD;
             breath/difficulty breathing on exertion (e.g., walking, going up and down stairs) are&#xD;
             also eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. BMI &lt;40&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Provides written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Be able to understand and agrees to comply with planned study procedures and be&#xD;
             available for all study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Agrees to the collection of saliva, nasopharyngeal, and venous blood specimens per&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Males or females, 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. No uncontrolled disease process(es) based on patient reported medical history (chronic&#xD;
             or acute), other than direct COVID-19 signs and symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. No physical or mental conditions or attributes at the time of screening, which in the&#xD;
             opinion of the PI, will prevent full adherence to, and completion of, the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Symptom scoring is independent from the classification of COVID-19 disease&#xD;
                  severity at baseline. Guidance to study subjects for grading of signs and&#xD;
                  symptoms will be based on definitions used for the grading of TEAEs:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  None (Grade 0): Not present&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Mild (Grade 1): Symptoms that are usually transient and may require only&#xD;
                       minimal or no palliative or specific therapeutic intervention and generally&#xD;
                       do not interfere with the subject's usual activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Moderate (Grade 2): Symptoms that are usually alleviated with palliative or&#xD;
                       specific therapeutic intervention. The symptoms interfere with usual&#xD;
                       activities of daily living causing discomfort but pose no significant or&#xD;
                       permanent risk of harm to the study subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Severe (Grade 3): Events interrupt usual activities of daily living, or&#xD;
                       significantly effect clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic&#xD;
                       intervention. Severe events are usually incapacitating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Positive urine pregnancy test at screening or females who intend to become pregnant&#xD;
             during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. COVID-19 signs associated with severe respiratory distress or imminent serious medical&#xD;
             outcomes.^^&#xD;

             generalized urticaria, angioedema, other significant reaction) to sun exposure.&#xD;

             evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Any intra-oral body piercings that cannot be removed and remain removed for the&#xD;
             duration of the study. Metal orthodontia is permitted as braces will be covered by the&#xD;
