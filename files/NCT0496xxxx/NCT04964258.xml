  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hoped that in the future, TAK-105 will be used to help treat people with nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting. The main aims of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To check for side effects from TAK-105 in healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn how much TAK-105 they can receive without getting side effects from it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive either TAK-105 or a placebo as an injection under the skin&#xD;
      (sub-cutaneous injection). A placebo looks like TAK-105 but will not have any medicine in it.&#xD;
      Three times as many participants will receive TAK-105 than placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have 4 parts. Each part will have several small groups of participants, called&#xD;
      cohorts. Participants will only be in 1 cohort in 1 part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Participants will check into the study clinic to receive a single dose of TAK-105 or&#xD;
      placebo and will stay in the clinic for about 10 days. Then, participants return to the&#xD;
      clinic for follow-up visits up to about 60 days after the dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Participants will check into the study clinic to receive TAK-105 or placebo once a&#xD;
      week for 4 weeks, and will stay in the clinic for about 26 days. Then, participants return to&#xD;
      the clinic for follow-up visits up to about 60 days after last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3: Participants will check into the study clinic to receive 2, 3 or 4 weekly doses of&#xD;
      TAK-105 or placebo. Their clinic stay will be from for 10 to 24 days depending which cohort&#xD;
      they are in. Then, participants return to the clinic for follow-up visits up to about 28 days&#xD;
      after last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 4: Participants will check into the study clinic to receive 2 doses (once a week for 2&#xD;
      weeks) of TAK-105 or placebo and will stay in the study clinic for about 12 days. They will&#xD;
      return to the clinic later (in about 1-3 weeks) for another (third) dose and will stay for 2&#xD;
      days after the third dose. Then, participants return to the clinic for follow-up visits up to&#xD;
      about 3 months after first dose.&#xD;

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-105. The study will look at the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and PK of TAK-105 in healthy participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in each cohort will be randomized to receive treatment with TAK-105 or matching&#xD;
      placebo which will remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study&#xD;
      (unless there is an urgent medical need). The study consists of 4 parts and up to 27 cohorts&#xD;
      as mentioned below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1 (SRD) will enroll healthy participants in up to 12 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2 (MRD) will enroll healthy participants in up to 5 ascending cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 3 (Dose titration) will enroll healthy participants in up to 6 multiple-dose&#xD;
           cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 4 (Redosing) will enroll healthy participants in up to 4 redosing cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cohort in all the parts will have 8 randomized participants with 6 participants&#xD;
      receiving a single dose of TAK-105, and 2 receiving TAK-105 matching placebo in a 3:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall duration of the&#xD;
      study is approximately 18 months.&#xD;

A 3-tiered ADA testing strategy will be used in this study. A Sample will initially be screened for ADA by the ADA screening assay. Any positive sample in the screening assay is considered a potential positive, which will be confirmed for true positivity by the confirmatory assay. If a sample is confirmed as an ADA true positive, ADA titer will be assessed.</description>
