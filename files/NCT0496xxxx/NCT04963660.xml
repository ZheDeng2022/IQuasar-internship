  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary immunodeficiencies represent a underdiagnosed group of rare diseases which if&#xD;
      diagnosed well and in time can be treated in an efficient manner and prevent complications&#xD;
      that may affect the quality of patients life in an severe manner. Neither in Costa Rica nor&#xD;
      in Central America studies or national registries regarding the prevalence and&#xD;
      characterization of primary immunodeficiencies in adult patients exist up to now. This study&#xD;
      reflects for the first time the epidemiologic situation of primary immunodeficiencies in a&#xD;
      Central American country, characterizing adult patients diagnosed with primary and idiopathic&#xD;
      immune disorders treated in two specialized immunodeficiency clinics in Costa Rica.&#xD;
