  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in oral health-related quality of life&#xD;
      (OHrQoL) in participants suffering from Dentinal Hypersensitivity (DH) symptoms following the&#xD;
      use of anti-sensitivity toothpaste for 24 weeks.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a virtual, prospective, twenty-four weeks, open label study in&#xD;
      participants with DH (self-reported symptoms). Participants self-perception of DH will be&#xD;
      evaluated by completion of a validated OHrQoL questionnaire (Dentin Hypersensitivity&#xD;
      Experience Questionnaire-48 [DHEQ-48]) at baseline, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks.&#xD;
