  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ITP patients with low platelet count and active bleeding symptoms are at risk of&#xD;
      life-threatening bleeding and therefore require a treatment with a rapid effect, reliable,&#xD;
      and sustained. The combination of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and prednisone (1 mg/kg&#xD;
      per day), is more rapidly and more frequently effective than high dose methylprednisolone to&#xD;
      increase the platelet count. This combination is therefore usually given in patients with&#xD;
      platelets count &lt; 20 x 109/L and moderate to severe bleeding manifestations. Based on common&#xD;
      practice in France and on French ITP guidelines, on average 50 % of patients with ITP and&#xD;
      profound thrombocytopenia do actually receive IVIg (mostly during the initial phase of the&#xD;
      disease) corresponding to approximately 1,500 ITP patients per year in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whereas IVIg is usually well tolerated, renal insufficiency and congestive heart failure may&#xD;
      occur, moreover IVIg are costly and non-easily available with supply difficulties in many&#xD;
      countries including France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High dose dexamethasone (DXM) (ie: 40 mg/d for 4 days) has recently emerged as a promising&#xD;
      treatment for ITP. One recent meta-analysis as well as a controlled prospective trial suggest&#xD;
      that the initial overall response was higher (&gt; 80 %) and the time to response was shorter&#xD;
      with dexamethasone (DXM) 40 mg/d given for 4 days compared to standard prednisone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that DXM could be a reasonable non-inferior alternative to&#xD;
      IVIg, more convenient for patients with less adverse events and economically cost-effective&#xD;
      for patients with moderate and severe bleeding manifestations.&#xD;
