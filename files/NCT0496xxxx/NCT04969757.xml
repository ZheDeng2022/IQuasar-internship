  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for end-stage renal disease in terms of&#xD;
      morbidity, mortality, and cost-benefit ratio. Graft loss is mainly related to the occurrence&#xD;
      of rejection. Hence the importance of regular monitoring to check that the graft is&#xD;
      functioning properly, to adapt immunosuppressive treatments and to check for side effects&#xD;
      related to the immunosuppressed state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conventional management, the patient is seen at regular intervals (ranging from 2 weeks to&#xD;
      3 months) in the referral transplant centre with recourse to hospitalisation if necessary. In&#xD;
      the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to reduce the risks of contamination,&#xD;
      teleconsultations have been proposed to replace face-to-face consultations. Predigraft&#xD;
      software facilitates remote patient assessment. This software provides an estimate of the&#xD;
      probability of renal graft survival at 3, 5 and 7 years of the assessment based on an&#xD;
      algorithm developed and validated by the U970 unit (Loupy A et al, BMJ 2019). The software&#xD;
      also provides an application for patients allowing secure data transfer (biological analyses,&#xD;
      blood pressure, weight). This allows the assessment of the need for additional patient&#xD;
      evaluation based on usual monitoring parameters (creatinine, proteinuria) that can be done in&#xD;
      the analysis laboratory near the patient's home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A first evaluation of the use and acceptability among care professionals has been conducted&#xD;
      between April and June 2020 and showed excellent results. It is now necessary to obtain&#xD;
      real-life data to evaluate the use of the tool among patients and healthcare professionals&#xD;
      and its impact on the organisation of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective interventional study with minimal risks and constraints on the active&#xD;
      file of transplant patients followed in ambulatory care for a period of 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study will be to evaluate the use of the Predigraft platform by kidney&#xD;
      transplant patients.&#xD;

SF-36 is a set of generic, coherent, and easily administered quality-of-life measures. The SF-36 assesses different dimensions of feeling healthy and well being using 11 questions.These measures rely upon patient self-reporting.. In two dimensions, the answer is binary (yes / no) and in the other 6 in ordinal quality (3 to 6 possible answers). A high score means a better quality of life.</description>
