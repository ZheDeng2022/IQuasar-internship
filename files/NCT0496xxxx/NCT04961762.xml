  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals experiencing homelessness often have complex health and social needs. This&#xD;
      population also faces disproportionate systemic barriers to accessing health care services&#xD;
      and social supports, such as not having primary care providers, needing to meet other&#xD;
      competing priorities, and difficulties affording medications. These barriers contribute to&#xD;
      discontinuities in care, poor health outcomes, and high acute healthcare utilization after&#xD;
      hospitalization among this population. This randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of a case management intervention (the Navigator program) for individuals experiencing&#xD;
      homelessness who have been admitted to hospital for medical conditions. This study will&#xD;
      examine outcomes over a 180-day period after hospital discharge, including follow-up with&#xD;
      primary care providers, acute healthcare utilization, quality of care transitions, and&#xD;
      overall health.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Follow-Up with Primary Care Provider (PCP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 14 Days of Discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Occurrence of a follow-up visit with a PCP (family physician or nurse practitioner). In-person encounters (e.g., ambulatory clinics, shelter clinics, and community health centers), virtual encounters (with video), and phone calls (without video) will be considered as follow-up visits. These modes of PCP follow-up are consistent with those outlined by quality standards from Health Quality Ontario. The investigators will ascertain PCP follow-up through both participant self-report at the 30-day interview and by contact with the PCP office. Ascertainment will be based on the PCP office's report if the participant is unreachable, or by participant self-report if the PCP office is unreachable. In the event of any discrepancy, the report of the PCP office will take precedence over participant self-report.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Composite All-Cause Hospital Readmission or Mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 30, 90, and 180 Days of Discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Hospital readmissions will be ascertained from the 30-day interview and administrative databases at ICES. Mortality data will be collected from hospital charts, follow-up with community contacts, or administrative databases at ICES. (Hospital readmissions exclude elective or scheduled admissions, labor and delivery visits, and transfers between services [i.e., from medicine to psychiatry] within the hospital.)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Reported Experience of Care Transition</measure>
    <time_frame>At 30-Day Follow-Up Interview</time_frame>
    <description>Ascertained with the Care Transitions Measure-3 (CTM-3). The CTM-3 is an abbreviated version of the original CTM-15, which measures the extent to which the healthcare team accomplished essential care processes in preparing the patient for discharge and participating in post-hospital self-care activities.&#xD;
The CTM-3 consists of 3 items with a 4-point scale with responses ranging from &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; (1) to &quot;Strongly Agree&quot; (4) to the following questions:&#xD;
During this hospital stay, staff took my preferences into account in deciding what my healthcare needs would be when I left.&#xD;
When I left the hospital, I had a good understanding of the things I was responsible for in managing my health.&#xD;
When I left the hospital, I clearly understood the purpose for taking each of my medications&#xD;
Items are scored by summing the responses and then linear transforming to a 0-100 range. Higher scores indicate better self-reported experience of care transition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Competing Priorities</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and At 30-Day Follow-Up Interview</time_frame>
    <description>Ascertained with the RAND Course of Homelessness Scale. Developed specifically for the homeless population, the RAND scale is a 5-item index of self-reported difficulty in meeting the following subsistence needs over the past 30 days: frequency of difficulty in finding shelter, enough to eat, clothing, a place to wash, and a place to use the bathroom. Possible responses to each item are never (1), rarely (2), sometimes (3), or usually (4) with total scores between 5-20. Higher scores indicate more difficulty in meeting subsistence needs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Health Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and At 30-Day Follow-Up Interview</time_frame>
    <description>Ascertained with the EQ-5D-3L (EuroQol-5 Dimensions-3 Levels). The EQ-5D-3L is a generic measure of health-related quality of life that has been widely used among the homeless population. The EQ-5D-3L includes five 3-level items concerning mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression that are weighted to produce a single utility score between 0 and 1. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of the EQ-5D-3L will also be included, which will allow participants to rate their overall health, mental health, and physical health from 0 to 100.</description>

    <measure>Medication Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>At 30-Day Follow-Up Interview</time_frame>
    <description>Ascertained with the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale 8 (MMAS-8). The MMAS-8 consists of 8 items, the first 7 of which are yes/no questions, and the last of which is a 5-point Likert-scale rating. Total MMAS-8 scores can range from 0 to 8 and have been categorized into three levels of adherence: high adherence (score = 8), medium adherence (score of 6 to 8), and low adherence (score&lt; 6).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Connection to Case Manager</measure>
    <time_frame>At 30-Day Follow-Up Interview</time_frame>
    <description>Connection to a case manager after hospital discharge will be assessed only among participants who report no contact with a case manager in the 30 days prior to their baseline interview.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Attendance of non-PCP Health Care Appointment</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 180 Days of Discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Non-PCP health care appointments are defined as appointments with any medical specialist or health care provider other than the participant's family physician or nurse practitioner. Only appointments documented in the discharge summary will be assessed for attendance. Attendance will be ascertained by contacting the health care provider.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Composite All-Cause Hospital Readmission or Mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 180 Days of Discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Time to all-cause hospital readmission or mortality is defined as the number of days from hospital discharge to the first all-cause hospital readmission or mortality during the 180-day observation period.</description>

    <description>In addition to receiving Standard Care, participants in the intervention arm will be assigned to a Homeless Outreach Counsellor. The Homeless Outreach Counsellor will connect with the participant as soon as possible during the admission and will provide support during the hospital admission and for approximately 90 days after hospital discharge.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Standard Care</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Standard Care consists of support from Care Transition Facilitators who work with patients during their hospital stay to arrange discharge plans and make follow-up arrangements. Care Transition Facilitators do not routinely work with patients after hospital discharge. As part of the routine discharge process, the health care team provides patients with medical recommendations, appointments for follow-up care as needed, a written discharge summary, and prescriptions as needed. If the patient has an identified primary care provider, a copy of the discharge summary is sent electronically to the primary care provider.</description>

    <description>The main role of the Homeless Outreach Counsellor is to support continuity and comprehensiveness of care by helping participants follow their post-discharge plans and facilitating strong links with community-based health and social services. The Homeless Outreach Counsellor also helps address specific needs of participants, develop comprehensive care plans with members of patient's multidisciplinary circle of care, and facilitate the transition of clients to long-term community-based health and social services.</description>
