  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, transplantation centers across North America generally do not offer longitudinal&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs and research is urgently needed to test the acceptability and&#xD;
      effectiveness of these programs using innovative delivery strategies that have the potential&#xD;
      for future scalability and to understand the associated costs. Through a strong collaboration&#xD;
      between the PM Cancer Rehabilitation and Survivorship (CRS) and alloBMT teams, the principal&#xD;
      investigators developed an innovative multicomponent rehabilitation intervention for patients&#xD;
      undergoing alloBMT (CaRE-4-alloBMT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CaRE-4-alloBMT uses a person- centred strategy and a multidimensional approach targeting&#xD;
      physical activity, nutrition, psychosocial distress and promoting self-management skills.&#xD;
      Innovative components of CaRE-4-alloBMT include:1) Individualized progressive exercise&#xD;
      prescriptions developed and monitored by CRS registered kinesiologists and supported with a&#xD;
      web/mobile application (Physitrack) that allows customizable exercise prescriptions, tracking&#xD;
      of exercise completion, and video tutorials; 2) Individualized nutrition plans and stepped&#xD;
      stratified care (education, counselling, intervention) based on nutritional status and&#xD;
      delivered by registered dietitians (alloBMT and CRS). 3) On-line e-modules (developed in&#xD;
      collaboration with PM Oncology Education) provide interactive education to promote&#xD;
      self-management skills on crucial topics; 4) Remote monitoring using FitbitTM devices to&#xD;
      monitor patients physical activity, caloric intake, and sleep for duration of the program; 5)&#xD;
      Remote clinical support: Pre/Post discharge, patients will have scheduled (PHS) remote&#xD;
      check-ins and health coaching sessions with a member of the CRS team (phone or MS Teams&#xD;
      video).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: i) To test the feasibility and safety of CaRE-4-alloBMT plus standard best&#xD;
      practice cancer care compared to standard best practice cancer care alone; ii) To assess the&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of CaRE-4-alloBMT on physical function, disability, nutritional status,&#xD;
      distress, QoL, healthcare utilization, and survival and estimate program return on&#xD;
      investment.&#xD;

      1.0 BACKGROUND: Allogeneic blood and marrow transplantation (alloBMT) is a curative treatment&#xD;
      for many hematologic cancers and its use has increased rapidly over the past decade. While&#xD;
      effective, alloBMT is associated with numerous treatment-related physical and psychosocial&#xD;
      side effects, reduced physical functioning, and worsening nutritional status which are&#xD;
      associated with increased risk of complications (i.e. infections, drug toxicity, weight loss,&#xD;
      graft failure &amp; graft-versus-host disease), significant early and late treatment related&#xD;
      mortality, and can profoundly affect quality of life (QoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, there have been calls for increased attention to the management of adverse&#xD;
      effects associated with alloBMT with the goal to minimize dysfunction, maximize well-being&#xD;
      and QoL, and reduce treatment-related mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer rehabilitation is now considered an essential component of cancer care and focuses on&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of the adverse effects of cancer and treatment and to optimize&#xD;
      functional status and QoL. Embedding multidimensional longitudinal (pre to post transplant)&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs that focus on exercise, nutrition and teaching self-management skills&#xD;
      as a standard part of treatment for individuals undergoing alloBMT has potential to mediate&#xD;
      the significant adverse effects, improve survival, and reduce burden on the healthcare&#xD;
      system. While patients typically receive some in-patient rehabilitation, this is a small part&#xD;
      of the alloBMT pathway and services are quite limited. Currently, transplantation centers&#xD;
      across North America generally do not offer longitudinal rehabilitation programs and research&#xD;
      is urgently needed to test the acceptability and effectiveness of these programs using&#xD;
      innovative delivery strategies that have the potential for future scalability and to&#xD;
      understand the associated costs. In response, through a strong collaboration between the PM&#xD;
      Cancer Rehabilitation and Survivorship (CRS) and alloBMT teams, the principal investigators&#xD;
      developed an innovative multicomponent rehabilitation intervention for patients undergoing&#xD;
      alloBMT (CaRE-4-alloBMT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION (see Appendix 1): CaRE-4-alloBMT is a longitudinal 6-month&#xD;
      rehabilitation program (peri to post transplant) adapted from an existing evidence-based and&#xD;
      effective model developed by the CRS team (CaRE@ELLICSR and CaRE@Home). The program is&#xD;
      informed by established behaviour change theory and harnesses current and emerging eHealth&#xD;
      technologies to reduce barriers to accessing and providing cancer rehabilitation.&#xD;
      CaRE-4-alloBMT uses a person- centred strategy and a multidimensional approach targeting&#xD;
      physical activity, nutrition, psychosocial distress and promoting self-management skills.&#xD;
      Innovative components of CaRE-4-alloBMT include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Individualized progressive exercise prescriptions developed and monitored by CRS&#xD;
           registered kinesiologists and supported with a web/mobile application (Physitrack) that&#xD;
           allows customizable exercise prescriptions, tracking of exercise completion, and video&#xD;
           tutorials. The initial personalized exercise program will be given to a participant&#xD;
           following the initial assessment. A program will be created based on the specific needs&#xD;
           and physical condition of each participant. The participant will receive the detailed&#xD;
           exercise program via Physitrack (includes exercise description and videos of each&#xD;
           exercise). Each exercise program will contain cardiovascular and strength training as&#xD;
           well as stretching exercises. The exercise program will be revised and progressions will&#xD;
           be added based on the individual's needs after the follow-up assessments or during the&#xD;
           scheduled check-ins between assessments. Check-ins are scheduled as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At 2 and 4 weeks after initial assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  8 weekly check-ins following discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At 10 and 12 weeks following discharge The participant can contact the&#xD;
                Kinesiologist by e-mail at any point during the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Individualized nutrition plans and stepped stratified care (education, counselling,&#xD;
           intervention) based on nutritional status and delivered by registered dietitians&#xD;
           (alloBMT and CRS). As part of standard of care, all patients receive a nutrition&#xD;
           assessment and their caloric intake goals are set. Those in the INT arm (CaRE-4-alloBMT&#xD;
           plus usual care group) will receive additional nutritional education through the&#xD;
           e-modules and monitoring of caloric intake through the Fitbit. They will also have&#xD;
           access to meal preparation and recipes through ellicsrkitche.ca. Patients can track&#xD;
           their nutritional intake on their Fitbit device and this data will be monitored weekly&#xD;
           by the RKin. Patients who falls below 50% of their goals (based on intake assessment)&#xD;
           will flagged to the RD for follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. On-line e-modules (developed in collaboration with PM Oncology Education) provide&#xD;
           interactive education to promote self-management skills on crucial topics (i.e. stress&#xD;
           management, nutrition, managing common symptoms). There will be 9 online e-modules:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Introduction: Getting started&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Eat and Cook for Wellness&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Manage Your Emotions&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Reduce Fatigue&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Being Mindful&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Boost Your Brain Health&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stay Connected&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Planning for the Future Participants will be asked to complete all 9 modules. Each&#xD;
                module should take between 20-30 minutes to complete. Participants can go through&#xD;
                these modules at their own pace. Patients will receive a link for the online&#xD;
                modules. Patients will be able to access the module by entering their e-mail&#xD;
                address and creating their own unique password.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Remote monitoring using FitbitTM devices to monitor patients physical activity, caloric&#xD;
           intake, and sleep for duration of the program. CRS and alloBMT clinicians will have&#xD;
           access to real-time Fitbit data through the clinical dashboard (developed in&#xD;
           collaboration with TECHNA). The Fitbit is also known to promote behaviours change and&#xD;
           allows for self-monitoring and feedback. Participants will be asked to wear the Fitbit&#xD;
           for the duration of the study. Participants will only need to add their meals to monitor&#xD;
           their nutrition. No other action is required from the participants once the account has&#xD;
           been created. This will replace the paper based food diary they must keep (standard of&#xD;
           care). The account for the participant will be created by the RA or RKin and the&#xD;
           participant will then be able to access the app via an email link. The RA or RKin can&#xD;
           assist/provide support to the participant as needed to access the app. If the&#xD;
           participant is unable to download or use the app a detailed print out of their exercise&#xD;
           program will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following information will be required to create an account:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  First name&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Last name (participant study number will be entered in this field&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Year of birth&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Email address Both the participant and Kinesiology team will have access to this&#xD;
                information but the account information is not visible to third parties. Physitrack&#xD;
                provides links to the privacy policy and terms of use/agreement and is available&#xD;
                for the participant to review as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Remote clinical support: Pre/Post discharge, patients will have scheduled (PHS) remote&#xD;
           check-ins and health coaching sessions with a member of the CRS team (phone or MS Teams&#xD;
           video). These occur in week 2,4 (pre) and 1-8,10,12 (post-discharge).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequency of check-ins and what will be discussed: Check-ins are by telephone or MSteams&#xD;
      video and scheduled as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 2 and 4 weeks after initial assessment (pre-BMT admission)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weeks 1-8, 10 and 12 post-discharge (post-BMT dischange)&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Check-ins discussion using motivational interviewing techniques and focus on&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adherence to exercise program&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes to exercise program based on participant's needs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Module completion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Answering participants questions The program strongly aligns with the SUNDAE framework&#xD;
