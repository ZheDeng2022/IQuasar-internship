      Aim: The purpose of this prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled study was to&#xD;
      compare the preoperative oral tramadol medication with ibuprofen and acetaminophen on the&#xD;
      success of inferior alveolar nerve blocks (IANB) of mandibular posterior teeth in patients&#xD;
      experiencing symptomatic irreversible pulpitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The study included five study groups, each consists of 50 patients who exhibited&#xD;
      symptomatic irreversible pulpitis of a mandibular first or second molar. The patients&#xD;
      received identically appearing capsules containing either tramadol 50 mg, tramadol 100 mg,&#xD;
      ibuprofen 600 mg, ibuprofen 600 mg/acetaminophen 1000 mg or placebo by mouth 60 min before&#xD;
      the administration of an IANB. Endodontic access was begun 15 min after completion of the&#xD;
      IANB, and all patients used for data analysis had profound lip numbness. The IANB success was&#xD;
      defined as no or mild pain (visual analog scale recordings) on pulpal access or&#xD;
      instrumentation. The data were analysed using chi-square χ2 and Kruskal-Wallis tests.&#xD;

      This study was designed as a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
      This trial was carried out according to the latest update of the Declaration of Helsinki&#xD;
      guidelines (October 2013) and approved by the Vision Colleges Research Ethics Committee&#xD;
      (approval number 20-5/2). The patients were pre-selected to participate based on a&#xD;
      preoperative pain scale of preliminary clinical assessment following the guidelines suggested&#xD;
      by the CONSORT group for planning and reporting clinical trials. A total of 275 adult&#xD;
      patients were screened for participation in this study. They were emergency patients of the&#xD;
      Vision Colleges Dental Clinics and were in good health based on their medical histories and&#xD;
      oral questioning. Subjects who were less than 18 years old, had a history of serious medical&#xD;
      problems, had used central nervous system depressants or any analgesic medication within the&#xD;
      previous 6 hours, were pregnant or were unable to give informed consent were all excluded&#xD;
      from the study. Finally, 50 patients were enrolled in each group, for a total of 250&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria were active pain in a mandibular molar first or/and the second molar,&#xD;
      prolonged response to cold testing (Endo-frost; Roeko, Langenau, Germany), absence of any&#xD;
      periapical radiolucency on periapical radiographs, and a vital coronal pulp on access&#xD;
      opening. The Modified Dental Anxiety Scale assessed the level of anxiety among the patients.&#xD;
      The pain of the patients was categorized into four categories using the Heft-Parker visual&#xD;
      analogue scale (HP VAS):&#xD;
&#xD;
      0 mm: no pain 0-54 mm: faint, weak, or mild 55-114 mm: moderate pain &gt;114 mm: strong,&#xD;
      intense, and maximum possible All patients were randomly divided using block randomisation to&#xD;
      ensure the homogeneity of the five groups. The patients were randomly given tramadol 50 mg,&#xD;
      tramadol 100 mg, ibuprofen 600 mg, ibuprofen 600 mg/acetaminophen 1000 mg or placebo by mouth&#xD;
      60 min before administering IANB. To blind the experiment, each of the 50 patients in each&#xD;
      group was randomly allocated a code consists of 2 letters and one number. Only the random&#xD;
      numbers identified the medications; thus, the patient and doctor were uninformed of which&#xD;
      medication was given to them. The medication and placebo were blinded in the following way.&#xD;
      In opaque yellow size &quot;000&quot; capsules, a certified pharmacist prepared identical-appearing&#xD;
      capsules of the medications and placebo in identical separate containers for each medication.&#xD;
      At 60 minutes after receiving the medication or placebo, the operator used a cotton tip&#xD;
      applicator to put anaesthetic gel (20 percent benzocaine; Patterson Dental Supply, Inc, St&#xD;
      Paul, MN, USA) at the IANB injection site for 60 s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants were then given regular IANB injections and 0.9 mL long buccal injections&#xD;
      containing 2% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine (Xylocaine; Astra Zeneca LP, Dentsply,&#xD;
      York, PA, USA). The first author used self-aspirating syringes (Septodont,&#xD;
      Sant-Maur-des-Fosses Cedex, France) and 27-G long needles to inject the anaesthetic solution&#xD;
      (Septoject, Septodont). Each patient was asked for lip numbness every 5 min for 15 min after&#xD;
      the IANB. The block was considered missed if substantial lip numbness was not reported by 15&#xD;
      min, and the participant was excluded from the trial. Due to a lack of lip numbness, no&#xD;
      patients were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After that, a rubber dam was used to isolate the teeth and endodontic access was conducted.&#xD;
      During the endodontic process, patients were asked to rate any pain they experienced. If the&#xD;
      patient was in pain, the treatment was stopped, and the patient used the HP VAS to rate&#xD;
      his/her discomfort. The success of the IANB was defined as the ability to access and clean&#xD;
      and shape the tooth without pain (VAS score of 0) or mild pain (VAS rating ≤54 mm). The&#xD;
      rubber dam was removed if the patient had moderate or severe pain (VAS rating ≥ 55 mm), and a&#xD;
      buccal infiltration of a cartridge containing 4% articaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine&#xD;
      (Septocaine; Septodont) was administrated buccally to the tooth that required emergency&#xD;
      treatment. After 5 min, the rubber dam was replaced, and endodontic access was continued. The&#xD;
      success of the buccal infiltration was defined as the ability to access and instrument the&#xD;
      tooth without pain (VAS score of 0) or with mild pain (VAS rating ≤54 mm). Intraosseous&#xD;
      anaesthesia was administrated to the patients who still had moderate to severe pain. The&#xD;
      intraosseous injection was administrated with the Stabident intraosseous anaesthetic system&#xD;
      (Fairfax Dental Inc, Miami, Fl, USA) using a cartridge of 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000&#xD;
      epinephrine as described previously. If that was not successful, an intrapulpal injection was&#xD;
      given, and endodontic debridement was completed. The extent of access preparation and/or&#xD;
      instrumentation was recorded as within dentine, within pulp space, and instrumentation of&#xD;
      canals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VAS satisfaction form was used to record the post-treatment satisfaction of the patient.&#xD;
      The patient was asked to draw a vertical line on the VAS (0-100 mm) to indicate their&#xD;
      satisfaction with the entire treatment. The VAS was classified into four categories; 0: not&#xD;
      satisfied, &gt;0 mm and ≤33 mm: somewhat satisfied, &gt;33 mm but &lt;66 mm: moderately satisfied and&#xD;
      ≥66 mm: completely satisfied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data of the study were collected and statistically analysed (SPSS 22.0 software; IBM Corp.,&#xD;
      Armonk, NY, USA) using chi-square χ2 test to compare between different groups for anaesthetic&#xD;
      success, gender, and tooth type. Normality of data was tested by Shapiro-Wilk test. The&#xD;
      Modified Dental Anxiety Scale, age, and initial pain ratings were analysed by using&#xD;
      Kruskal-Wallis test. The level of statistical significance was set at P &lt; 0.05. GPower v3.1.3&#xD;
      software (University of Düsseldorf; Düsseldorf, Germany) was used to calculate the sample&#xD;
      size. According to a power analysis, a sample size of 50 patients per group meets the&#xD;
      constraints of 0.05 and power = 0.95.&#xD;

    <description>At 60 minutes after receiving the medication or placebo, the participants were then given inferior alveolar nerve block injection. Each patient was asked for lip numbness every 5 minutes for 15 minutes after inferior alveolar nerve block injection. During the endodontic process, patients were asked to rate any pain they experienced on a Heft-Parker visual analog scale. The number of millimeters along the scale were reported. No pain corresponded to 0 mm. Mild pain was defined as greater than 0 mm and less than or equal to 54 mm. Mild pain included the descriptors of &quot;faint&quot;, &quot;weak&quot;, and &quot;mild pain&quot;. Moderate pain was defined as greater than 54 mm and less than 114 mm and included the descriptor &quot;moderate&quot;. Severe pain was defined as equal to or greater than 114 mm up to and including 170 mm. Severe pain included the descriptors of &quot;strong&quot;, &quot;intense&quot;, and &quot;maximum possible.&quot;</description>
