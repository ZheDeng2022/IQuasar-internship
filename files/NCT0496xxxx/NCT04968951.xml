  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers intend to prospectively study the safety, clinical efficacy and microbial&#xD;
      outcomes in patients with recently diagnosed UC with FMT capsule therapy derived from&#xD;
      pre-defined donors. Donors will be specifically screened for Fusobacterium and Sutterella&#xD;
      species as well as for global diversity. It is unknown if treatment with antibiotics before&#xD;
      FMT improves the engraftment and/or efficacy of FMT in UC, therefore the researchers plan to&#xD;
      randomize subjects to receive pre-treatment with antibiotics or not before FMT therapy. The&#xD;
      research team enroll patients from The Susan and Leonard Feinstein IBD Center and our&#xD;
      established early diagnosis clinic at Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label two arm pilot study to measure the safety, microbiological and clinical&#xD;
      impacts of FMT in patients with ulcerative colitis. The researchers will prospectively enroll&#xD;
      16 UC patients (up to 20 subjects accounting for subjects dropping out) with moderate-severe&#xD;
      disease from one tertiary care referral center. The overall objective of the study is to&#xD;
      collect robust clinical data and create a tissue repository including blood, stool and&#xD;
      biopsies to understand the safety, efficacy and microbial changes FMT has on UC patients. The&#xD;
      central hypothesis is that pre-defined oral capsule administered FMT is safe and effective&#xD;
      for the treatment of UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To determine the tolerability, feasibility, and safety of using fecal microbiota&#xD;
      transplantation orally as an induction agent for patients with ulcerative colitis. To&#xD;
      determine whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) delivered via oral capsules can&#xD;
      induce clinical remission in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Assess&#xD;
      whether pretreatment with antibiotics improves engraftment and efficacy of FMT in UC. To&#xD;
      characterize the impact of orally administered FMT on the microbiota of patients with&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis, particularly those changes associated with response or lack of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Outcomes: Clinical remission at Week 8, defined as: Steroid-free clinical remission&#xD;
      (Total Mayo less 2) and Endoscopic remission (Mayo endoscopic subscore 0 or 1)&#xD;
