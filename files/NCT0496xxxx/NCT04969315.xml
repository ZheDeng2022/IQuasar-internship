  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of orally administered&#xD;
      TT-10 in subjects with advanced selected solid tumors. The dose escalation portion of the&#xD;
      study will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      TT-10.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Multicenter, open-label dose-escalation Phase I/II clinical study, designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, PK, PD, anti-tumor activity, and efficacy of TT-10 in subjects&#xD;
      diagnosed with advanced Renal cell cancer (RCC), castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)&#xD;
      and Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); who have failed or are not eligible for standard of&#xD;
      care treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two phases. Dose escalation (Phase 1) will be to determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      TT-10 in subjects with advanced subjects diagnosed with advanced Renal cell cancer (RCC),&#xD;
      castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); who have&#xD;
      failed or are not eligible for standard of care treatment. Dose expansion (Phase 2) will be&#xD;
      to further explore the safety and tolerability of the MTD and/or RP2D, PK, PD, anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity, and efficacy of TT-10.&#xD;
