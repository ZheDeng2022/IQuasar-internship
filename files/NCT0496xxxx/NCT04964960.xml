      The goal of this study is to evaluate whether providing Pembrolizumab prolongs survival and&#xD;
      preserves quality of life while minimizing side effects for patients with NSCLC with&#xD;
      untreated asymptomatic brain metastasis.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in patient-reported cognitive functioning - Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive (FACT-Cog)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months (Baseline, 3 months post-enrollment, 6 months post-enrollment, 9 months post-enrollment, 12 months post enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT-Cog questionnaire was developed to assess perceived cognitive function and impact on quality of life (QOL) in cancer patients. The level of perceived cognitive impairments is measured on a four-point Likert scale (4 = several times a day to 0 = never) FACT-Cog has been widely administered across clinical settings and validated across different cultures and languages. Subjects can complete it in 5 minutes. A higher score indicates a better quality of life/cognitive function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life - Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months (Baseline, 3 months post-enrollment, 6 months post-enrollment, 9 months post-enrollment, 12 months post enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT-Br is a commonly used instrument measuring general quality of life (QOL) that reflects symptoms or problems associated with brain malignancies across 5 subscales. The level of well-being is measured on a four-point Likert scale (4 = very much to 0 = not at all). The measure yields information about total quality of life, as well as information about the dimensions of physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being, and disease-specific concerns. The score range is 0-200 where a higher score indicated a better quality of life. The FACT-Br is written at the 4th grade reading level, and subjects can complete it in 5-10 minutes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life - FACIT Fatigue Scale (FACIT-F)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months (Baseline, 3 months post-enrollment, 6 months post-enrollment, 9 months post-enrollment, 12 months post enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>FACIT-F is a short, 13-item, easy to administer tool that measures an individual's level of fatigue during their usual daily activities over the past week. The level of fatigue is measured on a four-point Likert scale (4 = not at all fatigued to 0 = very much fatigued) with a score range of 0-52. Subjects can complete the questionnaire in 2-3 minutes and the higher the score, the better the quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mild cognitive impairment (MoCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months (Baseline, 3 months post-enrollment, 6 months post-enrollment, 9 months post-enrollment, 12 months post enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>Neurocognitive functioning will be evaluated utilizing the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). MoCA assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. Participants will complete the MoCA (estimated time 10 minutes). The MoCA is scored to obtain an item total, scores can range from 0 to 30 and score of 26 or above is considered normal.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in performance status</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months (Baseline, 3 months post-enrollment, 6 months post-enrollment, 9 months post-enrollment, 12 months post enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>Participant performance status will be evaluated utilizing the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECGO) performance status instrument. Performance status is graded from 0-5 where lower scores indicate better performance/patient daily living abilities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Immune based biomarker activity</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks (Baseline, 6 weeks after baseline, 6 weeks after prior collection)</time_frame>
    <description>PD-1 and several immune-based markers, such as cytotoxic T cells, will be measured and summarized descriptively. Correlations with PD-1 and between markers will be estimated using Pearson or Spearman's correlation coefficient. Exploratory association of these biological markers with DCR will be performed using two-group comparison tests. Adjustment for multiple testing due to several immune-based markers will be considered using Holm's p-value adjustment method.</description>
