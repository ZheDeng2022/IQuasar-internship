      The purpose of this study is to test an ideated product concept with an intended use as a&#xD;
      blood-based testing alternative for patients with symptoms of recurrent metastatic breast&#xD;
      cancer when surgical tissue biopsy is infeasible or invasive biopsy is medically&#xD;
      contraindicated. The intended use is to aid in the diagnosis of suspected breast cancer&#xD;
      recurrence &amp; provide standard of care Hormone Receptor (HR)/HER2 status, which inform&#xD;
      immediate treatment decisions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 276,480 women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in the US in 2020.&#xD;
      Most women with breast cancer present with disease confined to the breast and local lymph&#xD;
      nodes, where sampling and/or removal of lesions is standard of care and well-managed. Those&#xD;
      diagnosed and treated for primary breast cancer often recur with metastatic disease more than&#xD;
      5 years after initial diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sadly, when lesions emerge in other areas, after months or decades with no evidence of&#xD;
      disease, mortality rates rise. The most common sites of distant recurrence of breast cancer&#xD;
      are the bone, lung, liver, and brain, all of which are difficult to biopsy, may not yield&#xD;
      sufficient sample to test, or may be unsafe or at least uncomfortable procedures for the&#xD;
      patient. As a result, at a critical point in patient care, there is still a current unmet&#xD;
      need for diagnostic information to guide decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also contributing to this data gap are the tissue biopsies with discrepant, unreliable,&#xD;
      indeterminant, unactionable, or untimely reported results. Based on discussions, interviews,&#xD;
      and surveys of both thought-leading academics and community-based medical oncologists, there&#xD;
      is an evident opportunity to improve patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this clinical trial the purpose is to examine the potential of blood draws as a rapid and&#xD;
      less invasive alternative to biopsies. Additionally, to compare the results of a liquid&#xD;
      biopsy test currently in development with results from standard-of-care (SoC) pathology&#xD;
      results from tissue biopsies in the same setting.&#xD;
