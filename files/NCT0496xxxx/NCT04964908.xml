      A Multicenter Retrospective Study to understand the clinical characteristics, treatment&#xD;
      pathway and resource utilization for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia A&#xD;
      retrospective, multi-centre, observational study to describe disease characteristics,&#xD;
      treatment patterns, treatment-related outcomes, and resource utilization for Chronic&#xD;

      CREEK is a retrospective, observational, registry-based study including patients with an&#xD;
      incidental diagnosis of CLL and started treatment (1st line, 2nd line, or Subsequent lines of&#xD;
      treatment) within the period between 01 June 2016 and 12 months before data collection as&#xD;
      identified from the patient records (from participating hospitals across the GCC States and&#xD;
      the International region countries) with at least 12 months of follow-up, after starting on&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the study will include a pilot cohort in the GCC as an exploratory objective to&#xD;
      describe the clinical and patient characteristics for the treatment-naive CLL patient&#xD;
