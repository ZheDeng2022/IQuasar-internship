  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis users who experienced a psychosis are particularly vulnerable to cannabis-related&#xD;
      harms, which can include worse psychotic symptoms and more hospitalizations. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      few psychosocial interventions exist that aim to decrease these harms. Instead, most focus on&#xD;
      ceasing cannabis use which is rarely appealing to cannabis users. Furthermore, face-to-face&#xD;
      psychotherapy often remains inaccessible to people with psychosis mostly due to lack of&#xD;
      trained clinicians. Alternatives such as e-interventions have the potential to increase&#xD;
      access to treatment and decrease clinicians' workload. Among cannabis harm reduction&#xD;
      approaches are the protective behavioural strategies. These strategies do not encourage nor&#xD;
      discourage cannabis use. Instead, they recommend behaviours for safer cannabis use. For&#xD;
      example, these strategies include: 1) avoid driving a car under the influence of cannabis, 2)&#xD;
      avoid mixing cannabis with other drugs and 3) purchase cannabis only from a trusted source.&#xD;
      In the present pan-Canadian study, we will test the first e-intervention called CHAMPS&#xD;
      (Cannabis Harm-reducing App for Managing Practices Safely) for cannabis harm reduction&#xD;
      adapted for young adult cannabis users who experienced a psychosis. CHAMPS is a smartphone&#xD;
      application that includes 17 strategies for safer cannabis use, a personalized consumption&#xD;
      goal and a consumption journal. The goals of this study are 1) to confirm whether CHAMPS is&#xD;
      acceptable to participants and 2) to test whether it works, notably by positively impacting&#xD;
      participants' health and cannabis consumption habits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicentric, two-arm, open-labelled, pilot randomized controlled trial involves 100&#xD;
      young cannabis users who experienced a psychosis and are followed in an early intervention&#xD;
      service (EIS) in Canada. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two&#xD;
      interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CHAMPS and EIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EIS alone&#xD;
&#xD;
      The smartphone application CHAMPS contains six modules (each lasting 15-20 min, weeks 1 to 6)&#xD;
      and a booster session (20 min, week 10) based on motivational interviewing and harm reduction&#xD;
      approaches. EIS consists of standard of care and psychoeducation material on cannabis use&#xD;
      offered in first episode psychosis clinics and administered through in-person visits and/or&#xD;
      phone or video calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be assessed for a follow-up at weeks 6, 12 and 18. Data on mental&#xD;
      health, substance use, cannabis dependence severity, cannabis-related problems, quality of&#xD;
      life and health care service utilization will be obtained through questionnaires and medical&#xD;
      charts.&#xD;

    <description>The Cannabis Harm-reducing App for Managing Practices Safely (CHAMPS) is a brief harm reduction e-intervention based on the principles of motivational interviewing and harm reduction approaches. This e-intervention will be completed by the participant using a smart phone. There will be a total of six individual sessions each lasting 15-20 min. There will be one booster session offered at 4 weeks post-intervention to review goal setting, evaluate motivation around changing cannabis use practices. This e-intervention will be administered adjunctively to psychosis early intervention services (EIS).</description>

    <description>Early intervention services (EIS) for psychosis will be offered as per standard of care at participating clinical sites. Theses services vary but typically include pharmacotherapy and individual and/or group psychotherapy. Any visits and services offered in the EIS arm will be considered 'usual care' and administered either through in-person clinic visits, phone calls, or video calls. Relevant service information will be collected for study purposes.</description>
