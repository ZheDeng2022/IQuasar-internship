      Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) strategy has been used in the patient management of&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) strategy has been used in the patient management of&#xD;
      different diseases, but up to now, few effort has been done to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      ERAS in patients perioperative management of cervical spine surgery. As a interdisciplinary&#xD;
      cooperation system, either qualitative or quantitative method alone can not completely&#xD;
      reflect the function of ERAS. Mixed model research (MMR) is a appropriate method to evaluate&#xD;
      a complex system, but it has not been used in ERAS evaluation. This study aims to evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of ERAS in the perioperative period of posterior approach of cervical spine&#xD;
      operation among patients with CSM using MMR, including the retrospective quantitative part&#xD;
      and prospective qualitative part. In the retrospective part, we will collect the data of&#xD;
      length of stay, VAS scores, mJOA scores and SF-36 scores to compare the difference between&#xD;
      ERAS group and regular group. In the prospective part, we will collect the data from the&#xD;
      focus group meetings and personal interviews of patients, to verify that ERAS has the ability&#xD;
      to improve the postoperative outcomes, while maintain an equal surgical effect.&#xD;
