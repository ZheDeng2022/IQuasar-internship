  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is defined as a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of &lt; 65mmHg&#xD;
      during surgery. Patients undergoing major gastrointestinal (GI) surgery, such as&#xD;
      esophagectomy with reconstruction, are at a high-risk of IOH because such surgeries typically&#xD;
      require more than 3h to complete and require blood transfusion or inotrope administration.&#xD;
      Critically, these surgeries involve organ removal or substitute connection, which require&#xD;
      wound or flap anastomosis. IOH is believed to be associated with postoperative anastomosis&#xD;
      necrosis. It increases the risk of postoperative intrathoracic or abdominal infection,&#xD;
      resulting in septic shock, postoperative major organ dysfunction and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data of TWA-MAP&lt; 65mmHg in the HPI guidance group will be significantly lower than that&#xD;
      in the group without HPI guidance.&#xD;

      Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is defined as a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of &lt; 65mmHg&#xD;
      during surgery. Patients undergoing major gastrointestinal (GI) surgery, such as&#xD;
      esophagectomy with reconstruction, are at a high-risk of IOH because such surgeries typically&#xD;
      require more than 3h to complete and require blood transfusion or inotrope administration.&#xD;
      Critically, these surgeries involve organ removal or substitute connection, which require&#xD;
      wound or flap anastomosis. IOH is believed to be associated with postoperative anastomosis&#xD;
      necrosis. It increases the risk of postoperative intrathoracic or abdominal infection,&#xD;
      resulting in septic shock, postoperative major organ dysfunction and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hypotension Prediction Index (HPI) is an algorithm made commercially available in 2019.&#xD;
      On the basis of arterial waveform features, HPI predicts hypotension defined as MAP &lt; 65 mmHg&#xD;
      for at least 1 min. In two previous randomized trials(RCTs), the primary outcome was the&#xD;
      severity and duration of hypotension, defined as a time-weighted average mean arterial&#xD;
      pressure (TWA-MAP) less than 65 mmHg (formula: (total area under&#xD;
      MAP&lt;65mmHg(mmHg*hours))/(surgery length (hours));normal range:0.01-0.5mmHg).A higher data of&#xD;
      TWA-MAP&lt;65mmHg indicates severe and longer IOH. However, according to the results of the&#xD;
      previous two RCTs, the effects of HPI guidance during surgery remain inconclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to investigate whether HPI guidance can be used to reduce the duration and severity of&#xD;
      hypotension during major GI surgery. Our hypothesis is that the data of TWA-MAP&lt; 65mmHg in&#xD;
      the HPI guidance group will be significantly lower than that in the group without HPI&#xD;
      guidance. Postoperative major complications and mortality will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Sixty patients aged 20 to 80 years undergoing elective GI surgery will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive hemodynamic management with or without HPI guidance. Clinicians caring for&#xD;
      patients assigned to the HPI guidance group will be alerted when the index exceeded 85 (range&#xD;
      0 to 100) indicating the later occurrence of MAP&lt; 65mmHg for at least minutes and a treatment&#xD;
      protocol based on advanced hemodynamic parameters recommended vasopressor or inotrope, fluid&#xD;
      administration, or observation. Primary outcome is the data of TWA-MAP&lt;65mmHg. Postoperative&#xD;
      complications will be recorded on postoperative day 3,7 and 30. The mortality rate from the&#xD;
      time of hospitalization to postoperative 30 days will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data of TWA-MAP&lt; 65mmHg in the HPI guidance group will be significantly lower than that&#xD;
      in the group without HPI guidance.&#xD;
