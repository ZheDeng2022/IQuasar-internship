  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop an ecological momentary implementation intentions intervention&#xD;
      (EMI-II) for cigarette smoking, which will link critical situations where smoking is likely&#xD;
      to occur with alternative responses to support avoidance of cigarette use. Using ecological&#xD;
      momentary assessment (EMA) for data collection, this project will evaluate the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and initial effectiveness of a micro-randomized trial (MRT) of EMI-II&#xD;
      targeting cigarette smoking reduction in a sample of adults who smoke a minimum of 15&#xD;
      cigarettes per day (n=100).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking accounts for nearly 1 in 5 preventable deaths in the United States, and&#xD;
      reducing cigarette smoking has been suggested for those not yet ready to quit. Cigarette&#xD;
      reduction has been shown to longitudinally predict eventual cessation. Evidence suggests that&#xD;
      smoking is highly sensitive to environmental stimuli, so ecological momentary interventions&#xD;
      (EMI) embedded within daily life may help reduce cigarette smoking. Within the context of&#xD;
      EMIs, researchers have explored different strategies to support smoking cessation and&#xD;
      reduction. Implementation interventions (II) is a novel self-regulatory strategy that may&#xD;
      help individuals reduce smoking. In II, individuals identify critical situations where&#xD;
      smoking is likely to occur, then develop and plan appropriate alternative responses to avoid&#xD;
      cigarette use. When II is delivered as a brief, single session intervention, II increases&#xD;
      cessation rates relative to control conditions. Although II is well-suited for EMI because&#xD;
      the brief messages are designed to be contextually relevant, no known research has evaluated&#xD;
      whether repeated administration of II delivered by EMI reduces cigarette use. EMI-II may be&#xD;
      beneficial with greater exposure and when delivered in the contexts where a behavior, such as&#xD;
      smoking, is likely to occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled trial aims to test an ecological momentary implementation&#xD;
      intentions intervention (EMI-II) to reduce cigarette smoking. This research seeks to identify&#xD;
      in-the-moment intervention components that target momentary contextual and personal variables&#xD;
      to effectively reduce cigarette smoking. Adults who smoke and are interested in reducing&#xD;
      their cigarette use will be randomized to either the immediate intervention condition, or to&#xD;
      a waitlist control. All participants will be followed for one month and will complete weekly&#xD;
      surveys. Intervention participants will receive two weeks of the EMI-II with daily ecological&#xD;
      momentary assessments (EMAs) in the two weeks post-randomization. Waitlist control&#xD;
      participants will complete the weekly surveys for two weeks, then have access to the EMI-II&#xD;
      with daily EMAs for two weeks. The daily EMAs are brief surveys in which participants report&#xD;
      their current context and recent behavior and events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project consists of two primary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To test the feasibility and acceptability of a customized, micro-randomized trial&#xD;
      using EMI-II for smoking reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that at least 75% of participants who start the EMI-II&#xD;
      component will complete the two-week active study period. Also, the investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that participants will rate the acceptability of the EMI-II at least a 3.5 out of 5, on&#xD;
      average.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Test the initial effectiveness of EMI-II for reducing cigarette smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that participants receiving EMI-II will show greater reductions&#xD;
      in self-reported smoking than participants assigned to an EMA-only control. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that self-reported cigarette smoking during the next EMA following&#xD;
      EMI-II presentation will be lower, relative to cigarette smoking reported in EMAs that do not&#xD;
      proximally follow the EMI-II delivery.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in the Immediate Intervention condition will create their Implementation Intention (II) messages before the two-week EMA + EMI-II period begins. During the EMA + EMI-II period, participants will complete five daily EMAs, and they will also complete weekly assessments reporting their past week cigarette smoking as a distal outcome and rating intervention acceptability. Following the EMA + EMI-II period, participants will enter a two-week follow-up period. During this time, participants will not receive any messages, but will report past week smoking on a weekly basis.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the Waitlist control condition will begin with a two-week no intervention condition during which they will report past week smoking on a weekly basis but will not receive any other intervention components. At the end of the two-week waitlist control period, participants will begin the two-week EMA plus EMI-II period. During the EMA plus EMI-II active study period, participants will complete five daily EMAs and weekly assessments to report their past week cigarette smoking and rate intervention acceptability. No follow-up is planned for the wait list control condition.</description>

    <description>To reduce smoking, this text messaging intervention will use a self-regulatory strategy, Implementation Intentions (II) to deliver appropriate alternative responses to cigarette smoking. Participants will create personalized II messages before starting the two-week intervention period. Then during the intervention period, after receiving Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs), participants will be micro-randomized to receive the EMI-II. During the EMA + EMI-II period, participants will complete five daily EMAs. After approximately 40% of these EMAs, participants will also receive the personalized EMI-II by text messaging.</description>
