    <textblock>
      A study that included patients of any gender between 15 and 70 years, with the diagnosis of&#xD;
      choledocholithiasis who required a cholecystectomy with an exploration of bile ducts.&#xD;
      Conventional cholecystectomy was performed and a T-tube was inserted in the common bile duct&#xD;
      (CBD) to measure the intraluminal pressure immediately after the procedure, and weekly&#xD;
      thereafter, with a 6-week follow-up. A control T-tube radiological study was performed at six&#xD;
      weeks to exclude residual stones.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A clinical, controlled, prospective, longitudinal, descriptive, observational and&#xD;
      double-blinded study was designed. Patients of any gender between 15 and 70 years, with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of choledocholithiasis, and who required a cholecystectomy with an exploration of&#xD;
      bile ducts were included. Conventional cholecystectomy was performed and perioperative T-tube&#xD;
      CBD pressure was registered immediately after the procedure, and weekly thereafter, with a&#xD;
      6-week follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control T-tube cholangiogram was performed at six weeks to exclude residual stones. Data was&#xD;
      analyzed with T-test for parametric values.&#xD;
