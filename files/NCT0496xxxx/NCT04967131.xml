  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who were diagnosed with reduction disc displacement by Research Diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria for Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD / RDC) were included in the study.&#xD;
      Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation exercises were performed for 30 minutes using neck&#xD;
      jaw and tongue patterns with rhythmic stabilization (RS) and combination of isotonics (CI)&#xD;
      techniques by physiotherapist. Maximal mouth openings were measured with caliper, pain&#xD;
      intensities were measured with visual analogue scale and pressure pain thresholds with hand&#xD;
      algometer.&#xD;

      TMD patients who are diagnosed by TMD/RDC are firstly assessed by physiotherapist for maximal&#xD;
      mouth opening(MMO), pain intensity and pressure pain threshold. Then they will taught&#xD;
      exercises with rhythmic initiation which includes repetation of the patern and 15 repetitions&#xD;
      are applied as warm-up period. Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) exercises are&#xD;
      performed in the neck and jaw patterns with rhythmic stabilization (RS) and combination of&#xD;
      isotonics (CI) techniques. In the neck, right rotation-right lateral flexion, left&#xD;
      rotation-left lateral flexion pattern, and the opening and closing pattern according to the&#xD;
      working mechanics of the masseter and temporal muscle in the chin, RS and CI techniques are&#xD;
      used. By providing maximum resistance in accordance with the needs of each individual, the RS&#xD;
      protocol consist of isometric contractions that would not involve changing movements for 10&#xD;
      seconds. The combination of isotonics technique include combined concentric, isometric, and&#xD;
      eccentric contraction of the agonist muscle for 5 seconds of each contraction without rest.&#xD;
      CI exercises consist of 15 repetitions per set. A 30-second rest given between sets to&#xD;
      include recovery. After exercises immediate MMO, pain intensity and pain treshold assessment&#xD;
      will be applied.&#xD;
