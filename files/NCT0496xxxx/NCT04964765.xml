      This study is to describe the exact location of NOAF-maintaining foci and rotors after&#xD;
      cardiac surgery identified by mapping using the non-invasive phase mapping with&#xD;
      CardioInsightTM - 3D Mapping technology (CardioInsightTM, Medtronic Switzerland, Tolochenaz,&#xD;
      Switzerland) and a low-dose computed tomography scan of the chest.&#xD;

      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most commonly oberserved postoperative complication after&#xD;
      cardiac surgery. New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) leads to prolonged intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU) and hospital length of stay, increased early mortality and stroke along with higher&#xD;
      treatment costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact location of structures triggering or maintaining NOAF is unknown. Identifying the&#xD;
      exact location of NOAF- maintaining foci and rotors could allow development of preventive&#xD;
      treatment strategies like preoperative ablation or perioperative ablation of high-risk foci.&#xD;
      Non-invasive phase mapping with CardioInsightTM (CIT) - 3D Mapping technology&#xD;
      (CardioInsightTM, Medtronic Switzerland, Tolochenaz, Switzerland) allows non-invasive&#xD;
      description of AF foci and rotors with a 252-electrode vest applied to the patient's torso&#xD;
      due to detailed mapping of NOAF-maintaining structures without invasive electrophysiological&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;

    <description>CardioInsightTM Cardiac Mapping System is a non-invasive single beat cardiac mapping system that provides three-dimensional electroanatomic maps of the heart. The CIT vest is attached to the patient's torso for non-invasive mapping. To ensure correct and rapid mapping of the NOAF by the CIT device, it is essential to briefly slow down the patient's heart rate below 50bpm for a few seconds. Therefore 6mg adenosine as a rapid i.v. bolus will be administered. The adenosine application will slow down the patient's heart rate and allow for correct mapping by the CIT device. Medical therapy of atrial fibrillation is started immediately according to local protocol. Since non-invasive mapping is performed within a few minutes, the therapy of atrial fibrillation will not be critically delayed. Consecutively, a low-dose thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan (neck to upper abdomen) will be performed independent from the patient's rhythm.</description>

    <description>The CT scans will follow a standardised protocol as predefined by the manufacturer of the CIT vest, Medtronic (Dublin, Ireland). After the sensor array has been placed on the patient, the patient is ready to undergo a CT scan to register each electrode's locations with respect to the body surface. All CT scans cover a body region from neck to the upper abdomen, have no cardiac gating performed or any contrast agent given. The CT scans are acquired on 3 CT scanners manufactured by Siemens Corporation (Berlin, Germany) with a fixed tube voltage of 80 kVp and 250 effective mAs (=mAs/pitch). The reconstruction parameters are of 3 mm slice thickness and of 1.5 mm increment (slice overlap) The estimated effective dose (ED) is 3.2 mSv per patient.</description>

        Ongoing recruitment of elective and emergent patients through the study team will be&#xD;
        performed during daily practice. All patients referred to the Department of Cardiac&#xD;
        Surgery, University Hospital Basel, are routinely informed about the potential complication&#xD;
        of NOAF. Besides, patients are informed about the BigMap study, mapping with CIT, its&#xD;
        indications and contraindications. All patients who have given informed consent before&#xD;
        surgery and present with NOAF are monitored and the mapping procedure is performed.&#xD;
