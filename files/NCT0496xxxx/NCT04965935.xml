      This study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial comparing&#xD;
      the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin to placebo in 52 kidney transplant recipients (KTR) with&#xD;
      pre-existing type. diabetes (T2D) or post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM). The primary&#xD;
      outcome of the trial is to determine if dapagliflozin is superior to placebo in reduction of&#xD;
      blood pressure in KTR.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is the renal replacement therapy of choice for patients with end stage&#xD;
      renal disease (ESRD). It has been well established that kidney transplantation improves&#xD;
      patient survival and quality of life, and results in significant savings to the health care&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the survival benefit conferred by transplantation, KTR still face a number of&#xD;
      challenges, especially in patients with diabetes. First, KTR still have a higher risk of&#xD;
      mortality than their age-matched counterparts without kidney disease. This mortality risk is&#xD;
      even greater amongst KTR with diabetes. Furthermore, mortality from cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (CVD) continues to be an important problem after transplantation. Another major challenge&#xD;
      faced by KTR is the continuing risk of developing graft failure over time. Unfortunately, in&#xD;
      the subgroup of KTR with diabetes, the incidence of graft failure is 50% higher than the&#xD;
      general kidney transplant recipient population, and recurrent diabetic kidney disease (DKD)&#xD;
      occurs in almost half of allografts after transplantation. Current strategies in the&#xD;
      management of graft dysfunction and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are focused on optimizing&#xD;
      immunosuppression and control of hypertension and dyslipidemia. Accordingly, there is an&#xD;
      important unmet need for cardio- and renoprotective strategies to address premature death and&#xD;
      graft loss in the KTR population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are glucose lowering agents that are&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of T2D, resulting not only in improved glycemic control, but also&#xD;
      weight loss, blood pressure and albuminuria reduction. Several clinical trials have shown&#xD;
      significant benefits of SGLT2i on cardiovascular and renal outcomes. Given the&#xD;
      glucose-dependent and independent effects of SGLT2i, as well as the accumulating evidence&#xD;
      demonstrating cardiorenal protection in non-KTR, the use of these agents in KTR is attractive&#xD;
      - especially since traditional renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors are not&#xD;
      effective. Moreover, the use of SGLT2i as a cardiorenal protective therapy may be of&#xD;
      particular value in KTR given the high burden of comorbidities such as diabetes, CVD and&#xD;
      hypertension, as well as the ongoing challenges of premature death and graft loss in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial comparing&#xD;
      the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin to placebo in 52 KTR with pre-existing T2D or PTDM. The&#xD;
      primary outcome of the trial is to determine if dapagliflozin is superior to placebo in&#xD;
      reduction of blood pressure in KTR. The secondary outcomes of this study include metabolic,&#xD;
      vascular, renal and transplant-specific measures. These outcomes have been included to&#xD;
      elucidate the potential mechanisms responsible for blood pressure lowering, and putative&#xD;
      cardio- and renoprotective effects in KTR. Safety outcomes will also be assessed.&#xD;
