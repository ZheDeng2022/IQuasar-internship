    <textblock>
      Chronic respiratory diseases such as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) and chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) constitute a major public health problem, due to their&#xD;
      high prevalence, but especially because of their cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality and the associated costs for the health system. The organization of long-term&#xD;
      management of these diseases is now part of the e-health process, digital health with the use&#xD;
      of massive &quot;big data&quot; generated by care and follow-up. Therapeutic patient education and the&#xD;
      integration of connected objects will allow personalized therapeutic education support with&#xD;
      interventions by local medical staff adapted to the needs of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will also allow to objectify the effect of treatments such as continuous positive airway&#xD;
      pressure (CPAP) for OSA or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and/or oxygen therapy for COPD, not&#xD;
      only on the prevention of respiratory decompensation but also on cardiovascular and metabolic&#xD;
      risk factors which are major elements of the prognosis. This project will therefore make it&#xD;
      possible to demonstrate the feasibility and to deploy a multi-actor care pathway in the&#xD;
      territory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a prospective clinical study, conducted at the Verdun Hospital,&#xD;
      with the main objective of studying the evolution of the quality of life of patients with a&#xD;
      chronic respiratory pathology, during an integrated management at home for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the evolution of the following parameters, before treatment (at inclusion) and&#xD;
           after 6 months of integrated management:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Treatment compliance (CPAP or NIV/oxygen therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Physical activity&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Weight&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Mean arterial pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Oxygen saturation, heart rate and respiratory rate for COPD patients&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Severity of COPD for the patients concerned&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Daytime sleepiness&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Fatigue&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. Patient acceptability of the use of connected objects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyze the trajectories of the measures collected throughout the integrated&#xD;
           management to identify specific profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyze the daily data of the different connected objects and treatments with regard&#xD;
           to the patients' profiles (according to age, gender, comorbidities, OSA or COPD group).&#xD;

      Chronic respiratory diseases such as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) and chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) constitute a major public health problem, due to their&#xD;
      high prevalence, but especially because of their cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality and the associated costs for the health system. There is also an inequality of&#xD;
      access to referral care linked to demographics and territorial organization. We are currently&#xD;
      at a turning point in the understanding of these pathologies and their coordinated management&#xD;
      by combining therapeutic modalities. The organization of long-term management of these&#xD;
      diseases is now part of the e-health process, digital health with the use of massive &quot;big&#xD;
      data&quot; generated by care and follow-up. Therapeutic patient education and the integration of&#xD;
      connected objects measuring weight, oxygen saturation rate, heart rate, respiratory rate,&#xD;
      skin temperature blood pressure or physical activity will allow personalized therapeutic&#xD;
      education support with interventions by local medical staff adapted to the needs of the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will also allow to objectify the effect of treatments such as continuous positive airway&#xD;

&#xD;
