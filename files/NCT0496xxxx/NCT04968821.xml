  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this randomized controlled study is to examine the preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of a physical activity intervention that includes wearable technology and remote&#xD;
      physical therapist support in patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive 8 sessions of a telehealth physical activity intervention (n=30) or&#xD;
      usual postoperative care (n=30). The Investigator's central hypothesis is that a&#xD;
      postoperative telehealth physical activity intervention will lead to greater improvements in&#xD;
      objective physical activity (primary outcome) and patient-reported physical function,&#xD;
      disability, and pain (secondary outcomes) compared to usual care in patients undergoing&#xD;
      lumbar spine surgery.&#xD;

    <measure>Post-operative physical activity as measured by an accelerometer.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months post-surgery</time_frame>

    <measure>Physical function as measured by the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) - Physical Function Domain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Physical Function 4-item short form will be used to measure physical function. Each item is measured from 1 to 5, representing low to high physical function, respectively. Total score ranges from 4 to 20. Total raw scores will be converted to T-scores.</description>

    <measure>Leg pain as measured by the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The NRS has 1 item and scores range from 0 to 10. A higher score represents more leg pain.</description>

    <measure>Depression as measured by the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) - Depression Domain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Depression 4-item short form will be used to measure depression. Responses for each item vary from Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, and Always. The lowest score is 4 and the highest score is 20, with higher scores indicating greater severity of depression.Total raw scores will be converted to T-scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain self-efficacy as measured by the Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>PSEQ has 10 items and responses vary from Not at all confident to completely confident. The lowest score is 0 and the highest score is 60 with a higher score representing higher pain self-efficacy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fear of movement as measured by theTampa Scale of Kinesiophobia.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The 17-item Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia will be used to measure fear of movement. It has two sub-scales (activity avoidance and fear of pain) and the total score ranges from 17 to 68 with higher scores indicating greater fear of movement.</description>
