    <textblock>
      This study is a cluster randomized trial carried out in schools of secondary cities of four&#xD;
      low- and middle income countries. Baseline surveys in 30 randomly selected schools will&#xD;
      assess the health behaviours of 13-17 year old students as well as school policies and&#xD;
      practices. The intervention arm (15 schools) will use the baseline information to develop a&#xD;
      package of actions in collaboration with students, teachers, and local authorities that will&#xD;
      subsequently be implemented an monitored over two years. Follow-up surveys to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the implemented actions will be conducted after two years in all 30&#xD;
      previously selected schools.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to generate health information through school surveys and use&#xD;
      this information directly and locally, involving adolescents, to change policies and plan&#xD;
      programmes to improve health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is carried out in secondary cities of four low- and middle income countries,&#xD;
      including Sekondi-Takoradi, Ghana; Jaipur, India; Spanish Town, Jamaica; and Fez, Morocco.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each of the four cities, 30 schools are randomly selected. Baseline surveys will be&#xD;
      conducted to assess (1) 13-17 year old student's health behaviours using the Global&#xD;
      School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS); and (2) health policies and practices in the&#xD;
      selected schools using the Global School Health Policies and Practices Study (G-SHPPS).&#xD;
      Additionally, the physical activity module of the GSHS questionnaire will be validated&#xD;
      against objective measurement devices in one randomly selected class of 15 randomly selected&#xD;
      schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schools will be randomly allocated to the intervention (15 schools) or control arm (15&#xD;
      schools) of the study. The intervention group will participate in interactive workshops using&#xD;
      the Global Accelerated Action for the Health of Adolescents (Global AA-HA!) approach and the&#xD;
      framework of Making every school a health-promoting school to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify adolescent health needs through exploring the collected data;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess policies and practices already in place;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identify gaps and needs for action to improve health. Students, teachers and local&#xD;
           authorities will propose and prioritize policy and programme solutions from menus of&#xD;
           effective interventions for school-, community- or city-level implementation, supported&#xD;
           by the Ministries of Health and Education and WHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeat GSHS and G-SHPPS surveys will be conducted two years later in all schools to assess&#xD;
      effectiveness of the interventions.&#xD;
