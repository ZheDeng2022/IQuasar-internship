      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase 2/3 study that will evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of bempegaldesleukin (BEMPEG; NKTR-214) combined with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      compared with pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC with&#xD;
      positive PD-L1 expression (CPS ≥ 1).&#xD;

• Global health status/quality of life assessment based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30).&#xD;
The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire designed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. All scale scores are linearly converted to range from 0 to 100. A higher total score indicates a better level of functioning.&#xD;
• Pain and Swallowing based on respective multi-item scales of EORTC QLQ head and neck cancer specific module (EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35).&#xD;
EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35 consists of 7 multi-item scales that assess pain, swallowing, senses, speech, social eating, social contact and sexuality. All scale scores are linearly converted to range from 0 to 100. A higher total score indicates increased severity of symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Global Health Status/Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>To compare mean change from baseline in global health status/quality of life scale of EORTC QLQ-C30. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is composed of multi-item scales and single item measures. These include 5 functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), a global health status/HRQoL scale, and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale. All scale scores are linearly converted to range from 0 to 100. A higher total score indicates a better level of functioning.</description>
