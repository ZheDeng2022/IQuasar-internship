  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Presence of SaRS-Cov-2 antibodies following exposure to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)&#xD;
      and/or vaccination is a major indicator of immunization. Few data exit about serology&#xD;
      response in nursing homes (NHs), i.e. in the most vulnerable population for developing severe&#xD;
      forms of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residents and health professionals in 9 nursing homes (NHs) with SaRS-Cov-2 antibodies&#xD;
      detection after exposure (either COVID-19 or vaccine) All biological tests were performed in&#xD;
      the frame of the standard care of residents and health professionals and all participants did&#xD;
      not express opposition for using anonymously their data for the purpose of this academic&#xD;
      analysis. In addition all Directors and Physicians of these NHs accepted to participate in&#xD;
      this study&#xD;
