    <textblock>
      Matching the color of resin composite utilized in anterior teeth is believed to be one of the&#xD;
      most challenging tasks a dentist has to face in daily practice. The color of the teeth is&#xD;
      primary influenced by dentin; on the other hand, enamel has a major influence on the color&#xD;
      perception in terms of lightness. In the layering concept, the missing dental tissues are&#xD;
      substituted in increments with resin composite of the exact shade as the dental tissue. A&#xD;
      translucent composite resin is applied over a more opaque composite resin to achieve a depth&#xD;
      perception similar to that of the natural teeth. Which indicates that the visible color is&#xD;
      the consequence of diffuse reflectance from the internal dentin or opaque material layer&#xD;
      through the external translucent layer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are numerous elements that make the color matching problematic. These problems arise&#xD;
      from the point that color matching rely on many different chromatic properties related to the&#xD;
      teeth and resin composite; those include hue, chroma and value; translucency, opalescence and&#xD;
      fluorescence; light diffusion and transmission; and luster and texture of the surface. To&#xD;
      reach the ideal esthetics, restorative material should mimic the natural tooth in the&#xD;
      previously mentioned properties, in addition of having a long time color stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Massive efforts were achieved over the years to improve the esthetic properties of dental&#xD;
      resin composite restorative materials. Recently, a single shade structurally colored&#xD;
      universal composite (Omnichroma, Tokuyama Dental) intended for use with most direct&#xD;
      restorative clinical cases was introduced in the market. Its manufacturer claimed that it&#xD;
      exhibits color change toward the color of the surrounding hard dental tissues. Thus, it has&#xD;
      the advantages of improving the esthetic appearance of the restoration, decrease dependence&#xD;
      on shade-matching procedures, decrease the number of shade guide tabs, and counteract for&#xD;
      color mismatches to some degree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up till now no studies assessed the color match of Omnichroma resin composite in anterior&#xD;
      teeth cavities clinically. Thus, the aim of this clinical trial was to investigate if the&#xD;
      single shade structurally colored universal resin composite (OMNICHROMA) will modify its&#xD;
      shade to match the tooth structure shade in anterior teeth cavities.&#xD;

      Participants' recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be selected from outpatient clinic of National Research Centre (NRC),&#xD;
      Cairo; Egypt Eligible patients who agreed to participate in this trial will sign on written&#xD;
      informed consents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Teeth color measurement Each patient first will receive scaling and polishing procedures&#xD;
           to clean the teeth surfaces. A total of 45 anterior teeth cavities will be prepared.&#xD;
           Before cavity preparation, shade determination will be performed with Vita Easyshade&#xD;
           spectrophotometer. The probe tip will be positioned perpendicular and flushed onto the&#xD;
           buccal surface of the tooth to get correct measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cavities preparation Appropriate local dental anesthesia (Mepecaine-L) 1mg will be&#xD;
           injected preoperatively unless declined by the patient. Treated teeth will be properly&#xD;
           isolated and saliva ejector will be utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conservative cavities will be prepared with #330 carbide bur (FG, Dentsply Midwest®) fixed to&#xD;
      a high speed hand piece with water coolant system. Cavity preparation will be limited to the&#xD;
      removal of caries and the exact cavity form and size will be obtained after caries removal.&#xD;
      Each bur will be discarded after 5 preparations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A functional esthetic enamel bevel will be prepared using a fine grained finishing diamond&#xD;
      rotary instrument on the facial surface, the bevel enables harmonious shade transition from&#xD;
      composite to tooth substance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Application of the adhesive system and resin composite in the prepared cavities Enamel of&#xD;
      the prepared cavities will be etched using UltraEtch (Ultradent, 40% phosphoric acid) for 30&#xD;
      seconds. After rinsing with water and air drying, the bonding agent will be applied according&#xD;
      to the manufacturer's instructions to the cavity using a brush then air-thinned gently and&#xD;
      light-cured for 20 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omnichroma resin composite will be packed in the prepared cavities using a Teflon coated&#xD;
      plastic instrument and the restoration will covered with celluloid strip to reduce the oxygen&#xD;
      inhibition layer and to get a smooth surface, then light-cured for 40 sec. Excess material&#xD;
      will be removed with scalpel. Finishing and polishing will be performed for the anatomical&#xD;
      contouring and smoothing of the restorations surfaces using all grates of soflex discs, fine&#xD;
      and Extra fine diamond burs, medium and fine rubber polishing points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Color assessment Color match data will be recorded for the restoration after one week. The&#xD;
      restorations will be gently dried with cotton and the color values of them will be recorded&#xD;
      using the Vita Easyshade spectrophotometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The color changes (ΔE) will be calculated from the changes in CIE L, a, and b values (ΔL, Δa,&#xD;
      Δb) as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ΔE= [(ΔL)2 + (Δa)2 + (Δb)2]1/2 CIE Lab is expressed by the L coordinate representing color&#xD;
      luminosity, varying from white to black, a and b coordinates representing the chromaticity of&#xD;
      the color, with axes varying from green to red and blue to yellow, respectively. The mean of&#xD;
      the values obtained will be calculated, and the L, a, and b parameters will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual assessment Visual assessment will be performed by two independent observers with&#xD;
      normal color vision as checked by Ishiara test. To determine the color-matching between the&#xD;
      restorations and the teeth. Color-matching visual scoring (VS) values will be expressed&#xD;
      numerically as follows: 1: mismatch/totally unacceptable, 2: Poor-Match/hardly acceptable, 3:&#xD;
      Good- Match/acceptable, 4: Close-Match/small-difference, and 5:&#xD;
      Exact-Match/no-color-difference. All observers will be trained in color-matching and taught&#xD;
      about the used grading system before the assessment.&#xD;
