  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, placebo controlled, multi-center study in subjects with mild&#xD;
      to moderate IPF. Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive placebo or ENV-101 as a&#xD;
      daily oral dose for 12 consecutive weeks of treatment. Following treatment, subjects will be&#xD;
      observed for an additional 6 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline in frequency of adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment under investigation. Frequency of a given AE is determined by dividing the total number of that AE observed during the study by the total number of subjects in the study.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in severity of AEs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of AEs are categorized as mild, moderate or severe as described below:&#xD;
Mild - Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subject's daily activities.&#xD;
Moderate - Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.&#xD;
Severe - Events interrupt a subject's usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or incapacitating.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The UCSD SOBQ consists of 24 questions (21 assess severity of shortness of breath during specific activities of daily living; 3 additional items ask about limitations due to: shortness of breath, fear of harm from overexertion and fear of shortness of breath). Each question has a 6-point scale (0 = &quot;not at all&quot; to 5 = &quot;maximal or unable to do because of breathlessness&quot;), resulting in a total score ranging from 0 to 120 (a higher score represents a worse outcome).</description>
