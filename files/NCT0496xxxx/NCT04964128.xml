      The purpose of this feasibility study is to evaluate subject safety of using the Klue Health&#xD;
      app utilizing meal gesture micro insulin dosing (meal gesture dosing) within the AHCL system&#xD;
      in adult subjects with type 1 diabetes in a clinic setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, single arm study in adult subjects with type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      utilizing AHCL System with meal gesture detection and micro dosing (meal gesture dosing).&#xD;
      Meal gesture dosing is a mode whereby meal announcements are not entered manually by the&#xD;
      user. Instead, when meal gesture dosing is active, meal announcements are generated&#xD;
      automatically by the system based on the detection of eating gestures and micro doses of&#xD;
      insulin are given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study period will be approximately 10 days long, but overall subject participation will&#xD;
      be approximately 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of up to 20 subjects (aged 18-75) may be enrolled at one investigational center in&#xD;
      Israel to have at least 8 subjects complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a run-in period and a study period. The first 2 weeks of the run-in&#xD;
      period is intended to allow subjects to become familiar with using the study pump system with&#xD;
      the SmartGuard feature and wearing the watch. Subjects should use the same insulin they will&#xD;
      be using during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first week of the study period, subjects will undergo a 5-day at-home baseline&#xD;
      meal challenge at one specific meal on each day. The Klue app will be set to monitoring-mode.&#xD;
      After run-in period and completion of the 1 week at-home study period with baseline meal&#xD;
      challenges, study subjects will check into the clinic for a 5-day (4 nights) intervention.&#xD;
      Study subjects will wear the system with Klue meal gesture dosing activated for the entire&#xD;
      duration of the 5-day intervention.&#xD;
