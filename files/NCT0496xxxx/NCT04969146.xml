      The purpose of the study is to design and test a dyadic sleep intervention for patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with cancer and their intimate partner.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep problems remain underdiagnosed and undertreated among cancer patients despite their&#xD;
      high prevalence and consequences to quality of life and health. Hepatobiliary cancer patients&#xD;
      have one of the highest rates of sleep problems with 59% reporting poor sleep quality and 43%&#xD;
      reporting sleeping less than 6 hours per night. Sleep problems were found to be associated&#xD;
      with clinical levels of depressive symptoms, elevations in pain and fatigue. Investigators&#xD;
      have observed that short sleep duration was associated with increased risk of mortality in&#xD;
      patients with hepatobiliary cancers. Inflammation has been hypothesized to mediate the link&#xD;
      between sleep and mortality. In hepatobiliary cancer, short sleep duration was associated&#xD;
      with elevations in Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, IL-1 and IL-2 and poor sleep quality with&#xD;
      elevations in Interferon (IFN) Interleukin-2, after adjusting for tumor associated&#xD;
      inflammation, mediated the link between sleep duration and survival. These pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines are also related to tumor growth and development of metastases. Sleep problems of&#xD;
      spouses or intimate partners of hepatobiliary cancer patients were also prevalent with 62%&#xD;
      reporting poor sleep quality and 33% reporting sleep less than 6 hours per night. Caregiving&#xD;
      for an intimate partner with cancer has been linked to increased mortality and sleep has been&#xD;
      proposed as a possible mediator of this link. Face to face cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      has been shown to be effective in cancer patients and cancer caregivers. However, due to the&#xD;
      distance patients travel to our medical center (58% &gt;1 hour), infrequency of visits (e.g.,&#xD;
      approximately every two months), limited resources (48% of patients &lt;$20,000 annual income),&#xD;
      and the unpredictability of cancer-related symptoms; weekly face-to- face CBT to treat sleep&#xD;
      problems is not feasible. Therefore, investigators will test a dyadic Modified Cognitive&#xD;
      Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi) intervention to reduce insomnia in patients and&#xD;
      possibly caregivers and expect the findings of this study to have a significant public health&#xD;
      impact for the over 12 million cancer patients and spousal/partner caregivers in which nearly&#xD;
      half are estimated to suffer from sleep problems.&#xD;
