  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is a strong predictor of adult obesity with health and economic&#xD;
      consequences for the individual and society. Adiposity rebound (AR) is a rise in the Body&#xD;
      Mass Index occurring between 3-7 years. Early adiposity rebound (EAR) occurs at a median age&#xD;
      of 2 years and is a risk factor for later obesity. Events happening in &quot;the first 1,000 days&quot;&#xD;
      play a role in obesity development. One of the key elements in this crucial time window is&#xD;
      the gut microbiome, a highly dynamic organ that is sensitive to environmental exposure being&#xD;
      linked to obesity development. Prenatal (dietary/lifestyle maternal factors and environmental&#xD;
      exposure) and postnatal determinants (the type of feeding, sleep patterns, speed of growth)&#xD;
      and environmental obesogenic pollutants may influence the infant microbial colonization, thus&#xD;
      increasing the risk of EAR onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LIMIT will holistically identify the longitudinal interplay between the intestinal microbiome&#xD;
      and infant/maternal nutritional and lifestyle habits, environmental factors exposure and&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements, in children with AR vs EAR, driving new mechanistic insights to&#xD;
      create an EAR predictive model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate a group of 150 mother-infant pairs, during the first four years of&#xD;
      life at different follow-up.&#xD;
