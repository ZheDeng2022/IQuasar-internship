  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to improve patient satisfaction and outcomes in facial&#xD;
      reconstructive surgery by using 3D clinical photography and computer modelling to help&#xD;
      illustrate and plan the patients' reconstructive journey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be conducted at the Royal Free Hospital department of Plastic and Reconstructive&#xD;
      Surgery, where patients with facial deformities or suspected diagnoses of skin cancer will be&#xD;
      referred from their GP or dermatology services. As is routine standard of care, they will be&#xD;
      reviewed in outpatient settings and the next management steps initiated. Our study will&#xD;
      introduce compulsory 2D and 3D photography and patient satisfaction questionnaires. The&#xD;
      photographs will be used to sit down with the participant and illustrate the intended&#xD;
      surgical reconstruction, keeping them up to date and fully informed of the surgical plan. The&#xD;
      questionnaire, FACE-Q, already validated for facial skin cancer surgery and reconstruction,&#xD;
      will be used to assess their satisfaction at each stage of their reconstructive journey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the study will benefit each participant and illustrate an improvement in&#xD;
      satisfaction so that such 3D photography, surgical planning with computer models produced by&#xD;
      these 3D images will become a routine part of future patients with facial disfigurement or&#xD;
      cancer requiring reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will form part of a PhD academic qualification at UCL for one of the research&#xD;
      registrars.&#xD;

      Setting: Royal Free Hospital, London. Single site. Study Population: Adult patients aged over&#xD;
      18 presenting with;&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Facial defects resulting from cancer or trauma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent from the patients will be obtained as soon as possible, during outpatient&#xD;
      consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: observational case series, feasibility study. As this is an open observational&#xD;
      study, there will be no randomization. As numbers of participant's attending with facial skin&#xD;
      cancer defects requiring reconstruction is small, there will not be any sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected number of participants: 10. Number determined after discussion with Chief&#xD;
      Investigators as adequate to determine feasibility or incorporating 3D photography, computer&#xD;
      modelling and questionnaires to improve satisfaction. Statistical input from supervisor and&#xD;
      chief investigator, Professor Eva Krumhuber, department of experimental psychology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study: 12 months Methodology: Clinic Consultation Patients will be referred to&#xD;
      our craniofacial clinic with either pre-defect or pre-biopsy lesions suspicious of being skin&#xD;
      malignancies, or following biopsy or defect resulting from excision, trauma or Mohs surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the lesion is suspicious for cancer but has not been diagnosed, this is discussed with the&#xD;
      patient and a biopsy booked. During the consultation the patient is sent for clinical 2D and&#xD;
      3D photography in the Royal Free Hospital Department of Clinical Photography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient presents to clinic with the defect, multiple pre-defect 2D photographs are&#xD;
      requested from the patient and stored on the hospital protected plastic surgery department&#xD;
      shared drive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photography All patients will undergo outpatient 2D and 3D photography in the Royal Free&#xD;
      Hospital Department of Clinical Photography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer modelling All images will be processed using the Vectra XT software from Canfield&#xD;
      Imaging Scientific, inc. used at the Royal Free Hospital Department of Clinical Photography.&#xD;
      From this, 3D images can be layered, accurate calculations made and the size of defects&#xD;
      accurately measured and templated. 3D models can be manipulated to illustrate each stage of&#xD;
      the reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment modality Treatment modalities will involve standard of care surgical management,&#xD;
      pre-assessment and post-operative care. This includes skin cancer and craniofacial MDT&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team discussions to plan and decide treatment. This will all take place at&#xD;
      Royal Free Hospital, London.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient questionnaires Patients will be asked to complete FACE-Q questionnaires at each&#xD;
      consultation and after each stage of their reconstruction at initial consultation, 6 weeks&#xD;
      post op, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FACE-Q is a validated questionnaire patient reported outcome measure including measures for&#xD;
      satisfaction with facial appearance, health-related quality of life, recovery, early life&#xD;
      impact, adverse effects and satisfaction with process of care (Klassen et al. 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up For patient who have undergone biopsy, they will be reviewed in the plastic surgery&#xD;
      dressings clinic 1 week post op to review the wound; their histology will be discussed in the&#xD;
      skin MDT 4-6 weeks later and the patient informed in a consultation of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If further excision or reconstruction is required, the patient will undergo the required&#xD;
      imaging and computer modelling and undergo the operative procedure. They will then be&#xD;
      reviewed a week later in our dressings clinic and at the next stage of their procedure in 3-4&#xD;
      weeks if staged reconstruction is required. After the final reconstruction, they will be&#xD;
      reviewed in outpatient clinic at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and storage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected from source (medical notes, questionnaires, and images), and collected&#xD;
      on a case record form (CRF) and then transferred to an electronic database. The master&#xD;
      database will be recorded by code and will hence be anonymized. Some parts of the medical&#xD;
      records and the data collected for the study will be looked at by authorised persons such as&#xD;
      the members of the research team, regulatory authorities, the Trust, and the sponsors of this&#xD;
      study. They may also be looked at by authorised people to check that the study is being&#xD;
      carried out correctly. All will have a duty of confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anonymised extracts of the database may be transferred securely to UCL for analysis.&#xD;
      Anonymised images may be shared with researchers in the department of surgery and&#xD;
      interventional sciences at UCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In some circumstances the data in an anonymous form may be used for preparation of the trial&#xD;
      report, and for submission to Government agencies as part of the procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data may be required for further studies, in which case further Research Ethics Committee&#xD;
      approval will be sought. Access to personal data is strictly controlled and limited to&#xD;
      authorised personnel only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal data will be stored on paper forms held in a secure, locked office accessible to&#xD;
      authorised personnel only. At the end of the study, personal data in paper form (completed&#xD;
      Case Record Forms) will be archived securely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dataset will be used for the sole purpose set out in this protocol. Anonymised raw data&#xD;
      will not be shared with any other organisation or named individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study, data will be collected from patients in accordance with the patient consent&#xD;
      form, patient information sheet and as described in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be appropriately maintained by authorised members of the research team for&#xD;
      statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Chief Investigator will nominate an individual to process, store and dispose of study&#xD;
      data in accordance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements, including the Data&#xD;
      Protection Act 1998 and any amendments thereto.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non anonymised data will not be transferred to any party not identified in the protocol and&#xD;
      will not be processed and/or transferred other than in accordance with the patients' consent.&#xD;
