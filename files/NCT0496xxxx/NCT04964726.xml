  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effect of a real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (fMRI) dyadic neurofeedback protocol with mothers and their adolescent daughters. Mothers&#xD;
      will view a moving bar showing their daughters' brain activity on a computer screen while&#xD;
      talking to their daughters.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study will determine the effects of a real-time functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging dyadic neurofeedback (rtfMRI-DNF) protocol that will train mothers with a history of&#xD;
      adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) to regulate adolescents' activation in the anterior&#xD;
      insular cortex (aIC) - a key brain region for ER. The proposed study will test the efficacy&#xD;
      of this protocol to promote healthy ER-related neurodevelopment in adolescents with a&#xD;
      maternal history of adversity. The proposed study will use DNF to provide neurofeedback from&#xD;
      the adolescent's aIC to the parent as the parent and adolescent engage in an emotion&#xD;
      discussion task together. Parents and adolescents (n=10 dyads) will communicate via&#xD;
      microphones and noise-canceling headphones while the adolescent is undergoing fMRI scanning.&#xD;
      Specific aims of the current study are: (1) to determine the brain response to aIC DNF&#xD;
      adolescents, and (2) to determine effects of DNF on parenting behaviors. This study is&#xD;
      significant because engaging with parents in DNF can promote positive ER development in&#xD;
      adolescents at risk due to the intergenerational effects of ACEs.&#xD;
