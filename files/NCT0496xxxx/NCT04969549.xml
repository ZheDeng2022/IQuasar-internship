  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of an open label trial designed to treat adult depression with TBS. Our&#xD;
      aim is to build capacity in neuroimaging analyses by performing magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) assessments at baseline and after 7-10 days of treatment onset in 50 patients. The&#xD;
      scientific goal is to test a hypothesis about treatment action: that TBS will reduce negative&#xD;
      bias (which causally maintains negative mood) after 1 week of treatment, and patients who&#xD;
      show this neurocognitive change will be the ones who go on to respond clinically after 6&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depressive disorders are among the leading causes of incapacity and disability worldwide. The&#xD;
      burden of depression is expected to increase and is associated with negative impact on&#xD;
      clinical conditions and physical and cognitive abilities. Given the limited efficacy of&#xD;
      antidepressant drugs, novel treatments such as theta-burst brain stimulation (TBS), a form of&#xD;
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), are being developed. However, to further&#xD;
      advance the field towards treatment personalisation, increasing understanding of TBS&#xD;
      antidepressant mechanisms and identifying treatment responders are important issues.&#xD;
      Moreover, no studies have used neuroimaging in TBS trials in depression yet. Our group in&#xD;
      Brazil is a leading brain stimulation centre, although neuroimaging expertise is lacking. We&#xD;
      will conduct an open label trial designed to treat adult depression with TBS. Our aim is to&#xD;
      build capacity in neuroimaging analyses by performing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      assessments at baseline and after 7-10 days of treatment onset in 50 patients. The scientific&#xD;
      goal is to test a hypothesis about treatment action: that TBS will reduce negative bias&#xD;
      (which causally maintains negative mood) after 1 week of treatment, and patients who show&#xD;
      this neurocognitive change will be the ones who go on to respond clinically after 6 weeks.&#xD;
      Scientifically, this proposal and its outcomes will help advance towards next-generation&#xD;
      precision brain stimulation, by incorporating cognitive/neuroimaging readouts that inform&#xD;
      about mechanism and individual response.&#xD;
