  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical Site Infections (SSI) develop as a complication of surgical care 30-90 days after&#xD;
      surgery without implants and within 1 year after implanted operations. Despite advances in&#xD;
      asepsis practices, sterilization methods, surgical technique and antibiotic prophylaxis, SSI&#xD;
      is the most important cause of hospital stay, morbidity and even mortality. SSI, which&#xD;
      constitutes approximately 20% of healthcare associated infections (HAI) all over the world,&#xD;
      is also the HAI with the highest cost. Although it has been reported that 60% of the SSI can&#xD;
      be prevented by using evidence-based guidelines, 2-5% of the operated patients develop SSI,&#xD;
      the hospital stay of patients with SSI is 7-11 days longer, the risk of death increases 2-11&#xD;
      times, It was reported that the cause of death was direct SSI. In the United States of&#xD;
      America (USA), SSI constitutes 31% of HAI, it is seen in 2-5% of inpatients, approximately&#xD;
      160,000-300,000 SSIs occur each year, the most common and costly HAI.Abdominal surgery; It&#xD;
      includes the treatment of diseases of organs such as stomach, gall bladder, pancreas, spleen,&#xD;
      liver, small intestine and large intestine. It has been reported that the incidence of SSIs&#xD;
      after abdominal surgery is 15-25% higher than other types of surgery. In a study conducted by&#xD;
      Alcan et al. (2020), 69.8% of nurses stated that they used Povidone Iodine as skin&#xD;
      antisepsis. Wistrand et al. (2015) compared preoperative 36 ° C and room temperature 20 ° C&#xD;
      Chlorhexidine Gluconate solutions, but reported that there was no difference in bacterial&#xD;
      colonization and SSI rates. In their study in Turkey, Gezer et al. (2020) reported that the&#xD;
      prevalence of SSI was significantly lower in the Povidone Iodine group heated to 37 ° C&#xD;
      before surgery compared to the Povidone Iodine group applied at 25 ° C room temperature.&#xD;

      This study was planned in accordance with a single blind randomized controlled full&#xD;
      experimental study design to determine the effect of skin antisepsis with Povidone Iodine,&#xD;
      which was heated at 37°C and at a room temperature of 20°C in the preoperative period, in&#xD;
      reducing surgical site infections in patients who underwent abdominal surgery. Patients who&#xD;
      will undergo abdominal surgery at Dr. Burhan Nalbantoğlu State Hospital will comprise the&#xD;
      sample of volunteer patients who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate in the&#xD;
      study. The data of the study was planned to be collected using the Patient Information Form,&#xD;
      Surgical Site Infection Follow-up Form and Post Discharge Patient Follow-up Form.&#xD;

The weight tracking of the patients will be determined using a digital weight meter provided by the researcher. Patient evaluation will be made with NRS-2002 in terms of malnutrition risk.&#xD;
Antibiotic prophylaxis of 1000 mg available in the operating room will be administered 30-60 minutes before the operation.&#xD;
Before the incision, a wound culture sample will be taken with sterile transport swap and sent to the laboratory for culture study.</description>
