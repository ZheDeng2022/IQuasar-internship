    <textblock>
      A study population with impaired fasting glucose levels, impaired glucose tolerance levels&#xD;
      and diabetes (with or without complications) along with healthy patients will be chosen as&#xD;
      participants. Their vital signs and their ECG (electrocardiograph) will be recorded during&#xD;
      their only visit. Data analysis will be performed using the vital signs parameters. The RR&#xD;
      intervals from the ECG will be analyzed by 5 different techniques to determine the best&#xD;
      technique that stratifies the subjects the most accurately.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) is a fundamental part of the nervous system in the body.&#xD;
      And yet, there is no technique to test or measure the health and functioning of a person's&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system.This type of study will determine the most accurate methodology to&#xD;
      test the autonomic nervous system through heart rate variability (HRV) monitoring and gain&#xD;
      vital information to distinguish patient groups in the diabetic population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no gold standard for measuring autonomic dysfunction. Currently the method of power&#xD;
      spectral analysis is finding very wide usage. It Is known that power spectral analysis does&#xD;
      not discriminate the two subsystems of the ANS well. There are other beat to beat&#xD;
      methodologies that have not yet gained traction. The reason for conducting this trial is to&#xD;
      take a group of subjects in various stages of impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose&#xD;
      tolerance and diabetes (with and without complications) and determine which methodology&#xD;
      stratifies these subjects most accurately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aims to introduce a new measurement method named the 'Beat to Beat' (BB) method for&#xD;
      gauging autonomic dysfunction in patients. The investigators hope to observe that the average&#xD;
      beat to beat method (BB) score could help discriminating diabetic patients into the following&#xD;
      five distinct groups from the pilot study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Normal blood glucose level: - (A blood sugar level less than 140 mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Impaired fasting glucose (IFG): - (A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT): - (two-hour glucose levels of 140 to 199 mg per dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Diabetes without complications: - (e.g., no neuropathy, no retinopathy or nephropathy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Diabetes with complications: - (at least one complication among neuropathy, retinopathy,&#xD;
           or nephropathy)&#xD;
&#xD;
      By showing that this measurement bears no relationship to the other four vital signs&#xD;
      parameters (heart rate, blood oxygenation, blood pressure, body temperature), it will prove&#xD;
      the necessity of this measurement in addition to the four vital signs for distinguishing&#xD;
      patient groups among the diabetic population.&#xD;
