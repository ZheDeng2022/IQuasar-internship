  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is seeking to evaluate that platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) is a&#xD;
      proven wound healing and osteogenic protein that plays a critical role in wound healing and&#xD;
      previous research has demonstrated a non-linear response where higher dosages produced less&#xD;
      effect. As Platelet Rich Fibrin (PRF) contains numerous platelets, it contains PDGF-BB, but&#xD;
      at levels lower than in the commercially available product and with inter-individual&#xD;
      variation, GEM21S. To achieve both ideal handling and achieve ideal levels of PDGF-BB, there&#xD;
      is a rationale to add GEM 21S recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-BB (rhPDGF) to&#xD;
      a bone graft prior to making &quot;sticky bone&quot;.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Innovations in biomedicine and recombinant protein technology show promising advances for the&#xD;
      regeneration of advanced alveolar defects. Recombinant growth factors and biologics encourage&#xD;
      minimally invasive procedures with improved clinical outcomes/healing times in complex oral&#xD;
      surgery procedures. PDGF-BB is a growth factor that is known to be a potent mitogen and&#xD;
      chemotactic agent for cells important in wound healing and bone regeneration. PDGF-BB is also&#xD;
      a strong angiogenic agent. These properties provide a solid biological mechanism of action&#xD;
      and rationale for the widespread use of rhPDGF-BB in dental and orthopedic surgery, as well&#xD;
      as in the treatment of difficult soft tissue wounds. Practically, two sources of&#xD;
      supra-physiologic levels PDGF-BB are currently available for use in dental hard and soft&#xD;
      tissue defects: 1) Platelet concentrates (PRF/PRF); and 2) GEM 21S, which contains&#xD;
      recombinant human PDGF-BB (rhPDGF-BB). Platelet rich plasma was first introduced to dentistry&#xD;
      in 1998 by Robert Marx. Since then, other autologous products have evolved. Platelet rich&#xD;
      fibrin (PRF) is one that is used daily in various clinical scenarios, including guided bone&#xD;
      regeneration. The rationale for its use is due to the supraphysiologic concentration of&#xD;
      growth factors (ie PDGF-BB) and cells to enhance would healing. Clinicians also frequently&#xD;
      incorporate PRF to bone grating materials to improve handling properties of the graft&#xD;
      material, also referred to as &quot;sticky bone&quot;. However, the literature varies greatly on the&#xD;
      believed mechanism of action and the therapeutic benefits claimed by their supporters. The&#xD;
      rationale for this proposed study that PDGF-BB is a proven wound healing and osteogenic&#xD;
      protein, but there are clinically insignificant amounts of PDGF-BB in PRF. Therefore, there&#xD;
      is a rationale to add GEM 21S (rhPDGF) to a bone graft prior to making &quot;sticky bone&quot; with&#xD;
      PRF. This would provide clinicians the benefits of a clinically proven and consistent dose of&#xD;
      rhPDGF to improve wound healing and bone formation in conjunction with the benefits of the&#xD;
      improved handling (i.e. sticky bone) from the addition of the PRF.&#xD;

    <description>The release kinetics of PDGF-BB will be assessed for one PRF preparation from each of the six individual participants and one GEM 21S sample. The quantification will be performed at 60 minutes, 8 hours, 1 day, 3 days, and 10 days. The samples will each be placed in a cell incubator at 37°C to allow for growth factor release into a phosphate-buffered saline. At each desired time point assessment, 2 ml of the sample will be collected, frozen, and replaced with 2 ml of additional phosphate-buffered saline. The protein quantification will be carried out using ELISA assay according to manufacturer's protocol.</description>
