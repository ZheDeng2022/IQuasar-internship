  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Energy drinks consumption has varied effects on the hemodynamic, blood glucose levels, brain&#xD;
      functions and memory. The use of energy drinks is pervasive and especially young adults&#xD;
      consume it often as binge drinking. The negative health effects of excessive use of energy&#xD;
      drinks has been reported in the scientific literature. Often energy drinks are consumed to&#xD;
      enhance alertness and cognition improvement. In this trial, the investigators intend to&#xD;
      compare the effects of a widely available energy drink brand in the country with the usual&#xD;
      black tea with 5gm sugar and milk. The aims of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the effect of consumption of energy drinks on hemodynamics parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effect of consumption of energy drinks on short term memory&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the effect of consumption of energy drinks on vigilance in adults&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the effect of consumption of energy drinks on blood glucose in adults&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To analyze the effect of energy drink on perception in adults&#xD;

      The participants will be halved in two groups: control group (consuming tea with 5gm of sugar&#xD;
      only) and experimental group (consuming energy drinks only) to acquire data regarding&#xD;
      fluctuations in hemodynamic parameters including heart rate (HR) and blood pressure&#xD;
      (BP)-systolic and diastolic (SBP and DBP) by measuring them before and after 30 minutes of&#xD;
      the consumption of tea with 5gm of sugar or energy drink in control or experimental groups.&#xD;
      In addition blood glucose level will be monitored in both the groups via glucometer before&#xD;
      and after. Reactions of energy drinks in comparison to tea on their respective groups will&#xD;
      also be analyzed by help of a stroop test (where the name of the color itself does not match&#xD;
      the ink of the color in which it is printed) for understanding its impact on cognitive&#xD;
      strengths and on memory by a minor sequence learning game controlled by time lapse. After&#xD;
      these interventions participants will be requested to fill out the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigatorsare aiming for a sample size of 76 participants, 38 in each of the two&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be entered and analyzed in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20&#xD;
      or above. Mean and SD will be calculated for variables such as age, weight, blood pressure&#xD;
      (Systolic and Diastolic) and heart rate, blood glucose and Stroop Test score. For qualitative&#xD;
      variables such as sex, co morbidity e.g. heart disease, hypertension, family history will be&#xD;
      presented as absolute frequencies and proportions. The hemodynamic parameters will be&#xD;
      recorded before and after consumption of energy drinks in the intervention and the control&#xD;
      group. Independent samples student t-test will be used to compare mean values of hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameter between intervention and control group. Significance level of 5% will be set for&#xD;
      the study keeping power at 80%.&#xD;
