  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gold standard surgical treatment for benign nasosinus pathologies is endoscopic surgery.&#xD;
      This surgery has experienced considerable growth over the last 30 years. Nevertheless, these&#xD;
      techniques can potentially lead to serious complications, with risks of damaging adjacent&#xD;
      structures (orbit, optic nerve, meninge or internal carotid artery). Therefore, improving the&#xD;
      safety of these procedures is a fundamental objective. Recently, computer-assisted surgery,&#xD;
      allowing endonasal navigation, has emerged. It appears to be an asset for the patient,&#xD;
      limiting complications and morbidity, and for the surgeon, improving his comfort and reducing&#xD;
      his mental workload. The major pitfall of the current technique is the loss of localisation&#xD;
      reliability during the intervention due to the registration process and the presence of two&#xD;
      screens (to locate the object on the endoscopic image and on the scan) We would like to&#xD;
      propose solutions to these limitations using a device based on augmented reality and 3D&#xD;
      reconstructions. It would guide the gesture in endonasal endoscopic surgery by displaying&#xD;
      high-risk areas and surgical landmarks in a reliable and precise way.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The available literature offers numerous expert and consensus opinions supporting the&#xD;
      usefulness and acceptance of endonasal navigation and encouraging development of optimised&#xD;
      navigation systems Augmented reality (AR) allows the surgeon to visualise the preoperative&#xD;
      imaging information in the form of a projection that is displayed on the endoscopic image&#xD;
      screen. This application, used in other surgical fields, is promising. The EnCoV team of the&#xD;
      Institut Pascal laboratory has notably developed an innovative functional AR system, in&#xD;
      laparoscopy in gynaecological, digestive and urological surgery The feasibility in endonasal&#xD;
      surgery has been confirmed in a cadaveric model and its clinical utility shown on various&#xD;
      systems. However, the question of accuracy during calibration and during the surgery remains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a surface registration system based on 3D reconstructions of patient's face and&#xD;
      endoscopic images. It would match 3D reconstructions of the patient's images with 3D&#xD;
      reconstructions of the CT scan or MRI images. Thus, this device would be able to provide a&#xD;
      large number of reference points for precise mapping. Tissue recognition (texture, contours,&#xD;
      etc.) processes would allow to display the right information in the right place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there is no such AR endonasal navigation system. Thus, the technical evolutions&#xD;
      developed in laparoscopy by the EnCoV team would be transposed the ENT field in order to&#xD;
      optimise endonasal endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outline of the study :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility study, observational, transversal. Feasibility criterion: To evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of a device based on AR to guide the gesture in endonasal endoscopic surgery by&#xD;
      displaying invisible high-risk areas and surgical landmarks in a reliable and accurate way.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Development of a questionnaire for AFR and SJORL ENT surgeons in order to assess their&#xD;
           needs and the interest of implementing such a navigation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study of the feasibility of integrating, in the laboratory, CT scan images with facial&#xD;
           and endonasal images filmed in the operating theatre, to form a qualitative clinical&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients and data acquisition:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Data acquisition The images will be collected in the operating theatre of the ENT&#xD;
                and Cervico-Facial Surgery department of the Gabriel Montpied University Hospital&#xD;
                in Clermont-Ferrand. They will be obtained from videos of the face and endonasal&#xD;
                anatomy filmed using the endoscope. All these images will be anonymised.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Duration of inclusion: 12 months (November 2020- October 2021)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Number of patients: Intermediate stages with analysis every 5 patients for the&#xD;
                first 15 patients and then every 10 patients will be realised, adapting the&#xD;
                recording methods and algorithms to the results. This will be a progressive process&#xD;
                of adjustment and refinement. The methods for recording patient data in the&#xD;
                operating theatre will evolve in order to optimise image processing. The annual&#xD;
                recruitment capacity is 50 patients; a maximum number of 30 to 40 patients is&#xD;
                expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Written consent: prospective collection of the patient's non-opposition&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Duration of each patient's participation: 1 day&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Data processing: This will be a collaborative work with the EnCoV team under the&#xD;
                responsibility of Pr A. BARTOLI. The most relevant images will be extracted,&#xD;
                corrected and then transformed into a 3D model in order to acquire depth data. The&#xD;
                CT scan images will also be transformed into 3D format. These two 3D models (from&#xD;
                the patient and from the imaging) will be merged using an algorithm, in order to&#xD;
                allow surface registration. The data will first be stored on the EnCoV servers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Validation of the navigation system by experimenting it on phantom models made from 3D&#xD;
           printing and ex vivo animal models, to form a quantitative preclinical study. In&#xD;
           endonasal endoscopy procedures the validity of the display of easily recognisable&#xD;
           structures will be checked.&#xD;
