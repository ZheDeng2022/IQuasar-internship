    <textblock>
      This phase I trial identifies the best dose of ipilimumab that can be administered through&#xD;
      the DoseConnect device followed by nivolumab in treating patients with stage III-IV melanoma&#xD;
      that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) or has spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      (metastatic). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may&#xD;
      help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor&#xD;
      cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ipilimumab that can be administered&#xD;
      through the DoseConnect device followed 30 minutes later by nivolumab intravenously (IV) on&#xD;
      day 1 of a 21-day cycle in patients with metastatic melanoma. (Dose-De-escalation Cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the pharmacokinetics of ipilimumab administered using the DoseConnect followed&#xD;
      30 minutes later by nivolumab IV in patients with metastatic melanoma demonstrating&#xD;
      in-transit metastases. (Dose De-escalation Cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the changes in immunologic profile after one cycle of ipilimumab administered&#xD;
      using the DoseConnect followed 30 minutes later by nivolumab IV. (Dose-De-escalation Cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ipilimumab via DoseConnect on day 1 of cycle 1 and via IV over 30 minutes on&#xD;
      day 1 of cycles 2-4. Patients also receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 21 days for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months until disease&#xD;
      progression, and then every 6 months for up to 2 years after registration.&#xD;

    <description>For each individual, a time series plot of the fold increase in a given immune parameter from pre-treatment levels will be constructed to visual inspect for trends. An immune response in a given parameter will be defined as a two-fold or more increase from pre-treatment levels for those with detectable levels prior to treatment or a two-fold or more increase from the LLD for those with levels below the LLD prior to treatment. A 90% confidence interval will be constructed for the difference in the proportion of patients who have an immune response after cycle 1 (ipilimumab [IpI] -DoseConnect [DC]) and lose it after cycle 2 (IpI-intravenous [IV]) and the proportion of patients who do not have an immune response after Cycle 1 (IpI -DC) but do after cycle 2 (IpI-IV).</description>
