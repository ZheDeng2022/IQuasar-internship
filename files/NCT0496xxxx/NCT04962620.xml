    <textblock>
      A study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Longidaze for the&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of external genital endometriosis .&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the outcomes of complex therapy in patients with external&#xD;
      genital endometriosis who, in addition to hormonal therapy, were prescribed Longidaze®,&#xD;
      vaginal and rectal suppositories, 3000 IU, with the outcomes of therapy in patients who&#xD;
      received only hormonal therapy.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the severity of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain (Day 30)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in the severity of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain by visual analogue scale (VAS) after 30 days from the baseline value in patients of the dienogest + Longidaze® combination therapy group compared with patients who received only dienogest. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is designed to measure pain intensity. It is a continuous scale in the form of a horizontal line 10 cm (100 mm) long and located on it two extreme points: &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;the strongest pain you can imagine.&quot; The patient is asked to place a line perpendicularly crossing the visual analogue scale at the point that corresponds to his pain intensity. The ruler measures the distance (mm) between &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;the worst pain imaginable,&quot; providing a score range from 0 to 100. A higher score indicates more pain intensity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the severity of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain (Days 90, 150, 180)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, Day 90, Day 150, Day 180</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in the severity of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain according to the VAS after 90, 150 and 180 days relative to the baseline value in patients of the dienogest + Longidaze® combination therapy group compared with patients who received only dienogest. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is designed to measure pain intensity. It is a continuous scale in the form of a horizontal line 10 cm (100 mm) long and located on it two extreme points: &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;the strongest pain you can imagine.&quot; The patient is asked to place a line perpendicularly crossing the visual analogue scale at the point that corresponds to his pain intensity. The ruler measures the distance (mm) between &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;the worst pain imaginable,&quot; providing a score range from 0 to 100.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Biberoglu and Berman scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, Day 30, Day 90, Day 150, Day 180</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the Biberoglu and Berman scale after 30, 90, 150 and 180 days from the baseline value from the start of treatment in patients of the dienogest + Longidaze® combination therapy group compared with patients who received only dienogest. The Biberoglu and Berman scale consists of five 4-point scales for assessing the severity of dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia and chronic pelvic pain not associated with menstruation, as well as the assessment of pain and static hyperalgesia during gynecological examination. In each of the scales, 0 points - no symptom, 3 points - the most pronounced symptom. The result is assessed by the sum of points for each symptom. With a sum of points from 1 to 2, pelvic pain is considered mild, from 3 to 5 - moderate, from 6 to 10 - strong, from 11 to 15 - severe.</description>

    <measure>Change in the score on the SF-36 quality of life questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, Day 30, Day 90, Day 150, Day 180</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the score on the SF-36 quality of life questionnaire after 30, 90, 150 and 180 days relative to the baseline value from the start of treatment in patients of the dienogest + Longidaze® combination therapy group compared with patients who received only dienogest.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the severity of uterine bleeding</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, Day 30, Day 90, Day 150, Day 180</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the severity of uterine bleeding after 30, 90, 150 and 180 days from the start of treatment in patients of the dienogest + Longidaze® combination therapy group compared with patients who received only dienogest. Patients will assess the severity of uterine bleeding in the patient's diary using the Mansfield-Voda-Jorgensen scale. There are five scoring options ranging from light bleeding to heavy bleeding. The rating is determined by the frequency of changing sanitary napkins or tampons, the degree of absorption of these products with blood, and also depends on the absorption properties of these products.</description>
