      The study was performed as a prospective, single center study at the Department of&#xD;
      Orthopedics, Sacred Heart of Jesus Hospital Vienna, Austria. 117 patients were enrolled in a&#xD;
      from January 2016 to May 2017. 53 patients received an isoelastic monoblock cup (RM Pressfit&#xD;
      vitamys® Mathys) and 64 patients received a metal- backed modular cup (ANA.NOVA® ImplanTec).&#xD;
      Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans according to DeLee and Charnley Zones were performed&#xD;
      at time points 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. The aim of thise study was to&#xD;
      compare changes in BMD between an isoelastic monoblock cup and a titanium modular cup. We&#xD;
      hypothesized that the more elastic monoblock cup performs better than the more rigid modular&#xD;
      cup with regard to changes in BMD.&#xD;

      The study was performed as a prospective, single center study at the Department of&#xD;
      Orthopedics, Sacred Heart of Jesus Hospital Vienna, Austria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria were as follows: any patient aged from 18 years onwards undergoing primary&#xD;
      cementless THA for degenerative joint disease, including osteoarthritis, post-traumatic&#xD;
      arthritis, congenital hip dysplasia and avascular necrosis. Excluded were all patients with&#xD;
      malignant diseases and pregnant women, additionally, patients were excluded if severe&#xD;
      complications such as fracture or revision surgery occurred during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were enrolled from January 2016 to May 2017, a total of 117 patients were included.&#xD;
      All patients underwent uncemented THA, patients either received a monoblock cup (RM Pressfit&#xD;
      vitamys®; Mathys Ltd. Bettlach, Switzerland), or a titanium shell (ANA.NOVA® Implantec,&#xD;
      Mödling, Austria). DEXA measurements according to the DeLee and Charnley Zones were performed&#xD;
      postoperatively, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after primary hip arthroplasty. Bone mineral density&#xD;
      (BMD) was measured by using the bone densiometer (Lunar, Prodigy, GE Medical Sytsems). A&#xD;
      special legholder was used to fix the leg to ensure the same rotation and avoid measurement&#xD;
      errors. DEXA measurements were performed and analyzed by two trained authors. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis focused on differences in BMD between monoblock cup and modular cup after 3, 6, 12&#xD;
      and 24 months as well as changes in BMD in relation to cup inclination. In order to gain&#xD;
      valid results, the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used. We used t-Test to evaluate&#xD;
      differences to the baseline. A probability value of p ≤0.05 was considered as statistically&#xD;
      significant. Data was analyzed using Microsoft Excel® and SPSS® (version 26.0, SPSS Inc.,&#xD;
      Chicago, IL, USA) representing standard statistical software. We hypothesized that the more&#xD;
      elastic monoblock cup performs better than the more rigid modular cup with regard to changes&#xD;
      in BMD.&#xD;
