  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, exploratory study. The study plans to enroll 30 eligible patients to&#xD;
      receive MEK inhibitor combined with anlotinib. Tumor assessments will be performed at&#xD;
      Screening with follow-up at Week 4 ±1 week from the date of the first cycle treatment, and&#xD;
      then every 4 weeks ±1 week until confirmed objective disease progression. Patients will&#xD;
      participate in safety follow-up after the first course of treatment, until within 3 months&#xD;
      after stopping the drug due to PD or toxicity. Blood samples will be collected at baseline&#xD;
      and each periodic assessment for biomarker analysis and screening.&#xD;

      Target subject population Adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with histologically or&#xD;
      cytologically documented extensive disease (American Joint Committee on Cancer Stage (8th&#xD;
      edition) IIIB-IV NSCLC. Patients must have World Health Organization/Eastern Cooperative&#xD;
      Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, weight &gt; 30 kg and adequate organ and marrow&#xD;
      function. All patients have no contraindications to the target drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of treatment Unless specific treatment discontinuation criteria are met, enrolled&#xD;
      patients will continue therapy until disease progression, as per investigator assessment.&#xD;
      Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration Trametinib 2mg will be&#xD;
      administered for all patients concurrently with Anlotinib starting on week 0. Trametinib will&#xD;
      be administered according to prescribing information in general use. The dose is 2mg, QD, PO.&#xD;
      Anlotinib is available at three dose levels, 12 mg, 10 mg, and 8 mg. Initial dose is 10 mg,&#xD;
      QD, PO, 14 days-on and 7 days-off. If there are no patients with DLT in first treatment cycle&#xD;
      , begin to explore dose of 12 mg. If there are 2 or more patients in 3 patients with DLT, 8&#xD;
      mg dose is to explore. Dose reduction may take place whenever toxicity that is not controlled&#xD;
      with optimal supportive care is noted during the study. If a subject subsequently tolerates&#xD;
      treatment well at that level in the judgment of the investigator, the dose may be increased&#xD;
      to the next dose level. If a subject cannot tolerate treatment after dose reduction to 8 mg,&#xD;
      treatment will be discontinued.&#xD;
