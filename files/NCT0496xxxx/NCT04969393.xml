  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will propose a novel approach to treat pregnant women with mild to moderate carpal&#xD;
      tunnel syndrome (CTS) using the recently introduced High intensity laser therapy with its&#xD;
      deep penetration and high-power characteristics. It's hopeful that the results of this study&#xD;
      can fill the gap of knowledge surrounding the conservative treatment options for CTS in order&#xD;
      to help patients restore their nerve function properly and promote new ways of addressing&#xD;
      CTS.&#xD;

    <description>The Median sensory nerve (SNDL) distal latency was measured according to the American Association of Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AAEM) guidelines with a Neuropack S1 MEB-9004 Nihon Koden (Japan). All measurements were performed in a room with the temperature kept at 25C.</description>

    <description>The Median motor nerve (MNDL) distal latency was measured according to the American Association of Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AAEM) guidelines with a Neuropack S1 MEB-9004 Nihon Koden (Japan).

    <measure>Changes in hand grip strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 5 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The hand grip strength (measured in Kilograms) was evaluated by the same investigator. Grip strength was tested by using Jamar hand held dynamometer following the American Society of Hand Therapists guidelines. The patient's arm was positioned with the shoulder adducted and neutrally rotated, the elbow was flexed at 90, the forearm and wrist were neutrally positioned while the participant was sitting. Patients were instructed to squeeze the handle as hard as they could, do maximal grip contraction for 2-5 s.</description>

    <description>An 11-point Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS; 0 = no pain, 10 = maximum pain) was used to assess the patients' levels of hand pain pre and post treatment.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients in group (A) received conventional physical therapy program along with HILT. Patients received pulsed Nd: YAG laser treatment, produced by EXAND MY 1064 nm Laser system, Mectronic Medicale, Italy. The apparatus provided pulsed emission (1064 nm), very high peak power (3 kW), a high level of fluency (energy density; 360-1780 mJ/cm2).</description>

    <arm_group_label>Group B (Conventional Physical Therapy)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients in this group received the conventional physical therapy program in the form of splinting, tendon and neural gliding exercises. Patients were instructed to wear a neutral custom volar splint at night and while performing strenuous activities during the day for 5 weeks.Also, the patients performed nerve-and tendon-gliding exercise under direct supervision of the therapist during the treatment sessions. Each exercise was repeated 10 times at each session and patients were encouraged to apply exercise 3-5 times per day for 5 weeks.</description>

    <description>Fifteen treatment sessions with pulsed Nd: YAG laser were applied to the subjects of the study group, three sessions per week, over 5 weeks in succession via EXAND MY 1064 nm Laser system, Mectronic Medicale, Italy. Patients in group (A) received HILT along with the conventional physical therapy program. The session involved 3 subphases: (1) The Initial phase &quot;Analgesic phase&quot;, (2) In the intermediate phase &quot;Trigger point phase&quot;and (3)The final phase &quot;Bio-stimulation phase&quot; was applied for 6 minutes with a slow scanning in several parallel longitudinal lines.</description>
