  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of transarterial&#xD;
      chemoembolization (TACE) combined with sorafenib/lenvatinib and iodion-125 seeds&#xD;
      brachytherapy (TACE-MKI-I) compared with TACE combined with sorafenib/lenvatinib (TACE-MKI)&#xD;
      for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein branch tumor thrombus (branch PVTT).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an single center, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      TACE-MKI-I compared with TACE-MKI for the treatment of HCC with branch PVTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      171 HCC patients with branch PVTT will be enrolled in this study. The Patients will be&#xD;
      treated with TACE-MKI-I or TACE-MKI using an 2:1 randomization scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TACE will be performed for the patients after randomization. Either sorafenib (400mg P.O.&#xD;
      BID) or lenvatinib (body weight ≥ 60 kg, 12mg P.O. QD; body weight &lt; 60 kg, 8mg P.O. QD) will&#xD;
      be started at 3-7 days after the first TACE according to the patients' own will and last&#xD;
      until disease progresses, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, loss of&#xD;
      follow-up, death, or other circumstances that require termination of treatment, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first. For patients in the TACE-MKI-I arm, iodion-125 seeds will be implanted into the&#xD;
      PVTT (according to the pre-operative planning) under CT guidance within 14 days after the&#xD;
      first TACE. TACE and iodion-125 seeds implantation can be repeated on demand during follow-up&#xD;
      based on the evaluation of laboratory and imaging examination.&#xD;
