  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer who had undergone&#xD;
      total/near-total thyroidectomy. After surgery patients were randomized to one of two methods&#xD;
      of performing thyroid remnant ablation. One group of patients who took thyroid hormone&#xD;
      medicine and were euthyroid [i.e. their thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are normal],&#xD;
      and received injections of rhTSH (0.9 mg daily on two consecutive days) followed by oral&#xD;
      radioiodine. The second group of patients did not take thyroid hormone medicine so that they&#xD;
      were hypothyroid (i.e. their TSH levels were high), and were given oral radioiodine.&#xD;
