  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is usually treated with antidepressant therapy (ADT);&#xD;
      however, sometimes ADTs alone are not enough to adequately treat GAD. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to assess adverse events and the change in disease activity with cariprazine when&#xD;
      added to ADTs compared with placebo in adult participants with GAD who have had an inadequate&#xD;
      response to 1 or more prior ADTs alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cariprazine is an approved drug being developed for the treatment of GAD. The participants&#xD;
      are placed into 1 of 4 groups, called treatment arms. Each group receives a different&#xD;
      treatment. There is a 1 in 4 chance that participants will be assigned to placebo. Around&#xD;
      1072 participants age 18-65 with GAD and an inadequate response to ADT alone will be enrolled&#xD;
      in the study in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a 2-week screening period, participants will receive daily oral capsules of cariprazine&#xD;
      of varying doses or placebo for 6 weeks, followed by a 4-week safety follow-up period for a&#xD;
      total study duration of 10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their&#xD;
      standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or&#xD;
      clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests,&#xD;
      checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.&#xD;

    <description>The SDS: Anxiety is a 5-item, patient-reported measure used to assess functional impairment in the domains of work/school, social life, and family life on a 10-point numeric rating scale with verbal anchors. The 3 items assessing work/school, social life, and home life or family responsibilities impairment are summed into a single dimensional measure of global functional impairment, with scores ranging from 0 (unimpaired) to 30 (highly impaired). Higher scores indicate greater impairment.</description>
