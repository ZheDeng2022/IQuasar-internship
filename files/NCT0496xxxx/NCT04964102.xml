      This study aims to explore associations of burn out, stress, communication skills,&#xD;
      interpersonal effectiveness and empathy level using data collected in pre and post&#xD;
      assessments from &quot;Workshop of Enhancing Interpersonal Effectiveness, Emotional Regulation and&#xD;
      Clinical Communication Skills&quot;.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The medical community is paying more and more attention to the nature of burnout,&#xD;
      physiological, or physical stress of health care professionals (HCP). Burn out and stress not&#xD;
      only affects the HCP themselves, but subsequently their team members, medical institutions,&#xD;
      and patients. Recent research has found that HCP's stress, burnout, and dissatisfaction with&#xD;
      work are associated with their practice time and leaving the job; as well as declines in&#xD;
      quality of care, poor patient results, and medical errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There seems to be a two-way correlation between burn out and empathy. On the one hand, the&#xD;
      more burn out, the lower the degree of empathy; on the other hand, the deficits in&#xD;
      perspective substitution seems to be a risk factor for burn out. The increase in multiple&#xD;
      perspectives and empathic attention seems prevent burn out. Other studies found that&#xD;
      practicing clinical communication skills through practices and role-plays, and using&#xD;
      emotional regulation methods to enable participants to express their attitudes and feelings&#xD;
      about communicating difficult problems may help HCP improve their degree of empathy and&#xD;
      communication skills. When such communication courses add combinations of stress management&#xD;
      and social skills training can not only improve communication skills, increase empathy, but&#xD;
      also prevent burnout and exhaustion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study aims to explore associations of burn out, stress, communication skills,&#xD;
      interpersonal effectiveness, and empathy level using data collected in pre- and post-&#xD;
      assessments from 'Workshops of Enhancing Interpersonal Effectiveness, Emotional Regulation,&#xD;
      and Clinical Communication Skills'. Before and after the workshop, information regarding&#xD;
      HCP's burn out, perceived stress, empathy level, and interpersonal effectiveness will be&#xD;
      assessed in order to understand whether the workshop has reached its goals and teaching&#xD;
      effectiveness. All information regarding personal data will be de-identified and encrypted.&#xD;
      These assessments are designed to evaluate the effectiveness of teaching activities in a&#xD;
      general teaching environment. This study will also focus on the reliability and validity&#xD;
      analysis of the short form research measures which used. It will conduct validation studies&#xD;
      comparing the Chinese version of the measures which used with internationally well known but&#xD;
      long research measures to make sure the reliability and validity. If these shorter forms have&#xD;
      well validity, it may be able to use the short and simplified questionnaires for related&#xD;
      research in the future.&#xD;
