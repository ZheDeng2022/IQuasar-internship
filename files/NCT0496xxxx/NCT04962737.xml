  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Somatosensory evoked potentials are crucial in determining the physiological changes of&#xD;
      potentials in nerve pathways. Although their main function is diagnostic, the investigators&#xD;
      have recently been used as a physiological test to determine physioelectric changes in&#xD;
      healthy subjects to study applied stimuli, such as laser, pain or electrotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The general configuration of the study consists of a study before and after the block of&#xD;
      sessions to be determined, and differences of all the variables measured before and after&#xD;
      NESA therapy will be compared through the mechanisms of somatosensory evocations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given its potential use, the objective of this study is to determine if there are changes in&#xD;
      the somatosensory evoked potentials of the ulnar, median, tibial, peroneal and vagus nerves&#xD;
      when non-invasive neuromodulation NESA is applied, which is used as a physiotherapy&#xD;
      treatment. for objectives such as pain, vegetative affectations and sleep disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variables of the study will be collected at two time points: before the intervention and&#xD;
      at the end of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis will be an intention-to-treat analysis. For the main outcomes&#xD;
      variables a two factor ANOVA will-be performed (intervention-time) with a post-hoc analysis&#xD;
      with kruskal wallis correction correction. Statistical significance will be defined as p&#xD;
      &lt;0.05&#xD;

Neurophysiological tests of the nervous system that functionally assesses the nerve pathways of the central and peripheral nervous system.&#xD;
Stimulations and recordings will be carried out only in the left auditory pavilion (since the right, due to the connection with the sinoatrial node of the heart by means of vagus efferences, can cause, according to the reports consulted, alteration of the heart rhythm and presyncope). Stimulations will be performed by means of a needle connected to the stimulator equipment, or in the tragus, by means of atrial surface electrode or auriculotherapy needle dipole.</description>
