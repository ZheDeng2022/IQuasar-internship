      This study is conducted to evaluate the efficacy of drug-eluting bead transarterial&#xD;
      chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) compared with conventional transarterial chemoembolization&#xD;
      (cTACE) as the conversion therapy for unresectable large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective and nonrandomized study to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      DEB-TACE (with DC Bead) compared with cTACE as the conversion therapy for unresectable large&#xD;
      HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 216 patients (≥ 108 patients in each arm) with initially unresectable large HCC (&gt;&#xD;
      7cm) will be enrolled in this study. The patients will receive either DEB-TACE or cTACE as&#xD;
      the primary treatment according to their won will. TACE can be repeated on demand based on&#xD;
      the evaluation of follow-up laboratory and imaging examination by the multidisciplinary team,&#xD;
      and the technique method of each TACE procedure (i.e. DEB-TACE or cTACE) for the same patient&#xD;
      should be consistent. During follow-up, the potential resectability of the tumor will be&#xD;
      assessed by the multidisciplinary team (MDT). Once the tumors become resectable, curative&#xD;
      surgical resection will be recommended for the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point of this study is success rate of conversion to resection. The secondary&#xD;
      endpoints are objective response rate (ORR) of TACE, progression-free survival (PFS), times&#xD;
      of TACE procedure to achieve conversion, conversion time, success rate of surgical resection,&#xD;
      tumor recurrence rate after resection, tumor-free survival (TFS) of patients who undergo&#xD;
      surgical resection, adverse events (AEs) and overall survival (OS).&#xD;

    <description>The patients will receive DEB-TACE if they choose DEB-TACE as the primary treatment. DC Bead loaded with epirubicin (1 vial of DC Bead loaded with 60 mg of epirubicin) is used for chemoembolization. During follow-up, TACE will be repeated on demand based on the evaluation of the follow-up laboratory and imaging examination, and the technique method of each TACE procedure (i.e. DEB-TACE) for the same patient should be consistent.</description>

    <description>The patients will receive cTACE if they choose cTACE as the primary treatment. An emulsion of epirubicin in lipiodol wiil be injected into the tumor feeding artery. Afterwards, microspheres or polyvinyl alcohol particles mixed with contrast agent will be administered intraarterially until arterial flow stasis was achieved. Generally, the dose of lipiodol and epirubicin should not exceed 30 mL and 60 mg for each procedure. During follow-up, TACE will be repeated on demand based on the evaluation of the follow-up laboratory and imaging examination, and the technique method of each TACE procedure (i.e. cTACE) for the same patient should be consistent.</description>
