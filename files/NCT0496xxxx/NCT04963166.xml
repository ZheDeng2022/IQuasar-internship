      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influenza (flu) virus infects millions around the world every year. Children are at&#xD;
      increased risk of complications from the flu. The flu vaccine protects against influenza, but&#xD;
      the vaccine can be improved. Researchers want to learn more about children s mucosal and&#xD;
      systemic immunity after flu vaccination. This could help to develop more effective flu&#xD;
      vaccines in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn what happens in kids immune systems after receiving a flu vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children ages 2-17 who have received a flu vaccine in the past and plan to get the current&#xD;
      seasonal flu vaccine given by injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study visits will take place at home and communication with the study team will be done&#xD;
      via phone or videoconference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will review medical history and flu vaccination history with the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get the flu vaccine at their local doctor s office or pharmacy. They will&#xD;
      not be given the vaccine in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete an electronic survey to give details about the date and type of&#xD;
      flu vaccine received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will collect nasal and fingerstick samples at home. They will collect 4 nasal&#xD;
      samples and 3 fingerstick samples over 6 months: once before they get the flu vaccine and 2-3&#xD;
      times after they get the vaccine. They will use collection kits that include instructions,&#xD;
      sample collection supplies, and shipping materials. They will ship all samples back to NIH&#xD;
      with all costs covered by NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compensation is provided.&#xD;

      Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natural History of Systemic and Nasal Mucosal Immunity after Influenza Vaccination in a&#xD;
      Pediatric Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While adults are heavily represented in influenza vaccine studies, there are limited studies&#xD;
      in the pediatric population. This study will characterize the changes in nasal and systemic&#xD;
      immunity after influenza vaccination in a pediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characterize nasal mucosal humoral immune response pre and post influenza vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characterize systemic humoral immune response pre and post influenza vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Describe the trend of nasal mucosal mucosal and serum humoral immune response over time after&#xD;
      vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline and post-vaccination mucosal anti-influenza antibodies from nasal samples as&#xD;
           measured by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Anti-hemagglutination (HA) head antibody quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent&#xD;
                assay (ELISA) immunoglobulins (Ig) (IgA, IgG)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Anti-HA stalk antibody quantitative ELISA (IgA, IgG)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Anti-neuraminidase (NA) antibody quantitative ELISA (IgA, IgG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Baseline and post-vaccination systemic anti-influenza antibodies as measured by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Anti-HA head antibody quantitative ELISA (IgM, IgG, IgA)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Anti-HA stalk antibody quantitative ELISA (IgM, IgG, IgA)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Anti-NA antibody quantitative ELISA (IgM, IgG, IgA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple timepoint measurements of mucosal anti-influenza antibodies from nasal samples as&#xD;
      measured by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-HA head antibody quantitative ELISA (IgA, IgG)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-HA stalk antibody quantitative ELISA (IgA, IgG)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-NA antibody quantitative ELISA (IgA, IgG)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple timepoint measurements of systemic anti-influenza antibodies as measured by:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-HA head antibody quantitative ELISA (IgM, IgG, IgA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-HA stalk antibody quantitative ELISA (IgM, IgG, IgA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-NA antibody quantitative ELISA (IgM, IgG, IgA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children who are &gt;= 2 years and &lt; 18 years of age (N = 51; accrual ceiling = 100).&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled by age group: 2 - 6 years old, 7 - 11 years old and 12 - 17&#xD;
      years old with a goal enrollment of 17 per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled by telephone or videoconference, and sample collections will be&#xD;
      done in participant homes. Recruitment will be from community pediatric clinics and self- or&#xD;
      family referral.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Children receiving their first ever influenza vaccine require two doses of the vaccine one&#xD;
        month apart and will not be included in this study. Only participants who have already&#xD;
        received a flu vaccine series in the past will be eligible for this study. Evaluation of&#xD;
        immunity after the first ever influenza vaccination series is an important question that&#xD;
        should be explored separately. We will enroll participants into one of three cohorts by&#xD;
        age: 2 6 years old, 7 11 years old, and 12 17 years old. We will aim to enroll similar&#xD;
        numbers of participants into each group to ensure a diverse age range in our population.&#xD;
