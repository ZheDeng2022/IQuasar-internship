  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted as a randomized controlled study to determine effect of tube bathing&#xD;
      on skin and bilirubin levels in infants undergoing tunnel and LED of phototherapy. The&#xD;
      population of the study consisted of term babies with the diagnosis of hyperbilirubinemia in&#xD;
      Gaziantep Cengiz Gökçek Maternity and Pediatrics Hospital and Kilis State Hospital Neonatal&#xD;
      Intensive Care Units (NICU) among November 2019-September 2020. The sample size was composed&#xD;
      of a total of 140 babies, which were determined according to Power Analysis and met the case&#xD;
      selection criteria. Accordingly, Thirty-five babies were randomly assigned to each group&#xD;
      (Tunnel Group = experiment and control; LED Group = experiment and control). The babies in&#xD;
      the experimental groups were given a tube bath at 6 and 12 hours after phototherapy started.&#xD;
      On the other hand, the babies in the control groups were given routine cares in the units.&#xD;
      Data were gathered 'Information and Registration Form', Neonatal Skin Risk Assessment Scale&#xD;
      (NSRAS) and Neonatal Skin Condition Score (NSCS).&#xD;

    <description>When differences regarding decrease in 24-hour total serum bilirubin (TSB) levels were compared in all relevant experimental groups, statistically differences were observed (p˂ .001). In particular, the levels of bilirubin were listed as LED-trial, Tunnel-trial, Tunnel-control and LED-control, respectively. It is worthy to utter herein that the decline in TSB was more notable in bathing groups.</description>
