      University Students with Mild to Moderate Depressive symptoms University students experience&#xD;
      a range of unique psychosocial stressors that increase their risk of major depression that&#xD;
      are substantially higher than those found in the general population (Nahla, et.al., 2013).&#xD;
      The prevalence rates of moderate to extremely severe depression symptom was 69.5% in&#xD;
      Bangladesh (Islam, et.al., 2020), and 57.6% of the students suffered from moderate to&#xD;
      extremely severe depression symptom among final-year medical students in India (Kumar,&#xD;
      et.al.,2019), and a study showed that the prevalence of depression is particularly high among&#xD;
      Australian university students (Farrer, et. al.,2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A report from the CHP in Hong Kong showed that the prevalence of mild to moderate, and severe&#xD;
      depressive symptoms in adolescents and children were 51.1%, and 4.2% respectively in 2012&#xD;
      (CHP, 2020). However, a cross-sectional study of Hong Kong showed that a high proportion of&#xD;
      the university students displayed depressive symptoms with 68.5% of them presented mild and&#xD;
      moderate depressive symptoms, and 9% presented moderately severe to severe depressive&#xD;
      symptoms (Lun, et. al., 2018). The result was higher than a similar survey (20.9%) conducted&#xD;
      by the University of Hong Kong 10 years ago (Wong, et. al., 2006). Although almost 3 in every&#xD;
      5 undergraduate students (59.5%) in Hong Kong are likely to experience mild to moderate&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, inadequate attention has been given in primary health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health impact with Mild to Moderate Depressive symptoms Mild depression usually affects our&#xD;
      daily activities and causes detectable symptoms in university students, and it is common but&#xD;
      often remain unrecognized and treated inadequately (Klein, et. al., 2016). If the&#xD;
      investigator can accurately diagnose depression when it is mild, and treating it effectively&#xD;
      at this stage that can prevent the condition from worsening to become moderate or severe. The&#xD;
      majority of suicide cases are linked with mental disorders, and most of them are triggered by&#xD;
      severe depression. Suicide was the second leading cause of death among 15-29 year olds&#xD;
      globally in 2015 (WHO, 2017). In Hong Kong, the number of suicides in the age-group 15 to 24&#xD;
      years increased in subsequent years from 54 in 2014, to 68 in 2015 and 75 in 2016 (DH, 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insufficient student mental health services within the University Campus In Hong Kong, only 3&#xD;
      out of 8 universities providing health services on campus. At the beginning of school term,&#xD;
      students will be arranged to fill the mental wellness questionnaire from Office of Student&#xD;
      Affairs, and they will be referred to see counselors or consult the doctor in school clinic&#xD;
      if necessary. Only one university provides in-house psychiatric service, the student will be&#xD;
      referred to In-house psychiatric service by OPD doctors. Other universities may refer to&#xD;
      outside psychiatric service, with a long waiting queue for more than 6 months in Hospital&#xD;
      Authority, or to receive private psychiatrist subsidized by university itself. For the&#xD;
      current psychiatric service in one of the universities in Hong Kong, there is a total of 803&#xD;
      attendances (148 students) in 2018/19, with 5.4 visits per student, 79 of students have&#xD;
      depression (53%), 55 students who had suicidal idea, plan or act (37%). A considerable&#xD;
      increase in the demand for psychiatric services followed by an increase number of university&#xD;
      students reported depressive symptoms (64 students in 2017-18 vs 79 students in 2018-19),&#xD;
      consequently increased the waiting time for the consultation. Apart from the existing&#xD;
      psychiatric consultation for those who presented severe depressive symptoms, there is an&#xD;
      imperative need to develop and evaluate effective prevention strategies to help those&#xD;
      university students with mild to moderate depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief nursing advice for University Students with Mild to Moderate Depressive symptoms&#xD;
      Evidence shows that a brief nursing advice is more feasible and cost-effective (Vijay,&#xD;
      G.C.,et. al., 2015), and all very brief interventions for physical activity were acceptable&#xD;
      and low cost. (Pears et. Al., 2015). It can increase physical activity in the short term when&#xD;
      compared with usual care or more intensive interventions. Comparing to other interventions,&#xD;
      such as cognitive behaviour therapy, which probably takes many weeks to implement but with&#xD;
      only short-term effect in reducing depression (Stallman, et al.,2016). All nursing staff are&#xD;
      well trained to provide a brief advice on mental health and thus no extra training is&#xD;
      required. The intervention is suggested to deliver in a single session of no more than 5 min,&#xD;
      that could be delivered in health checks or similar consultations (Vijay, G.C.,et. al.,&#xD;
      2015). Students can receive brief nursing advice at the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, nurses play as an important role in multidisciplinary collaboration in the&#xD;
      University campus, such as Office of Student Affairs, faculty and department. They can refer&#xD;
      their students to university clinic if the student is in needed. All urgent cases can be&#xD;
      arranged to consult in-house psychiatrists within the same day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If brief nursing advice in the campus can lower the depression symptoms of the university&#xD;
      students, it can align with Department of Health in strengthening the primary health care and&#xD;
      reduce the burden of tertiary healthcare. Due to the convenient location on campus, the&#xD;
      intervention will be more accessible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why Physical activity? In general, the counselors or psychiatrists will focus on the&#xD;
      stressors, or signs and symptoms of the university students which cause depression symptoms&#xD;
      in the consultation visit. However, the evidence supporting physical activity as a treatment&#xD;
      for mild-to-moderate depression, which is extensive and relatively uncontested. A precious&#xD;
      study showed that university students who did exercise regularly reported fewer depressive&#xD;
      symptoms than those who did not perform regular exercise (Lun, et. al., 2018). A study&#xD;
      reported that both motivational and volitional elements are important in any intervention to&#xD;
      increase physical activity in people with mild-to-moderate depression (Katarzyna, et. al.,&#xD;
      2018). Physical activity was negatively related to the level of depression by severity among&#xD;
      Undergraduate Students in Malaysia (Wan, et. al., 2020). Students with regular exercise&#xD;
      towards the future experienced fewer depressive symptoms (Lun, et. al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theoretical or conceptual framework of how physical activity can help people reduce the&#xD;
      depressive symptoms Theory-based interventions are more effective in changing behaviour than&#xD;
      interventions that do not use a theoretical approach (Prestwich, A., et. al, 2014), and&#xD;
      Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) is one of the most widely used theories in health behaviour&#xD;
      research. SCT has guided the development of numerous physical activity interventions and its&#xD;
      constructs are strongly associated with physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research gap School-based intervention on mental health is found to be insufficient in both&#xD;
      local and global university settings, and rarely discussed or reported in the literature.&#xD;
      Besides, no study describe the theoretical or conceptual framework of brief intervention in&#xD;
      health advice. The investigator hypothesized that brief nursing advice is effective to lower&#xD;
      the severity of depressive symptoms of the university students with mild to moderate&#xD;
      depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7A. Study design: i. Study design We will conduct a Randomised Control Trial, with two-group&#xD;
      pre-test and repeated post-tests, and a between-subjects design following CONSORT guideline.&#xD;
      PHQ-9 questionnaires (PHQ-9) will be completed by the participants before and after receiving&#xD;
      the intervention. The participants will be assessed their depression symptoms via&#xD;
      questionnaire, followed up their progress of physical activity changes and given a booster&#xD;
      intervention at 2nd month. At 6th month, participants will be assessed their depression&#xD;
      symptoms via questionnaire. For the control group, participants will be given a health&#xD;
      education leaflet and assessed their depression symptoms via questionnaire, followed up their&#xD;
      progress of physical activity changes at 2nd month and 6th month. The researchers strictly&#xD;
      adhere to the declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Settings The setting will be in University Health Service, CUHK campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Subjects For the enrolment, all students who visit clinic will be assessed for the&#xD;
      eligibility to join the study. The inclusion criteria include aged 18 aged or above, able to&#xD;
      speak and read in Chinese, had presented mild to moderate depressive symptoms as identified&#xD;
      by a minimum score of 5 on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and will have at least 1&#xD;
      more year's study period in the university. The investigator will exclude those with actively&#xD;
      suicidal, PHQ score &gt;15-19 moderately severe, 20-27 severe depressive symptoms, or those who&#xD;
      are receiving antidepressant medication or mental health service such as counselling or&#xD;
      psychiatric consultation, or Athletes/ &gt;150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical&#xD;
      activity throughout the week, or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity.&#xD;
      For those are excluded in the study, all cases will be referred by medical doctors or&#xD;
      in-house psychiatrists for follow up within the same day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and allocation concealment Informed consent will be sought from each&#xD;
      participant. The investigator will conduct baseline assessment, and randomization to allocate&#xD;
      the subjects into intervention or control group. All procedure will be implemented in single&#xD;
      room to ensure the privacy and to minimize the possibility of contamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group For the intervention group, participants will receive a 5-mins brief&#xD;
      nursing advice incorporating with Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). The protocol is about the&#xD;
      relationship between exercise and mental health, the advantages of increase physical activity&#xD;
      and regular exercise, and highlight the consequence if not deal with the depressive symptoms.&#xD;
      At the 2nd month, participants will be assessed their depression symptoms via questionnaire,&#xD;
      followed up their progress of physical activity changes and given a booster intervention. At&#xD;
      6th months, subjects will be assessed their depression symptoms and the level of physical&#xD;
      activity changes via questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group A wellbeing leaflet from CHP will be provided to each participant. At the 2nd&#xD;
      month, subjects will be assessed their depression symptoms via questionnaire, followed up&#xD;
      their progress of physical activity changes and given another wellbeing leaflets. At 6th&#xD;
      months, subjects will be assessed their depression symptoms the level of physical activity&#xD;
      changes via questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion, the subject will be received a $50 cash coupon for the incentive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v. Data analysis All data will be entered and analyzed by using SPSS for Window, v. 26.&#xD;
      Independent t-test will be used to compare the change in depressive symptoms before and after&#xD;
      intervention between the two groups. The investigator will use the 9-item Patient Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for the measurement tool. It is a valid and reliable tool for assessing&#xD;
      depressive symptoms in Hong Kong general population. It is used to monitor the severity of&#xD;
      depression and response to treatment.&#xD;
