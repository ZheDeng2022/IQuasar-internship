    <textblock>
      This project uses concurrent CEA+CABG combined surgery on high-risk patients with severe&#xD;
      carotid artery stenosis and severe coronary artery stenosis. After multidisciplinary&#xD;
      preoperative evaluation, intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring, and postoperative&#xD;
      management standards, compare CEA+CABG combined operations during the same period And the&#xD;
      advantages and disadvantages of a single CABG or CEA operation, the purpose is to explore the&#xD;
      best surgical treatment plan, establish an interdisciplinary clinical medicine platform&#xD;
      centered on patients with heart and cerebrovascular diseases, and develop a standard&#xD;
      procedure and The perioperative management is standard, so it is particularly important and&#xD;
      naturally has its advanced significance.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (1) In patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis, the preoperative CTA or DSA,&#xD;
             combined with carotid ultrasound and high-resolution magnetic resonance clearly&#xD;
             diagnosed the degree of carotid artery stenosis on the responsible side&gt;50%; (2)&#xD;
             Patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis before operation CTA or DSA,&#xD;
             combined with carotid ultrasound and high-resolution magnetic resonance, clearly&#xD;
             diagnosed the carotid artery stenosis rate of the affected side&gt;70%; (3) All patients&#xD;
             with carotid artery stenosis were located in the surgically accessible position,&#xD;
             without complete carotid artery occlusion or intracranial segment Severe vascular&#xD;
             stenosis; (4) The stenosis rate of the left main coronary artery by coronary&#xD;
             angiography is more than 70%, or the disease of the three main vessels is more than&#xD;
             50%, and the bridging condition is good.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:(1) The disease is beyond the reach of surgery (such as C2 level or&#xD;
        above); (2) The symptoms of hypertension are not effectively controlled before surgery&#xD;
        (systolic blood pressure&gt; 180mmHg); (3) Carotid artery stenosis caused by&#xD;
        non-atherosclerosis , Such as arteritis, arterial dissection, vascular congenital&#xD;
        malformations, etc.; (4) combined with hemorrhagic cerebrovascular diseases such as&#xD;
        intracranial aneurysms or vascular malformations; (5) combined with blood system diseases&#xD;
