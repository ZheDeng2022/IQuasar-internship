    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence of left ventricular diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis, and to analyze the correlation between Portal&#xD;
      Hemodynamics combined with N-terminal Pro-brain natriuretic Peptide and heart dysfunction in&#xD;
      patients with cirrhosis, raising clinicians' awareness of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy, early&#xD;
      assessment and intervention to improve long-term outcomes in patients with cirrhosis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Liver cirrhosis is the terminal stage of the development of chronic liver disease caused by&#xD;
      various reasons, and it is often accompanied by multiple complications. Late cirrhosis is&#xD;
      often accompanied by obvious changes in liver and systemic hemodynamics.Patients with liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis are in a highly dynamic cycle Status: lower arterial blood pressure, increased&#xD;
      heart rate, increased cardiac output, peripheral vascular resistance, often lead to changes&#xD;
      in myocardial structure and function, called cirrhotic cardiomyopathy.Cirrhotic&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy (CCM) is defined as cardiac dysfunction in patients with end-stage liver&#xD;
      disease in the absence of prior heart disease.The true burden of CCM among patients with ESLD&#xD;
      is currently unknown. Prior studies evaluated CCM prevalence and estimated it to be&#xD;
      approximately 50%,however, this estimate was based on the old criteria.Some studies show that&#xD;
      the pressure of Portal veins increases in patients with cirrhosis, Portal Hemodynamics&#xD;
      change, is related to the severity of cirrhosis, N-terminal Pro-brain Natriuretic Peptide&#xD;
      serum level is related to the heart dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis, which can be used&#xD;
      as an evaluation index of cirrhosis cardiomyopathy. In the past, most of the relevant studies&#xD;
      were related to the severity of cirrhosis and left heart dysfunction, the effect of heart&#xD;
      dysfunction on the prognosis of chronic liver disease in patients with cirrhosis, and the&#xD;
      correlation between left heart function and venous hemodynamics in patients with cirrhosis&#xD;
      was less relevant. Based on the above research background, carry out this research.&#xD;
