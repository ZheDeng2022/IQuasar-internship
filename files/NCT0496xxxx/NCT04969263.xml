  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antibodies are an important part of the body's defense against infection. Individuals who&#xD;
      have no antibodies or very low antibody levels are considered less well protected from&#xD;
      Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) than those who have higher antibody levels. What level of&#xD;
      antibodies is necessary for protection is currently unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inadequate antibody response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)&#xD;
      vaccination has been described among kidney transplant recipients. The aim of this study is&#xD;
      to elicit an antibody response to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients who have failed to respond to two doses of either the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine or&#xD;
      Pfizer-BioNTech Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine.&#xD;

      This is an open label, non-randomized study in kidney transplant recipients who received two&#xD;
      doses of either mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and have a negative (&lt;0.8 U/mL) or low (titer &lt;50 U/mL)&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 antibody response using the Roche Elecsys® anti-RBD assay. Eligible participants&#xD;
      will receive a third dose of the same mRNA vaccine as the prior two doses.&#xD;
