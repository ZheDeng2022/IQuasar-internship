  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-transplant metabolic syndrome (PTMS) affects about 50% liver transplant (OLT) and 25%&#xD;
      lung transplant (LTx) recipients at 12-18 months post-transplant. PTMS (comprised of glucose&#xD;
      intolerance, obesity, hypercholesterolemia and hypertension) has been associated with&#xD;
      increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and long-term survival. Exercise studies in the&#xD;
      early post-transplant period have shown some benefits on PTMS risk factors with&#xD;
      facility-based training, but it remains unclear if exercise can be sustained in the home&#xD;
      environment with sufficient adherence or training intensity to impact PTMS beyond the early&#xD;
      post-transplant period. Objectives: 1) To evaluate the feasibility of a three-month&#xD;
      individualized, virtual home-based exercise training program in OLT and LTx recipients&#xD;
      starting at 1 year post-transplant. 2) To assess estimates of intervention efficacy on&#xD;
      elements of PTMS, insulin resistance, exercise self-efficacy, and health related quality of&#xD;
      life (HRQL). Methods: 20 OLT and 20 LTx recipients with 2 or more PTMS risk factors at 12-18&#xD;
      months post-transplant will be randomized to a home-based exercise program versus usual care.&#xD;
      The exercise group will undergo aerobic training 3 to 5 times per week with resistance&#xD;
      training at least twice weekly over a 12-week period. Exercises will be demonstrated by a&#xD;
      qualified exercise professional during the first visit with weekly phone and video calls to&#xD;
      guide exercise progression, ease communication and promote exercise self-efficacy and&#xD;
      adherence based on guiding behavioral principles. As secondary measures, PTMS, insulin&#xD;
      resistance, body composition (optional), HRQL, and assessment of self-efficacy will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline and 12-weeks.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both LTx and OLT recipients have several common risk factors for PTMS including significant&#xD;
      weight gain, immunosuppression, and physical inactivity. These risk factors have been shown&#xD;
      to be partly reversible with an active lifestyle. A home-based exercise program may prove to&#xD;
      be an effective post-transplant intervention for improving the metabolic profile of&#xD;
      transplant recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To evaluate the feasibility (recruitment rate, program adherence,&#xD;
      attrition, safety, and participant satisfaction) of a 12 week individualized, virtual&#xD;
      home-based aerobic and resistance training program in OLT and LTx recipients that are 12-18&#xD;
      months post-transplant. Secondary objective: To assess estimates of intervention efficacy on&#xD;
      elements of PTMS, insulin resistance, exercise self-efficacy, and HRQL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: We hypothesize that it will be feasible to recruit both OLT and LTx recipients&#xD;
      into a home-based exercise program with ≥ 70% adherence to the prescribed exercise dose.&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: PTMS risk factors, self-efficacy and HRQL will be improved with a&#xD;
      home-based exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The home-based exercise group will be asked to exercise 3 to 5 times per week (≥ 150 minutes&#xD;
      of aerobic exercises at moderate intensity) and to also complete resistance training&#xD;
      (resistance bands or free weights) over a 12-week period with the guidance of a qualified&#xD;
      exercise professional. The control group will be counselled by a qualified exercise&#xD;
      professional on the importance of accumulating at least 150 minutes of moderate physical&#xD;
      activity during the first assessment at the beginning of the study. Both groups will also&#xD;
      receive physical activity trackers (Fitbit), exercise training or physical activity logs, and&#xD;
      a counselling session by the dietitian at the start of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A home-based exercise program may prove to be an effective post-transplant intervention for&#xD;
      improving the metabolic profile of transplant recipients. Characterizing the feasibility,&#xD;
      adherence, and effect estimates of home-based exercise training constitutes the first key&#xD;
      step in promoting a healthy lifestyle in transplant recipients, and supporting the&#xD;
      development of future trials aimed at reducing the morbidity associated with PTMS.&#xD;
