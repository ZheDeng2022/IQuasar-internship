  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a multifaceted rectal cancer survivorship care program involving&#xD;
      oncology specialists, nursing support and primary care physicians. This initiative centers on&#xD;
      regular meetings with oncology nursing support, enhanced communication and coordination of&#xD;
      care among clinicians including primary care physicians, and an educational platform for&#xD;
      patients regarding the late and long-term effects of cancer. Initial efforts will target&#xD;
      rectal cancer patients specifically as they have been identified as being at high risk of&#xD;
      having unmet needs. Once we have realized measurable, successful implementation in this&#xD;
      population, our hope is then to expand our initiative to all colon cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rectal cancer is a life-altering diagnosis that can have long-lasting effects not only on&#xD;
      one's physical health, but also their psychological, emotional and financial well-being. With&#xD;
      advancements in both disease detection and therapeutic options, there is now a growing cohort&#xD;
      of patients who have successfully completed active rectal cancer treatment and transitioned&#xD;
      into post-treatment care. Unfortunately, the post-treatment phase has its own set of&#xD;
      challenges. Lost in Transition was one of the first major publications to advocate for&#xD;
      dedicated survivorship planning, raising awareness of the needs of cancer survivors. Since&#xD;
      then, both the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the American Cancer Society&#xD;
      have released guidelines for survivorship care focused on prevention, surveillance,&#xD;
      assessment, intervention, coordination of care and survivorship planning. Despite these&#xD;
      efforts to bolster survivorship care, studies have found an average of 2.88 unmet needs among&#xD;
      cancer survivors affecting physical, financial, educational, emotional and psychology&#xD;
      domains. The investigators propose a multifaceted rectal cancer survivorship care program&#xD;
      involving oncology specialists, nursing support and primary care physicians. This initiative&#xD;
      centers on regular meetings with oncology nursing support, enhanced communication and&#xD;
      coordination of care among clinicians including primary care physicians, and an educational&#xD;
      platform for patients regarding the late and long-term effects of cancer. Initial efforts&#xD;
      will target rectal cancer patients specifically as they have been identified as being at high&#xD;
      risk of having unmet needs. Once the investigators have realized measurable, successful&#xD;
      implementation in this population, the hope is then to expand this initiative to all colon&#xD;
      cancer patients.&#xD;

    <description>The survivorship initiative will consist of:&#xD;
(A) Regular meetings with the rectal cancer oncology pivot nurse (IPO). These meetings present an opportunity for patients to discuss any treatment-related distress or late and long-term side-effect.&#xD;
(B) Identification of a primary care physician. If the patient is not known to a Primary care physician (PCP), the IPO will add the patient to an accelerated waitlist.&#xD;
(C) Development of an individualized survivorship plan. During meetings with the oncology pivot nurse, a survivorship care plan will be populated, included information on patient risk factors, treatments completed, pathology findings, and future surveillance planned. This document will be reviewed by the treating colorectal surgeon, and will be subsequently shared with the oncology team, the PCP and the patient (if the patient desires).&#xD;
(D) Educational resources for patients. Patients will be offered educational materials to help address their specific needs.</description>
