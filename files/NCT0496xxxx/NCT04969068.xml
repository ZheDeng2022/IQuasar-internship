  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Remimazolam has shown promising results for sedation in colonoscopy . Alfentanil is widely&#xD;
      used in the analgesia of ERCP . The purpose of the study was to determine the median&#xD;
      effective dose of remimazolam for duodenoscopy insertion during ERCP with alfentanil 10µg/kg.&#xD;

      1. Title:The median effective dose of remimazolam for duodenoscopy insertion during ERCP&#xD;
           with alfentanil 10µg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research center: Single center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The population of the study: Age is between 18 and 85 years; ASA I and II levels;&#xD;
           Patients undergone elective ERCP surgery, non-intubation patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sample size:The sample size was decided based on that of prior literature, which had&#xD;
           demonstrated that at least six independent pairs with success/failure duodenoscopy&#xD;
           insertion during ERCP are required for reliable estimates of the ED50 of remimazolam&#xD;
           with the Dixon's up-and-down method, and data from seven independent pairs of patients&#xD;
           were collected for this study. The ED50 (95% confidence interval, CI) of remimazolam for&#xD;
           successful duodenoscopy insertion during ERCP was calculated according to the formula of&#xD;
           Dixon and Massey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Interventions:The dose of remimazolam for each patient was determined by the response of&#xD;
      the previously tested patients using the modified Dixon's up-and-down method.The first&#xD;
      patient was tested at 0.2mg/kg remimazolam (0.025mg/kg as a step size). Duodenoscopy&#xD;
      insertion was conducted when MOAA/S≤1.The response of the patients to the duodenoscopy&#xD;
      insertion during ERCP was categorized as either 'success (no movement)' or 'failure&#xD;
      (movement).' Movement was defined as difficult duodenoscopy insertion ,gross purposeful&#xD;
      muscular movement, coughing, vomiting, or laryngospasm occurring during or after insertion of&#xD;
      duodenoscopy .No movement was depicted when the reactions mentioned earlier were absent.&#xD;
