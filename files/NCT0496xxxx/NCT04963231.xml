  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) pathway is the principal regulator of mammalian energy&#xD;
      balance and body weight. Originating in the hypothalamus it concertedly modulates appetite&#xD;
      (feelings of hunger and satiety), energy intake (as caloric consumption), and energy&#xD;
      expenditure (basal metabolism, thermogenesis, and physical activity) to define long term body&#xD;
      weight. In humans and animal models, genetic defects in this pathway result in severe forms&#xD;
      of early-onset obesity and unrelenting hunger (Farooqi 2008). Mechanistically these forms of&#xD;
      obesity arise due insufficient activation of MC4Rs leading to overconsumption of food and a&#xD;
      reduction in energy utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setmelanotide, a MC4R agonist, has the potential to restore reduced activity in MC4Rs in&#xD;
      patients with these genetic defects in MC4R pathway. Thus, setmelanotide may serve as a form&#xD;
      of &quot;replacement&quot; therapy to re-establish weight and appetite control in patients with these&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for study&#xD;
             participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients must have a pre-identified genetic variant in an established MC4R&#xD;
                  pathway gene that contributes to obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  For a gene variant to be eligible for inclusion in the study, the variant must be&#xD;
                  categorized by a CLIA/CAP/ISO15189 -certified laboratory using ACMG criteria as&#xD;
                  (1) Pathogenic, (2) Likely Pathogenic or (3) a VUS. In the case where an&#xD;
                  investigator has genetic results on a patient who may be eligible for the study,&#xD;
                  but the genetics have not yet been categorized by a CLIA/CAP/ISO15189 -certified&#xD;
                  laboratory, then the Sponsor may provide testing and/or categorization through a&#xD;
                  third-party laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients between the ages of 6 and 65 at the time of signing Informed Consent or&#xD;
                  Assent are eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Patients must be obese, defined as BMI ≥40 kg/m2 for patients ≥18 years of age or&#xD;
                  BMI ≥97th percentile for age and gender for patients 6 up to 17 years of age&#xD;
                  based on based on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Study participant and/or parent or guardian is able to communicate well with the&#xD;
                  Investigator, to understand and comply with the requirements of the study&#xD;
                  (including QD injection regimen and all other study procedures) and is able to&#xD;
                  understand and sign the written informed consent/assent. Patients who are unable&#xD;
                  to comply with all study procedures due to cognitive limitations or any other&#xD;
                  reason should not be enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. If male or a childbearing female, including pre-pubertal females if relevant, the&#xD;
                  patient must agree to use a highly reliable form of contraception throughout the&#xD;
                  study and for 90 days following the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Female participants of&#xD;
                  non-childbearing potential, defined as surgically sterile (status post&#xD;
                  hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation),&#xD;
                  post-menopausal for at least 12 months (and confirmed with a screening&#xD;
                  follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] level in the post-menopausal lab range), and&#xD;
                  failure to have achieved menarche, do not require contraception during the study.&#xD;
                  Female patients must not become pregnant and male patients must not donate sperm&#xD;
                  during and for 90 days following their participation in the study.&#xD;

                  dose approved for the treatment of diabetes mellitus (e.g., liraglutide up to a&#xD;
                  daily dose of 1.8 mg) as long as (1) it is not being prescribed for the treatment&#xD;
                  of obesity, (2) the dose has been stable for at least 3 months prior to&#xD;
                  enrollment, (3) the patient has not experienced weight loss during the previous 3&#xD;

&#xD;
               5. Any suicidal ideation of type 4 or 5 on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating&#xD;
                  Scale (C-SSRS) during Screening, any suicide attempt in the past 20 years or any&#xD;

                  considered severe enough to interfere with the study and/or confound the results.&#xD;
                  Any patient with a potentially clinically significant disease should be reviewed&#xD;
                  with the Sponsor to determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Has significant features of (or meets the diagnostic criteria for) a genetic&#xD;
                  syndrome that is associated with obesity, such as Tatton-Brown-Rahman syndrome&#xD;

                  (CREBBP).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Note: Although some of the genetic variants that are eligible to be enrolled into&#xD;
                  this study are associated with specific syndromes, the intent of this study is&#xD;
                  not to enroll children with significant cognitive impairment or other significant&#xD;
                  co-morbidities. Patients with the correct genetic variants, but who otherwise do&#xD;

                  Note: If the type of skin cancer is not known, then the patient should not be&#xD;
                  enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
              12. Significant dermatologic findings relating to melanoma or pre-melanoma skin&#xD;
                  lesions (excluding non-invasive basal or squamous cell lesion), determined as&#xD;
                  part of a comprehensive skin evaluation performed by the Investigator during&#xD;
                  Screening. Any concerning lesions identified during Screening will be biopsied&#xD;
                  and results known to be benign prior to enrollment. If the pretreatment biopsy&#xD;
                  results are of concern, the patient may need to be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
              13. Patient is, in the opinion of the Study Investigator, not suitable to participate&#xD;
                  in the study.&#xD;
