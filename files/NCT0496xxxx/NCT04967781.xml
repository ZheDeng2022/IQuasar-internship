  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although elderliness and chronic comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases and respiratory diseases, are known risk factors for severe progression of COVID-19,&#xD;
      it still remains puzzling on why younger patients without any comorbidity advance to severity&#xD;
      and even more rapidly, the underlying mechanisms for severe progression of COVID-19 still&#xD;
      needs to be elucidated. Based on current picturing of the COVID-19, similar to SARS, besides&#xD;
      direct viral toxicity, immune-mediated attack derived from either the release of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokine perpetual cascade, or secondary pathogen-induced autoimmunity&#xD;
      response may also play important roles on disease progression and partly account for the&#xD;
      multi-system injuries related with COVID-19. Virus infection has been implicated in the&#xD;
      initiation of autoimmunity, which can attack multiple systems. With the knowledge of&#xD;
      characteristics of SARS, high level of autoimmune activity was shown to make severe injuries&#xD;
      to lungs or other organs, leading to poor outcome including multi-system failure9. COVID-19&#xD;
      may also get autoimmunity involved which is of obviously younger and female population&#xD;
      predominance during the pathogenesis, no matter pre-existing or secondary to viral infection.&#xD;
      Particularly strong immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection might not be protective, but&#xD;
      perhaps, be harmful to the host, contributing to disease severe progression.&#xD;

        who were diagnosed as COVID-19 with real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assay of pharyngeal swab&#xD;
        specimens18 confirmed results were screened, and those tested with autoimmunological&#xD;
        detections including either ANA+ENA (Antinuclear antibody + Anti-extractable nuclear&#xD;
        antigen antibody), Anti-cardiolipin antibody (ACA), Rheumatoid factor (RF), or&#xD;
        Anti-streptolysin O antibody (ASO) detection, were enrolled in our study from Jan 22, 2020&#xD;
