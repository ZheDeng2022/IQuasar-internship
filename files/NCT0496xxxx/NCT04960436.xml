    <textblock>
      In this study, patients who underwent allogeneic meniscus transplantation and meniscus&#xD;
      resection were followed up for more than 10years to evaluate the long-term efficacy and&#xD;
      explore the cartilage protective role of meniscus transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the long-term clinical effect of allogeneic meniscus transplantation, IKDC&#xD;
      score, Lysholom score, Tegner score, VAS score, etc. were used to compare the clinical&#xD;
      effects of allogeneic meniscus transplantation, and the progress of knee joint degeneration&#xD;
      and cartilage injury was evaluated through X-ray and MRI.&#xD;

    <description>All MRI scans were obtained with a 3.0-T MRI scanner (Magnetom Trio with TIM system, Siemens Healthcare). Five routine MRI sequences with a section thickness of 4 mm were obtained in all patients. Preoperative and postoperative evaluations of the articular cartilage of the transplanted compartment were performed with the Yulish score41 (grade 0 = normal; grade 1 = normal contour 6 abnormal signal; grade 2 = superficial fraying, erosion, or ulceration of &lt;50%; grade 3 = partial-thickness defect of &gt;50% but &lt;100%; grade 4 = full-thickness cartilage loss). The signal of the meniscus allograft in the coronal plane of the T2-weighted fast spin echo sequence was graded on a scale of 0 to 3.</description>

    <description>All patients also obtained 45° flexion weightbearing AP radiographs of both the ipsilateral and contralateral sides at final follow-up. The radiograph of the total length of the lower limbs was used to evaluate alignment. In the AP plain radiographs, the shortest distance between the femoral condyle and tibial plateau of the transplanted side was measured and designated as the joint space height. The difference between the ipsilateral and contralateral sides was calculated to identify joint space narrowing. In addition, Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) grading was used to assess the osteoarthritic status of the knee.</description>

    <description>This score is widely used by exercise assessors for patients with knee joint disease. This scoring method divides the patient's exercise level into 0-10 points, 0 as disability, and 10 as being able to participate in national competitive sports.</description>

    <description>This score is often used together with the Tegner score. The scores of this scoring system are generally high and focus more on the assessment of daily activities rather than sports.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The age is less than 50 years; the force line is basically normal (≤ ± 3°); the joint is&#xD;
        stable or the joint stability is corrected at the same time during the operation; the joint&#xD;
        degeneration or large area cartilage damage. In the transplantation group, 10 patients&#xD;
        experienced pain or swelling in the joint space of the affected side for an average of 35&#xD;
        months after meniscus resection, and then received meniscus transplantation. The other 8&#xD;
        patients underwent meniscus transplantation at the same time as meniscus resection.&#xD;
        Patients in the resection group received meniscus transplantation at the same time.&#xD;
        Symptoms, signs, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were diagnosed as a meniscus tear and&#xD;
        the judgment during the operation could not be preserved, so a total meniscus was&#xD;
        performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Severe knee synovial disease; severe joint degeneration or extensive cartilage damage;&#xD;
        improper force lines; severely unstable joints that cannot be corrected; both meniscuses&#xD;
        are removed; the other knee joint has a history of severe trauma or surgery.&#xD;
