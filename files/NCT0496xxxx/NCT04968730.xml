      Objective to construct the related early activity program for patients with lumbar&#xD;
      intraspinal tumor after hemilaminectomy, and evaluate the postoperative limb function&#xD;
      exercise according to the content of the program. In order to improve the self-care ability&#xD;
      and quality of life of patients, reduce postoperative complications, shorten the average&#xD;
      length of stay, reduce hospitalization expenses and improve patient satisfaction.&#xD;
