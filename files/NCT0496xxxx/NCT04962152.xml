  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) can be associated with stronger postoperative&#xD;
      pain than is commonly believed. Pain control after thoracic surgery is important because&#xD;
      increased acute pain has been shown to increase the incidence of chronic pain, and untreated&#xD;
      pain may lead to increased morbidity. It is generally accepted to introduce multimodal&#xD;
      analgesic strategies based on regional blockade, opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paravertebral block (PVB) involves the injection of local anesthetic into a wedge-shaped&#xD;
      space lateral to the spinal nerves as they emerge from intervertebral foramina. It produces&#xD;
      ipsilateral somatosensory and sympathetic nerve blockade effective for anesthesia as well as&#xD;
      for management of pain of unilateral origin from the chest and abdomen. So far, thoracic&#xD;
      paravertebral block (TPVB) is the most common technique used for patients undergoing VATS.&#xD;
      TPVB may be useful after VATS because a single injection of local anesthesia may provide&#xD;
      effective analgesia for the intense short-duration pain that patients experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nalbuphine sebacate (Naldebain速) is a long-acting prodrug of nalbuphine developed for meeting&#xD;
      the unmet medical need of long-acting analgesics. It is a synthetic opioid agonist-antagonist&#xD;
      analgesic of the phenanthrene series. It is chemically related to both the widely used opioid&#xD;
      antagonist, naloxone, and the potent opioid analgesic, oxymorphone. The currently proposed&#xD;
      clinical use of nalbuphine sebacate is a single dose of Naldebain速 administered&#xD;
      intramuscularly approximately 24 h prior to the planned surgery for pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of TPVB combined with a&#xD;
      single dose of intramuscular Naldebain速 administered preoperatively to patients scheduled to&#xD;
      undergo VATS.&#xD;
