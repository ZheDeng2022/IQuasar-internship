      The Trial Assessing Light-Intensity Exercise on the Health of Older Breast Cancer Survivors&#xD;
      pilot randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of a home-based,&#xD;
      light-intensity physical activity intervention among 56 obese, older adult breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors, in comparison to a usual care control condition.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit 56 obese, older adult breast cancer survivors at least 1 year,&#xD;
      and up to 10 years post-breast cancer treatment, and randomize them to either a 15 week&#xD;
      light-intensity physical activity intervention, or usual care group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The participants will receive weekly support calls, and instructed to increase&#xD;
      their light-intensity physical activity, to achieve at least 150 minutes per week. The&#xD;
      frequency, intensity, time, and type of physical activity will be modified to maximize&#xD;
      adherence and compliance. The support calls developed for this trial target older adults'&#xD;
      capabilities, opportunities, and motivations for physical activity.&#xD;

The session durations will build over time to 150 minutes per week. Participants will be instructed to walk, or engage in other forms of light-intensity physical activity to achieve these goals. Participants will be instructed on the use of the ratings of perceived exertion scale (6-20). As the participants' health and fitness status improves, frequency, intensity, and session duration will be modified accordingly during weekly support calls. As participants will enter the study engaging in varying levels of physical activity, goals will be responsive to the most recent week's achieved minutes.</description>
