  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Self-management strategies for asthma, including patients engagement and adherence to&#xD;
      personalised action plans with advice on recognizing and responding to deterioration in&#xD;
      control with effective treatments can improve asthma outcomes and possibly reduce the risk of&#xD;
      future exacerbations. However, the real-life evidence is that asthma control remains&#xD;
      sub-optimal in the majority of cases, thus increasing the related socio-economic costs&#xD;
      worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because an increased variability of lung function remains a hallmark of poor asthma control&#xD;
      and exacerbations, its assessment over time could contribute to the success of&#xD;
      self-management plans. Previous studies have shown the potential of Forced Oscillation&#xD;
      Technique (FOT) as a tool for monitoring increased variability of airway obstruction and for&#xD;
      identifying the onset of acute deterioration of airway function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that a personalised self-management plan&#xD;
      including FOT improves asthma control and reduces number of days with increased symptoms&#xD;
      compared to conventional asthma treatment.&#xD;
