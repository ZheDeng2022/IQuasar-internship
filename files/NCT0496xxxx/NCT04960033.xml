      We evaluated fracture risk assessment tools (FRAXs) from different regions in Chinese&#xD;
      postmenopausal women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This cross-sectional study recruited 264 postmenopausal women aged ≥50 years in September&#xD;
      2017. Basic information, general condition, history of illness, family history, and clinical&#xD;
      risk factors were evaluated via a questionnaire. All subjects underwent a bone mineral&#xD;
      density examination of the femur and lumbar spine and thoracolumbar spinal X-ray. The 10-year&#xD;
      major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) and hip fracture (HF) risks were calculated using FRAXs&#xD;
      from mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Asia-America. All data were analyzed using SPSS&#xD;
      17.0. Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio were used to compare the effectiveness&#xD;
      of each FRAX.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Postmenopausal women aged ≥50 years were randomly selected from community centers in&#xD;
             Changsha City, Hunan Province, China in September 2017. Menopause was defined as the&#xD;
             absence of menstrual cycles for at least one year. All subjects were&#xD;
             noninstitutionalized and in good health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The criteria for exclusion were morphological abnormalities or skeletal distortions&#xD;
             that prohibited either clinical measurements or morphometric assessments of skeletal&#xD;
             radiographs.&#xD;
