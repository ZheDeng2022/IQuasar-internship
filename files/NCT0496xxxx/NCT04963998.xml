      The Study was divided into three Phases: Screening Phase (1-2 weeks); Treatment Phase (~ 1&#xD;
      month); and Follow-up Phase (two weeks). During the Screening Phase, blood samples were taken&#xD;
      for analysis of blood count, liver and kidney functions from potential appropriate diabetic&#xD;
      patients with chronic wounds in their foot. Stable chronic diabetic patients, whose wounds&#xD;
      were not infected and the wound size increased or did not decreased by more than 25% per week&#xD;
      or 35% by SOC treatment during the Screening Phase, and who will meet all other study&#xD;
      inclusion criteria, were enrolled and start the 4 weeks Treatment Phase. The wounds were then&#xD;
      treated by applying the Copper Oxide containing Dressings (COD) that were changed twice a&#xD;
      week. In the two weeks post-treatment period, the patient received standard of care (SOC)&#xD;
      dressing. In that time period, the patient were seen once after two weeks. The Primary&#xD;
      outcome was the evaluation of the safety of the COD and the secondary outcomes were the&#xD;
      evaluation of the wound size change of the foot wounds when using COD. Measures that were&#xD;
      assessed included&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Percent change in wound size during the Treatment Phase,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rate of increase in extent and quality (color) of granulation tissue,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Infectious episodes during the Treatment Phase.&#xD;

      The Study was divided into three Phases: Screening Phase (1-2 weeks); Treatment Phase (~ 1&#xD;
      month); and Follow-up Phase (two weeks). During the Screening Phase, blood samples were taken&#xD;
      for analysis of blood count, liver and kidney functions from potential appropriate diabetic&#xD;
      patients with chronic wounds in their foot. Stable chronic diabetic patients, whose wounds&#xD;
      were not infected and the wound size increased or did not decreased by more than 25% per week&#xD;
      or 35% by SOC treatment during the Screening Phase, and who will meet all other study&#xD;
      inclusion criteria, were enrolled and start the 4 weeks Treatment Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Treatment Phase, the index wounds were evaluated, undergone bed side debridement&#xD;
      if necessary, and photographed. Tissue Analytics software was used to assess wound size and&#xD;
      volume. The wounds were washed by normal saline or a previously used solution (but no new&#xD;
      disinfectant or any antibacterial preparation), and then the COD was applied on the wound.&#xD;
      The COD was applied on the wounds for the duration of the Treatment Phase and changed twice a&#xD;
      week, once in the clinic and once at home. At every clinic visit the following assessments&#xD;
      were performed: wound assessment, including size determination, depth, clinical impression of&#xD;
      infection (swelling, erythema, discharge quantity and quality, granulation, fibrin and&#xD;
      necrotic tissue, odor, pain, and tenderness); antibiotics and vital signs as necessary. After&#xD;
      ~ 1 month of test wound dressings use, a blood sample was taken for blood count, liver and&#xD;
      kidney functions. If needed, the patients' wounds were treated using the hospital SOC in the&#xD;
      follow up period. The Primary outcome was the evaluation of the safety of the COD and the&#xD;
      secondary outcomes were the evaluation of the wound size change of the foot wounds when using&#xD;
      COD. Measures that were assessed included&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Percent change in wound size during the Treatment Phase,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rate of increase in extent and quality (color) of granulation tissue,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Infectious episodes during the Treatment Phase.&#xD;
