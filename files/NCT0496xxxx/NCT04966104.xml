      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological distress and reduced quality of life are prevalent in patients with chronic&#xD;
      heart failure (CHF). The one-year rehospitalization rate is very high (40%), as well as the&#xD;
      five-year mortality rates (45% for women and 60% for men). International task force&#xD;
      committees report that medical therapy combined with digital (telehealth) counseling for CHF&#xD;
      self-care optimizes clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
      At trial completion, it is predicted that ODYSSEE-vCHAT versus enhanced usual care (eUC) will&#xD;
      reduce hospitalization and mortality. Greater engagement with the digital program is also&#xD;
      predicted to be linked with improved self-reported mental and physical health at months 2, 4,&#xD;
      6, 10, and 12 and trial completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CHF who are at least 18 years old are recruited. Accrual of the sample (n =&#xD;
      162) will occur over an 18-month period. It involves the University Health Network (UHN),&#xD;
      Sunnybrook Hospital, Mount Sinai Hospital, and community-based patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      ODYSSEE-vCHAT is a double-arm, parallel-group, randomized, controlled (real-world) pilot&#xD;
      trial with assessments at baseline, months 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, and trial completion (median = 14&#xD;
      months, range = 6 to 22 months). It is a single-blind trial, with research personnel blinded.&#xD;
      All patients have free access to their respective digital intervention, ODYSEE-vCHAT or&#xD;
      enhanced usual care (eUC). Subjects are invited by weekly emails to participate in the&#xD;
      resources available to their group. eUC patients have access to educational materials for CHF&#xD;
      self-care that are available to the public on professional websites. Participation in&#xD;
      supplementary programs that provide CHF self-care education is not restricted. However,&#xD;
      supplementary program activity will be statistically controlled for in the outcome&#xD;
      assessments. Participation in supplementary health programs is monitored by self-reported&#xD;
      status in the assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANALYSES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Separate generalized linear models (GLMs) will evaluate ODYSSEE-vCHAT versus eUC for primary&#xD;
      and secondary outcomes. GLMs will be adjusted for baseline assessments and potential&#xD;
      covariates. Interactions between treatment arm and gender will be examined for each outcome,&#xD;
      using Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons for relevant subgroups. Significance in all tests will&#xD;
      be p&lt;0.05, 2-sided.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a progressive clinical syndrome in which the heart is unable&#xD;
      to pump oxygenated blood sufficiently to meet metabolic demands during exercise or at rest.&#xD;
      At age 55, the lifetime risk for CHF is 29% for women and 33% for men. CHF is a major cause&#xD;
      of psychological distress and reduced quality of life. The one-year rehospitalization rate is&#xD;
      40%. The five-year mortality rate is 45% for women and 60% for men. International task force&#xD;
      committees report that medical therapy combined with patient education for CHF self-care&#xD;
      optimizes clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular mortality incidence decreases with incremental adherence to self-care.&#xD;
      Improvement in CHF self-care also predicts greater quality of life at 12 months. However,&#xD;
      patient adherence to self-care is problematic. In the absence of intervention, only 9-36% of&#xD;
      CHF patients have moderate to high adherence to these behaviours. Key patient barriers to&#xD;
      self-care are low health literacy and social isolation, which are present for 39% and 25% of&#xD;
      CHF patients, respectively. These barriers are associated with depressed mood and low&#xD;
      motivation, which further increases risk for non-adherence and poor clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home-based telehealth programs such as the current ODYSSEE-vCHAT digital initiative are&#xD;
      currently changing practice standards for outpatient medical care. A telehealth program of&#xD;
      social network support that is integrated with automated digital counselling is central to&#xD;
      this proposal. This approach has demonstrated potential to improve overall wellbeing while&#xD;
      increasing engagement with digital programs and sustaining preventive self-care with positive&#xD;
      role modelling, information sharing, and structured presentations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task force statements advocate digital interventions that are patient-centred, scalable, and&#xD;
      can improve clinical outcomes while reducing healthcare costs. Telehealth trials have&#xD;
      increased therapeutic outcomes with reduced heterogeneity when an evidence-based protocol of&#xD;
      behavioural counselling is used. Furthermore, the development of home-based telehealth&#xD;
      programs such as the ODYSSEE-vCHAT digital initiative is consistent with task force&#xD;
      guidelines for COVID-19 prevention. Integrating a social network intervention with an&#xD;
      automated (scalable), evidence-based digital program for CHF self-care is likely to optimize&#xD;
      therapeutic benefits. A digital social network initiative is central to this proposed pilot&#xD;
      trial because of its potential to (i) sustain patient engagement with CHF self-care&#xD;
      resources, (ii) promote self-care learning and positive role modelling through information&#xD;
      sharing or structured presentations, and (iii) improve quality of life and health literacy&#xD;
      while reducing perceived social isolation. Peer support is associated with increased&#xD;
      self-care adherence. These findings highlight the importance of determining whether a social&#xD;
      network program enhances the therapeutic benefit of (individual-focused) telehealth services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that, at trial completion (median = 14 months, range = 6 to 22&#xD;
      months), ODYSSEE-vCHAT versus enhanced usual care (eUC) will significantly reduce the risk&#xD;
      for a composite index of incident all-cause mortality, all-cause emergency department (ED)&#xD;
      visits, or CHF-related hospitalization (based on linkage to health administrative a data&#xD;
      base).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary hypothesis is that participant engagement with CHF self-care resources [defined&#xD;
      by (i) sum login minutes, (ii) sum logins, and (iii) number of login days prior to a login&#xD;
      lapse ≥ 2 months] at months 2, 4, 6, 10, and 12 and trial completion (range = 6 to 22 months)&#xD;
      will be greater in ODYSSEE-vCHAT versus eUC, and independently associated with the following&#xD;
      outcomes: Increased health-related quality of life, adherence to CHF self-care behaviours,&#xD;
      quality of life activities, overall mental health, practice of COVID-19 protective&#xD;
      behaviours, health literacy, active involvement in medical care, and perceived social&#xD;
      support, as well as decreased depression, anxiety, loneliness, and use of alcohol,&#xD;
      cigarettes, and cannabis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POTENTIAL RISKS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may feel uncomfortable using ODYSSEE-vCHAT because they are not familiar with&#xD;
      the software or a computer, answering certain questions posed in the questionnaire packages,&#xD;
      contributing to the weekly discussions on Zoom due to privacy concerns, or submitting an&#xD;
      audio or video comment on the weekly presentations and discussions because they would no&#xD;
      longer be an anonymous participant in the trial. Audio or video comments may also be used for&#xD;
      research and educational purposes in the public domain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY PARAMETERS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will provide assistance in using ODYSSEE-vCHAT through video tutorials and&#xD;
      over the telephone, if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will accommodate a refusal to respond to any question(s) posed in the&#xD;
      questionnaire packages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During webcasts, visual input from patients remains disabled to protect their identification.&#xD;
      If participants would like to contribute to the discussion without speaking, they may opt to&#xD;
      use the chat feature on Zoom instead. Comments written in the chat are not included in the&#xD;
      recording of the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' audio or video comments are censored for inappropriate comments pertaining to&#xD;
      violence, sexual content, coarse language, etc. If a patient's video is selected for&#xD;
      presentation to other participants in the trial, or to the public, the patient will be&#xD;
      notified so that they have an opportunity to grant or withhold their permission for this use&#xD;
      of their video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The social network chatrooms are HIPPA compliant and moderated by three levels of content&#xD;
      filtering to ensure that posts meet conventional standards of ethical conduct. Level 1 is a&#xD;
      search algorithm that is automatically updated with banned word lists. Level 2 is self-report&#xD;
      by patient volunteers as in prior research. Level 3 is done manually by research assistants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary outcome: At trial completion, a time-to-event analysis will be conducted using a&#xD;
           multivariable Cox Proportional Hazards model to evaluate if ODYSSEE-vCHAT versus eUC&#xD;
           reduced risk for the composite endpoint. Potential confounders will be selected using&#xD;
           forward (P &lt; 0.05) and backward (P &lt; 0.10) stepwise selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary outcomes: General linear models (GLMs) will evaluate if ODYSSEE-vCHAT versus&#xD;
           eUC evokes greater program adherence at months 2, 4, 6, 10, and 12 and trial completion,&#xD;
           adjusting for potential baseline confounders. The GLM will be repeated using sum logins&#xD;
           as the dependent variable. A multivariable Poisson model will evaluate whether&#xD;
           ODYSSEE-vCHAT versus eUC is associated with greater duration of engagement, adjusting&#xD;
           for potential confounding variables. Separate GLMs will evaluate if ODYSSEE-vCHAT versus&#xD;
           eUC improves self-reported outcomes at months 2, 4, 6, 10, and 12 and trial completion,&#xD;
           adjusting for baseline assessment for each endpoint and potential baseline covariates.&#xD;
           Clinical interpretation for health-related quality of life will be based on a group&#xD;
           difference ≥ 5 points. Bonferroni post-hoc tests will be used to assess interactions for&#xD;
           relevant groups. Significance in all tests is p &lt; 0.05, 2-sided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exploratory analyses: Separate analyses will be conducted for gender. The Cox&#xD;
           Proportional Hazards Model or competing risk models will be used for CHF-specific&#xD;
           endpoints of mortality, hospitalization, and ED visits, separately and collectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEVIATIONS FROM STATISTICAL PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the statistical plan involves exploratory analyses, a need to deviate from it is not&#xD;
      expected. Nevertheless, the statistical analysis and methodology committee will be consulted&#xD;
      regularly throughout the trial. Any unplanned analyses will be adjusted using the Bonferroni&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers recently reported a reduction over 12 months in a composite index score of&#xD;
      all-cause mortality and hospitalization for telehealth support (50.6%) versus usual care&#xD;
      (59.3%), p = 0.01. This yielded a sample estimate of 142. Using a 14.7% adjustment rate&#xD;
      (142*1.147) for withdrawal or attrition based on values obtained from CHF-CePPORT (6.5% of&#xD;
      patients withdrew and 8.2% were lost to follow-up), the final sample size estimate is 162,&#xD;
      with a type 1 error of 5% and a power of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT COMPLIANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attendance for assessments will be facilitated by telephone and email reminders if&#xD;
      participants fail to complete these within 7 days after receiving the hyperlinks to the&#xD;
      online questionnaire packages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT WITHDRAWAL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events such as an unforeseen mental health crisis may affect a patient's ability to&#xD;
      participate in this trial. In cases of patient withdrawal, all data up to this point&#xD;
      pertaining to the patient will be used for outcome analyses. The Steering Committee will&#xD;
      review how and whether the subject should be replaced in the trial. The referring&#xD;
      cardiologist will be alerted about the withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRITERIA FOR TRIAL TERMINATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ODYSSEE-vCHAT trial will be terminated prematurely in the event of a recurrent adverse&#xD;
      event that is related to our trial procedures or content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Data Review/Monitoring Committee will ensure that the trial meets an appropriate standard&#xD;
      for data quality control. The Steering Committee will adjudicate primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes and review and advise the team about the progress of ODYSSEE-vCHAT, protocol&#xD;
      compliance, and any adverse incidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiologists and their nursing staff in participating outpatient clinics will identify&#xD;
      patients who meet trial criteria and will obtain verbal consent to be approached by the&#xD;
      research team. The research coordinator or a research assistant will either approach the&#xD;
      potential participant in the clinic or enter electronic patient records to obtain their&#xD;
      contact information. Informed consent may be obtained in person or virtually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will also be advertised to CHF patients on patient education websites, on posters&#xD;
      in participating outpatient clinics, and through mass emailing. Patients who contact the&#xD;
      research team through advertising will be sent our Referral Form via email, to be completed&#xD;
      and submitted to us via email by their physician. The Referral Form will screen potential&#xD;
      participants based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Potential participants who&#xD;
      qualify for the trial will then be directed through the consenting process virtually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited continuously until our target sample size is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA STORAGE&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data is stored on secure servers within the UHN digital environment for at least 10 years&#xD;
      after trial completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are issued a tracking number when information regarding any identifying information&#xD;
      is transmitted for analysis. Subject anonymity and confidentiality will be preserved. Only&#xD;
      aggregate data will be published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All research personnel have signed an employee confidentiality agreement ensuring that&#xD;
      confidential information is not disclosed to any other person or entity. All source documents&#xD;
      containing personal identifiers are stored in filing cabinets under lock and key. The&#xD;
      database is stored electronically on the firewall-protected server, making it inaccessible&#xD;
      externally. Access to the room, which contains the research file server, is restricted to&#xD;
      designated persons who are employed by the Behavioural Cardiology Research Unit at the UHN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion of the trial with persons outside the research team will never reveal personal&#xD;
      identifiers of participants. All access to data will be denied to persons outside the&#xD;
      research team. Data transmission will occur via encrypted storage material over the Internet.&#xD;

    <masking_description>An independent statistician will log into a secure program (managed by the University Health Network THETA institute) that uses randomly permuted blocks to assign subjects to ODYSSEE-vCHAT or the control group. To reduce the chance of patient allocation being predictable, we will follow the convention whereby the block sizes and the fraction of each block size will be known only by an independent statistician, and we will test the algorithm with staff at THETA prior to subject recruitment. Our team of investigators will be blinded to ensure impartiality in decisions about procedures and analyses.</masking_description>

    <description>ODYSSEE-vCHAT consists of (a) automated digital counselling resources (information pages, videos, and interactive digital tools and trackers), (b) moderated chatrooms, and (c) weekly 30-minute presentations led by a healthcare professional and/or a patient representative, followed by a 30-minute question-and-answer period. Each aspect of ODYSSEE-vCHAT is informed by a rotating schedule of seven weekly themes on chronic heart failure (CHF) self-care behaviours. Our server contacts participants by email on a weekly basis, inviting them to access the resources available to them. Participants login to our server using their password-protected personal accounts. Each participant's total number of logins and login time (with timestamps) are recorded. Assessments occur online at baseline, months 2, 4, 6, 10, and 12, and end of trial (median = 14 months, range = 6 to 22 months).</description>

    <description>eUC provides educational chronic heart failure self-care resources and COVID-19 prevention guidelines that are available to the public on professional websites (e.g., Heart Failure Society of Canada, American Heart Association, European Society of Cardiology, Health Canada). Patients will have unlimited access to these resources. Subjects are invited by weekly emails to participate in these resources. Self-reported assessments are administered at baseline, at months 2, 4, 6, 10, and 12, and at trial completion (median = 14 months, range = 6 to 22 months).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Biological males and females who are 18 years of age or older and who are diagnosed&#xD;
             with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (systolic heart failure)&#xD;
             corresponding to the New York Heart Association Classes 2 to 4 (NYHA II-IV) for 3 or&#xD;
             more months prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than or equal to 40% with documentation&#xD;
             by ventriculography or quantitative echocardiography (these data are readily available&#xD;
             as per standard of care)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No worsening of chronic heart failure for 1 month prior to recruitment, as determined&#xD;
             by a referring physician&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical treatment determined by the referring physician adheres to Canadian&#xD;

          -  Informed written consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Preserved ejection fraction [these patients often exhibit normal brain natriuretic&#xD;
             peptide levels and a high rate of non-cardiac mortality (approximately 30%), which&#xD;
             would confound our evaluation of ODYSSEE]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Scheduled for advanced surgical therapy (e.g., heart transplantation or implantation&#xD;
             of a left ventricular assistive device) within 3 months of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous heart transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Record of significant comorbidities at enrollment [e.g., renal failure&#xD;
             (serum-creatinine greater than or equal to 300 micromoles/L or 3.0 mg/dL), liver&#xD;
             disease (alanine transaminase greater than the three-fold upper limit of normal),&#xD;
             poorly controlled diabetes (fasting blood glucose greater than 10 mmol/L or hemoglobin&#xD;
             A1C greater than 8%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypotension and/or systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 85 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistent systolic or diastolic hypertension (systolic greater than 170 mmHg or&#xD;
             diastolic greater than 100 mmHg despite antihypertensive therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic heart failure secondary to primary uncorrected valvular cardiomyopathy,&#xD;
             predominant right-sided heart failure, or a non-cardiac disease (e.g., complex&#xD;
             congenital heart disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe psychiatric disorder that requires acute psychiatric care, as determined by a&#xD;
             referring physician (e.g., psychosis or bipolar mood disorder)&#xD;
