  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project was a Randomized control trial conducted to check the Effects of Proprioceptive&#xD;
      Neuromuscular Facilitation on Shoulder Pain due to chronic impingement syndrome in paraplegic&#xD;
      Manual Wheelchair users after Spinal Cord Injury so that we can have best treatment option&#xD;
      for patients with shoulder pain due to manual wheelchair usage. duration was of&#xD;
      6months,convenient sampling was done, subject following eligibility criteria from Spine&#xD;
      welfare trust center, Nawaz Sharif social security Hospital were randomly allocated in two&#xD;
      groups via lottery method, Group A participants were given baseline treatment along with PNF&#xD;
      exercises , Group B participants were given baseline treatment upto 6 weeks and 3 sessions&#xD;
      per, post intervention assessment was done after 6 weeks, by self-generated questionnaire&#xD;
      (WUSPI) wheel chair users shoulder pain index, (SRQ) Shoulder rating questionnaire and&#xD;
      physical assessment by 2 special test was done, data was analyzed by using SPSS version 25.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In paraplegic manual wheelchair users Shoulder pain is most common problem after spinal cord&#xD;
      injury. Due to wheelchair propulsion, weight relief task and other household activities&#xD;
      repetitive load induced on upper limb and put substantial load in particular on shoulder.In&#xD;
      spinal cord injured patients shoulder pain is because of over use of upper limb and shoulder&#xD;
      during wheelchair related activities and personal care activities. less stability and slight&#xD;
      muscle mass leads toward pain in their life at some point because of Muscular imbalance and&#xD;
      later on shoulder secondary impingement syndrome. This study compared the rhythmic&#xD;
      stabilization technique from PNF exercises with conventional treatment on experimental and&#xD;
      control group to see the difference in reduction of pain and disability.&#xD;

    <measure>Shoulder rating Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6th Week</time_frame>
    <description>Shoulder rating questionnaire (SRQ) was designed to assess the severity of symptoms related to and the functional status of the shoulder. It includes domains of global assessment, pain, daily activities, recreational and athletic activities, work, satisfaction, and areas for improvement. Each domain is graded separately and is weighted to arrive at the total score</description>

Experimental group received rhythmical Stabilization Technique on shoulder joint on all shoulder movements up to 1 minute in supine position For stability of joint ,re-establish dynamic rotator cuff stability and to enhance MS strength and decrease pain.&#xD;
Conventional Treatment: heating pad for 15 minutes, TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) and after that shoulder stretching of upper trapezius muscle, pectorals and levator scapule and isometric exercises of rotator cuff muscles performed in supine .( 10 sec hold and 10 to 15 reps)..</description>
