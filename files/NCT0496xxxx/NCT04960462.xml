      A retrospective study of the changes in the VAS scores and imaging examinations after the&#xD;
      reconstruction and reinforcement of nerve root sleeves and caudal angioplasty for the&#xD;
      treatment of sacral cysts from August 2017 to January 2018 was used to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      of the surgical prescription.&#xD;

      Objective: To clarify the curative effect of nerve root sleeve reconstruction and&#xD;
      reinforcement and caudal plasty in the treatment of sacral cysts Design: A retrospective&#xD;

      reinforcement of nerve root sleeves and sacral canoplasty for the treatment of sacral cysts&#xD;
      from August 2017 to January 2018 to evaluate the efficacy of the surgical prescription.&#xD;
