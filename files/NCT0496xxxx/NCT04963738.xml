      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single subcutaneous&#xD;
      (SC) dose of JNJ-73763989 in adult participants with renal impairment compared with healthy&#xD;
      participants with normal renal function.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 42 days</time_frame>
    <description>AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with AEs by Severity Grades</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 42 days</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with AEs by severity grade will be reported. Severity scale ranges from Grade 1 (Mild) to Grade 5 (Death). Grade 1= Mild, Grade 2= Moderate, Grade 3= Severe, Grade 4= Life-threatening and Grade 5= Death related to adverse event.</description>
