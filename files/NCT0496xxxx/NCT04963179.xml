      PREG2 is a randomized controlled trial that aims to evaluate efficacy in preventing&#xD;
      intrauterine adhesion recurrence after hysteroscopic adhesiolysis of a novel intrauterine&#xD;
      barrier film named Womed Leaf&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PREG2 is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled, two arm clinical study. The&#xD;
      objective is to evaluate the efficacy of Womed Leaf in preventing intrauterine adhesion&#xD;
      recurrence after adhesiolysis compared to adhesiolysis alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed on women with moderate or severe adhesions (AFS score &gt;=5)&#xD;
      scheduled for adhesiolysis. Indeed, the risk of intrauterine adhesion is very high (up to&#xD;
      60%) in this population of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up diagnostic hysteroscopy will be performed 6-8 weeks after the adhesiolysis&#xD;
      procedure to determine the presence and severity of IUAs according to the American Fertility&#xD;
      Society and European Society of Gynecologic Endoscopy classification systems of adhesions.&#xD;
      Fertility-related outcome will include live pregnancy at 1 year and 2 years and will be&#xD;
      reported as secondary endpoints. 154 women are planned to be included in the PREG2 study.&#xD;

    <description>Womed Leaf™ device is composed of a uterine anti-adhesion film pre-loaded inside a flexible inserter.&#xD;
Womed Leaf™ is inserted in the uterine cavity by the gynecologist surgeon as a film folded into a 5 mm diameter flexible inserter. Once released, the film will unfold and swell into the uterine cavity to keep uterus walls separated during approximately 5 days. It is degraded and discharged naturally through the cervix and vagina in less than 30 days.</description>
