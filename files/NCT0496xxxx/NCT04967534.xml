  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise in general and resistance training (RT) in particular have demonstrated positive&#xD;
      effects on frailty outcomes, including physical functioning. However, frail older people with&#xD;
      functional impairments are among the least physically active and have problems reaching&#xD;
      high-intensity levels. Whole-body electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) allows the simultaneous&#xD;
      innervation of all large muscle groups by external electrical stimulation, inducing a&#xD;
      high-intensity RT at a low subjective effort level. The efficacy of WB-EMS in frail older&#xD;
      people has yet to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of WB-EMS in frail older&#xD;
      people.&#xD;

    <description>Simultaneous, individually adjustable stimulation of 12 muscle groups using an interval approach with a duty cycle of 6s impulse/4s rest, bipolar electric current (impulse -frequency 85Hz, -width 350μs, rectangular pattern) will be applied. After a 4-week conditioning period, 1.5x 20 min/week WB-EMS will be conducted for 12 weeks (total training duration 8 weeks). Easy to perform functional exercises focusing on balance, transfer ability, stepping, and lower extremity strength will be done during WB-EMS. Exercise intensity will be individually prescribed and adjusted by the rate of perceived exertion (RPE-Borg CR10 scale 4 (moderate) to 7 (hard)). WB-EMS will be fully supervised one-on-one.</description>
