      The present study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of DBS targeted the combination of&#xD;
      the anterior limb of internal capsule and nucleus accumbens (ALIC/NAcc-DBS) to refractory&#xD;
      OCD, based on multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, sham-stimulation controlled design,&#xD;
      that could help to obtain stronger evidence of the efficacy of multiple targets.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OCD is a chronic and disabled mental disorder, with one third of patients could hardly get&#xD;
      recovery from the medication and psychotherapy. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a novel&#xD;
      potential surgical treatment for refractory OCD, however, the choose of targets are still&#xD;
      controversial. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      bilateral DBS of the anterior limb of internal capsule and nucleus accumbens (ALIC/NAcc-DBS)&#xD;
      for treatment-refractory OCD. In this multicenter, prospective, and double-blinded study, 64&#xD;
      patients with OCD who met the eligibility criteria will be enrolled and randomized allocated&#xD;
      to active and sham-stimulation group, followed up for three months after surgery. Then the&#xD;
      blind will be uncover, the sham group switch to true stimulation, all patients will be&#xD;
      followed up at six months after surgery. The primary outcome was to compare the treatment&#xD;
      response rate between the active group and sham-controlled group at the end of three months&#xD;
      after surgery. The secondary outcomes include changes in the Yale-brown obsessive-compulsive&#xD;
      scale (Y-BOCS), Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA), Hamilton depression scale (HAMD), and Clinical&#xD;
      global impressions (CGI) scale of both groups.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Randomization of DBS are blinded to evaluators, participants, and programming doctors. The programming doctors used the specific software to allocated the participants, that software was preset random coding program to randomized allocate the subjects. The DBS interface of all patients is displayed as a true stimulus, but the true impulse was running in the background controlled by the software, so that even the programming doctors could not know the grouping.</masking_description>

    <description>Our primary outcome measure was to compare the treatment response rate (TRR) between the active group and sham-controlled group at the end of three months. (TRR is defined as the number of treatment response/the number of group, a ≥35% reduction in Y-BOCS plus CGI=1or2 met the criteria of treatment response). Note: Y-BOCS, Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale; CGI, clinical global impression.</description>

    <description>The severity of OCD symptoms was assessed using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). This scale including 10 items, the maximum score is 40. The higher score means the more serious of disease.</description>

    <description>The Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) is an invaluable tool for monitoring the treatment outcomes of patients.The CGI actually comprises three companion one-item measures evaluating the following: (a) severity of psychopathology from 1 to 7, (b) change from the initiation of treatment on a similar seven-point scale, and (c) an overall evaluation of the theraputic effect and side effects.</description>

    <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) is used to quantify the severity of symptoms of depression and is one of the most widely used and accepted instruments for assessing depression. It contains 24 items rated on 5-point scale, with the sum of all items making up the total score, yielding total scores from zero to 96. The higher score means more severity of depression symptoms.</description>

    <description>The Hamilton Anxity Rating Scale (HAM-A) was one of the first rating scales developed to measure the severity of anxiety symptoms. The scale consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both psychic anxiety and somatic anxiety. Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe), with a total score range of 0-56, where &lt;17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 mild to moderate severity and 25-30 moderate to severe.</description>
