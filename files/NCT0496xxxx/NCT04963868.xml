    <textblock>
      Although metal stents have been widely used in the endoscopic step-up approach for&#xD;
      necrotizing pancreatitis, the exact timing of transmural stent removal has not been well&#xD;
      studied. In this prospective, open-label, randomized controlled study, we recruited and&#xD;
      enrolled consecutive patients with necrotizing pancreatitis undergoing endoscopic transmural&#xD;
      necrosectomy. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to case group (a novel strategy in&#xD;
      which the stents were removed during the last necrosectomy when the necrosectomy endpoint was&#xD;
      achieved) and control group (the conventional strategy in which the stents were removed after&#xD;
      the last necrosectomy when clinical symptoms were relieved and fluid was nearly completely&#xD;
      resolved confirmed by imaging). The primary endpoint was the incidence of composite&#xD;
      complications within three months of enrollment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last decade, approaches to managing necrotizing pancreatitis have evolved from open&#xD;
      surgery to a minimally invasive approach due to the efficacy and lower morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality rates of the latter technique. As one of minimally invasive approaches, endoscopic&#xD;
      step-up approach, with transmural drainage whenever feasible and subsequent necrosectomy as&#xD;
      required, was first described in 1996 and has evolved to first-line therapy for symptomatic&#xD;
      necrotizing pancreatitis. However,The exact timing of transmural stent removal has not been&#xD;
      well studied. The conventional strategy for stent removal in the published guidelines has&#xD;
      been that patients should undergo follow-up imaging and stent removal at 4-8 weeks if&#xD;
      walled-off necrosis has resolved. Here, we introduced a novel strategy in which the stents&#xD;
      were removed during the last necrosectomy when the endpoint of endoscopic transmural&#xD;
      necrosectomy was achieved, that was, the necrotic tissue was nearly completely removed, and&#xD;
      the pink granulation tissue lining the wall was uncovered. Compared to the conventional&#xD;
      strategy, the novel strategy avoided one endoscopy procedure. The present study is the first&#xD;
      prospective, open-label, randomized controlled study to investigate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of the novel strategy. We recruited and enrolled consecutive patients with necrotizing&#xD;
      pancreatitis undergoing endoscopic transmural necrosectomy. Eligible participants were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to case group (a novel strategy in which the stents were removed during the&#xD;
      last necrosectomy when the necrosectomy endpoint was achieved) and control group (the&#xD;
      conventional strategy in which the stents were removed after the last necrosectomy when&#xD;
      clinical symptoms were relieved and fluid was nearly completely resolved confirmed by&#xD;
      imaging). The primary endpoint was the incidence of composite complications within three&#xD;
      months of enrollment.&#xD;
