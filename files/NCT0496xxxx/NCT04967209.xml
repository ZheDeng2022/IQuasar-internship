    <textblock>
      This mixed methods study will involve obtaining user feedback on the first 4 weeks of the&#xD;
      Healthy Habits for Cancer (HCC) Program. Short pre and post surveys and in-depth qualitative&#xD;
      interviews will be conducted exploring their views on the app (features they liked and didn't&#xD;
      like), the extent to which they believe the app would have to be further adapted, how they&#xD;
      would feel about such an app being embedded in their cancer care and when in their care&#xD;
      pathway they would like to be offered it.&#xD;
