      Duration of mechanical ventilation, length of intensive care unit stay, length of&#xD;
      postoperative hospital stay, and the incidence rates of complications between the group with&#xD;
      endotracheal tube extubation in the operating room (OR-EX) and those without (NOR-EX) in&#xD;
      patients who underwent living-donor liver transplantation for end-stage liver failure are&#xD;
      going to be compared. Through these results, it is investigated whether endotracheal tube&#xD;
      extubation in the operating room is useful in reducing the length of stay in the intensive&#xD;
      care unit and the hospital stay after surgery in patients who have undergone living-donor&#xD;
      liver transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long-term mechanical ventilation after liver transplantation may increase the risk of&#xD;
      complications such as pneumonia, sepsis, and multi-organ failure. Recent advances in surgical&#xD;
      techniques and the introduction of short-acting anesthetics have accelerated the recovery of&#xD;
      liver transplant recipients, and early extubation after liver transplantation is being&#xD;
      proposed as a standard method. The results of a study on early extubation in patients&#xD;
      undergoing liver transplantation suggested a reduction in the length of stay in the&#xD;
      neutralizer room and predictors of early extubation. However, these studies are limited to&#xD;
      males, and there is no study in which the definition of early extubation includes extubation&#xD;
      in the operating room or extubation in the operating room within 1-3 hours of arrival in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit.&#xD;
