    <textblock>
      The Investigator propose a randomized trial that will assess whether participant involvement&#xD;
      in pre-operative counseling for ERAS improves post-surgical pain scores. The Investigator&#xD;
      will also assess participant compliance to ERAS-prescribed medications, and functionality&#xD;
      (return to school). Each participant who is enrolled in the study will be assigned to 1)&#xD;
      pre-operative counseling with participant's caregiver or 2) caregiver-only counseling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols have been shown to be safe and effective in&#xD;
      pediatric and adolescent gynecology (PAG) participants. However, the individual elements of&#xD;
      ERAS that are associated with positive outcomes have not been identified. Pre-operative&#xD;
      counseling and education is a standard component of ERAS. In pediatric and adolescent&#xD;
      gynecology (PAG), pre-operative counseling is typically administered to the participant's&#xD;
      caregiver rather than directly to the participant. It is possible that direct participant&#xD;
      involvement in ERAS pre-operative counseling could be an important factor to improve&#xD;
      post-surgical outcomes. To investigator's knowledge, no studies have examined the impact of&#xD;
      direct participant involvement in pre-operative counseling on ERAS outcomes in the PAG&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
