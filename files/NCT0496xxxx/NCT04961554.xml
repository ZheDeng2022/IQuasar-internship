    <textblock>
      Trismus is an involuntary contracture of the masticatory muscles, blocking the opening of the&#xD;
      jaw, first intermittent then permanent and irreducible. Trismus is the result of pain or&#xD;
      spasm or even muscle fibrosis, due to infectious, inflammatory or tumoral involvement of the&#xD;
      masticatory muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During any anesthesia, control of the patient's upper airways is a major issue. Orotracheal&#xD;
      intubation is the gold standard. Trismus will therefore complicate this management of the&#xD;
      airways. This trismus can prevent the realization of a classic intubation, by the inability&#xD;
      to use a laryngoscope or video laryngoscope, in favor of awake fiberoptic intubation, a&#xD;
      technique that causes discomfort during the procedure, then a state of post-traumatic stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mandibular block is increasingly used in the analgesia of mandibular surgeries thanks to the&#xD;
      simplicity of the technique and its good efficiency. It has been described that the&#xD;
      mandibular locoregional anesthesia made it possible to remove the trismus due to a dental&#xD;
      infection, allowing the realization of a surgical gesture under good conditions. In addition,&#xD;
      authors have described V3 block as a technique that could improve the safety of anesthesia in&#xD;
      patients with acute trismus, by avoiding the need for awake nasofibroscopy intubation. One&#xD;
      study showed that performing locoregional anesthesia of the mandibular nerve improved the&#xD;
      mouth opening in patients with mandibular fracture. The investigators wondered if this&#xD;
      locoregional anesthesia could also work on other types of trismus such as infectious, tumoral&#xD;
      and osteoradionecrosis trismus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During preoperative consultation, anesthesists usually measure the mouth opening. In our&#xD;
      study, anesthesists will also measure the mouth opening after performing locoregional&#xD;
      anesthesia of the V3 nerve (mandibular block). In addition to the measurement made before the&#xD;
      start of the anesthetic treatment, research provides for three other measurements of the&#xD;
      mouth opening using a rule (millimeters), taken at different times : after sedation, after&#xD;
      performing locoregional anesthesia and after curarization. The investigators will also&#xD;
      collect the cause of the limited mouth opening, the duration of development. The&#xD;
      investigators will study pain at rest and when opening the mouth, under sedation, when&#xD;
      performing the block, then when opening the mouth after performing the block. The presence of&#xD;
      edema next to the area of locoregional anesthesia, the type of product used for sedation and&#xD;
      locoregional anesthesia, the intubation technique performed, as well as the difficulty&#xD;
      experienced by the operator will be collected&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to avoid recourse to awake fiberoptic intubation, which causes&#xD;
      discomfort during the procedure and post-traumatic stress disorder, in patients with a very&#xD;
      limited mouth opening (less than 20mm) and who must undergo anesthesia general for mandibular&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a reminder, the definition of limited mouth opening (MO) is a lower 35mm mouth opening,&#xD;
      according to the Société française d'anesthésie-réanimation (SFAR) recommendations. The&#xD;
      investigators define a very limited mouth opening as a mouth opening that does not allow a&#xD;
      video laryngoscope blade to be inserted into the patient's mouth (less than 20mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During preoperative consultation, anesthesists usually measure the mouth opening. In our&#xD;
      study, anesthesists will also measure the mouth opening after performing locoregional&#xD;
      anesthesia of the V3 nerve (mandibular block). In addition to the measurement made before the&#xD;
      start of the anesthetic treatment, research provides for three other measurements of the&#xD;
      mouth opening using a rule, taken at different times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management is carried out exclusively by the investigators, the latter being&#xD;
      anesthetists. Thus, the evaluation of the different mouth openings using a ruler (in&#xD;
      millimeters), the evaluation of the pain using the numerical scale, the administration of&#xD;
      sedation, the realization of loco-regional anesthesia, intraoperative and postoperative&#xD;
      anesthetic management will be carried out by one and the same person qualified in anesthesia&#xD;
      for maxillofacial surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, six key steps for our study will be carried out by the anesthetist-resuscitator:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Initial patient assessment with assessment of pain and mouth opening (millimeters)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Introduction of sedation, and reassessment of pain and mouth opening (millimeters)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Performing a locoregional anesthesia of the V3 for analgesic purposes&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Reassessment of pain, mouth opening (millimeters) at least 15 minutes from the block,&#xD;
           and possibly the Mallampati score. Mallampati score is systematically noted as part of&#xD;
           the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Induction of anesthesia, and reassessment of the mouth opening after curarization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Assessment of the difficulty of intubation (difficulty in passing the videolaryngoscope&#xD;
           blade, Cormack score applied to videolaryngoscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthetist who performs the locoregional anesthesia will collect the data using the&#xD;
      standardized questionnaire created for the study, notifying the key clinical elements of&#xD;
      airway management that are being research within the framework of care, according to the&#xD;
      rules of good anesthesia practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data, collected as part of the treatment, will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cause of the limited mouth opening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The duration of development&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain at rest and when opening the mouth, then under sedation, when performing the block,&#xD;
           then when opening the mouth after performing the block, using the digital scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The presence of edema next to the area of locoregional anesthesia of V3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The type of product used for sedation and locoregional anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The mouth opening (measured in millimeters using a ruler) before any gesture then after&#xD;
           sedation, 15 minutes from the completion of the V3 nerve block, and after curarization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators will also evaluate the evolution of the Mallampati score at the same&#xD;
           time, as part of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The intubation technique performed, as well as the difficulty experienced by the&#xD;
           operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data will be pseudonymized.&#xD;

    <description>The main outcome is the measure of patient's mouth opening (in millimeters) in the minutes preceding and following the mandibular block.&#xD;
The mouth opening will be measured using a ruler with 4 defined times:&#xD;
Before any anesthesia&#xD;
After sedation&#xD;
15min from the realization of the loco-regional anesthesia&#xD;
After curarization, just before intubation. These different measurements will be carried out by a ruler, and by a single operator for these 4 measurements.</description>
