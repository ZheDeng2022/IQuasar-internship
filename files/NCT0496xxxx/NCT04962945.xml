  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound-guided axillary vein catheterization can be performed via the oblique-axis and&#xD;
      long-axis approaches of the axillary vein. The aim of our study is to compare the first&#xD;
      puncture success rate and safety between the two approaches of ultrasound-guided axillary&#xD;
      vein catheterization in cardiac surgical patients with high bleeding risk&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients after cardiac surgery, antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants are usually used for&#xD;
      preventing thrombosis. Use of those drugs is associated with increased risk of bleeding. Any&#xD;
      invasive procedures may put those patients at additional risk of bleeding. Ultrasound (US)&#xD;
      has become widely accepted to guide safe and accurate central venous catheterization.&#xD;
      Ultrasound-guided axillary vein catheterization can be performed via the oblique-axis and&#xD;
      long-axis approaches of the axillary vein. The aim of our study is to compare the first&#xD;
      puncture success rate and safety between the two approaches of ultrasound-guided axillary&#xD;
      vein catheterization in cardiac surgical patients with high bleeding risk&#xD;
