    <textblock>
      The WHO Surgical Safety Checklist is a simple tool designed to improve the safety of surgical&#xD;
      procedures by bringing together the whole operating team (surgeons, anaesthesia providers and&#xD;
      nurses) to perform key safety checks during vital phases of perioperative care: prior to the&#xD;
      induction of anesthesia, prior to skin incision and before the team leaves the operating&#xD;
      room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2007, WHO Patient Safety launched the Second Global Patient Safety Challenge, Safe Surgery&#xD;
      Saves Lives.Anaesthetists, operating theatre nurses, surgeons, safety experts, patients and&#xD;
      other professionals came together and came up with the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist. The 19&#xD;
      items of the surgical checklist have shown to improve on mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical time out is carried out before the start of any surgical procedures to reduce the&#xD;
      occurrence of wrong-site, wrong-procedure, and wrong-person surgery where the patient's&#xD;
      identity, the procedure, and the surgical site before surgical incision or the start of the&#xD;
      procedure is verified. This also helps to raise any concern regarding the procedural risk and&#xD;
      any concerns, prevent medical errors, patient morbidity, patient mortality, and reduce&#xD;
      surgical complication rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Checklist is intended as a tool for use by clinicians interested in improving the safety&#xD;
      of their operations and reducing unnecessary surgical deaths and complications and also help&#xD;
      ensure that teams consistently follow a few critical safety steps and thereby minimize the&#xD;
      most common and avoidable risks endangering the lives and wellbeing of surgical patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this Checklist is to reinforce accepted safety practices and foster better&#xD;
      communication and teamwork between clinical disciplines.&#xD;

      Definition of terms A time-out is defined as &quot;an immediate pause by the entire surgical team&#xD;
      to confirm the correct patient, procedure, and site,&quot; for Preventing Wrong Site, Wrong&#xD;
      Procedure, and Wrong Person Surgery for all accredited hospitals, ambulatory care centers,&#xD;
      and office-based surgery facilities Elements that are clearly verbalized by the member of the&#xD;
      operating room team performing the time-out were considered compliant Distraction is defined&#xD;
      as any involvement in an activity concerning a non-life-threatening issue by any operating&#xD;
      room team member, including conversations unrelated to the time-out, loud music playing,&#xD;
      unexpected entrances, and personnel engaged in other tasks, among others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Checklist divides the operation into three phases, each corresponding to a specific time&#xD;
      period in the normal flow of a procedure-the period before induction of anaesthesia, the&#xD;
      period after induction and before surgical incision, and the period during or immediately&#xD;
      after wound closure but before removing the patient from the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each time-out procedure observed, the investigators will record compliance for each&#xD;
      element of the time-out. Elements that are clearly verbalized by the member of the operating&#xD;
      room team performing the time-out were considered compliant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As each step of the time-out is verbalized by a team member, the operating room team members&#xD;
      are expected to respond. The observations will be conducted by trained study staff using a&#xD;
      standardized Checklist/ Proforma to assess surgical team compliance with the time-out&#xD;
      protocol and to record general observations of the operating room environment. Any&#xD;
      non-routine events that occurred during the time-out process will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each phase, the Checklist coordinator must be permitted to confirm that the team has&#xD;
      completed its tasks before it proceeds onward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated and actual blood loss, anticipated and actual surgical duration will also be&#xD;
      noted&#xD;
