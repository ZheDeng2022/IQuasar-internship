    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effects of daily consumption for 4 weeks of a probiotic&#xD;
      durum wheat pasta vs a conventional durum wheat pasta without probiotics on fasting metabolic&#xD;
      parameters and inflammatory status, on gut permeability and functionality, on daily energy&#xD;
      intakes, appetite feelings, body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circunferences,&#xD;
      blood pressure, body composition and wellbeing status in overweight and obese subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Growing evidence highlights the role of the individual diet and gut microbiome in modulating&#xD;
      human metabolism, inflammatory status and cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This scenario supports nutritional approaches targeted to modify gut microbiota composition&#xD;
      to trigger health benefits and the interest to develop novel functional foods enriched with&#xD;
      probiotics. Most of commercial probiotic foods are in the category of dairy products and&#xD;
      contain Lactobacillus strains. Besides that, Bacillus spp. along with the ability to form&#xD;
      spores show probiotic attributes by exhibiting pathogen exclusion and antioxidant,&#xD;
      antimicrobial and immune-modulatory abilities. Furthermore, they possess a stronger viability&#xD;
      and stability to withstand high temperature processes, such as baking and boiling, than other&#xD;
      probiotic bacteria thus representing an ideal choice for the development of functional&#xD;
      cereal-based products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, Bacillus clausii UBBC07 exhibits probiotic properties by alleviating the&#xD;
      severity and symptoms of acute diarrhoea in adults and children and show a high stability&#xD;
      over a wide range of temperatures with potential applications in a variety of formulations&#xD;
      and foods. The health benefits of B. clausii UBBC07 in overweight and obese subjects is&#xD;
      underexplored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the effects of consumption for 4 weeks of a probiotic durum&#xD;
      wheat pasta enriched with spores of B. clausii UBBC07 vs a conventional durum wheat pasta&#xD;
      (control) on metabolic and inflammatory status, on gut permeability and functionality, on&#xD;
      daily energy intakes, appetite feelings, body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist and hip&#xD;
      circunferences, blood pressure, body composition and wellbeing status in overweight and obese&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
