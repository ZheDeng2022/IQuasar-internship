      The purpose of this research is to look at the safety and effectiveness of a HER2-targeted&#xD;
      therapy neratinib when given with capecitabine, a chemotherapy, for breast cancer patients&#xD;
      with brain metastases whose tumors were HER2-negative by standard tests but showed abnormal&#xD;
      HER2 activity based on the CELsignia results. The CELsignia test results might predict&#xD;
      whether this breast cancer type will respond to treatment with neratinib and capecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neratinib is called a HER2-targeted therapy because it stops cancer cells from growing by&#xD;
      targeting and blocking the HER2 proteins that help cancer cells grow. Neratinib is an oral&#xD;
      drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat HER2-positive breast&#xD;
      cancer. It is considered investigational in this study because your breast cancer was&#xD;
      determined to be HER2-negative by the standard method of testing. However, the CELsignia test&#xD;
      showed that your breast cancer cells have HER2 pathway activity that might respond to&#xD;
      HER2-targeted treatment.&#xD;
