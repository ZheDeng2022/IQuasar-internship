  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to be vast, exceeding the&#xD;
      capacity of mental health services and delaying treatment for people in need, with&#xD;
      devastating consequences for those affected. Emerging data suggest that frontline health&#xD;
      workers (e.g. physicians, nurses, EMTs) and essential workers (in industries such as energy,&#xD;
      and food products and services) face particular risks for mental health problems during and&#xD;
      after the COVID-19 outbreak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the unprecedented mental health needs during and as a result of the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic this study will develop and test novel, cost-effective and scalable,&#xD;
      digitally-delivered mental health interventions, and will test this approach by focusing on&#xD;
      health care workers and other essential workers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stigma towards mental health care is a profound obstacle that interferes with individuals&#xD;
      seeking these services. Research suggests that interventions that are based on social contact&#xD;
      are the most efficient way to reduce stigma. By combining online video and interactive&#xD;
      behavioral change modules, this study aims to address stigma and both empower essential&#xD;
      workers (healthcare and non-healthcare workers) both to seek treatment for mental health&#xD;
      issues as well as to reduce psychiatric symptoms by increasing social support, facilitating&#xD;
      sleep hygiene, and maintaining physical exercise. A total of 4,200 members of these high-risk&#xD;
      groups will be recruited to participate in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing the&#xD;
      efficacy of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will consist of brief videos in which empowered members of the respective&#xD;
      high-risk group (presented by actors) share their COVID-19 related mental health problems and&#xD;
      describe how they were able to confront their mental health problems, which in turn helped&#xD;
      them seek mental health care. The video will be followed by a short, interactive, digital&#xD;
      behavioral change module. Within each high-risk group, individuals will first be randomized&#xD;
      to receive the video (one time), video plus booster (second administration of the video), or&#xD;
      non-intervention video control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will randomize participants within each high-risk group into one of three arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Video + Behavioral Change Module, with Booster: 2-3-minute video (in which empowered&#xD;
      members of the respective high-risk group (protagonists) share their COVID-19 related mental&#xD;
      health problems and describe how they were able to confront their mental health problems,&#xD;
      which in turn helped them seek mental health care) will be followed by 3-4-minute online&#xD;
      digital behavioral change modules at days 1 and 14 of the study (&quot;video+booster&quot;); 2) Video +&#xD;
      Behavioral change modules without Booster: 2-3-minute video will be followed by 3-4-minute&#xD;
      online digital behavioral change modules at day 1 only (&quot;video&quot;); 3) No Intervention video&#xD;
      (Control Arm): Participants randomized to this arm will receive video not related to mental&#xD;
      health (&quot;control&quot;). Following the intervention, the study includes three follow-ups (day 14,&#xD;
      30, and 90) to examine longer-term effects.&#xD;
