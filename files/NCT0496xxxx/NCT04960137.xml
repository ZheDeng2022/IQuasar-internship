  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a comparative study through clinical trials to verify&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of the products in the experimental group for clinical use.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The product of this clinical validation is the fixed button plate system, which is used for&#xD;
      the reconstruction of the coracoclavicular ligament in the treatment of recurrent shoulder&#xD;
      dislocation. The clinical trial was conducted to verify the rationality of its structural&#xD;
      design, the convenience of its operation, and the effectiveness and safety of its clinical&#xD;
      use. This trial was conducted in a parallel controlled trial design, the patients were&#xD;
      divided into test and control groups to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the product.&#xD;

    <description>The button plates fixation system consists of fixing plate, prefabricated mix, button and fuse. In the process of use, the fuse plays the role of guiding the fixed plate through, pulling the button and shortening the distance between the button and the fixed plate. The prefabricated mix is pre-worn between the button and the fixed plate, and the lead pulls the distance between the fixed plate and the button after tightening and fixing. Prefabricated mix, make mix tight and knot. Finish the preliminary work of fixing.</description>
