  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect a urine sample from patients with prostate and&#xD;
      urothelial (bladder) cancer and healthy volunteers who do not have cancer, so that&#xD;
      researchers can perform studies on microcellular structures called exosomes that may&#xD;
      eventually lead to a new type of urinary biomarker test for prostate and urothelial cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a one-time participation, banking study of up to 40 subjects (10 prostate, 10&#xD;
      urothelial, 20 without cancer). Subjects must meet eligibility at the time of informed&#xD;
      consent and will donate approx. 200mL of urine sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop alternative and efficient urinary exosome isolation and glycan analysis approaches&#xD;
      for especially large glycan structures, including their isomers present at low levels, which&#xD;
      will particularly enhance current analytical technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide further testing of the current microfluidic-based approaches developed to screen&#xD;
      glycan samples which this additional specimen will provide to assess whether the current&#xD;
      analytical techniques are robust enough to handle this type of sample with sufficient&#xD;
      resolution and sensitivity for useful analytical information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare alterations in exosome-derived glycans in adults with prostate and urothelial&#xD;
      carcinoma in comparison with the exosome-derived glycans in age-matched healthy adults for&#xD;
      assessment of findings to explore if the tools could be applied for future study toward a&#xD;
      liquid biopsy test.&#xD;

      Urine sample collection, handling, and storage requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect at least 40-50 mL of fresh fasting urine (Note: up to 200 mL from each subject&#xD;
           can be used for this study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within two hours of collection, add one tablet containing protease inhibitor cocktail&#xD;
           and 0.5 mL of 2% sodium azide solution (weight to volume in water) to the sample for&#xD;
           preventing bacterial growth (both additives provided by the Novotny Glycoscience&#xD;
           Laboratory). Close the cap and mix gently by hand until the additives have dispersed&#xD;
           into the urine sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Label the sample with the study ID, subject ID, date and time of collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Store at -80°C&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Batch-ship samples on dry ice to:&#xD;
