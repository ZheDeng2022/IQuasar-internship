  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic eczema is a common skin disorder affecting at least 2-3% of the western population.&#xD;
      Atopic eczema cannot be cured and therefore treatment aims to alleviate the symptoms of the&#xD;
      disease. Today, many different medical treatments are available: from mild hormone creams to&#xD;
      harsh systemic treatments. The treatment chosen depends in part on the severity of the eczema&#xD;
      and on the treatment response of the individual. This practice may mean that some people with&#xD;
      eczema undergo unnecessary treatment courses with associated side effects. We know today that&#xD;
      eczema has a hereditary component, and different areas have been identified in the hereditary&#xD;
      material that appear to play a role. Although it is thought that variations in specific areas&#xD;
      of the inheritance material may influence how eczema is expressed in the individual, the&#xD;
      significance of these variations is far from clarified. The investigators want to increase&#xD;
      the knowledge about atopic eczema, about the disease and how in the future we can organize&#xD;
      the treatment of eczema based on knowledge of our genetic material. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators want to elucidate whether there is a correlation between specific variations in&#xD;
      the genetic material and how the eczema is clinically expressed. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators want to assess whether reports with specific information about the individual's&#xD;
      genetic material in relation to his or her lifestyle can help retain participants in research&#xD;
      projects.&#xD;
