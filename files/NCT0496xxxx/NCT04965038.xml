  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-arteritic, thromboembolic central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is an acute&#xD;
      neurovascular-ophthalmological emergency which leads to severe and permanent vision loss; no&#xD;
      evidence-based therapy does exist. Two recent meta-analyses indicate early intravenous&#xD;
      thrombolysis to be beneficial in CRAO. Therefore, the REVISION randomized placebo-controlled&#xD;
      interventional trial will investigate intravenous alteplase in CRAO as it is practiced in&#xD;
      acute ischemic stroke, i.e. within 4.5 hours after symptom onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The REVISION observational study will evaluate retinal changes on optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (OCT) in patients within 12 hours of CRAO onset, and the REVISION substudy, which&#xD;
      will be conducted adjunct to either the interventional or the observational study, will&#xD;
      evaluate the value of the retrobulbar spot sign for prediction of outcome and treatment&#xD;
      response.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Non-arteritic, thromboembolic central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is an acute&#xD;
      neurovascular-ophthalmological emergency which leads to severe and permanent vision loss in&#xD;
      the affected eye in ~ 95% of cases. Despite a variety of widely practiced &quot;conservative&#xD;
      standard treatments&quot;, such as hemodilution, ocular massage, and paracentesis, there is no&#xD;
      evidence-based therapy for non-arteritic CRAO. Animal models have proven a limited ischemic&#xD;
      tolerance of the retina with irreversible damage occurring within only four hours after&#xD;
      disruption of blood flow. This is why rapid reperfusion represents THE logical therapeutic&#xD;
      approach. Two recent meta-analyses indicate early intravenous thrombolysis to be beneficial&#xD;
      in CRAO. Therefore, the REVISION trial will investigate intravenous alteplase in CRAO as it&#xD;
      is practiced in acute ischemic stroke, i.e. within 4.5 hours after symptom onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequential evaluation by optical coherence tomography (OCT) will visualize dynamic ischemic&#xD;
      changes of the retina during and after CRAO. The REVISION observational study will enroll&#xD;
      patients within 12 hours of symptom onset and aims at comparing late time window retinal&#xD;
      findings to early ischemic changes found in patients of the randomized REVISION&#xD;
      interventional trial. Ultimately, OCT may become the preferred tool when it comes to assess&#xD;
      retinal tissue viability in patients with an unknown CRAO onset (e.g. wake-up CRAO), and CRAO&#xD;
      patients who present in an extended time window beyond 4.5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The REVISION substudy, which will be conducted adjunct to either the interventional or the&#xD;
      observational study, will evaluate the value of the retrobulbar spot sign for prediction of&#xD;
      outcome and treatment response.&#xD;
