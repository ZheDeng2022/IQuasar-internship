  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical pharmacists have an important role in inter-professional healthcare collaboration&#xD;
      for epilepsy management. However, the pharmacy practices of managing epilepsy are still&#xD;
      limited in Vietnam, deterring pharmacists from routine adjustments of antiepileptic drugs,&#xD;
      which could decrease the patients' quality of life. This study aimed to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of pharmacist interventions in epilepsy treatment at a Vietnamese general&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproic acid, which are among the first-generation AEDs, are&#xD;
      prescribed in many countries around the world, including Vietnam. These agents have&#xD;
      complicated pharmacokinetics, which may result in alterations in absorption, distribution,&#xD;
      and metabolism. This means that, given the same dose, the serum concentration of each drug&#xD;
      may vary between patients. The management of epilepsy, as a result, requires&#xD;
      inter-professional collaboration to ensure therapeutic optimization. As healthcare&#xD;
      professionals, clinical pharmacists play an important role in epilepsy management, which&#xD;
      includes establishing a therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) protocol, adjusting doses,&#xD;
      monitoring ADRs, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the clinical pharmacy practices in epilepsy management are quite limited in Vietnam.&#xD;
      The treatment gap-the proportion of people with epilepsy who are not adequately treated-still&#xD;
      remains very high, especially in rural areas (84.7%), which probably results from&#xD;
      discontinuing the treatment or refusing to take medications. This shows a need for pharmacist&#xD;
      consultations for patients with epilepsy and their family members, as they may be lack&#xD;
      information about AEDs or motivation in controlling potential seizures. In addition, the&#xD;
      adjustments of antiepileptic drugs by pharmacists are not routine procedures, nor are&#xD;
      monitored for effectiveness in many Vietnamese hospitals. This lack of engagement threatens&#xD;
      the patients' safety and decreases their quality of life. To address this issue, certain&#xD;
      interventions are needed to enable pharmacists to manage patients with epilepsy more&#xD;
      systematically. This study was therefore conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      pharmacist interventions in epilepsy treatment at a general hospital in Vietnam.&#xD;
