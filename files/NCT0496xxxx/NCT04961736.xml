    <textblock>
      High incidence rate of knee osteoarthritis and gait analysis are important for early&#xD;
      assessment of biomechanics. ACL injury is an ideal clinical model for studying knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To clarify the mechanism between the biomechanical status of knee joint and the change of&#xD;
      gait touch information, and to provide scientific basis for quantifying and evaluating the&#xD;
      biomechanical status of knee joint in dynamic load-bearing state.&#xD;

      Objective: to analyze the shape and function of the regenerated hamstring tendon within 2&#xD;
      years after the removal of the hamstring tendon in ACL reconstruction, reveal the change rule&#xD;
      of the characteristics of hamstring tendon regeneration and its biomechanical changes, and&#xD;
      guide the selection of operation and postoperative rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 55 healthy people and 55 male patients with ACL reconstruction were recruited. All&#xD;
      completed the basic rehabilitation training under the guidance of the postoperative&#xD;
      rehabilitation program. Using infrared motion capture system, three-dimensional force&#xD;
      measuring platform, isokinetic muscle force testing system and ultrasound, the anterior&#xD;
      cruciate ligament reconstruction patients were tested before operation, 2 weeks, 3 months, 6&#xD;
      months, 12 months after operation and 24 months after operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome evaluation indicators and statistical methods: evaluation indicators: (1) three&#xD;
      dimensional motion capture and analysis results: 1) peak ground reaction force; 2)&#xD;
      three-dimensional angle and torque of hip, knee and ankle joints in different stages; (2)&#xD;
      isokinetic muscle strength results: bilateral knee extension torque and knee flexion torque&#xD;
      at different angles and angular velocities. (3)Ultrasound evaluation: the thickness,&#xD;
      cross-sectional area and shear wave velocity of the semitendinosus were measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods: ① repeated measurement analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the&#xD;
      effects of different time after operation on the three-dimensional gait characteristics,&#xD;
      muscle strength and tendon regeneration characteristics. ② Independent sample t-test was used&#xD;
      to test the three-dimensional characteristics, muscle strength and tendon condition of&#xD;
      patients at different time points after operation. ③ The difference of three-dimensional gait&#xD;
      characteristics, muscle strength and tendon between the healthy side and the affected side at&#xD;
      different time points after operation were examined by paired sample t-test. ④ Bivariate&#xD;
      correlation analysis was used to analyze whether the thickness, cross-sectional area, shear&#xD;
      wave propagation velocity and postoperative time were related.&#xD;
