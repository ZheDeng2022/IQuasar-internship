  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this investigation was to determine the impact of branch-chained amino&#xD;
      acids (BCAAs) supplementation on serotonin and associated metabolites during endurance&#xD;
      exercise on healthy individuals. Specifically, despite the strong theoretical basis for&#xD;
      supplementation of BCAAs to attenuate serotonin production and fatigue during exercise, most&#xD;
      human clinical trials have failed to demonstrate these benefits. To shed light on this&#xD;
      discrepancy, the purpose of this study was to measure the impact of BCAA supplementation on&#xD;
      serotonin and associated metabolites during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this purpose, investigators determined the effects of the consumption of a BCAA&#xD;
      beverage on endurance exercise performance and serum metabolites. The supplementation&#xD;
      protocol consisted of two trials in which each participant consumed 8 grams of BCAA&#xD;
      supplement in a beverage or a placebo in randomized order. It was hypothesized that&#xD;
      post-exercise metabolites would differ between BCAA and placebo conditions.&#xD;

      Research Design This study utilized a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover&#xD;
      design comparing supplementation of BCAA versus placebo beverages consumed immediately before&#xD;
      and halfway through a 60-minute run at 65% of maximal aerobic capacity. To isolate the impact&#xD;
      of BCAA on serotonin and metabolism during exercise, blood samples were collected immediately&#xD;
      before and after exercise. A targeted metabolomic analysis was designed for BCAA to verify&#xD;
      supplementation induced increases in serum concentration, as well as for serotonin to assess&#xD;
      impacts of BCAAs. Untargeted metabolomic analysis was performed to identify global metabolic&#xD;
      impacts of BCAA supplementation on metabolism during endurance exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximal Aerobic Capacity A graded exercise test was used to measure maximal oxygen&#xD;
      consumption (VO2max) using a motorized treadmill. Each participant was fitted with an&#xD;
      electronic heart rate (HR) monitor, a mouthpiece and a two-way non-rebreathing tube and a&#xD;
      nose clip, all of which were attached to a standard laboratory metabolic cart (TrueOne 2400,&#xD;
      ParvoMedics, Sandy, Utah). Participants self-selected a speed between 5 and 7.5 mph and began&#xD;
      running at a 0% incline. Each minute, the treadmill incline was increased by 1.5% while speed&#xD;
      remained constant until the participant voluntarily terminated the test due to exhaustion.&#xD;
      Each participant's VO2max was defined as the highest 30 second average value collected during&#xD;
      the test. Heart rate at 65% of VO2max was then determined and used for the experimental&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental procedure Participants were asked to return to the lab no earlier than 72 hours&#xD;
      after the completion of the VO2max test to complete the first of two trials in the&#xD;
      experimental procedure. In the 48 hours prior to each trial, participants were asked to&#xD;
      record what they were eating, drinking and if they took any medications. All participants&#xD;
      were asked to refrain from consuming alcohol within the 48 hours prior to the trials. With&#xD;
      the exception of the experimental beverage, each of the two trials were identical in&#xD;
      procedure and were separated by at least 72 hours. Testing was performed at the same time of&#xD;
      day for each participant and all testing was completed between 4:00 and 8:00 p.m.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were provided with a randomly assigned beverage containing either BCAAs or a&#xD;
      placebo solution. Participants consumed the experimental beverage five minutes prior to their&#xD;
      running trial. Each participant was then fitted with a HR monitor and blood was drawn three&#xD;
      minutes after ingestion. The blood draw was immediately followed by a warm-up on the&#xD;
      treadmill at a self-selected speed for two to five minutes. Each participant then started&#xD;
      their 60-minute running trial at 0% incline at 65% of their established VO2max. Halfway into&#xD;
      the 60-minute trial, each participant ingested another serving of the assigned placebo or&#xD;
      BCAA beverage. Heart rate and the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) were collected every 10&#xD;
      minutes during the 60-minute trial. At the conclusion of the 60 minutes, participants cooled&#xD;
      down for two minutes before exiting the treadmill and completing the post-exercise blood&#xD;
      draw. Blood samples were allowed to clot for 15 minutes followed by centrifugation at 1200&#xD;
      RPM for 15 minutes at 4°C. The serum supernatant was then collected in clean vials and&#xD;
      immediately stored at -80°C until liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) analysis.&#xD;
      Treadmill speed during the first trial were recorded and replicated during the second trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental beverages Each participant was provided a BCAA supplement solution or a placebo&#xD;
      solution in a double-blind, randomized crossover design. The BCAA solution was 8 oz of water&#xD;
      mixed with approximately 8 grams of a standard BCAA supplement in powder form. Each 8-gram&#xD;
      dose contained 2.5 grams of leucine, 1.25 grams of isoleucine and 1.25 grams of valine. The&#xD;
      presence of BCAA was confirmed by LCMS. The placebo solution was 8 oz of water mixed with&#xD;
      approximately 2.0 mL of a sucralose-based drink mix. Both the BCAA solution and the placebo&#xD;
      solution were similar in color and in taste. Participants were allowed to drink additional,&#xD;
      plain water during the 60-minute running trial if desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolite extraction Serum samples were thawed and 20μL of serum was removed and placed in a&#xD;
      clean vial. Protein precipitation was completed with the addition of 80μL of cold acetone&#xD;
      followed by agitation on a vortex machine and two hours in a -80°C freezer. Serum was then&#xD;
      centrifuged at 20,000g for 10 minutes at -4°C. The metabolite rich supernatant was collected&#xD;
      and concentrated using negative pressure to dryness (ConcentratorPlus, Eppendorf, Hamburg,&#xD;
      Germany). Samples were then stored at -80°C for no more than 24 hours until ready for LCMS&#xD;
      analysis. Directly before LCMS analysis, metabolite samples were reconstituted with 40μL of&#xD;
      methanol:water (50:50) and placed in a clean mass spectrometry vial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LCMS conditions LCMS analysis was performed on an Agilent 6538 Q-TOF MS (Agilent&#xD;
      Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) coupled to an Agilent 1290 UHPLC (Agilent Technologies, Santa&#xD;
      Clara, CA) using a 1.8μm, 2.1mm X 150mm Waters HSST-3 UPLC column (Waters Corp., Milford,&#xD;
      MA). Electrospray ionization was in positive mode. LC mobile phases were water (A), and&#xD;
      acetonitrile (B), both with 0.1% formic acid. Flow was kept constant at 300µL per minute. The&#xD;
      mobile phase gradient began with 95% A and finished with 5% A after seven minutes before&#xD;
      returning to 95% at eight minutes and continuing to the end of the ten-minute run time.&#xD;
      Column compartment temperature was kept constant at 30°C. MSMS analysis was completed using&#xD;
      identical conditions with pooled extracted serum samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Serotonin standards (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) were analyzed under&#xD;
      the described LCMS conditions and the retention time and m/z value were determined.&#xD;
      Concentrations of 0.001µM, 0.01µM, 0.05µM, 0.1µM, 0.5µM, 1µM and 5µM were analyzed allowing&#xD;
      for the creation of a standard concentration curve and the determination of the limit of&#xD;
      detection. Peaks for serotonin from participant serum samples were then integrated and the&#xD;
      concentration was calculated from the standard curve using MassHunter (Agilent Technologies,&#xD;
      Santa Clara, CA). For the untargeted data analysis, the raw data files were converted to&#xD;
      .mzML and .mgf files using MSConvert and then mined using mzMine (Chambers, et al., 2012,&#xD;
      Katajamaa, et al., 2006). Blank samples were also created using the same metabolite procedure&#xD;
      without serum and were analyzed under identical LCMS condition concurrently. The resulting&#xD;
      sample blank data was also converted and mined with the sample data and were used to remove&#xD;
      machine background and mobile phase contributions to the data. Cleaned datasets and MSMS data&#xD;
      were then statistically analyzed using MetaboAnalyst and Sirius software, respectively (Chong&#xD;
      2019, Dührkop, et al., 2015, Dührkop, et al., 2019). The BCAA supplement was also examined&#xD;
      using LCMS and the results were analyzed to confirm the presence of BCAAs and additives&#xD;
      including flavoring and sweetening agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Serotonin concentrations were normalized and center scaled using the&#xD;
      caret R package. After normalization, a nested ANOVA was completed with serotonin&#xD;
      concentration as the dependent variable and treatment and time as independent variables. The&#xD;
      results of the nested ANOVA analysis led to further exploration of the groups and t-tests&#xD;
      were performed between treatment and temporal groupings.&#xD;
