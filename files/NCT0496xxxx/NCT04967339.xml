  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with early to mid-stage knee osteoarthritis (OA), a conservative treatment is&#xD;
      indicated. In medial knee OA (when mainly the medial compartment of the knee is affected by&#xD;
      OA), lateral wedge insoles have been promoted as cost effective and simple solution. However,&#xD;
      clinical trials report conflicting results, with some reporting no benefit while others&#xD;
      reported a small decrease in knee pain. Recent studies reported medial OA patients to have a&#xD;
      tendency to a plano-valgus foot deformity, which is associated with a varus lower limb&#xD;
      alignment and an internal rotation of the tibia. Some authors thus proposed the correction of&#xD;
      plano-valgus deformity with foot deformity correcting insoles instead of lateral wedge&#xD;
      insoles. Until today, only one study investigated the effect of foot deformity correcting&#xD;
      insoles (e.g. with medial arch support) as alternative to lateral wedge insoles and reported&#xD;
      encouraging results. However, they used lateral wedge insoles with custom arch support&#xD;
      instead of foot deformity correcting customized insoles along (without lateral wedge).&#xD;
      Furthermore, they did not perform any biomechanical analyses. The primary object of this&#xD;
      study is to compare the effect of foot deformity correcting insoles for plano-valgus foot&#xD;
      deformities and lateral wedge insoles on knee load distribution, knee pain and patient&#xD;
      reported outcome measures in early to mid-stage medial knee OA patients after 6 and 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is defined as an inflammatory process leading to loss of&#xD;
      protective cartilage which results in pain, disability and loss of function. Around 25% of&#xD;
      the population between 55 and 84 years is affected by OA of the knee. It can be graded using&#xD;
      various classification, one of the most used being the Kellgren-Lawrence-Score (KL) ranging&#xD;
      from 1 (early) to 4 (end stage). The treatment of choice for end-stage three compartmental&#xD;
      knee OA (KL 4) is a total knee arthroplasty (TKA), whereby the damaged/degenerated parts of&#xD;
      the knee are removed and replaced by a prosthesis. However, in patients with early to&#xD;
      mid-stage OA (KL 1-3), which are usually younger patients, a conservative treatment is&#xD;
      indicated. The goal of this conservative treatment is to relieve symptoms and at best slow&#xD;
      progression of the diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In medial knee OA (when mainly the medial compartment of the knee is affected by OA), one&#xD;
      approach is to reduce the medial compartment contact force (MCF) by shifting load from the&#xD;
      medial (disease affected) to lateral (disease free) compartment. Thereby lateral wedge&#xD;
      insoles have been promoted as cost effective and simple solution. The biomechanical idea of&#xD;
      these insoles is a shift in load distribution through a change in lower limb alignment. The&#xD;
      lateral wedge of the insoles leads to a change in foot alignment (varus hindfoot) and&#xD;
      consequently to a change in knee alignment (valgus knee = &quot;knock-knees&quot;) and load&#xD;
      distribution. Biomechanical studies confirmed a reduction in external knee adduction moment&#xD;
      (EKAM) and knee adduction angular impulse (KAAI), which are surrogate measures to estimate&#xD;
      knee joint load distribution (e.g. MCF). However, clinical trials report conflicting results,&#xD;
      with some reporting no benefit while others reported a small decrease in knee pain in at&#xD;
      least some patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the light of this, the connection between knee OA and foot deformities has been&#xD;
      reassessed. One study found patients with medial knee OA to have a more pronated foot type&#xD;
      (i.e. tendency to plano-valgus deformity) compared to an age-matched control group without&#xD;
      OA. Other investigations found more rigid foot types in patients with medial knee OA and a&#xD;
      more internally rotated tibia during gait as well as an inversion of the forefoot. This seems&#xD;
      important because the hindfoot axis has a significant influence on the mechanical axis of the&#xD;
      lower limb and thereby on the load distribution in the knee. Half a degree valgisation of the&#xD;
      hindfoot axis leads to one-degree varisation of the mechanical axis. Furthermore, a&#xD;
      plano-valgus foot morphology was found to lead to internal rotation of the tibia which&#xD;
      increases shear forces in the medial knee compartment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, patients with medial knee OA tend to have a plano-valgus foot deformity which is&#xD;
      associated with a varus lower limb alignment and an internal rotation of the tibia. Both have&#xD;
      been associated to an increased loading of the medial compartment. Consequently, some authors&#xD;
      proposed the correction of plano-valgus deformity with customized foot deformity correcting&#xD;
      insoles instead of lateral wedge insoles as conservative treatment option for early to&#xD;
      mid-stage medial knee OA. Until today, only one study investigated the effect of foot&#xD;
      deformity correcting insoles (e.g. insoles with customized medial arch support) as&#xD;
      alternative to lateral wedge insoles and reported encouraging results. However, they used&#xD;
      lateral wedge insoles with and without medial arch support and did not explicitly only&#xD;
      correct the foot deformity. Furthermore, they did not perform any biomechanical analysis,&#xD;
      which seems important since some previous studies found significant differences in KAAI and&#xD;
      EKAM among patients.&#xD;
