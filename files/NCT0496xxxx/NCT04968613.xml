  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cognitive impairment of Parkinson's disease is non amnestic, which is characterized by&#xD;
      working memory impairment and executive dysfunction. The current drug therapy (such as&#xD;
      levodopa, dopamine receptor agonists) and surgical treatment (such as deep brain electrical&#xD;
      stimulation, thalamic lesion) not only can not effectively alleviate cognitive impairment,&#xD;
      but also may aggravate cognitive and speech behavior abnormalities. This project will explore&#xD;
      how dopamine regulates temporal working memory in human research by combining drug&#xD;
      intervention, neuroimaging and cognitive tasks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease in the elderly. The incidence&#xD;
      rate of China's disease is 1.7% in the population over 65 years old. The latest research&#xD;
      shows that Parkinson's disease is not a simple motor disorder, but a multi organ dysfunction&#xD;
      disorder with both motor symptoms and non motor symptoms. With the development of the&#xD;
      disease, more than 80% of the PD patients will develop dementia. Different from the amnestic&#xD;
      cognitive impairment of Alzheimer's disease, the cognitive impairment of Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      is non amnestic, characterized by working memory impairment and executive dysfunction. The&#xD;
      current mainstream drug therapy (such as levodopa, dopamine receptor agonists) and surgical&#xD;
      treatment (such as deep brain electrical stimulation, thalamic lesion) can not effectively&#xD;
      alleviate cognitive impairment, and may even aggravate cognitive and speech behavior&#xD;
      abnormalities, We should first understand the neurochemical (molecular) mechanisms of working&#xD;
      memory impairment and executive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. A prospective single&#xD;
      blind randomized controlled design was used. Newly diagnosed PD patients were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to three treatment groups: Madopar monotherapy group (n = 50), senfrol monotherapy&#xD;
      group (n = 50) and placebo group (n = 50). Objective to study the performance of temporal&#xD;
      working memory in PD patients and reveal the dopaminergic mechanism of temporal working&#xD;
      memory.&#xD;
