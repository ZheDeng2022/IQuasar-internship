  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies the effect of behavioral health support including tele-health in&#xD;
      helping surgical patients taper off of prescription opioid pain medications. &quot;Tapering off&quot;&#xD;
      means taking dose amounts of medication that get smaller over time, so that less and less of&#xD;
      the drug is used until it is not needed anymore. Researchers want to learn how these&#xD;
      techniques may improve a patient's ability to lower or avoid dependence on opioid medications&#xD;
      after surgery, and if behavioral therapies may improve quality of life, emotional well-being,&#xD;
      and functional status around surgery.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the impact of Lucid Lane's perioperative opioid tapering program utilizing&#xD;
      daily behavioral health support (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act&#xD;
      [HIPAA]-compliant sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT], mindfulness, 1:1&#xD;
      psychotherapy, group therapy, and 2-way texting and chat, all interactions with Lucid Lane&#xD;
      licensed therapists), for patients who are on an opioid medication prior to surgery&#xD;
      (tolerant), or naive and will be undergoing a surgery with curative intent post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients participate in the Lucid Lane therapy program including working with a mental&#xD;
      health therapist on mindfulness, CBT, group therapy, and mind-body therapies for 3-9 months&#xD;
      or until the tapering off period is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive standard of care post-surgical opioid education.&#xD;
