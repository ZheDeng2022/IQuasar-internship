    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of oral varespladib, in addition&#xD;
      to standard of care, in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this 2-part, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2&#xD;
      study are to define a safe dose for the population and to assess the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      and efficacy of orally dosed varespladib to improve survival without respiratory failure in&#xD;
      patients hospitalized with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), when given in addition&#xD;
      to the institutional standard of care therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mortality rates of COVID-19 are strongly linked to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)&#xD;
      which may be, additionally, correlated with elevations of secretory phospholipase 2 (sPLA2)&#xD;
      and widespread loss of functioning lung tissue. Upregulation of sPLA2 is thought to be&#xD;
      involved in the dysregulated inflammatory cascade pathways (increased markers of immune&#xD;
      activation, also known as cytokine release syndrome) and enzymatic degradation of lung&#xD;
      surfactant linked to the development of ARDS. It is believed that treatment with varespladib,&#xD;
      a potent inhibitor of sPLA2, might prevent or mitigate progression of pulmonary dysfunction&#xD;
      in COVID-19 patients by two mechanisms: suppression of sPLA2-induced inflammation and,&#xD;
      uniquely, preservation of pulmonary surfactant by direct inhibition of the enzyme responsible&#xD;
      for surfactant phospholipid degradation: sPLA2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from previous phase 2 clinical trials of varespladib suggested it had potential to&#xD;
      reduce mortality in severely septic patients with ARDS, particularly when treatment was&#xD;
      initiated within 18 hours of identification of organ failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two parts. Both parts will be randomized and double-blind.&#xD;
      Part 1 will be dose-finding in four parallel treatment groups randomized to treatment with&#xD;
      varespladib (at 250 mg once daily [QD], twice daily [BID], or three times daily [TID] [250,&#xD;
      500, or 750 mg/day]) or placebo in a 5:5:5:3 ratio. After all participants in Part 1 have&#xD;
      completed Day 28, a data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will review the safety results from&#xD;
      Part 1, including all available safety data through Day 60, and will recommend the dose&#xD;
      regimen to be used in Part 2. Part 2 will randomize an additional 72 participants to the dose&#xD;
      regimen selected from Part 1 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both parts of the study, eligible participants will be enrolled and randomized to receive&#xD;
      active varespladib or placebo in addition to institutional standard of care for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed daily per standard of care while hospitalized and on a regular&#xD;
      basis after discharge. The Day 1, 4, 7, 14, and 28 visits will be performed in person (either&#xD;
      at the hospital/site or via a home health provider) to assess safety, obtain blood and urine&#xD;
      samples for laboratory tests, and obtain clinical outcome data. The Day 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10,&#xD;
      11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 45, and 60 visits for discharged participants may be&#xD;
      conducted by phone or via electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed by respiratory failure-free survival at Day 28. Safety will be&#xD;
      assessed by evaluating adverse events (AEs), vital sign measurements, use of oxygen&#xD;
      therapies, changes in levels of biomarkers, clinical laboratory test results,&#xD;
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examination findings, and concomitant medications and&#xD;
      therapies. A DSMB will evaluate safety data at specified intervals during both parts of the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples will be drawn from all participants in Part 1 and in a subset of&#xD;
      approximately 14 participants in Part 2 in order to enable estimation of PK parameters in&#xD;
      approximately 22 participants receiving active treatment with varespladib.&#xD;
