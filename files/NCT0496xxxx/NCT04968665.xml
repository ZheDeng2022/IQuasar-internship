      Explore The Mechanism for the Effects of Joint Biomechanical Properties on Medial Cartilage&#xD;
      of Tibiofemoral Joint Degeneration&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cartilage degeneration in the medial tibiofemoral joint is common after anterior cruciate&#xD;
      ligament reconstruction (ACLR), which may develop into knee osteoarthritis (disability rate&#xD;
      21.3%). Alterations in joint biomechanical properties play an important role in cartilage&#xD;
      degeneration after ACLR. However, the mechanism remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research studied the joint kinematics and kinetics properties after ACLR and found&#xD;
      significant changes in biomechanics in the ACLR knees. Therefore, this study will combine&#xD;
      longitude biochemical changes in the cartilage to explore how the alterations in biomechanics&#xD;
      would influence biochemical changes in the joint cartilage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will explore the joint biomechanical properties during functional activities by&#xD;
      motion analysis, the effects of biomechanical properties on cartilage stress distribution by&#xD;
      finite element analysis, the long-term biochemical changes in the joint cartilage by&#xD;
      functional MRI. This study will establish prediction models for cartilage biomechanical&#xD;
      changes in the mid-term based on joint biomechanical properties in the early stage after&#xD;
      ACLR, and cartilage biomechanical changes in the long-term based on joint biomechanical&#xD;
      properties in the mid-term after ACLR. The study aims to clarify the mechanism of cartilage&#xD;
      degeneration after ACLR and search biomechanical risk factors, in order to provide methods&#xD;
      for clinical prevention of cartilage degeneration after ACLR.&#xD;
