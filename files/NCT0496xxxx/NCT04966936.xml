  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microprocessor knee joints are prosthetic knee joints with an integrated processor or a&#xD;
      computer that can analyze data. During walking, parameters such as step speed, joint angles,&#xD;
      and weight transferred through sensors are analyzed by the computer inside the joint and&#xD;
      determines the movement for the safest and most normal walking. They have different features&#xD;
      from each other in terms of weight/height, sensor and processor frequency, load carrying&#xD;
      capacity, phase control (hydraulic, pneumatic, magnetic), battery properties, water&#xD;
      resistance, and special activity mode. C-Leg, Genium, Genium X3, Rheo Knee 3, Rheo Knee XC,&#xD;
      Orion etc. prostheses of different companies are used as oscillating and compression phase&#xD;
      microprocessor knee prostheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publications on C-leg, Genium and Genium X3 prostheses are limited in international&#xD;
      literature. Although there are existing studies comparing C-leg and Genium, there is no study&#xD;
      comparing these three prostheses. The investigators think that our study is important because&#xD;
      it is the first study in the literature to compare these three prostheses. In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators aimed to examine the effects of different microprocessor knee prostheses on&#xD;
      mobility and gait parameters in unilateral traumatic transfemoral amputees.&#xD;

      The study will be carried out with patients who applied to the outpatient clinic or who&#xD;
      received inpatient treatment in the orthopedic rehabilitation (amputee) clinic. The patient's&#xD;
      demographic information (age, gender, height, weight, body mass index, education level,&#xD;
      occupation, marital status) and clinical characteristics (amputation date, cause of injury,&#xD;
      amputation side, etc.) will be recorded with the evaluation to be made to the patient. The&#xD;
      activity levels of the patients will be evaluated by the Amputee Mobility Predictor, the&#xD;
      mobility of the patients by the Locomotor Capacity Index, the prosthesis satisfaction in&#xD;
      general with the visual analog scale (VAS), the walking ability and capacity with the&#xD;
      prosthesis will be evaluated by the 2 min walking test, and the gait analysis will be&#xD;
      evaluated in the motion analysis laboratory.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The amputee is evaluated with 21 functions and a score is obtained. According to this score, the patient's K activity level is determined. K0: The patient is immobile, does not have the potential and ability to ambulate or transfer with the prosthesis. K1: The patient can use the prosthesis for ambulation and transfers. Prostheses provide limited or unlimited in-home ambulation. K2: The patient provides limited ambulation in the community with the prosthesis. K3: The patient has the potential to use the prosthesis at variable speeds. The patient can use the prosthesis not only for ambulation, but also for occupation, therapeutic activities and exercises. K4: The patient has the potential and ability to use the prosthesis in high-energy activities.</description>
