  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The physical, social and psychological effects of Behcet's disease necessitate the patient's&#xD;
      adaptation in many areas. This study was conducted to examine the effect of psychoeducation&#xD;
      given to Behcet's patients in the context of the Roy Adaptation Model on illness adjustment,&#xD;
      dyadic adjustment, self-esteem, and psychiatric symptoms. The study is a control group&#xD;
      quasi-experimental study with a pre-test, post-test and follow-up design. The study was&#xD;
      conducted with 70 Behcet's patients including 35 interventions and 35 controls. The data of&#xD;
      the study were collected using the &quot;Patient Information Form&quot;, &quot; Adaptation to Chronic&#xD;
      Illness Scale&quot;, &quot;Dyadic Adjustment Scale&quot;, &quot;Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale&quot; and &quot;Brief Symptom&#xD;
      Inventory&quot; in pre-test, post-test and follow-up measurements. A 7-session psychoeducation&#xD;
      program was applied to the intervention group.&#xD;

      The research was carried out by using quantitative research methods, quasi-experimental&#xD;
      (pre-test, post-test, follow-up, control group) research method.The study was conducted with&#xD;
      patients followed-up in eye, dermatology and rheumatology clinics of 6 state-owned hospitals&#xD;
      in Ankara, Turkey. The sample size of the study was calculated with the PASS (Power Analysis&#xD;
      and Sample Size) statistical package program. It was calculated that our study could be&#xD;
      performed with 5% error and 90% power with 35 interventions and 35 control groups, with 70&#xD;
      patients in total. Thus, the research was completed with 70 patients, 35 interventions and 35&#xD;
      control groups.The 7-session psychoeducation program prepared on the basis of the Roy&#xD;
      Adaptation Model was applied to the intervention group once a week for 90-120 minutes.&#xD;
      Psychoeducation was conducted in 3 groups of 10-12 people, and make-up sessions were held for&#xD;
      those who did not attend two consecutive psychoeducation sessions or did not attend two&#xD;
      sessions in total. The contents of the psychoeducation sessions were created by the&#xD;
      researcher, based on the Roy Adaptation Model, by examining the relevant literature. After&#xD;
      the ethics committee report with the permission number GO16 / 229-21 was obtained from the&#xD;
      Non-Interventional Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Hacettepe University, the&#xD;
      application permission was obtained from the hospitals where the study will be conducted in&#xD;
      order to be able to apply the study. Before starting the intervention, the patients were&#xD;
      informed about the purpose and scope of the study, and written informed consent was obtained&#xD;
      from the patients who agreed to participate in the study. For the control group, after the&#xD;
      necessary information was given to the patients, their written informed consent was obtained.&#xD;
