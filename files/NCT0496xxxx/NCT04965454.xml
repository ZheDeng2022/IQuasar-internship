  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective clinical trial will evaluate PET/CT and genomic liquid biopsy based&#xD;
      biomarkers as predictors of clinical therapeutic response to immune-checkpoint inhibitor&#xD;
      (ICI) therapy for patients with inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The primary&#xD;
      objective of this diagnostic trial is to assess the accuracy of pre-treatment fluorine-18&#xD;
      (18F-) fluorocholine (FCH) PET/CT for predicting a lack of objective response (LOR) after 16&#xD;
      weeks of ICI therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective open-label single-arm diagnostic clinical trial evaluating fluorine-18&#xD;
      fluorocholine (FCH) PET/CT and cell-free DNA mutation profiling (also referred to as genomic&#xD;
      liquid biopsy) as diagnostic tools for predicting therapeutic response in advanced HCC&#xD;
      patients receiving immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. All enrolled subjects will&#xD;
      undergo diagnostic testing with FCH PET/CT and genomic liquid biopsy before ICI treatment. A&#xD;
      fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT may also be performed before treatment and after&#xD;
      8 weeks if the pre-treatment FCH PET/CT shows low or heterogeneous tumor uptake. The accuracy&#xD;
      of tumor biomarkers based on PET/CT and liquid biopsy for predicting therapeutic outcome and&#xD;
      disease progression will be determined using objective clinical endpoints based on the&#xD;
      radiographic classification of treatment response by RECIST v1.1 applied to CT or MRI&#xD;
      performed after 16 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
