  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the incidence of venous thromboembolism in people who are&#xD;
      diagnosed with atopic dermatitis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine whether venous thromboembolism is higher in people with&#xD;
      atopic dermatitis compared and those without and to explore the risk in particular subgroups&#xD;
      of people with AD such as those with higher body mass index or using oestrogen containing&#xD;
      contraceptives. Such insights will be valuable for clinicians in advising patients with&#xD;
      atopic dermatitis regarding venous thromboembolism prevention and detection and when&#xD;
      selecting atopic dermatitis treatments.&#xD;

    <measure>Demographic sub-group analysis of risk of venous thromboembolism</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years from index date</time_frame>
    <description>To explore potential heterogeneity in the risk of venous thromboembolism across subgroups of people with atopic dermatitis: by gender, age groups (18-45, 45-65, 65+), obesity, baseline use of oestrogen containing contraceptives in females, atopic dermatitis severity and history of allergic conditions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Allergic condition sub-group analysis of risk of venous thromboembolism</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years from index date</time_frame>
    <description>To explore risk of VTE stratified by the presence, or absence of allergic conditions at baseline. Allergic conditions will comprise common allergies; allergic rhinitis, allergy to dust mites or animal dander, and food allergies e.g., nut, fruit, shellfish, eggs and cows' milk allergies. Medication and other allergies will not be included.</description>
