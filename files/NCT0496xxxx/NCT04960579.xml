    <textblock>
      Phase 1 study comprised of open-label, dose escalation, multiple cohorts of P-BCMA-ALLO1&#xD;
      allogeneic T stem cell memory (Tscm) CAR-T cells in subjects with relapsed / refractory&#xD;
      Multiple Myeloma (RRMM).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 study follows a 3+3 design of dose-escalating cohorts. After a subject enrolls,&#xD;
      allogeneic CAR-T cells will be administered as a single dose, following a standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy based conditioning regimen. Treated subjects will undergo serial measurements of&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and response. Rimiducid may be administered as indicated.&#xD;
