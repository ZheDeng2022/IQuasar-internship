      Explore the many factors that affect the compliance of home exercise therapy in patients with&#xD;
      non-specific chronic low back pain, establish a theoretical model of the factors affecting&#xD;
      compliance behavior, in order to guide rehabilitation clinical practice, and improve the&#xD;
      compliance of patients with non-specific chronic low back pain to home exercise&#xD;
      prescriptions.&#xD;

      ABSTRACT Objective: To achieve more information and establish better guidance for the&#xD;
      clinical practice of rehabilitation, to improve the adherence of non-specific chronic low&#xD;
      back pain patients with home-based exercise prescription by exploring the factors that affect&#xD;
      the adherence of patients, and by building a theoretical model of adherence influencing&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: From February 2019 to August 2019, 39 patients were diagnosed as non-specific chronic&#xD;
      low back pain and prescribed home-based exercise prescription in the Department of&#xD;
      rehabilitation medicine of Peking University Third Hospital. They were recruited by&#xD;
      criterion-based sampling and had face-to-face exercise therapy guidance from the same&#xD;
      physiotherapist. We have a semi-structured 20-40 minutes telephone interview 2-3 months&#xD;
      later. The conversation was recorded with the consent of the patients, then the recorded&#xD;
      content was documented as text data. By the patient's exercise type, intensity, duration and&#xD;
      frequency, the patient adherence was classified as complete adherent, partial adherent and&#xD;
      complete not adherent. The qualitative research method was used to analyze the data under the&#xD;
      guidance of grounded theory with the help of qualitative analysis software NVivo. NVivo was&#xD;
      used to encode the text data of patient's conversation in three levels, and the themes were&#xD;
      extracted to explain the causes of adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Result: Of the 39 patients interviewed, 32 responded to the interview, with a response rate&#xD;
      of 82.0%. The average age of these 32 responded patients was 48.8±18.6 years old. There were&#xD;
      9 males (28.1%) and 23 females (71.9%). There were 4 complete adherent patients, 5 not&#xD;
      adherent, and 23 partial adherent (including 14 giving up halfway and 9 intermittent&#xD;
      exercise). The open coding got 19 initial sub-categories; then axial coding classified 19&#xD;
      initial sub-categories into five main categories, namely health belief, self-efficacy,&#xD;
      exercise prescription, self-management and family support. Selective coding classified health&#xD;
      belief and self-efficacy as &quot;internal environment&quot;, while exercise prescription and family&#xD;
      support as &quot;external environment&quot;. Based on this discovery, two theories are established: (1)&#xD;
      patients' &quot;self-management&quot; ability is the internal motivation of adherence behavior; (2) the&#xD;
      &quot;internal environment&quot; and &quot;external environment&quot; play a regulatory role in adherence&#xD;
      behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: Patients' adherence behavior is directly affected by the ability of&#xD;
      self-management and tends to be standardized under the regulation of good internal and&#xD;
      external environment. Regular follow-up, health education and adjusting the structure of&#xD;
      exercise prescription are necessary measures to improve patients' adherence.&#xD;

    <description>Studies have shown that the compliance of patients at 8-12 weeks reaches a peak, so this time node is the most suitable time node to investigate compliance. Telephone follow-up is irreplaceable convenience, so the telephone follow-up survey of patient compliance with exercise prescriptions is The most feasible method The purpose of the telephone follow-up is to 1. Investigate the compliance of the patients; 2. Make the patients fill out a self-made research compliance scale influencing factors through the telephone.The purpose of the telephone follow-up is to 1.
