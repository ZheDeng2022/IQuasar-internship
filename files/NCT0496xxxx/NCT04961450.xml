  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Motor neuron disease (MND) is a group of disease characterized by motor neuron disorders and&#xD;
      neurodegeneration. MND and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) were believed to comprise a&#xD;
      neurodegenerative disease spectrum. The prognosis of the disease spectrum varies according to&#xD;
      the type of disease, and the diagnosis of patients is often delayed due to insufficient&#xD;
      diagnostic biomarkers. In recent years, the academic community has made significant progress&#xD;
      in the study of biomarkers of the disease, but there is still a lack of specific biomarkers&#xD;
      with strong diagnostic value. Besides, the low prevalence makes it difficult to carry out&#xD;
      studies with large samples. The aim of this study was to explore diagnostic biomarkers of the&#xD;
      disease spectrum by collecting variable samples from a large group of patients. The findings&#xD;
      will both offer a better understanding of MND/FTD spectrum disease and also support the&#xD;
      development of a model to study other rare diseases.&#xD;
