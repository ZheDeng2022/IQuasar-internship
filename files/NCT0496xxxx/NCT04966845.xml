    <textblock>
      Study of 120 healthy subjects without cardiovascular disease, 40 smokers of conventional&#xD;
      cigarettes, 40 exclusive users of Heat-non-Burn Cigarettes and 40 nonsmokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline measurements of CO will be performed in the morning after awakening without the use&#xD;
      of any mask when they arrive at hospital. This time point is selected to detect the lowest&#xD;
      exhaled CO levels after the abstinence of smoking during the sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After baseline CO measurement, subjects will be randomly assigned to assess exhaled CO&#xD;
      concentration at the end of an 8h morning shift wearing a mask at hospital, or to CO&#xD;
      assessment at the end of an 8h morning period without mask out of the hospital (usually home&#xD;
      stay). Then the subjects will be crossed over to CO assessment at end of an 8h period without&#xD;
      mask out of the hospital after their shift or to an 8h afternoon period wearing a mask during&#xD;
      an afternoon hospital shift respectively.&#xD;

      Study of 120 healthy subjects without cardiovascular disease, 40 smokers of conventional&#xD;
      cigarettes, 40 exclusive users of Heat-non-Burn Cigarettes and 40 nonsmokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects are civil medical personnel working for the National Health System, in a&#xD;
      Tertiary University Hospital in Athens. Also, working in a hospital environment will ensure&#xD;
      the use of a mask during the shift.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline measurements of CO will be performed in the morning after awakening without the use&#xD;
      of any mask when they arrived at hospital. This time point is selected to detect the lowest&#xD;
      exhaled CO levels after the abstinence of smoking during the sleep. CO has a half-life of 5-6&#xD;
      hours and consequently CO levels after the period of sleep (almost 8 hours) verge to decline&#xD;
      or to normalize.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After baseline CO measurement, subjects will be randomly assigned to assess exhaled CO&#xD;
      concentration at the end of an 8h morning shift wearing a mask at hospital, or to CO&#xD;
      assessment at the end of an 8h morning period without mask out of the hospital (usually home&#xD;
      stay). Then the subjects will be crossed over to CO assessment at end of an 8h period without&#xD;
      mask out of the hospital after their shift or to an 8h afternoon period wearing a mask during&#xD;
      an afternoon hospital shift respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements with and without mask will be done one hour after smoking the last cigarette.&#xD;
      Subjects are inducted to smoke the same number of cigarettes or heets during their shift&#xD;
      while wearing the mask as well as during the out-hospital period when not using a mask.&#xD;
      During their shift they are instructed to wear the surgical mask constantly.&#xD;
