  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The technology of the pulse-synchronous alternating pressure system has been patented It is&#xD;
      ready for application. Since the device is a combination of commercially available products&#xD;
      with a software controlling the duration/initiation of the negative pressure, no harm for the&#xD;
      study participant is expected. With no adequate preclinical model of impaired&#xD;
      microcirculation being available, and the non-invasive nature of the device, the rationale to&#xD;
      test the product in a controlled setting in clinical patients is justified. The intervention&#xD;
      takes place twice a day for two consecutive days with objective assessment of the&#xD;
      microcirculation before and after the intervention. Thereby, the immediate effect of the&#xD;
      intervention is to be evaluated. A fifth assessment takes place on the third day without&#xD;
      prior intervention to assess a possible long-term effect (comparison against first&#xD;
      measurement - base line).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this project is to investigate the tolerability and the comfort of&#xD;
      pulse-synchronized negative pressure (PSNP) applied by the device manufactured by Orputec&#xD;
      GmbH on the dermal microcirculation. Evaluation of patient comfort and tolerability will be&#xD;
      performed by a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of the device (PSNP) significantly influences the dermal microcirculation&#xD;
      (measuring by LD, HS, TH).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Orputec has developed a device that uses the technology of a pulse-synchronized alternating&#xD;
      pressure system. It can be applied in the field of regenerative medicine to treat lymphedema&#xD;
      by improving the blood- and lymphatic circulation. The machine consists of four components:&#xD;
      an electrocardiograph (ECG), a vacuum pump, a software controlling the timing of suction and&#xD;
      drainage, and an individual suction cap for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as an open, interventional cohort, intraindividually controlled, pilot&#xD;
      study. A pilot sample size of 12 is chosen because the device will be tested in a controlled&#xD;
      setting for the first time. No formal sample size calculation was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collective consists of 12 subjects, with diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2 but no apparent&#xD;
      wounds on the lower leg. Before inclusion, subjects will be screened for current skin lesions&#xD;
      in the region of interest (ROI), comorbidities, and their medical history concerning diabetes&#xD;
      and skin lesions. The ROI on both lower legs will be marked, and the dermal microcirculation&#xD;
      will be measured, non-invasively, using LD, HS, and TH. After ensuring a comfortable&#xD;
      position, each subject will receive treatment with the PSNP device on one chosen lower leg&#xD;
      for 120 minutes. During the treatment, a warming unit, which is also used after flap surgery&#xD;
      to maintain an adequate ambient temperature, will be used to obtain local thermal hyperaemia,&#xD;
      hence a prospected dilation of the vessels. The non-invasive imaging (LD, HS, TH) will be&#xD;
      performed before and after the intervention. This treatment course will be applied twice a&#xD;
      day (with 4h +/- 2h in between) for two consecutive days. Toleration of the treatment and&#xD;
      wellbeing of the subjects will be assessed by a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Finally, another&#xD;
      series of imaging (LD, HS, TH) will be performed on the morning of the third day without a&#xD;
      prior intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of numeric endpoints: All numeric endpoints will be checked for&#xD;
      normality, e.g. by using a Shapiro-Wilk test. If a numeric endpoint deviates from normality,&#xD;
      then data transformations (e.g. log-transformation) will be considered. Numeric endpoints&#xD;
      will be analysed by means of a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The level of&#xD;
      significance will be set to 5% in all analyses. No adjustment for multiple comparisons will&#xD;
      be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the following comparisons will be performed by using descriptive statistics&#xD;
      (e.g. Q1, median, Q3, mean, standard deviation) and graphical methods (e.g. box plots):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of time points (prior to intervention on day 1; after intervention on day 1;&#xD;
           prior to control on day 1; after control on day 1;â€¦; day 3) within each treatment&#xD;
           condition (intervention: treated leg; control: untreated leg).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of treatment conditions (treated vs. untreated legs) for each time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to identify influencing factors for the effect of the PSNP treatment, the&#xD;
      investigators will use graphical methods as well as regression models and mixed effects&#xD;
      models (e.g., analysis of covariance).&#xD;
