  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose escalation and expansion study is designed to&#xD;
      assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and&#xD;
      preliminary clinical activity of FHD-609 given intravenously in subjects with advanced&#xD;
      synovial sarcoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an ascending multiple dose clinical trial with expansion arms. It is primarily&#xD;
      intended to evaluate the safety and tolerability of FHD-609 when administered intravenously&#xD;
      to subjects with advanced synovial sarcoma. The Dose Escalation Phase will allow for the&#xD;
      determination of the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and/or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced synovial sarcoma. This study will also evaluate the PK/PD profiles of&#xD;
      multiple dose administration of FHD-609.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Dose Expansion Phase will allow a more robust evaluation of the safety profile of&#xD;
      FHD-609, including less frequent toxicities and an assessment of anti-tumor activity. The&#xD;
      data from this study in subjects with advanced synovial sarcoma, including safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, PK/PD findings, and anti-tumor activity, will form the basis for subsequent&#xD;
      clinical development of FHD-609&#xD;
