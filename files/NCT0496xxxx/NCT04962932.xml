  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate if internet- delivered cognitive behavior therapy (CBT),&#xD;
      based on exposure principles and behavioral activation, improves QoL and symptom burden in&#xD;
      patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF), controlling for expectancy of improvement&#xD;
      and attention from a caregiver, using an active control group (stress management). The study&#xD;
      will include 260 patients with symptomatic AF despite optimal medical treatment in accordance&#xD;
      with current guidelines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat)&#xD;
      affecting 3% of the population. AF is associated with poor quality of life (QoL) and large&#xD;
      costs for society. In a considerable proportion of patients, AF symptoms (e.g., palpitations,&#xD;
      fatigue, and chest pain) are not alleviated by current medical or interventional treatments.&#xD;
      Psychological factors can worsen AF symptoms, and anxiety and depression are common among AF&#xD;
      patients. Symptom preoccupation and avoidance of social and physical activities are likely to&#xD;
      play important roles in the development of anxiety, depression, disability and healthcare&#xD;
      utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to evaluate if CBT, based on behavioral activation and exposure principles,&#xD;
      improves wellbeing and QoL in symptomatic AF patients controlling for expectancy of&#xD;
      improvement and attention from a caregiver using an active control group receiving stress&#xD;
      management treatment (SMT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: A randomized controlled trial. Participants are randomized to internet- delivered&#xD;
      exposure-based CBT (N=130) or to SMT (N=130). Participants in both groups receive weekly&#xD;
      therapist support through online written communication. The internet-delivered SMT-treatment&#xD;
      includes life-style advice (e.g., exercise, sleep advice), relaxation and problem-solving&#xD;
      skills to reduce stress. Both treatments lasts 10 weeks and are comparable regarding number&#xD;
      of treatment modules, treatment burden and attention from the treating psychologist.&#xD;

    <description>Internet-delivered CBT over 10 weeks The CBT treatment lasts for 10 weeks and includes the following: Education on the role of anxiety on cardiac function and the effects of symptom preoccupation and avoidance QoL and depression in AF, creating a vicious cycle; exposure to physical sensations that are similar to AF symptoms (e.g.,palpitations due to physical activity or stress) to reduce fear of these symptoms; exposure to situations or activities previously avoided and abolishment of behaviors that aim to control symptoms; and behavioral activation aiming to increase social and physical activity and reduce depressive symptoms. Therapist support is provided at least once weekly through the platform developed for the purpose. Therapists are trained CBT-psychologists.</description>
