  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial evaluates the best dose, potential benefits, and/or side effects of&#xD;
      erdafitinib in combination with enfortumab vedotin in treating patients with bladder cancer&#xD;
      that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) and possesses genetic alterations in&#xD;
      FGFR2/3 genes. Erdafitinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by&#xD;
      blocking the action of an abnormal FGFR protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This&#xD;
      may help keep cancer cells from growing and may kill them. Enfortumab vedotin is a monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody, enfortumab, linked to an anticancer drug called vedotin. Enfortumab attaches to a&#xD;
      protein called nectin-4 on cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them.&#xD;
      It is a type of antibody-drug conjugate. Giving erdafitinib in combination with enfortumab&#xD;
      vedotin may shrink or stabilize metastatic bladder cancer with alterations in FGFR 2/3 genes.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the feasibility and safety of erdafitinib when combined with enfortumab&#xD;
      vedotin (EV) for patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) harboring FGFR2/3&#xD;
      activating genomic alterations who are progressing following platinum-based chemotherapy and&#xD;
      PD1/L1 inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)&#xD;
      of EV when combined with erdafitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To observe and record overall response rate&#xD;
      (ORR). III. To observe and record duration of response (DOR). IV. To observe and record&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS). V. To observe and record overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess association of tumor PD-L1 and nectin-4 protein expression with response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Use commercial tissue next generation sequencing (NGS) assay to confirm FGFR status as&#xD;
      well as to describe the genomic landscape of metastatic UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess genomic changes by circulating tumor (ct)-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) assessment&#xD;
      to study mechanisms of resistance with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess pharmacokinetic (PK) of monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) and erdafitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of enfortumab vedotin in combination with fixed dose&#xD;
      erdafitinib followed by a dose-expansion study of the drug combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive erdafitinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and enfortumab vedotin&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone an ophthalmologic examination and have no active eye&#xD;
             disease which would be likely to increase the risk of eye toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of erdafitinib and enfortumab vedotin on the developing human fetus are&#xD;
             unknown. For this reason and because FGFR inhibitors and humanized antibody-drug&#xD;

             must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and 3&#xD;
             months after completion of erdafitinib and enfortumab vedotin administration. Should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men&#xD;
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 5 months after&#xD;
             completion of erdafitinib and enfortumab vedotin administration&#xD;
&#xD;
