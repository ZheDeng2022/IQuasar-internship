    <description>All patients will begin treatment at a dose of 0.5 mg of setmelanotide per day. Patients will then increase their dose by 0.5 mg increments, every 2 weeks. The dose of setmelanotide used in this study will be based on the weight bands for the 2- to &lt;6-year-old patients to ensure the exposure is similar to that observed for adults dosed at 2 to 3 mg setmelanotide once daily. The highest dose in this study for patients who weigh &lt;20 kg, 20 to &lt;30 kg, 30 to &lt;40 kg and ≥40 kg will be 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.5 mg and 2.0 mg per day.</description>

             lesions identified during screening will be biopsied and results known to be benign&#xD;
             prior to enrollment. If the pre-treatment biopsy results are of concern, the patient&#xD;
             may need to be excluded from the study.&#xD;
