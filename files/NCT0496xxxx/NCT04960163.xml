  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ACLF and cirrhotic patient have deranged coagulation parameters and this coagulation&#xD;
      parameters altered when this group of patients undergoing dialysis because of renal failure.&#xD;
      this group of patients is also high risk of sepsis. Most common organ involved during sepsis&#xD;
      leading to organ failure is renal. So, all this cascade increases the risk of bleeding as&#xD;
      well as coagulation failure. Currently there are no studies evaluation the coagulation status&#xD;
      in patients with cirrhosis undergoing dialysis. Further there are no studies evaluating the&#xD;
      utility of these global tests of coagulation as a guide to judicious blood transfusion in&#xD;
      these patients to prevent bleeding. Further there are no studies comparing the two different&#xD;
      modalities of assessment.&#xD;

      METHODOLOGY Aim: The incidence and predictors of bleeding diathesis development due to DIC in&#xD;
      cirrhosis and ACLF patients undergoing CRRT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: Development of bleeding diathesis within 3 days [ e.g-bleeding/ooze from access&#xD;
      sites, GI bleeding (blood in ryles tube, hematemesis's, melena, bleeding PR), bleed form ET&#xD;
      tube site, bleed form nose/mouth or any other site]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the following factors as predictors of bleeding diathesis within 3 days:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Severity of liver disease: CTP, MELD, MELD-Na, APACHE, SOFA, AARC, lactate,&#xD;
                ammonia, [baseline and degree of change ,12 hrly,24 ,48 and 72 Hrly]&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Presence and severity of AKI, HE [baseline and degree of change 12 hrly,24,48,72 or&#xD;
                at the detection of bleeding]&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Presence and severity of infections/sepsis [baseline and degree of change 12 hrly&#xD;
                or at the detection of bleeding]&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Complement levels (C3/C4) [baseline and degree of change at day 3 or at the&#xD;
                detection of bleeding]&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Following test of coagulation system [baseline and degree of change 12&#xD;
                hrly,24,48,72 hrly and at the detection of bleeding [ Platelets counts (manual),&#xD;
                PT(INR), Prothrombin index, aPTT, Factor VIII/vWF , Fibrinogen, d-Dimer, FDP, DIC&#xD;
                score)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ROTEM (EXTEM,FIBTEM,APTEM,INTEM)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Type and dose vasopressors (NA, vaso, Terlipressin, somat, phenylep)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hemodynamic parameters [pulse, BP, Lung water, SVV, SVR, CO/CI] optional&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CRRT parameters [type of dialysate, membrane, flow,]&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Survival by day 7&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Patients with cirrhosis or ACLF undergoing CRRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be conducted on patients admitted to Department of Hepatology from May&#xD;
           2021 to Aug 2021 at ILBS, New Delhi&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study group will comprise of patients with cirrhosis undergoing dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size with Justification: There are no previous study to determine the bleeding risk in&#xD;
      ACLF or cirrhotic patient undergoing CRRT therapy so this is the pilot study so taking first&#xD;
      40 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: There are no intervention arm. its prospective trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and assessment: Investigator will be monitoring any bleeding epiosdes during the&#xD;
      CRRT and in case there are any bleeding risk the coagulation factors based upon ROTEM and&#xD;
      correct the coagulation abnormalties will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All variables shall be expressed in median (range)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Variables will be compared by Mann- Whitney U test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For Categorical variables we will use Chi-Square or Fisher's test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival analysis will be done using cox-proportional regression analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actuarial probability of survival shall be calculated by Kaplan- Meier graph and compared by&#xD;
      log- rank test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Effects: increase risk of bleeding during CRRT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping rule of Study: in case of bleeding not controlled with coagulation correction or&#xD;
      patient become hemodynamically unstable , negative consent for the further course of&#xD;
      treatment then study will be stopped .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcome of the project-.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence of dialysis related bleeding in first 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess correlation of ROTEM abnormalities with risk of clinically significant&#xD;
           bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the need and volume of FFP, Cryoprecipitate, platelet and packed red blood&#xD;
           cell transfusion based on ROTEM pre- and post-procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Incidence of transfusion associated lung injury and circulatory overload in both groups&#xD;
           at 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Incidence of infections (Time frame first 24 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Incidence of infections and bleeding in first 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Duration of hospital or ICU stay in both groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. 7 day mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ROTEM would be done pre-procedure to assess the coagulation status for all patients enrolled&#xD;
      and subsequently post procedure and in case of bleeding, after transfusion at 12 hours and 24&#xD;
      hours, 48 and 72 hours respectively. Other standard blood tests would be done including&#xD;
      record of mean arterial pressures, CBC, KFT, LFT, PT/INR, arterial ammonia, lactate, serum&#xD;
      procalcitonin as required. In case of presence or absence of active bleed FFPs,&#xD;
      Cryoprecipitate, platelets will be transfused depending upon the coagulation parameters as&#xD;
      assessed by ROTEM .&#xD;
