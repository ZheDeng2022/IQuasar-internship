      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim I: Test the efficacy of a mindfulness-based text messaging program for smoking cessation&#xD;
      (&quot;iQuit Mindfully&quot;), both as a standalone intervention and in combination with in-person&#xD;
      counseling; and Aim II: Investigate the mechanisms through which mindfulness training impacts&#xD;
      smoking cessation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 2 X 2 randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of the iQuit&#xD;
      Mindfully text messaging program, both as a standalone intervention and in combination with&#xD;
      in-person counseling (Mindfulness-based Addiction Treatment; MBAT), compared to usual care.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to one of four groups based on assignment to iQuit Mindfully&#xD;
      text messages (yes/no) and in-person MBAT (yes/no):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Usual Care (self-help materials + nicotine patch and nicotine lozenge treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MBAT (8 weekly virtual MBAT sessions + self-help materials + nicotine patch and nicotine&#xD;
           lozenge treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  iQuit Mindfully (iQuit Mindfully text messages + self-help materials + nicotine patch&#xD;
           and nicotine lozenge treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MBAT + iQuit Mindfully (8 weekly virtual MBAT sessions + iQuit Mindfully text messages +&#xD;
           self-help materials + nicotine patch and nicotine lozenge treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will receive self-help smoking cessation materials, including the&#xD;
      &quot;Clearing the Air&quot; booklet developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and a referral to&#xD;
      the Tobacco Cessation Quitline (1-800-QUIT-NOW). All study participants will also receive&#xD;
      nicotine patches and lozenges. Assessments will occur at baseline and weeks 1, 3, 5, and 8.&#xD;
      Follow-up assessments will occur at weeks 12 and 24.&#xD;
