    <textblock>
      This Phase 3, randomized, Double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm, parallel-group,&#xD;
      multicenter study with randomized withdrawal will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and&#xD;
      durability of KBP-5074 in adult participants who have stage 3b/4 chronic kidney disease (CKD)&#xD;
      (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥15 to ≤44 mL/min/1.73 m^2) and uncontrolled&#xD;
      hypertension (systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥140 and &lt;180 mm Hg and taking 2 or more&#xD;
      antihypertensive medications.&#xD;

      Participants in this study will be recruited, screened, and enrolled at approximately 140&#xD;
      study sites globally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of the following periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pretreatment Phase: This will include prescreening assessment and screening period of up&#xD;
           to 4 weeks and 2-week Open-label placebo Run-In period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A 24-week Double-blind Treatment Period (Randomization to Week 24) will include: An&#xD;
           initial 12-week (Randomization to Week 12) and second 12-week (Week 12 to Week 24)&#xD;
           treatment period and a second 12-week treatment period (Week 12 to Week 24), during both&#xD;
           the periods study drug will be titrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A 24-week Open-label Treatment Period (Week 24 to Week 48) during which eligible&#xD;
           participants will receive Open-label KBP-5074.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A 4-week Randomized Double-blind Withdrawal Period (Week 48 to Week 52) during which&#xD;
           eligible participants will be randomized to continue their current KBP-5074 dose at the&#xD;
           end of Open-label treatment or receive matching placebo for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A 4-week post-treatment Follow-Up Period (Week 52 to Week 56).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During, 24-week Double-blind Treatment Period, 24-week Open-label Treatment Period, and at&#xD;
      4-week Randomized Double-blind Withdrawal Period, the background antihypertensive medications&#xD;
      change may or may not be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Double-blind Treatment Period, eligible participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to KBP-5074 0.25 mg or matching placebo once daily (QD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Randomized Double-blind Withdrawal Period, participants who meet the randomized&#xD;
      withdrawal criteria will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to continue their current&#xD;
      KBP-5074 dose at the end of the Open-label Treatment Period or matching placebo QD.&#xD;
