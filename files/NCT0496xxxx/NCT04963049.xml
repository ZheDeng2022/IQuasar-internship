  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to explore whether using a surgical facemask impacts performance&#xD;
      in response exercise below vs. above the ventilatory threshold (VT). The investigatores also&#xD;
      aim to explore the impact of sexual dimorphism in the physiological response to exercise&#xD;
      performed within these specific intensities. Finally, the onvestigators intend to examine&#xD;
      whether the effects of wearing a facemask affect physiological recovery at cessation of&#xD;
      exercise&#xD;

      Tests will be carried out during the afternoon period (between 13.00 and 16.00 h), in a&#xD;
      laboratory with an environmental temperature between 22 and 24 ºC and a relative humidity&#xD;
      between 44 and 56%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be tested on 3 non-consecutive days. On the first day, a Graded&#xD;
      Exercise Testin (GXT) will be performed, to measure VO2max and to enable the&#xD;
      individualization of intensities according to the VT of each participant. (Silva et al.,&#xD;
      2011). Then, in a randomized (computer generated algorithm) counterbalanced manner, all&#xD;
      participants performed resting and standardized cycle-ergometer submaximal protocols on two&#xD;
      different conditions (with and without facemask), within a 1-week period. On the first visit,&#xD;
      body mass measurements will be taken, to the nearest 0.01 kg, on a digital scale (BG 42,&#xD;
      Breuer GmbH, Söflinger, Germany) with the participants wearing light-weight clothes and no&#xD;
      shoes. Measurements of standing height will be limited to the first visit and taken to the&#xD;
      nearest 0.5 cm using a stadiometer. Body Mass index (BMI) will be calculated by dividing the&#xD;
      participants' mass in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. Then, after a brief&#xD;
      warm-up period, each participant will perform a maximal cycle-ergometer test consisting of a&#xD;
      ramp protocol to volitional exhaustion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of our purposes is to determine the impact of exercising with a facemask on physiological&#xD;
      recovery. For this reason, measurements, within each submaximal testing session (with and&#xD;
      without a facemask), will be taken using a standardized timeline designed to allow measuring&#xD;
      recovery postsubmaximal exercise and compare it with a resting baseline time point.&#xD;
      Specifically, testing will begin with a 10-min resting period in the seated position&#xD;
      (baseline). Subsequently, participants will exercise either without (control) or with&#xD;
      (experimental) a surgical facemask at an intensity below the VT and recover for another 10&#xD;
      min. Then, each participant will exercise at an intensity above the VT until volitional&#xD;
      exhaustion and this will be followed by 10 min of recovery.&#xD;
