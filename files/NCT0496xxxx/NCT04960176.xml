  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to develop, describe in detail and validate a feasible, cheap&#xD;
      and convenient non-invasive sham acupuncture technique in order to use safely and repeatedly&#xD;
      in future studies. Additionally, the reactions of the volunteers to sham needles in different&#xD;
      positions and in different parts of the body will be investigated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following the Second World War, the evidence based research is the keystone of modern&#xD;
      medicine applications. Randomized, placebo controlled and double/triple blinded clinical&#xD;
      studies are the sine qua non of evidence based medicine. As a matter of course acupuncture&#xD;
      which was defined as traditional and the main outcome was the clinical effects throughout the&#xD;
      centuries, had its share form the tremendous evolution. For the past decades, studies on&#xD;
      acupuncture are designed and prosecuted on the basis of randomized and placebo controlled&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical trials for invasive modalities, placebo is the procedure that mimics the original&#xD;
      procedure in order to provide objective comparison. These procedures are called as sham&#xD;
      techniques and in acupuncture sham techniques are divided into two categories as invasive&#xD;
      sham procedures and non-invasive sham procedures. Non-invasive sham is a technique that is&#xD;
      designed to create a minor sensory stimulation in the absence of skin penetration using a&#xD;
      placebo needle or any device imitating needle. In acupuncture practice it is a fact that sham&#xD;
      procedures are non-inert and even can exert high therapeutic effect. Consequently, the main&#xD;
      concern regarding the randomized controlled trials on acupuncture is that false negative&#xD;
      rates might be misleadingly higher than acceptable values. The clinical therapeutic effects&#xD;
      of non-invasive techniques are attributed to the activation of physiologic endogen systems&#xD;
      due to the belief that acupuncture was applied although it was only sham. Non-invasive&#xD;
      techniques need to be used in clinical trials designed to discriminate this mentioned effect&#xD;
      from the point-specific effects of real acupuncture and non-specific effects obtained by skin&#xD;
      penetration in invasive sham techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fact that sham techniques used in clinical studies are far from standardization&#xD;
      inevitably increase the false negativity rates. In fact there are various techniques about&#xD;
      non-invasive sham acupuncture. Blunted needles or plastic guide tube, nail, pencil point&#xD;
      probe or even wooden skewers were used. Techniques are not described most of the time and&#xD;
      majority of the studies lack standardization and validation of the non-invasive sham&#xD;
      technique that is used. There are standard Park and Steinberger needles which were developed&#xD;
      privately for non-invasive sham procedures. The advantage these latter needles is that the&#xD;
      patient cannot see the application of the needle. Otherwise as in all non-invasive sham&#xD;
      technique the needles do not penetrate the skin, the patient does not get the de chi&#xD;
      sensation and the stimulation of the needles is not possible.&#xD;
