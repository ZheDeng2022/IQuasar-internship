      This project will observe and follow up the changes of pulmonary function and CT in patients&#xD;
      with smoking combined with pulmonary tuberculosis, and measure the ratio of Th1 cells, Th17&#xD;
      cells, macrophages and neutrophils and the secretion of factors such as TNF-α, IFN-γ and&#xD;
      IL-17 in pulmonary blood and alveolar lavage fluid.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and tuberculosis are major global health&#xD;
      problems, and acquired and acquired immunity play an important role in COPD and tuberculosis,&#xD;
      and there is an interaction between COPD and tuberculosis, but the exact mechanism is not&#xD;
      clear. Pre-existing TB infection is an independent risk factor for COPD and can aggravate&#xD;
      pulmonary function and increase hospitalization and mortality in COPD patients. In COPD&#xD;
      patients, Th1 and Th17 cells are involved in the development of COPD and emphysema through&#xD;
      activation of macrophages and recruitment of neutrophils, while matrix metalloproteinases&#xD;
      (MMPs) of macrophage and neutrophil origin are involved in the formation of tuberculosis&#xD;
      cavities, and cytokines such as TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-17 are involved in the mechanism of their&#xD;
      destruction, IL-17 restricts the expression of HIF-1α to inhibit the development of TB&#xD;
      granulomas, and CT analysis revealed that combined TB exacerbates emphysema in COPD patients.&#xD;
      The above evidence suggests that tuberculosis plays an important role in the formation of&#xD;
      emphysema in COPD. In this project, we will observe and follow up the changes of pulmonary&#xD;
      function and CT in patients with smoking combined with pulmonary tuberculosis, and examine&#xD;
      the ratio of Th1 cells, Th17 cells, macrophages and neutrophils and the secretion of TNF-α,&#xD;
      IFN-γ, and IL-17 in pulmonary blood and alveolar lavage fluid.&#xD;
