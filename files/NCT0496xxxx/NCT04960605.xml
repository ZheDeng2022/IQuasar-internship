  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Sjögren's Syndrome (PSS) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease primarily&#xD;
      involving the salivary and lacrimal glands. Few data exist regarding survival and success&#xD;
      rate of dental implants in patients with PSS. Although a previous study suggest lower success&#xD;
      rate for dental implants we hypothesize that dental implants have similar survival and&#xD;
      success rate in PSS as healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the long-term survival and success rate of&#xD;
      dental implants in patients with PSS compared to the healthy controls.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sjögren's syndrome (SS) affects about 5% of population worldwide. Patients with Primary&#xD;
      Sjögren's Syndrome (PSS) have dry mouth, oral mucosal problems, increased dental decay and&#xD;
      problems wearing dentures. A retrospective case series indicated that implant survival rate&#xD;
      may be reduced among SS patients. Furthermore, there is lack of scientific evidence to&#xD;
      support success or failure of dental implants in SS-patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis is that the outcome of implant treatment after 5 years is similar in&#xD;
      patients with primary Sjögren's Syndrome (pSS) compared to matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants with PSS fulfilled the Copenhagen Criteria and/or the US-EU criteria for&#xD;
      PSS, miss at least one tooth and have sufficient bone volume for a single implant insertion&#xD;
      without bone augmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of PSS patients was done via own existing databases on PSS patients as well as&#xD;
      repeated national announcements in the Danish Dental Journal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We included 24 consecutive participants with PSS. For each participant with PSS (test group),&#xD;
      an age, gender, and tooth-type matched healthy participant (control group) was enrolled&#xD;
      (n=24).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical part of the implant treatment was carried out by two experienced maxillofacial&#xD;
      surgeons. Straumann implants (Straumann Bone level Roxolid®) with a hydrophilic sandblasted,&#xD;
      acid etched implant surface (SLActive) was used for all participants. If more than one&#xD;
      implant was placed, the study implant was determined according to a randomization scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inserted implants were allowed to heal for 3 months before the prosthetic part, which was&#xD;
      carried out by two experienced prostodontists. The same prosthetic material and method was&#xD;
      applied for all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants were recalled for baseline (2 months after prosthetic loading) and 1, 3 and&#xD;
      5 years examination, where the biological (marginal bone level, inflammation etc.), technical&#xD;
      (fractures, loosening's etc.), esthetic (Copenhagen Index score) and patient-reported (Oral&#xD;
      Health Impact Profile questionnaire/OHIP-49) assessments were performed.&#xD;
