    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multi-cohort study to investigate safety, anti-tumor activity of the&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody BGB A317 in combination with Anlotinib and standard chemotherapy as&#xD;
      first-line treatment in Gastric, or Gastroesophageal Junction Carcinoma. The study includes a&#xD;
      screening (up to 28 days), treatment (until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or&#xD;
      treatment withdrawal for another reason), safety follow-up (up to 30 days following last&#xD;
      study drug treatment), and survival follow-up phase.&#xD;
