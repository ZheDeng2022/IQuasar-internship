      Background/Rationale: Prostate cancer(PC)is the second most frequent cancer diagnosis made in&#xD;
      men and the fifth leading cause of death worldwide(1). Variations in the incidence rates&#xD;
      world wide reflect differences in multiple epidemiological variables depending on the&#xD;
      different regions. It is known that in Central America is the leading cause of cancer death&#xD;
      in men. For South America, it is the second cause of cancer death and the third in North&#xD;
      America(2). Estimations from 2012 from Brazil reported over 60,000 new cases. While in 2017&#xD;
      the United States (US) reported more than 160,000 new cases, represent in gone in five&#xD;
      diagnosis of cancer in men (3-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)has been reported in several&#xD;
      studies in various regions of the world, but unfortunately in Latin America data are&#xD;
      incomplete. A comprehensive systematic review including 71,179 patients observed for up to 12&#xD;
      years, indicated that 10.0-20.0% of PC patients developed CRPC within approximately five&#xD;
      years of follow-up. Over 84.0% of them had metastases present at the time of CRPC diagnosis,&#xD;
      and 33.0% of those without metastases at diagnosis developed them within two years (3,4).&#xD;
      Currently, patients with metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) have an overall survival rate between 9 and&#xD;
      13 months and is associated with bone metastases and poor quality of life (3.7). The negative&#xD;
      prognosis of mCRPC may be associated in part with few and limited therapeutic options. In the&#xD;
      past decade, there have been few new treatment options for this group of patients becoming an&#xD;
      unmet need, but the development of targeted therapies and the application of PCD-damaged DNA&#xD;
      repair mutation detection (DDR) tests allow patient classification and offer them important&#xD;
      treatment options, particularly in advanced stages of the disease where current options are&#xD;
      limited (8,9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and Hypotheses Primary Objective: Determine the prevalence of homologous&#xD;
      recombination repair (HRR) gene mutations in participants with mCRPC in Latin America(LatAm)&#xD;
      between February 2021 and January 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of the mCRPC participants with HRR&#xD;
           gene mutations in LatAm between February 2021 and January 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Describe the association between demographic and clinical characteristics, and the&#xD;
           prevalence of HRR gene mutations in participants with mCRPC per LatAm country between&#xD;
           February 2021 and January 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No hypothesis will be considered for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A cross-sectional, non-interventional, multicenter study to determine the&#xD;
      prevalence of HRR gene mutations in participants with metastatic castration-resistant&#xD;
      prostate cancer in LatAm. The study will be performed in reference centers for the attention&#xD;
      of mCRPC patients in LatAm countries (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Panama&#xD;
      and Peru). The study will select participants with mCRPC diagnosed between February 2021 and&#xD;
      January 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During screening visit, consecutive eligible participants who have been diagnosed with mCRPC&#xD;
      will be invited to participate, and after consent, their demographic in formation and history&#xD;
      of cancer data will be collected. Archived FFPE tumor blocks (tissue sample)from eligible&#xD;
      participants will be requested from the local pathology laboratory and used for HRR mutation&#xD;
      testing. A blood sample will be taken from each participant enrolled in the study&#xD;
      independently of the FFPE availability-. Although blood sample must be available for testing&#xD;
      under the algorithm of this protocol, not all blood samples will be processed and/ or&#xD;
      analyzed. After checking FFPE tissue availability Pathologist will perform an assessment in&#xD;
      order to check sample quality. If pathology assessment of FFPE sample accomplishes sample&#xD;
      quality requirements tissue will be cut in 5um slices and 15 to 20 slides will be provided to&#xD;
      reference laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After NGS sequencing and complete analyses are performed for each sample, reporting will be&#xD;
      performed signed from Laboratory main investigator. Reporting will be delivered to&#xD;
      Participant ́s Center and Physician will report the results to each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' medical records will be reviewed for data relevant to mCRPC diagnosis,&#xD;
      including basic demographic information, medical history, and treatment history.&#xD;
      Approximately 390 patients will be enrolled in this study. It is anticipated that&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled at eight sites in multiple countries, including Argentina,&#xD;
      Brazil, Colombia, CostaRica, Mexico, Panama and Peru(Panama and Costa Rica, and Colombia and&#xD;
      Peru are considered as clusters).The maximum duration of the study is expected to be&#xD;
      12months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Source(s):To perform HRR mutation testing, archival FFPE biopsy tissue samples from&#xD;
      primary or metastatic tumor will be used. HRR genes according to provider ́s protocol. FFPE&#xD;
      slides and blood samples will be analysed using New Generation Sequencing (NGS) at one&#xD;
      central analytics laboratory (reference laboratory) in each country. Each reference&#xD;
      laboratory will perform HRR mutation testing and report mutation status of each of the genes&#xD;
      included in the test according to the procedure established by the HRR mutation testing&#xD;
      manufacturer. Variants classification will be performed according ACMG guidelines. All&#xD;
      demographic&#xD;
      informationandhistoryofcancerdata(includingprevioustreatments)fromparticipantswill be&#xD;
      collected in retrospective manner using patient medical records. Data will be entered in the&#xD;
      electronic forms. The principal investigator will be responsible for ensuring that all&#xD;
      required data are collected and entered into the electronic forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population :Study population will be the diagnosed castration resistant metastatic&#xD;
      prostate cancer patients in the selected countries from February 2021 and January 2022..It is&#xD;
      estimated that approximately 390 patients will be enrolled&#xD;
