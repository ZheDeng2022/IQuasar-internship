      This study is a prospective,multicenter,non-interventional real-world study.The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to observe the clinical status of infection patients under standardized&#xD;
      application of antibacterial/anitifungal drugs,and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      anti-infection treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study plans to enroll 5000 hospitalized patients (≥ 18 years old with infectious&#xD;
      disease),who take antibacterial/anitifungal drugs for more than 3 days. Patients mainly come&#xD;
      from ICU,Respiratory Department and Hematology Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical data collection is divided into five parts,including Baseline,3rd and 7th day&#xD;
      after the first dosing of antibacterial/anitifungal drugs,End of antibacterial/anitifungal&#xD;
      drugs treatment (EOT),14th day after EOT. The collected clinical data cover general&#xD;
      characteristics,condition assessment and severity evaluation,pathogenic diagnosis,the use of&#xD;
      antibacterial/antifungal drugs,antibacterial/antifungal drugs-related adverse events,et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the collection of case data, the proportion analysis, efficacy evaluation&#xD;
      and safety evaluation for the standardized application of antibacterial/antifungal drugs will&#xD;
      be carried out.&#xD;
