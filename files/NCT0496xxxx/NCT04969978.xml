      This phase IV clinical trial determines the impact of implementing a Quitline electronic&#xD;
      (e)Referral system with an enhanced academic detailing implementation strategy on Quitline&#xD;
      reach, smoking cessation assistance and self-reported quit rates among patients in community&#xD;
      health centers. It also examines the cost-effectiveness of Quitline eReferrals both with and&#xD;
      without enhanced academic detailing. If this implementation strategy is effective, this&#xD;
      strategy could be used to increase smoking cessation treatment through the collaboration&#xD;
      between state Quitlines and community health centers that serve large numbers of&#xD;
      socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Implement a Quitline electronic (e)Referral system with enhanced academic detailing (AD)&#xD;
      (intervention; n=10 community health centers [CHCs]) and without enhanced AD (comparison;&#xD;
      n=10 CHCs) to compare rates of eReferral offers, eReferral acceptance, Quitline enrollment,&#xD;
      orders for smoking cessation medication, and receipt of in-clinic counseling among patients&#xD;
      identified as current smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess the effectiveness of implementing a Quitline eReferral system with enhanced AD&#xD;
      (intervention) versus without enhanced AD (comparison) on self-reported smoking quit rates&#xD;
      among all patients identified as current smokers, and among a subset who enroll in Quitline&#xD;
      services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Estimate the total annual costs and incremental cost-effectiveness of a Quitline&#xD;
      eReferral system, with and without enhanced AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Clinics are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Clinics are notified via email that the eReferral system is available with a link to&#xD;
      an online publication that includes an overview of Quitline services, information on Quitline&#xD;
      effectiveness, and a detailed eReferral workflow with corresponding electronic health record&#xD;
      (EHR) screenshots, including how to identify eligible patients, create an eReferral, and&#xD;
      access Quitline follow-up data in the EHR. Clinics also gain access to technological&#xD;
      assistance, as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Clinics receive standard online materials and access to remote technological&#xD;
      assistance as in Arm I. Clinics also receive group training of clinic staff prior to&#xD;
      activation of the Quitline eReferral system and 12 months post-activation, follow-up booster&#xD;
      sessions, written training materials for all providers and staff, including new hires, and&#xD;
      monthly performance audit and feedback.&#xD;
