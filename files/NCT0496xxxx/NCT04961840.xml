  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect information on pregnant women diagnosed with constipation from their&#xD;
      health care insurance claims records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will include the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those who took prucalopride.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those who took other medicines for constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those who did not take any prescription medicines for constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the study is to assess the risk of major birth defects with the mother's use&#xD;
      of prucalopride during the first 3 months of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study uses existing health care insurance information; participants are not enrolled,&#xD;
      treated, or required to visit the doctor during this study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women with constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Maternal coverage by health care and prescriptions insurance during eligibility&#xD;
             period:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Live births: 90 days prior to the last menstrual period until 30 days&#xD;
                  post-delivery;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  abortions (spontaneous abortions): from 180 days prior to the first code for&#xD;
                  abortion to 30 days after this diagnosis;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  stillbirths: from 180 days prior to the first code for stillbirth to 30 days&#xD;
                  after this diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For infant outcomes, the cohort will be restricted to pregnancies with linked&#xD;
             offspring.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For major malformations, only pregnancies with livebirths will be included, since&#xD;
             information regarding the pathology results from a pregnancy loss or the indication&#xD;
             for termination is rarely recorded. In addition, infants are required to have full&#xD;
             insurance coverage from delivery to at least 90 days after the delivery, unless the&#xD;
             infant died prior to the end of the 90 days, in which case a shorter eligibility&#xD;
             period until death is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the analyses of pregnancy losses, the cohort also includes pregnancies ending in&#xD;
             spontaneous abortion, stillbirth and any livebirth (linked or unlinked to a delivery).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Termination of pregnancy will be identified but excluded from analyses (since&#xD;
             malformations are rarely coded and these pregnancies will not be at risk for other&#xD;
             outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancies in which prucalopride is dispensed in the 3 months prior to the LMP but&#xD;
             not during the first trimester (to ensure that there is not misclassification of the&#xD;
             non-exposed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women with opioids dispensed in the 3 months prior to LMP or during the first&#xD;
             trimester (to exclude potential opioid-induced constipation) and women with&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel diseases (because they are a contraindication)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For major malformations, the cohort excludes pregnancies with a chromosomal&#xD;
             abnormality based on at least one inpatient or outpatient ICD-9 code for&#xD;
             758.xx,759.81-759.83, or 655.1x within 90 days after delivery in the infant and/or&#xD;
             maternal claims.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For major malformations, pregnancies with outpatient exposure to definite teratogens&#xD;
             including warfarin, antineoplastic agents, isotretinoin, misoprostol, and thalidomide&#xD;
             from LMP through LMP plus 90 days (that is, days of exposure overlap with 1st&#xD;
             trimester).&#xD;
