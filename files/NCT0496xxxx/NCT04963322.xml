  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By confirming the incidence of biliary tract complications in adult patients aged 18 years or&#xD;
      older who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation , and measuring the duration of&#xD;
      application of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, drugs administered during the application&#xD;
      period of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, duration of fasting period, duration of total&#xD;
      intravenous nutrition, and plasma bilirubin concentration, the researchers will try to find&#xD;
      risk factors of biliary tract complications in patients receiving extracorporeal membrane&#xD;
      oxygenation. Clinically, the researchers will check whether there are modifiable risk factors&#xD;
      in patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is an important method for the management of severe&#xD;
      refractory heart and lung dysfunction, and improvements in extracorporeal membrane&#xD;
      oxygenation equipment and increased experience have made it possible to use it for a long&#xD;
      time. However, complications following extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are very common,&#xD;
      and mortality and morbidity are high. When extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is applied,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal bleeding may occur due to stress, ischemia, or bleeding tendency, and direct&#xD;
      secondary bilirubin elevation and gallstone formation may occur secondary to long-term&#xD;
      fasting, total intravenous nutrition, hemolysis, and diuretics. In intensive care patients,&#xD;
      acalculous cholecystitis can progress with multiple organ failure and is known to be&#xD;
      associated with prolonged ICU stay and high mortality. However, there is no report on whether&#xD;
      the incidence of cholecystitis, risk factors, direct elevation of bilirubin, and&#xD;
      cholelithiasis in patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation progresses to&#xD;
      symptomatic cholecystitis.&#xD;
