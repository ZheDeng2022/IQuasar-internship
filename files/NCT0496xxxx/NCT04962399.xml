  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, the early diagnosis ability of diabetic nephropathy (DKD) is relatively poor,&#xD;
      leading to some missed diagnosis of early disease patients. At the same time, because DKD&#xD;
      patients have complex metabolic disorders, once they develop to end-stage renal disease,&#xD;
      compared with other renal diseases, the treatment of DKD is more difficult and the prognosis&#xD;
      is poor. At present, the main treatment for DKD is to strengthen blood glucose control and&#xD;
      control blood pressure through renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) to delay the&#xD;
      occurrence and development of DKD, but it can not reduce the risk of most patients&#xD;
      progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In recent years, it is becoming a new&#xD;
      therapeutic target for DKD to control the inflammatory response by targeting the inflammatory&#xD;
      factors and inflammatory signaling pathways. Therefore, this study attempts to explore the&#xD;
      correlation between N / OFQ and the occurrence and development of type 2 DKD, and seek new&#xD;
      theoretical basis for the potential treatment of inflammation.&#xD;
