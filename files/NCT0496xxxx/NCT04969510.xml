  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of 10, 20, 40 and 60 mg oral PRAX-114 as adjunctive therapy compared to&#xD;
      placebo in the treatment of adults with MDD who had an inadequate response to their current&#xD;
      antidepressant treatment. A sub-study to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of PRAX-114&#xD;
      and metabolites when dosed in the evening in participants with MDD will be conducted in a&#xD;
      subset of participants at selected research sites with serial PK sampling capabilities.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline in HAM-D17 total score at Day 15</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D17 is a depression rating scale consisting of 17 items; 9 items are scored on a 5-point scale (ranging from 0 to 4), and 8 items are scored on a 3-point scale (ranging from 0 to 2). The total score of the 17 items ranges from 0 to 52 with higher scores indicating greater depression. Therefore, a decrease in the total score or on individual item scores indicates improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in HAM-D17 total score at Day 29</measure>
    <time_frame>29 days</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D17 is a depression rating scale consisting of 17 items; 9 items are scored on a 5-point scale (ranging from 0 to 4), and 8 items are scored on a 3-point scale (ranging from 0 to 2). The total score of the 17 items ranges from 0 to 52 with higher scores indicating greater depression. Therefore, a decrease in the total score or on individual item scores indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in HAM-D17 total score at all other time points</measure>
    <time_frame>4 days, 8 days, 22 days, 36 days, and 43 days</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D17 is a depression rating scale consisting of 17 items; 9 items are scored on a 5-point scale (ranging from 0 to 4), and 8 items are scored on a 3-point scale (ranging from 0 to 2). The total score of the 17 items ranges from 0 to 52 with higher scores indicating greater depression. Therefore, a decrease in the total score or on individual item scores indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score at Day 15 and all other time points</measure>
    <time_frame>4 days, 8 days, 15 days, 22 days, 29 days, 36 days, and 43 days</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S assesses the clinician's impression of the participant's current depression symptoms. The clinician should use his/her total clinical experience with this patient population and rate the current severity of the participant's mental illness on a 7-point scale from 1 (Normal, not at all ill) to 7 (Among the most extremely ill patients).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) score at Day 15 and all other time points</measure>
    <time_frame>4 days, 8 days, 15 days, 22 days, 29 days, 36 days, and 43 days</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I assesses the participant's improvement (or worsening). The clinician is required to assess the participant's condition relative to Baseline (Day 1) on a 7-point scale from 1 (Very much improved) to 7 (Very much worse).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HAM-D17 response (reduction from baseline score of ≥50%) at Day 15, Day 29, and all other time points</measure>

    <description>The HAM-D17 is a depression rating scale consisting of 17 items; 9 items are scored on a 5-point scale (ranging from 0 to 4), and 8 items are scored on a 3-point scale (ranging from 0 to 2). The total score of the 17 items ranges from 0 to 52 with higher scores indicating greater depression. Therefore, a decrease in the total score or on individual item scores indicates improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>4 days, 8 days, 15 days, 22 days, 29 days, 36 days, and 43 days</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D17 is a depression rating scale consisting of 17 items; 9 items are scored on a 5-point scale (ranging from 0 to 4), and 8 items are scored on a 3-point scale (ranging from 0 to 2). The total score of the 17 items ranges from 0 to 52 with higher scores indicating greater depression. Therefore, a decrease in the total score or on individual item scores indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in the Symptoms of Depression Questionnaire (SDQ) total and sub-scale scores at Day 15 and all other time points</measure>
    <time_frame>4 days, 8 days, 15 days, 22 days, 29 days, 36 days, and 43 days</time_frame>
    <description>The SDQ is a 44-item, self-report scale assessing the severity of symptoms across several subtypes of depression. Items are scored on a 7-point scale (ranging from 1 to 6). The SDQ total score is the sum of all 44 item scores and ranges from 44 to 264 with higher scores indicating worse symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression-Improvement (PGI-I) score at Day 15 and all other time points</measure>
    <time_frame>4 days, 8 days, 15 days, 22 days, 29 days, 36 days, and 43 days</time_frame>
    <description>The PGI-I scale is a global self-assessment used to rate the response of a participant's condition to therapy or intervention. It consists of 1 question that asks the participant to rate their current condition compared to how it was prior to beginning treatment on a scale of 1 (very much better) to 7 (very much worse).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) at Day 15 and all other time points</measure>
    <time_frame>4 days, 8 days, 15 days, 22 days, 29 days, 36 days, and 43 days</time_frame>
    <description>The WSAS assesses the degree to which mental health problems interfere with day-to-day functioning in 5 domains: work, social leisure activities, private leisure activities, home- management, and personal relationships. The WSAS total score is the sum of the 5 item scores and ranges from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating poorer adjustment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence and severity of Adverse Events (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>43 days</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial participant, temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of AEs by preferred term</measure>
    <time_frame>43 days</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of AEs will be reported by preferred term, including any terms related to clinically significant changes in body temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), clinical laboratory measures (chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and coagulation), and electrocardiogram parameters (heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, and corrected QT intervals).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) measured suicidal ideation or behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>43 days</time_frame>
    <description>The C-SSRS is composed of 5 yes/no questions addressing suicidal behavior and 5 yes/no questions addressing suicidal ideation, with sub-questions assessing the severity. Incidence is measured as the number of &quot;yes&quot; answers indicating the presence of suicidal ideation or behavior.</description>
