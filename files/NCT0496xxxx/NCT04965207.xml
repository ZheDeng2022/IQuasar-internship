      IVUS will be used to evaluate the ratio of false lumen to occluded segment, the ratio of&#xD;
      false lumen to stent length, the location characteristics of false lumen and its prognostic&#xD;
      value for perioperative complications, 1-year late lumen loss and MACCE events in patients&#xD;
      with coronary CTO.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, novel technologies of CTO interventional therapy become mature. These&#xD;
      technologies usually artificially cause dissection of coronary artery. The events such as&#xD;
      collateral vessel loss, vascular injury and tear, perforation, pericardial tamponade caused&#xD;
      by false lumen may theoretically affect the perioperative and long-term prognosis of&#xD;
      patients. In this study, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) was used to evaluate the&#xD;
      characteristics of true lumen and false lumen in CTO segment, so as to determine its impact&#xD;
      on the prognosis of patients.&#xD;
