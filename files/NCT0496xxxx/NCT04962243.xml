  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore the difference of blood lipid levels between patients with Achilles tendon rupture&#xD;
      and healthy people without Achilles tendon rupture, and to provide clues for further&#xD;
      exploration of its mechanism.&#xD;

      Data were collected from 287 patients with Achilles tendon rupture repaired by Yang Yuping,&#xD;
      deputy chief physician of the Institute of Sports Medicine of Peking University Third&#xD;
      Hospital from January 2017 to December 2017. A total of 10,375 subjects who underwent&#xD;
      physical examination in the Physical Examination Center of Peking University Third Hospital&#xD;
      during the same period were selected as the control group, and 9,193 subjects were selected&#xD;
      as the control group after excluding patients without blood lipid test results, professional&#xD;
      athletes, hypertension and diabetes patients. The general data, blood glucose, blood lipid,&#xD;
      blood uric acid, smoking and alcohol consumption of the subjects were collected through the&#xD;
      hospital information system. The blood glucose, blood lipid, uric acid and other data of the&#xD;
      control group and the Achilles tendon rupture group were detected, and it was concluded that&#xD;
      the blood lipid level of the patients with Achilles tendon rupture group was higher than that&#xD;
      of the control group.&#xD;
