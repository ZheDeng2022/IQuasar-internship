  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The unpredictable nature of the attacks is one of the essential characteristics of bradykinin&#xD;
      angioedema. The two main difficulties for physicians managing a patient with bradykinin&#xD;
      angioedema are to make the diagnosis and anticipate the severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers can be used to diagnose, guide treatment, or predict the severity of a disease.&#xD;
      However, the identification of biomarkers is currently difficult in bradykinin both for&#xD;
      diagnosis and prognosis. While measurement of C4 and C1 inhibitor (quantitative and&#xD;
      functional assays) allows the diagnosis of bradykinin angioedema due to C1 inhibitor&#xD;
      deficiency, whether genetic or acquired, many patients with normal C1 inhibitor bradykinin&#xD;
      angioedema, either hereditary or acquired, are still difficult to diagnose. For patients with&#xD;
      hereditary angioedema with C1-inhibitor deficiency, there is no biomarker currently available&#xD;
      to predict the severity. Any biomarker that could improve the diagnosis on the one hand, and&#xD;
      improve the prediction of the frequency and severity of the response to treatment on the&#xD;
      other hand, would obviously be extremely useful. The aim of our study is to assess the&#xD;
      existence possible biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of bradykinin angioedema.&#xD;
