  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to compare the efficacy of different physical therapy protocols in the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis patients. Patients in this study were randomly&#xD;
      assigned into 3 groups. Group A received ultrasound therapy protocol, group B received radial&#xD;
      shock wave therapy protocol and group C received a combination of both ultrasound therapy and&#xD;
      radial shock wave therapy protocol. All patients were also received Achilles tendon and&#xD;
      plantar fascia stretches. Foot function was evaluated by foot function index and ankle&#xD;
      dorsiflexion range of motion was measured by Baseline® bubble inclinometer at the baseline&#xD;
      and 4 weeks after treatment&#xD;

      Sixty patients having unilateral chronic plantar fasciitis will be recruited for the study&#xD;
      from Al-Qurayyat General Hospital, in Al-Jouf Region, Saudi Arabia. The inclusion criteria&#xD;
      were as follows: patients suffered planter fasciitis of more than 3 months, maximum&#xD;
      tenderness near the medial calcaneal insertion and pain was greater than 4 on visual analogue&#xD;
      scale during taking the first steps in the morning. Patients were excluded if they had&#xD;
      previous ankle or foot surgery or pathology, or if they had a previous history of shock wave&#xD;
      therapy or topical corticosteroid injections to the ankle or foot, circulatory disturbances&#xD;
      in the lower extremities, neuropathic or radicular pain in the lower limbs and pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were randomly assigned into 3 equal groups (n = 20). Group A received ultrasound&#xD;
      therapy protocol using Enraf Nonius Sonoplus 490, Netherlands. Group B received radial shock&#xD;
      wave therapy protocol using Swiss DolorClast® Master, Electro Medical Systems, SA, Nyon,&#xD;
      Switzerland. Group C received a combination of both ultrasound therapy and radial shock wave&#xD;
      therapy protocol. All patients also received a traditional physical therapy program (3&#xD;
      sessions per week, for 4 weeks) consisting of Calf muscles stretching and plantar fascia&#xD;
      stretching. Foot function and Ankle dorsiflexion range of motion were evaluated at the&#xD;
      baseline and 4 weeks after treatment.&#xD;
