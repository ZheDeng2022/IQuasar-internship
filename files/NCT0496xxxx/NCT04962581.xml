    <textblock>
      A prospective descriptive study of the use of an individualized capnography to each lung in&#xD;
      the context of one-lung ventilation achieved with a double-lumen tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Pilot project and proof of concept&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One study suggests a way to predict possible events of hypoxemia (Sat O2 &lt; 90%) during&#xD;
           one lung ventilation (OLV) with the use of two individualized capnography devices on&#xD;
           each lung during two-lung ventilation before inducing OLV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition, a recent presentation in the 2021 Thoracic Anesthesia Symposium suggested&#xD;
           possible benefits of the use of a capnography device on the non-ventilated lung in the&#xD;
           detection of air leaks around the bronchial cuff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The same presentation demonstrated the utility of EtCo2 measurement to determine the&#xD;
           achievement of complete lung collapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With these previous demonstrations, the use of an individualized capnography for each lung&#xD;
      can potentially describe different steps during thoracic surgery. Therefore, a descriptive&#xD;
      prospective study on patients that require thoracic surgery with use of a double lumen tube&#xD;
      is proposed to verify the feasibility of dual capnography during OLV. The use of two&#xD;
      different devices, randomized during our study, will also help to identify the impact of&#xD;
      different air aspiration levels on our measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such results will allow to put forward prospective projects to help to optimize OLV during&#xD;
      thoracic surgeries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thoracic surgery (excluding cardiac surgery) requires lung isolation and one-lung ventilation&#xD;
      (OLV) to achieve unilateral lung collapse in order to complete the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-lung ventilation requires the use of pulmonary isolation techniques. Two main isolation&#xD;
      techniques are used by clinicians: double-lumen tubes (DLT) and bronchial blockers (BB).&#xD;
      Bronchial blockers are less used than DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-thoracic interventions and consequently one-lung ventilation, are achieved in a lateral&#xD;
      decubitus, with the positioning of the operated hemi-thorax exposed. The most dreaded&#xD;
      complication during OLV is hypoxemia, which is defined as the desaturation in the patient's&#xD;
      oxygen (SpO2 under 90%). The primary goal of one-lung ventilation is to achieve a rapid and&#xD;
      complete lung collapse of the operated lung&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung collapse is a technique that is well mastered and for which the investigators have&#xD;
      contributed significantly regarding its execution in our five of our most recent studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a presentation during the 2021 Thoracic Anesthesia Symposium raised our curiosity&#xD;
      regarding the induction of lung collapse (1) This presentation detailed the relevance and&#xD;
      possible benefits of adding a capnography on the isolated non-ventilated lung. According to&#xD;
      the authors, the capnography of the non-ventilated lung could potentially detect air leaks&#xD;
      towards the non-ventilated lung around the bronchial cuff and indicate the occurrence of&#xD;
      complete lung collapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, an observational study demonstrated the utility of individualized capnography on&#xD;
      each lung during thoracic surgery with DLT (2). The measure of the exhaled CO2 gradient&#xD;
      between both lungs in a lateral decubitus position before one-lung ventilation could help&#xD;
      predict the oxygenation level during the subsequent one-lung ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The capnography is a tool that is used to monitor continuously the concentration of CO2 that&#xD;
      is inhaled and exhaled by intubated patients during general anesthesia (GA). The measures are&#xD;
      made with a device that samples a certain quantity of air volume inside a common circuit that&#xD;
      ensures the ventilation of both lungs. The sample is taken on a connector that is inserted in&#xD;
      the mechanical ventilation circuit. Many companies offer such devices. The intrinsic mechanic&#xD;
      is the same although the quantity of volume sampled can vary from one model to another.&#xD;
      (50mL/min to 200mL/min)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of individualized capnography of each lung seems to present potential benefits during&#xD;
      three key moments surrounding one-lung ventilation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - During the period of time before one-lung ventilation, after the lateral positioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The gradient between the exhaled CO2 of both lungs could predict oxygenation levels&#xD;
           during one-lung ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the ventilation of both lungs, the exhaled CO2 is proportional to the blood flow&#xD;
           in the pulmonary bed. During the ventilation of both lungs in the lateral decubitus&#xD;
           position, the blood flow may vary according to the initial perfusion of both lungs. The&#xD;
           effect of gravity caused by the patient's lateral position on the isolated&#xD;
           non-ventilated lung's perfusion allows for a better oxygenation. Other factors may also&#xD;
           influence the gradient. With that said, oxygenation levels during OLV could be&#xD;
           proportional to the difference of exhaled CO2 between both lungs during the lateral&#xD;
           decubitus position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results could change or conduct during OLV by anticipation of a possible desaturation&#xD;
      in oxygen, usually unpredictable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - During the initiation of the one-lung ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
      o The capnography is installed on the operated isolated and non-ventilated lung. This could&#xD;
      help confirm the quality of the lung isolation and guide our conduct in order to correct&#xD;
      inadequate isolation. The quality of the lung isolation depends on the adequate position of&#xD;
      the bronchial extremity of the left DLT in the main bronchus. It also depends on the&#xD;
      bronchial cuff's seal. In the beginning of OLV, fluctuations in the exhaled CO2 by the&#xD;
      isolated non-ventilated lung decrease and flatten. If there is an air leak around the&#xD;
      bronchial cuff in the main bronchus, the exhaled CO2 curve will show persistent fluctuations,&#xD;
      which would indicate a leak or inadequate seal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The necessity of correction in the placement of the bronchial cuff and isolation could then&#xD;
      be guided by the observation of the exhaled CO2 curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - During one-lung ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
      o During OLV, the capnography installed on the non-ventilation lung could help identify the&#xD;
      occurrence of complete lung collapse of the isolated lung. This aspect is an important&#xD;
      variable in each of our studies on this subject and is difficultly objectifiable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The capnography could resolve this problem and help objectively identify total lung collapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis concerning the principal goal of this study is that the measure of the exhaled&#xD;
      CO2 of the isolated and non-ventilated lung during thoracic surgery will have specific&#xD;
      characteristics for each of the steps described previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis concerning our secondary goal is that capnographs that have different levels&#xD;
      of aspiration will help us observe distinct exhaled CO2 characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal: Characterize the measures of exhaled CO2 during different steps of OLV for both&#xD;
      lungs (ventilated and non-ventilated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: Evaluate the performance and reliability between two devices (high and low level&#xD;
      of air aspiration) of capnography on the measure of exhaled CO2 of both lungs during OLV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of this study, patients requiring elective thoracic surgeries requiring a OLV&#xD;
      will benefit from the addition of an additional capnography on the isolated non-ventilated&#xD;
      lung (non-dependent lung) from the anesthetic induction until the achievement of complete&#xD;
      collapse of the lung. The investigators will exclude patients in whom a bronchial blocker&#xD;
      will be used for OLV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information about age, sex, weight, height, VEMS, DLCO and surgical side was collected&#xD;
      for all the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The capnography usually used at IUCPQ-UL will be placed on the ventilated lung circuit. The&#xD;
      capnography system under study will be installed on the circuit of the non-ventilated lung.&#xD;
      The ventilation will be adjusted according to the standards of practice at IUCPQ-UL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, two capnography machines with different aspiration levels will be&#xD;
      evaluated. They will be randomized before the induction of anesthesia, to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of each of these devices during the different peri-VUP assessment periods.&#xD;
      These devices are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - GE Healthcare, CARESCAPE, Respiratory Modules Carbon dioxide (CO2) Sampling rate: 120&#xD;
           ± 20 ml / min&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Covidien, CAPNOSTREAM 35. Sampling rate: 50 + - 10 ml / min&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measures of exhaled CO2 for the ventilated and non-ventilated lung will be carried out&#xD;
      continuously and will be recorded on the various devices used, then transferred to a laptop&#xD;
      computer to be inserted into an Excel file. In addition, the ventilation parameters&#xD;
      (respiratory rate, end-tidal volume, 2-lung or single-lung ventilation, FiO2 and PEEP) will&#xD;
      also be collected manually. This data will then be retrieved and transferred to the Excel&#xD;
      file for further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stages of observation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Period following induction of anesthetic in the supine position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Period in lateral decubitus&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Immediate (ventilation of both lungs)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. After the start of the OLV until the opening of the pleura&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. From the opening of the pleura until achievement of complete collapse of the&#xD;
                isolated lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the detection of exhaled CO2 is zero in the non-ventilated lung, which could indicate&#xD;
      complete collapse, a photo of the video screen showing an overall view of the lung will be&#xD;
      taken in order to qualify the lung collapse at that precise moment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The description of the lung collapse will be done in this photo, according to our usual&#xD;
      criteria by an independent assessor after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental period should last less than two hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will require the recruitment of 30 patients divided into 2 groups of 15 subjects.&#xD;
      This number was determined based on the analysis of the results of a study published in 2009&#xD;
      by Yamamoto et al (8). The sample size was therefore calculated from the results obtained&#xD;
      concerning the exhaled CO2 between the two lungs during lateral decubitus positioning. This&#xD;
      is included in our primary assessment goal. It will take a total of 13 patients per group for&#xD;
      there to be a statistically significant difference with a p &lt;0.05 and a power of 0.95.&#xD;
      Indeed, Yamamoto et al. obtained an exhaled CO2 of 36 ± 5 in the upper lung and 29 ± 5 in the&#xD;
      lower lung. The groups for each capnography will be rounded to 15 to obtain a total of 30&#xD;
      patients. If a post-randomization exclusion should occur, the capnography randomization will&#xD;
      be transferred to the next subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected data will first be analyzed in a descriptive manner with graphics in order to&#xD;
      interpret fluctuations in exhaled CO2 in the isolated lung. Subsequently, Student's T tests&#xD;
      will be carried out in order to compare the values obtained for each measurement time. These&#xD;
      comparisons will be made between the different periods and between the different capnographs&#xD;
      from the mentioned companies. Finally, the CO2 measures at the time of the picture of the&#xD;
      isolated lung will be correlated with the quality of the lung collapse as determined by an&#xD;
      independent assessor after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope that the data collected during this research project will allow us to&#xD;
      demonstrate the potential benefits of an additional capnograph on the isolated lung during&#xD;
      OLV. Promising results from this easy-to-use technology could help predict the onset of&#xD;
      hypoxemia in some patients. In addition, the quality of lung isolation could be monitored&#xD;
      using this technology. Finally, if the exhaled CO2 is shown to be a potential marker of lung&#xD;
      collapse, this will standardize the subjective methodology currently used in the literature&#xD;
      in which the lung collapse is indicated by photos or videos of the lung. Such results will&#xD;
      allow us to put forward prospective projects already under development within our team.&#xD;
