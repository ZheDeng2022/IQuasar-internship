  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is indicated for selected patients with chronic pain who have&#xD;
      not responded to conventional medical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty (40) patients indicated for SCS placement and presenting to UAMS Interventional Pain&#xD;
      Management Clinic in Little Rock, Arkansas will be recruited for this study. Prior to&#xD;
      temporary stimulator placement, patients will complete symptom related questionnaires and&#xD;
      provide a blood sample. Demographic and clinical characteristics will be obtained through&#xD;
      medical record review. Patients will complete the same questionnaires and provide a blood&#xD;
      sample at each of the routine clinical care follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To identify genes and regulatory regions associated with the resolution of chronic&#xD;
      pain. Peripheral leukocytes from each blood sample will be used for the longitudinal&#xD;
      assessment of epigenetic and transcriptional changes associated with the resolution of pain&#xD;
      in responders versus non-responders to neuromodulation. The identification of biological&#xD;
      processes and molecular functions that are differentially regulated in patients after&#xD;
      resolution of pain compared to non-responders to SCS promises to improve the understanding of&#xD;
      mechanisms involved in the resolution of persistent pain and identify novel druggable&#xD;
      targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To compare differences in catastrophizing and patient-reported outcomes between&#xD;
      responders and non-responders following SCS. Despite long-term treatment success in patients&#xD;
      with SCS, the criteria for determining treatment success is greater than 50 percent reduction&#xD;
      in pain score following initiation of treatment. This study will attempt to identify&#xD;
      demographic, clinical characteristics, and symptom related outcomes that predict successful&#xD;
      SCS treatment and determine how epigenetic changes that occur in chronic pain patients may&#xD;
      align with risk factors identified through patient reported outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuromodulation has emerged as a minimally invasive therapy effective for the treatment of&#xD;
      refractory neuropathic pain conditions. Epidural placement of electrodes provides long term&#xD;
      analgesia through electrical stimulation of the spinal cord which alters expression of genes&#xD;
      involved in synaptic signaling in the dorsal horn. Patients who receive SCS represent a&#xD;
      unique opportunity to study the physiological mechanisms associated with the resolution of&#xD;
      chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a descriptive, prospective, longitudinal study that will consist of individuals with&#xD;
      persistent pain and meet criteria for implantation of a neurostimulation device. Forty&#xD;
      patients indicated for neurostimulation device placement and presenting to the University of&#xD;
      Arkansas for Medical Sciences Interventional Pain Management Clinic in Little Rock, Arkansas&#xD;
      will be recruited for this study. Patients who meet study inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      recruited to participate prior to stimulator placement procedure. Following an initial&#xD;
      consultation and exam by a physician, patients will have necessary imaging and&#xD;
      neuropsychological evaluation. Prior to SCS placement procedure, the patient will complete&#xD;
      preoperative labs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, patients will be asked to complete the demographic questionnaire, the WHODAS2&#xD;
      instrument, and provide a blood sample. Blood samples will be drawn using EDTA and RNApax&#xD;
      gene tubes and stored until sample processing is completed. Medical records will be reviewed&#xD;
      and abstracted for research-related data elements from EPIC EMR. Questionnaire and form&#xD;
      responses collected and recorded for study use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Demographics Questionnaire. Race, ethnicity, marital status, living situation,&#xD;
      educational level, work status, financial status, current and past medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) 2.0 short form will be&#xD;
      administered to measure the day to day functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical record review form: patient's persistent pain diagnosis, pain related medical and&#xD;
      surgical treatment, and relevant coexisting medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's medical record will be reviewed following each clinic visit during the&#xD;
      follow-up period. Participant responses will be collected using standardized instruments&#xD;
      administered by the clinic through routine clinical care. These instruments include the Pain&#xD;
      Catastrophizing Scale, the Oswestry Disability Index, and the Patient-Reported Outcomes&#xD;
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS) administered during patients routine clinical care&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study timepoints for data collection and sample collection are: Baseline (Pre-treatment),&#xD;
      routine follow-up visit &lt; 60 days after baseline, 4 weeks post implant procedure, and 3&#xD;
      months post implant procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequencing libraries will be created from blood samples obtained from the 5 patients who&#xD;
      experience the greatest pain reduction following SCS and 5 patients who report the least pain&#xD;
      reduction following SCS. These libraries will be deeply sequenced and analyzed for&#xD;
      differential gene expression chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation between the 2&#xD;
      groups. The remaining samples will be used to validate the sequencing findings using site or&#xD;
      gene specific techniques.&#xD;
