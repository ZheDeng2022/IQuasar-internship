  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional Electrical Stimulation is an established technique in which small electrical&#xD;
      impulses are used to cause a contraction in muscles and thereby enable movement, in people&#xD;
      with neurological or musculoskeletal problems who are unable to undertake those movements&#xD;
      themselves. People with spinal cord injuries of the neck at C5, C6 and C7 account for 35% of&#xD;
      all spinal cord injuries. Despite this, there is only one commercial FES (Functional&#xD;
      Electrical Stimulation) based orthosis currently available. Even that has limitations in that&#xD;
      it as it has a single size rigid exoskeleton it does not fit all people who could benefit and&#xD;
      also due to its rigidity it does not allow people with lower injuries to utilise any&#xD;
      remaining tenodesis grip. As a result, it is not widely used within the spinal injured&#xD;
      communities. Therefore what is required is a more flexible system that can benefit a larger&#xD;
      number of people whilst still being affordable within the constraints of the NHS. A previous&#xD;
      INSPIRE funded project, TETRAGRIP I demonstrated that a surface FES system controlled by an&#xD;
      inertial sensor, measuring movement of the opposite shoulder, could meet this specification&#xD;
      and was successfully tried on two people with tetraplegia. What is now required is a more&#xD;
      detailed study in which the principle components of that system are incorporated into a&#xD;
      practical device suitable for use at home without clinical supervision. It is therefore&#xD;
      proposed to develop and build such a system and to conduct extended home based trials in&#xD;
      three people with tetraplegia.&#xD;

    <description>This main aim of this whole research project is to evaluate the performance of the TetraGrip II system in improving the upper limb functions in people with C4-C7 tetraplegia i.e. people who have damaged their spinal cord in the neck resulting in loss of function in all four limbs. The Tetragrip system uses a technique called Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) in which small electrical impulses are used to activate paralysed muscles and hence provide movement. The stimulation is controlled by sensors which measure the movement of the other shoulder and enable the person to regain the use of their hand via stimulating electrodes placed on the skin over the relevant muscles.&#xD;
The feasibility of using this FES based system in restoring the upper arm functions will be evaluated by clinically trying the device on participants with C4-C7 tetraplegia.</description>
