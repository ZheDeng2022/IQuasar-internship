    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind, placebo controlled, series of N-of-1 trials of individualised&#xD;
      stimulant dose on ADHD symptomatology in children with FASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The broad aim of this study is to contribute new evidence towards understanding treatment&#xD;
      efficacy for ADHD symptoms in FASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the ongoing effectiveness of stimulant medication prescribed for ADHD symptoms&#xD;
           in individual children with FASD of clinically prescribed stimulant medication compared&#xD;
           to placebo to control ADHD symptoms (using behavioural and cognitive measures) in&#xD;
           children with FASD and ADHD using a N-of-1 trial design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To obtain pilot data to examine feasibility and tolerability of the planned N-of-1 trial&#xD;
           design in children with FASD and ADHD for future and larger studies that might seek to&#xD;
           examine if the different stimulant types are equally effective relative to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To review the multiple N-of-1 data to analyze key individual factors that mediate the&#xD;
           effect of stimulants relative to placebo on ADHD symptoms, including underlying child&#xD;
           factors (attention skills, cognitive function), sociodemographic factors and other&#xD;
           prenatal exposures.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single site, double-blind, placebo controlled, N-of-1 trial of clinically&#xD;
      prescribed, individualised stimulant dose on ADHD symptomatology in children with FASD. The&#xD;
      N-of-1 trial has a four-period crossover design, comparing attention skills on active drug&#xD;
      compared to placebo. In the present N-of-1 study, interventions will be administered for 4&#xD;
      days with a 1-day washout prior to each intervention. Intervention will include either&#xD;
      prescribed stimulant (active drug) or matched placebo capsules, compared in two 2-week&#xD;
      treatment blocks (each block consisting of 1 week active drug and 1 week placebo). Within&#xD;
      each week, usual medication will be given for 3 days between each of the 4 intervention&#xD;
      phases. Participants will be randomized to one of two treatment arms, with either active drug&#xD;
      or placebo consistently first followed by the other. Randomization will be used to select the&#xD;
      starting treatment so that equal (50%) of participants start with placebo and active drug for&#xD;
      the first of the 4-day intervention phase. That is, ABAB or BABA for a 4-period sequence with&#xD;
      a block size of 2, across 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondarily the investigators will collate outcomes across the N-of-1 trials and make use of&#xD;
      a 'series' or multiple N-of-1 trial design18, chosen as it is a valid method of trial design&#xD;
      for rare clinical disorders where individualized treatments are required. This design can&#xD;
      result in robust evidence, assuming standards of methodological practice.1 In an N-of-1&#xD;
      trial, each participant is assured of receiving both the study medication and placebo, and&#xD;
      thus learns whether the treatment works specifically for them or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Test ongoing effectiveness of stimulant medication in individual children with FASD on&#xD;
           pharmacotherapy for ADHD symptomatology, using individual N-of-1 trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective 1: To examine feasibility and tolerability of the N-of-1 trial design in&#xD;
      children with FASD and ADHD for future, larger studies that might seek to examine if the&#xD;
      different stimulant types are equally effective relative to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective 2: Through quantitative analysis of a series of N-of-1 trials,1 explore&#xD;
      individual factors that mediate the effect of stimulants relative to placebo on ADHD&#xD;
      symptoms, on children with FASD, including underlying attention skills, cognitive function&#xD;
      and other child/sociodemographic factors and additional prenatal exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives: Investigators will review if there is any change in pediatrician&#xD;
      patient management post trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children (4-18 years) with FASD and ADHD seen by the Victorian Fetal Alcohol Service&#xD;
      (VicFAS), prescribed stimulant medication for ADHD symptoms. The age limit selected was based&#xD;
      on the age in which stimulants have been shown to be effective in controlling ADHD symptoms&#xD;
      in the general population, and who are seen by the clinical service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VicFAS assesses 20 children per year at the diagnostic clinic. All participants are currently&#xD;
      approached for consent to the already established VicFAS database, which includes full child&#xD;
      demographic, clinical and neurodevelopmental information as well as optional consent for&#xD;
      future studies. Participants who have consented to this optional inclusion will be&#xD;
      re-consented to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 40 participants will be approached for recruitment to the study. This will be a&#xD;
      convenience sample of children seen through the VicFAS FASD diagnostic clinic since inception&#xD;
      in September 2019 until September 2021 (n=40). Given sample size calculations for N-of-1&#xD;
      studies, and to minimise burden on families, at least three crossovers are required.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in ADHD symptoms - teacher report - between placebo and stimulant</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4 of each trial week (4 weeks total)</time_frame>
    <description>ADHD symptoms will be measured using the Conners 3rd Edition-Teacher (Conners 3-T), for 6-18 year old's and the Conners Early Childhood teachers/childcare providers (full length) form for participants 2-6 years. Each item is rated on a Likert scale from 0 to 3 (0=never or rarely; 1=sometimes; 2=often; 3=very often). Test- retest values for the Conners scales indicate excellent temporal stability (ranging from .73 to 1.00).&#xD;
The T-score is norm referenced, with a mean of 50. The average range falls within one standard deviation of the mean (i.e., between 40 and 59). A higher score indicates more elevated symptoms. T score Guideline 70+Very Elevated Score 65-69 Elevated Score 40-59 Average score 60-64 High average score &lt; 40 Low score. Investigators will examine Inattentive and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity Symptom Scales. Symptoms indicated for each subscale are summed to get total.</description>

    <measure>Change in continuous performance task - between placebo and stimulant</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4 of each trial week (4 weeks total)</time_frame>
    <description>Continuous Performance Task-II (for ages 8 years and over) (or Conners Kiddie Continuous Performance Test 2nd Edition for younger children (4-7 years) - will be used to assess sustained attention. Participants respond to target letters or pictures presented on a computer screen, and response time, errors/error types are recorded.&#xD;
The total errors/errors type (omission/commission) will be analysed. This is standardised for age and gender. T-scores for age and gender (Mean 50, Standard Deviation 10) are provided. Lower scores indicate better performance.&#xD;
Investigators will analyse data from errors (commission - incorrect responses to non-targets - and omission - missed targets - errors). A higher error score indicates worse performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in spatial working memory - between placebo and stimulant</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4 of each trial week (4 weeks total)</time_frame>
    <description>Spatial Working Memory (SWM) task from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. SWM is a component of cognitive executive function which is measured by SWM task of CANTAB between the errors. The ability to retain spatial information and manipulate remembered items in working memory will be measured with the SWM task of CANTAB which is self-ordered and assesses the individual's ability to strategise. Between search errors will be analysed. Scores are raw scores, with no normative data available. Higher error score indicated poorer performance. Scale does not have a maximum range.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Visual Information Processing - between placebo and stimulant</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4 of each trial week (4 weeks total)</time_frame>
    <description>Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP) from Cantab. RVP measures the ability to sustain attention over time. In this task, single digits appear in a pseudo--random order at a rate of 100 digits per minute in a box at the centre of the screen. Participants are to detect a 3-digit target sequence (e.g. 2-4-6) and respond by pressing a button at the bottom of the screen when the final number of the sequence appears on the screen.&#xD;
The outcome measure of this subtest is A'. A' is the signal detection measure of sensitivity to the target regardless of response tendency. Higher scores indicate better performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Digit span - between placebo and stimulant</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4 of each trial week (4 weeks total)</time_frame>
    <description>Digit Span task (forwards and backwards) - Auditory working memory. Children are required to repeat a sequence of digits. This measure provides a raw score of the number of accurately recalled digits. This is norm referenced. A Z-Score will be calculated. A higher score indicates greater working memory span relative to peers.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in child emotion and behaviour- between placebo and stimulant</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4 of each trial week (4 weeks total)</time_frame>
    <description>Strengths &amp; Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). This will be used as a brief but robust measure of child emotional and behavioural difficulties. It is a parent rated questionnaire with 25 items, each rated on a 3-point scale (0=not true, 1=somewhat true, 2= certainly true). There are 5 sub-scales each with scores ranging from 0-10. It includes five scales: emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, peer relationship problems, and prosocial behaviours. The total difficulties score is calculated by summing 4 of the sub-scales to give a score between 0-40. Investigators will use the total difficulties score. A total difficulties score of 17 or above is considered clinically significant. The greater the total score, the greater the difficulties experienced. Age and gender based Z-scores will be calculated using published Australian normative data. A higher Z score indicates greater difficulties.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in functional Impairment- between placebo and stimulant</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4 of each trial week (4 weeks total)</time_frame>
    <description>Impairment resulting from ADHD symptoms. This scale contains the items that are most likely to represent the participant's target of treatment. The instrument uses a Likert scale such that any item rating 2 or 3 is clinically impaired. The scale is scored generating the total score. When defining impairment for DSM-IV, any domain with at least two items scored 2, one item scored 3 or a mean score &gt;1.5 is impaired.</description>

    <description>The stimulants used in the trial are commercially available and will be used in accordance with the approved labelling. Participants must be on a stable dose of stimulant medication for at last 1 month prior to the study. The dose is individualized and titrated by treating primary paediatrician. This will represent the starting dose for the trial, and this will remain stable through the course of the 4-week trial. This study is a N-of-1 RCT of currently prescribed stimulant medications for treatment of ADHD symptoms in children with FASD, relative to matched placebo capsules. Based on pilot data from this group, psychostimulant medications prescribed in this population may include:&#xD;
Methylphenidate IR&#xD;
Methylphenidate LA&#xD;
Dexamphetamine&#xD;
Children will take the required number of capsules to match the total prescribed dose (e.g. 30mg Ritalin LA is 3x10mg capsules).</description>
