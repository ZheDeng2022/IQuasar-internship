  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In areas of the Sahel sub-region of Africa with intense seasonal malaria transmission,&#xD;
      seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine (SP+AQ)&#xD;
      has become the standard-of-care for the prevention of malaria in children. Despite the&#xD;
      scale-up of SMC across West Africa, the malaria burden remains high. Reasons for this are not&#xD;
      well understood, however, it is hypothesized that children eligible for SMC who get malaria&#xD;
      may be underdosed or may have not received SP+AQ. Moreover, there are major concerns that the&#xD;
      continued use of the SMC strategy may increase selection of AQ and/or SP-resistant Plasmodium&#xD;
      falciparum parasites. The overall objective of this observational study are to understand the&#xD;
      factors driving malaria among children eligible to receive SMC and whether circulating levels&#xD;
      of sulfadoxine (SDX), pyrimethamine (PYR), and AQ are associated with risks of malaria and&#xD;
      antimalarial drug resistance.&#xD;

      of sulfadoxine (SDX), pyrimethamine (PYR), and AQ are associated with risks of malaria and&#xD;
      antimalarial drug resistance. The specific objectives of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine associations between the levels of exposure to the components of SP+AQ&#xD;
           (SDX, PYR, and AQ) and malaria risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine associations between levels of exposure to the components of SP+AQ and the&#xD;
           prevalence of P. falciparum genetic polymorphisms associated with drug resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the prevalence of genetic polymorphisms associated with SP+AQ resistance&#xD;
           between parasites infecting children eligible to receive SMC and those infecting older&#xD;
           children ineligible to receive SMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess whether the prevalence of genetic polymorphisms associated with SP+AQ&#xD;
           resistance changes over time.&#xD;
