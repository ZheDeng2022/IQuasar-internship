      Phase I clinical study on the safety, tolerance, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of repeated&#xD;
      intratympanic HY01 in patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss. In this study,&#xD;
      low-dose group and high-dose group were designed, 6 cases in each group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence rate of sudden deafness is increasing year by year, which can cause severe&#xD;
      hearing loss. Intratympanic HY01 can increase the local drug concentration in the ear, which&#xD;
      is equal to or better than that in the treatment of sudden sensorineural hearing loss, and&#xD;
      reduce the systemic drug concentration at the same time. It has obvious clinical value for&#xD;
      the treatment of hormone forbidden population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HY01 is one of glucocorticoid drugs. In this study, we designed low-dose group and high-dose&#xD;
      group of HY01, and enrolled 6 patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss for salvage&#xD;
      therapy in each group. HY01 will be administrated on D1, D4 and D7 . The trial will be ended&#xD;
      30 days after the first administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After determining the safety of low-dose, the patients in the high-dose group will be&#xD;
      enrolled. The safety observation indexes included systemic Routine Indexes and otology&#xD;
      indexes, and the efficacy and pharmacokinetics were observed at the same time.&#xD;
