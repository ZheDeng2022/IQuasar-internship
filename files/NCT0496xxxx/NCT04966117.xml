  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the number one killer of Australians with a high risk for a&#xD;
      recurrent event(s) and hospital readmission. Many of these readmissions can be prevented with&#xD;
      better management to control the problem of CAD. A disease management program, led by nurses&#xD;
      who interact with other health professionals/providers, can help with education and&#xD;
      counselling, taking medications correctly and making healthy lifestyle changes for higher&#xD;
      risk patients. Newer models of disease management programs make use of mobile devices (such&#xD;
      as an &quot;app&quot;) and telehealth (by phone or video call) to monitor and manage health which could&#xD;
      facilitate CAD management. Therefore, the aim of this study is to test this type of disease&#xD;
      management program (DMP) compared to standard care for reducing hospital readmissions or&#xD;
      death in people with CAD who are at high risk of being readmitted. The Investigators envisage&#xD;
      that a novel Risk-Guided DMP will be favorable to patients and associated with high-level&#xD;
      participation. The Investigators hypothesize that high-risk patients randomized to&#xD;
      Risk-Guided CAD will have reduced hospital readmissions or death compared with those&#xD;
      randomized to usual care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators aim to test a nurse-led, technology-enabled model of health care delivery,&#xD;
      called Risk-Guided DMP, to reduce readmissions following CAD, thereby enhancing recovery and&#xD;
      survivorship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators envisage that a novel Risk-Guided DMP will be favorable to patients and&#xD;
      associated with high-level participation. The Investigators hypothesize reduced hospital&#xD;
      readmissions or death for high-risk patients randomized to Risk-Guided DMP compared to usual&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed study is an effectiveness and feasibility trial of a risk guided DMP to reduce&#xD;
      hospital readmissions in CAD patients. The Investigators seek to do this by adopting&#xD;
      innovative approaches to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) a community-based secondary prevention DMP, ii) supported by a novel m-Health app (SmartCR&#xD;
      developed by CardiHab) to address components of a Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) program, and&#xD;
      iii) selection of higher risk patients for appropriate management by validated (PEGASUS-TIMI&#xD;
      54) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HeartWest patients aged 30-74 years who are diagnosed with CAD will be recruited. Discharge&#xD;
      summaries and appointment bookings will be screened to invite patients to participate upon&#xD;
      knowledge of a planned or unplanned CAD hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline measures will include clinical features (including severity and number of affected&#xD;
      vessels) and biochemistry (troponin, B-type natriuretic protein, renal function) from medical&#xD;
      records; patient self-reported socio-demographic features, cognitive function using the&#xD;
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment as an important predictor of readmission, mental health via the&#xD;
      Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire&#xD;
      and quality of life using the Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL-8D) questionnaire. Exercise&#xD;
      capacity will be quantified by peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak) and cardiac function will be&#xD;
      assessed via two-dimensional echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk evaluation will be performed by PEGASUS-TIMI 54 criteria for selection of high risk&#xD;
      patients [score â‰¥6] who have ~3-4 times higher risk of a secondary event than the remainder.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be assigned a cardiac nurse to help manage their heart condition who will:&#xD;
develop a care plan and communicate with the patients' General Practitioner (GP) and cardiologist about management, particularly medications to help control risk factors.&#xD;
provide health coaching at pre-specified times over 12 months via telehealth (phone or video call) to ensure that patient's take their medications as prescribed and to give health education and guidance on lifestyle changes.&#xD;
facilitate cardiac rehabilitation via a smart phone or tablet app (called SmartCR). This app monitors health and physical activity, has prompted tasks to do and delivers education via video, audio and written articles. The information from this app can be used by the cardiac nurse during telehealth follow-up.&#xD;
invite participation to a supervised 6-week group exercise program which will require using our on-site gym.</description>
