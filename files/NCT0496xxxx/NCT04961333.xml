  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Internet-based multidisciplinary interventions will be offered to participants suffering from&#xD;
      longterm COVID-19 syndrome. Data will be collected by internet platform at Karolinska&#xD;
      Institutet (BASS) before, after rehabilitation and at follow-up after 6 months. Both&#xD;
      self-scored questionnaires and physical tests performed at home will be collected to&#xD;
      understand the symptomatology, functioning and activity level. Rehabilitation during 8 weeks&#xD;
      period will be given in groups as face-to-group, pre-recorded film sessions and by individual&#xD;
      approach, the participants will use ExorLive app for physical activity.&#xD;

      This randomised study aimed to understand if multidisciplinary internet-based interventions&#xD;
      performed in group and individually are applicable for participants suffering from longterm&#xD;
      COVID-19 syndrome. Data will be collected by internet platform at Karolinska Institutet&#xD;
      (BASS) before, after rehabilitation and at follow-up after 6 months. Both self-scored&#xD;
      questionnaires and physical tests performed at home will be collected to understand the&#xD;
      symptomatology, functioning and activity level. Rehabilitation during 8 weeks period will be&#xD;
      given in groups as face-to-group, pre-recorded film sessions and by individual approach, the&#xD;
      participants will use ExorLive app for physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be randomised for treatment and waiting lists using a website&#xD;
      random.org. Waiting list will be offered rehabilitation interventions after at least 8 weeks&#xD;
      period of waiting to exclude a spontaneous improvement or worsening of symptoms. To&#xD;
      understand the impact of rehabilitation on work capacity and employment/economic supply, the&#xD;
      data from Social Insurance databas will be obtained 2021 year before and upp to 2 years after&#xD;
      the intervention. To understand the impact of rehabilitation on sickness-leave, the data from&#xD;
      National Insurance Agency will be obtained for 2021 and 2022.&#xD;
