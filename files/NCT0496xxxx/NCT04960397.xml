      This is a Phase 1b, randomized, double-blind, dose-escalating, age de-escalating,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study of a targeted 220 children, ages 6 months to 17 years, inclusive.&#xD;
      This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of of one and two&#xD;
      doses of Sing2016 M2SR H3N2 influenza vaccine (manufactured by FluGen) administered&#xD;
      intranasally in seven cohorts of children. The first two groups to be vaccinated will be&#xD;
      Cohorts 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 consists of 45 children 9-17 years old. Thirty of them will receive one dose of the&#xD;
      vaccine at a dose of 10^9 TCID50, and 15 will receive one dose of placebo. Cohort 2 comprises&#xD;
      45 children 2-8 years old. Thirty of them will receive one dose of the vaccine at a dose of&#xD;
      10^8 TCID50 and 15 will receive one dose of placebo. Sites will enroll participants into&#xD;
      Cohorts 1 and 2 simultaneously. Once 25 or more participants in each of the first 2 cohorts&#xD;
      (Cohorts 1 and 2) have completed Day 8, the Safety Review Committee (SRC) will evaluate if&#xD;
      any halting rules are met and if it is deemed safe to proceed to enrollment of the next&#xD;
      cohort. Cohort 3 consists of 25 children 2-8 years old. Fifteen of them will receive one dose&#xD;
      of vaccine at 10^9 TCID50 and 10 will receive one dose of placebo. Once all 25 participants&#xD;
      in Cohort 3 have completed Day 8 of follow-up, similar to Cohorts 1 and 2, the SRC will&#xD;
      review to ensure no halting rules are met and if no rules are met, progression to Cohort 4&#xD;
      can begin. Cohort 4 consists of 45 children 2-8 years old, thirty of them will receive two&#xD;
      doses of vaccine at 10^9 TCID50 and 15 will receive two doses of placebo, with a 28-day&#xD;
      interval between the first and second doses. Once 25 or more participants in Cohort 4 have&#xD;
      completed Day 36 of follow-up, once again the SRC will review to ensure no halting rules are&#xD;
      met. If progression is allowed, Cohort 5 will begin. Enrollment within the cohort will not&#xD;
      halt during the SRC review of the lead-in group of eight children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Cohorts 5, 6, and 7, each will enroll 6- to 23-month-olds who are influenza-naïve (defined&#xD;
      as children without receipt of influenza vaccine and without previous documented influenza&#xD;
      infection). Cohort 5 consists of 8 children who will be randomized to receive two doses of&#xD;
      10^7 TCID50 Sing2016 M2SR (n=6) or two doses of placebo (n=2). A safety assessment will be&#xD;
      conducted once all 8 have completed Day 8 to determine progression to Cohort 6. Cohort 6 will&#xD;
      consist of 26 children. A lead-in group of 8 children will be randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      either two doses of 10^8 TCID50 of the Sing2016 M2SR (n=6) or two doses of placebo (n=2).&#xD;
      Once the first 8 children have completed Day 8, the SRC will review the safety and determine&#xD;
      if Cohort 7 may begin enrollment. The additional 18 children in Cohort 6 may continue to&#xD;
      enroll during the SRC review. Overall, they will be assigned randomly to two doses of 10^8&#xD;
      TCID50 of the Sing2016 M2SR (n=12) or two doses of placebo (n=6). Cohort 7 will be the final&#xD;
      cohort. Twenty-six children will be randomly allocated to receive two doses of either 10^9&#xD;
      TCID50 Sing2016 M2SR (n=18) or placebo (n=8). This cohort does not have a &quot;lead-in&quot; group&#xD;
      since data from such a group are not needed to allow the enrollment in a subsequent cohort.&#xD;
      However, the study-wide and individual halting rules still apply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all cohorts, a minimally acceptable pre-vaccination blood volume is set at one 5-mL tube&#xD;
      of blood (Serum Separator Tube (SST) for serum), regardless of age. Should the site not be&#xD;
      able to collect that blood before the first vaccination, the child will not be permitted to&#xD;
      continue. After the administration of the above noted vaccine doses, safety will be assessed&#xD;
      by the evaluation of reactogenicity from Days 1-8 for participants in Cohorts 1-3, who are&#xD;
      receiving a single dose of vaccine or placebo, and from Days 1-8 and approximately Days 29-36&#xD;
      for participants in Cohorts 4, 5, 6, and 7, who are receiving 2 doses of vaccine or placebo.&#xD;
      Study duration will be approximately 22 months with subject participation duration&#xD;
      approximately three months. The primary study objective is to assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of one and two administrations of the Sing2016 M2SR H3N2 influenza vaccine at&#xD;
      10^7, 10^8, or 10^9 TCID50 delivered intranasally to healthy participants, 6 months to 17&#xD;
      years of age.&#xD;
